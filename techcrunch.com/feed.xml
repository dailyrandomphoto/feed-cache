										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instant messaging app <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/telegram" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="telegram">Telegram <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is &#8220;approaching&#8221; 500 million users and plans to generate revenue starting next year to keep the business afloat, its founder Pavel Durov said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Durov said he has personally bankrolled the seven-year-old business so far, but as the startup scales he is looking for ways to monetize the instant messaging service. &#8220;A project of our size needs at least a few hundred million dollars per year to keep going,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The service, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/telegram-hits-400-million-monthly-active-users/">topped 400 million active users in April this year</a>, will introduce its own ad platform for public one-to-many channels &#8212; “one that is user-friendly, respects privacy and allows us to cover the costs of server and traffic,” he wrote on his Telegram channel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;If we monetize large public one-to-many channels via the Ad Platform, the owners of these channels will receive free traffic in proportion to their size,&#8221; he wrote. Another way Telegram could monetize its service is through premium stickers with &#8220;additional expressive features,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;The artists who make stickers of this new type will also get a part of the profit. We want millions of Telegram-based creators and small businesses to thrive, enriching the experience of all our users.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some analysts were hoping that Telegram would be able to monetize the platform through its blockchain token project. But after several delays and regulatory troubles, Telegram said in May that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/telegram-abandons-its-ton-blockchain-platform/">decided to abandon the project</a>.</p>
<p>For this project, Dubai-based Telegram had raised $1.7 billion from investors in 2018. It had planned to distribute its token, called grams, after developing the blockchain software. Telegram offered to return $1.2 billion to investors earlier this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Telegram has a social networking dimension. Our massive public one-to-many channels can have millions of subscribers each and are more like Twitter feeds. In many markets the owners of such channels display ads to earn money, sometimes using third-party ad platforms. The ads they post look like regular messages, and are often intrusive. We will fix this by introducing our own Ad Platform for public one-to-many channels,&#8221; Durov wrote today.</p>
<p>All existing features will remain free, said Durov, who is one of the biggest critics of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-owned <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/whatsapp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="whatsapp">WhatsApp, adding <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> that Telegram is committed to not introduce ads in private one-to-one chats or group chats because they are a “bad idea.”</p>
<p>“We are not going to sell the company like the founders of WhatsApp. The world needs Telegram to stay independent as a place where users are respected and high-quality service is ensured,” he wrote. “Telegram will begin to generate revenue, starting next year. We will do it in accordance with our values and the pledges we have made over the last 7 years. Thanks to our current scale, we will be able to do it in a non-intrusive way. Most users will hardly notice any change.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Telegram also introduced a new group voice chats feature to the app. The new voice chats feature, which is similar to Discord&#8217;s always-on room, supports a few thousand participants.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You’ve heard of challenger banks? Now meet the challenger energy suppliers. The UK’s Octopus Energy has attained a $2.06 billion valuation (£1.5 billion) after attracting a $200 million (£150 million) investment from Tokyo Gas for a 9.7% stake, in order to launch a joint venture. Octopus will own 30% of the venture, with Tokyo Gas owning the majority. After five years of operation, Octopus is now close to the valuation of British Gas owner Centrica.</p>
<p>Octopus will now launch as a brand in Japan with its trademark 100% renewable electricity operation which uses an innovative AI and data-based platform to balance loads around the grid. Its Kraken software is also licensed to Origin Energy, nPower and E.On, Good Energy and Hanwha Corporation, among others, reaching 17 million energy accounts worldwide.</p>
<p>“This joint venture will bring our exciting approach to renewable energy and technology to the world’s largest competitive energy market, and the investment will turbocharge our mission to revolutionize energy globally,” said chief executive Greg Jackson in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Australia’s Origin Energy is also set to take a stake in Octopus for 50 million dollars (£37 million) following a larger investment in April when Origin bought a 20% stake.</p>
<p>Octopus says it is aiming for 100 million customers around the world by 2027, and recently launched in the US, Australia, Germany and New Zealand.</p>
<p>In the UK, Octopus has a 5% share of the energy supply market and counts 1.8 million households in its retail portfolio, according to the company.</p>
<p>Tokyo Gas president Takashi Uchida said: “Through this partnership, we will contribute to the achievement of a better lifestyle for customers by realizing value creation and delivery tailored to every one of them.”</p>
<p>Japanese renewables lag the UK by 50% (renewables in Japan in 2019 accounted for 18.9% of electricity vs 37.9% in the UK) so the potential for growth is significant. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has set a target of reaching net-zero by 2050.</p>
<p>In the UK Octopus has also launched Electric Juice, an electric vehicle roaming network, and partnered with Tesla to launch Tesla Power.</p>

The round was led by Sequoia Capital China, with participation from Hillhouse Capital and Shunwei Capital. All three are returning investors.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/easyvan/company_financials">Crunchbase data</a>, this brings Lalamove’s total raised so far to about $976.5 million. The company’s last funding announcement was in February 2019, when it hit unicorn status with a Series D of $300 million.</p>

<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-16/hong-kong-s-lalamove-said-to-seek-funds-at-8-billion-valuation">reported last week</a> that Lalamove was seeking at least $500 million in new funding at $8 billion valuation, or four times what it raised at least year.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013 for on-demand deliveries within the same city, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/easyvan" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="easyvan">Lalamove <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has since grown its business to include freight services, enterprise logistics, moving and vehicle rental. In addition to 352 cities in mainland China, Lalamove also operates in Hong Kong (where it launched), Taiwan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/lalamove-enters-the-us/">entered the United States</a> for the first time in October, and currently claims about 480,000 monthly active drivers and 7.2 million monthly active users.</p>
<p>Part of its Series D had been earmarked to expand into India, but Lalamove was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/india-bans-another-43-chinese-apps/">among 43 apps </a>that were banned by the government, citing cybersecurity concerns.</p>
<p>In its announcement, Lalamove CEO Shing Chow said its Series E will be used to enter more fourth- and fifth-tier Chinese cities, adding &#8220;we believe the mobile internet’s transformation of China’s logistics industry is far from over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other companies that have recently raised significant funding rounds for their logistics operations in China include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/manbang-1-7-billion-funding/">Manbang</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/alibaba-6-6-billion-investment-yto/">YTO</a>.</p>
<p>Lalamove’s (known in Chinese as Huolala) Series E announcement said the company experienced a 93% drop in shipment volume at the beginning of the year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but has experienced a strong rebound, with order volume up 82% year-over-year even before Double 11.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WeRide, one of China’s most-funded startups developing autonomous driving capabilities, said on Wednesday that it has raised a $200 million strategic round from Chinese<a href="https://en.yutong.com/"> bus maker Yutong</a>.</p>
<p>Mega investments aren’t uncommon at companies like WeRide developing the next-generation level 4 driving standard, which denotes that the car can handle the majority of driving situations independently without human intervention.</p>
<p>WeRide did not disclose its valuation for this round, which is the first tranche of its Series B round, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funding will see WeRide joining hands with Yutong, a 57-year-old company, to make autonomous driving minibusses and city buses as well as work on R&amp;D, vehicle platforms and mobility services together. The partners have already jointly developed a front-loaded driverless minibus for mass-production. The model, which comes without a steering wheel, accelerator or brakes, is designed for operating in urban open roads, said WeRide</p>
<p>Alliance Ventures, the strategic venture capital arm of Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, became WeRide&#8217;s strategic investor<a href="https://www.weride.ai/series-a/"> in 2018</a> following the completion of the startup&#8217;s Series A round, which was partially funded by the Chinese facial recognition giant SenseTime.</p>
<p>Autonomous driving startups in China are racing to showcase their progress, in part to attract funding for their cash-bleeding businesses. Alibaba-backed AutoX, for instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/autox-removes-safety-drivers/">began deploying driverless cars</a> on the roads in Shenzhen in a bold move. WeRide and its rivals are testing various levels of autonomous driving vehicles in both the United States and major Chinese cities where local policies are supporting the futurist transportation tech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Capital&#8217;s attitude is shifting and increasingly bullish about autonomous driving and its commercial future following the COVID-19 pandemic [in China]. Many investments are happening in this space because investors don&#8217;t want to miss out on any potential leaders in autonomous driving,&#8221; the WeRide spokesperson said. &#8220;Our Series B round has attracted a lot of interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>WeRide’s competitors include Pony.ai in its backyard Guangzhou, AutoX and Deeproute.ai in Shenzhen, Momenta in Suzhou, Baidu in Beijing, to name a few.</p>

<p>The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ikea-systems" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ikea-systems">IKEA <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-owned online marketplace for on-demand labor said it reset user passwords out of an abundance of caution and that it &#8220;took steps to prevent access to any user accounts,&#8221; a TaskRabbit spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company later confirmed it was a credential stuffing attack, where existing sets of exposed or breached usernames and passwords are matched against different websites to access accounts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We acted in an abundance of caution and reset passwords for many TaskRabbit accounts, including all users who had not logged in since May 1, 2020, as well as all users who logged in during the time period of the attack, even though most of the latter activity was attributable to users’ regular use of our services,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As always, the safety and security of the TaskRabbit community is our priority, and we will continue to be vigilant about protecting our users’ personal information,&#8221; said the spokesperson.</p>
<p>TaskRabbit customers were alerted to the incident in a vague email that only noted their password had been recently changed &#8220;as a security precaution,&#8221; without saying what specifically prompted the account change. TechCrunch confirmed that the email was legitimate.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon for companies to reset passwords after a security incident where customer or account information is accessed or stolen in a breach.</p>
<p>Last year, online apparel marketplace StockX reset customer passwords after initially citing &#8220;system updates,&#8221; but later admitted it took action after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/stockx-security-concerns-reset-passwords/">found suspicious activity</a> on its network. Days later, a hacker provided TechCrunch with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/03/stockx-hacked-millions-records/">6.8 million StockX account records</a> stolen from the company&#8217;s servers.</p>

<p>TaskRabbit&#8217;s freelance labor marketplace was founded in 2008, and grew over time from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/10/taskrabbit-debuts-revamped-platform-launches-new-website-and-mobile-apps/">an auction-style platform</a> for negotiating tasks and errands to a more mature and tailored marketplace to match customers with contractors. That eventually attracted the attention of furniture retailer IKEA, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/28/ikea-buys-taskrabbit/">bought the startup in September 2017</a> after TaskRabbit put itself on the market for a strategic buyer.</p>
<p>The year after the acquisition, however, TaskRabbit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/16/taskrabbits-app-is-offline-while-it-investigates-a-cybersecurity-incident/">had to take its website and app down</a> due to a &#8220;cybersecurity incident.&#8221; The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/18/taskrabbit-ceo-posts-statement-as-its-app-returns-following-a-cybersecurity-breach/">later revealed</a> an attacker had gained unauthorized access to its systems. Then-TaskRabbit CEO Stacy Brown-Philpot said the company had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/18/taskrabbit-ceo-posts-statement-as-its-app-returns-following-a-cybersecurity-breach/">contracted with an outside forensics team</a> to identify what customer information had been compromised by the attack, and urged both users and providers to stay vigilant in monitoring their own accounts for suspicious activity.</p>
<p>Following the attack, the company said it was implementing several new security measures and would work on making the log-in process more secure. It also said it would reduce the amount of data retained about taskers and customers as well as &#8220;enhance overall network cyber threat detection technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brown-Philpot <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/stacy-brown-philpot-is-stepping-down-as-ceo-of-taskrabbit/">left TaskRabbit earlier this year</a>, and the CEO role has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ania-smith-named-chief-executive-officer-at-taskrabbit-301110433.html">since been filled by</a> former Airbnb and Uber Eats leader, Ania Smith.</p>

This is your Daily Crunch for December 22, 2020.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Stimulus bill increases penalties for illegal streaming services</strong></p>
<p>While we wrote several stories yesterday about the tech implications of the new stimulus bill (and highlighted it in yesterday&#8217;s Daily Crunch), more details are emerging — like the fact that it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/stimulus-bill-streaming/">make illegal streaming for profit a felony</a>, punishable by fines or up to 10 years of imprisonment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The language of the bill seems to focus on commercial piracy services, rather than individuals or Twitch streamers — a point that one of its sponsors, Senator Thom Tillis, emphasized in a statement, claiming that &#8220;no individual streamer has to worry about the fear of prosecution.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the copyright front, the bill also creates a new Copyright Claims Board to handle copyright infringement claims of up to $30,000.</p>
<p><strong>The tech giants</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Content moderation has been a thorny topic in 2020. And when I say “thorny,” I mean in the sense of having multiple congressional hearings on the subject. Twitter and Facebook in particular have been mired in concerns around the subject, fielding complaints that they both haven’t done enough to weed out problematic content and suggestions that they’re a censorship-happy, shadow-banning enemy of the First Amendment.</p>
<p>The latter appears to be the sole reason for the existence of the right wing-focused Twitter competitor, Parler.</p>
<p>As <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/substack" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="substack">Substack <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> grows in popularity, the newsletter platform is going to face some tremendously difficult questions around content moderation. Today<a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/substacks-view-of-content-moderation"> it published a lengthy blog post</a> hoping to nip some of those concerns in the bud. The write-up offers some caveats, but largely espouses the platform’s commitment to free speech, noting:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>In most cases, we don’t think that censoring content is helpful, and in fact it often backfires. Heavy-handed censorship can draw more attention to content than it otherwise would have enjoyed, and at the same time it can give the content creators a martyr complex that they can trade off for future gain. We prefer a contest of ideas. We believe dissent and debate is important. We celebrate nonconformity.</p></blockquote>
<p>The stance reflects Substack’s commitment to a subscription-based model, rather than the ads that currently keep the lights on for services like Twitter and Facebook. Instead, it takes a 10% cut of writers’ subscription revenue. Certainly that frees it up from sponsorship boycotts to some degree. The subscription model also means that users have to opt into specific content more so than on platforms like Twitter and Facebook, where content boundaries are far more fluid.</p>
<p>“We are happy to compete with ‘Substack but with more controls on speech’ just as we are happy to compete with ‘Substack but with advertising,’ ” the company writes.</p>
<p>Of course, there are financial considerations &#8212; there always are. Substack has a vested interest in supporting right-wing and conservative voices who have decried Facebook and Twitter’s practices. Notably, The Dispatch is at the top of the service’s politics leaderboard. In an interview with TechCrunch earlier this year, editor Stephen Hayes called the service, “unapologetically center-right,” while its current blurb refers to it as “conservative.”</p>
<p>“None of these views are neutral,” Substack writes. “Many Silicon Valley technology companies strive to make their platforms apolitical, but we think such a goal is impossible to achieve.” There’s no doubt some truth in that. Any position on content moderation can be viewed as a political one to some degree. And equally, none will make everyone &#8212; or even most people &#8212; completely happy.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s also easy to see the service facing some major tests of its current hands-off approach as the service continues to grow in popularity. The service’s approach has involved putting its name out there in front of consumers, meaning it won’t be viewed as a kind of invisible publishing platform.</p>
<p>Substack is quick to add that there is, naturally, content that crosses the line in spite of this. “Of course, there are limits,” it writes. “We do not allow porn on Substack, for example, or spam. We do not allow doxxing or harassment.”</p>

<p>Reacting to Reuters&#8217; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-autos-exclusive/exclusive-apple-targets-car-production-by-2024-and-eyes-next-level-battery-technology-sources-idUSKBN28V2PY">recent news</a> that Apple has not abandoned its electric car program and is still pursuing plans to build a physical vehicle, Musk tweeted that in &#8220;the darkest days&#8221; of scaling Model 3 production, he reached out to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO Tim Cook and raised the possibility of the Cupertino company acquiring Tesla. Musk says that Cook refused to take the meeting.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Apple for comment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">During the darkest days of the Model 3 program, I reached out to Tim Cook to discuss the possibility of Apple acquiring Tesla (for 1/10 of our current value). He refused to take the meeting.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Musk&#8217;s short tweet did not clarify exactly when this timeline was, though given public information about Tesla&#8217;s Model 3 production, it was likely between 2017 and 2019. In regards to Musk&#8217;s proposed sales price, 1/10th of Tesla&#8217;s current market capitalization is about $60 billion, which isn&#8217;t too far from the stock&#8217;s public value last year before it reached stratospheric heights in recent months.</p>
<p>Though Tesla is now worth more than $600 billion on the public markets after joining the S&amp;P 500 this week, most Wall Street analysts seem perplexed by the stock&#8217;s recent growth, which has been owed to young and first-time investors rallying behind Tesla&#8217;s products and its CEO.</p>

<p>Conti (who founded the company with Lionel Vital and Joseph Gilley) is a former Uber software engineer and researcher himself.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea, as he explained via email, is that one customer might be more excited about a $5 discount, while another might be more effectively enticed by free shipping, and a third might be completely uninterested because they just made a large purchase. Using a merchant&#8217;s order history and website activity data, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gradient-decision-making" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gradient-decision-making">Bandit ML <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is supposed to help them determine which offer will be most effective with which shopper.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2090301" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090301" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2090301" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/analytics-pink-bg.jpg?w=680" alt="Bandit ML screenshot" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/analytics-pink-bg.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/analytics-pink-bg.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/analytics-pink-bg.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/analytics-pink-bg.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/analytics-pink-bg.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/analytics-pink-bg.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2090301" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bandit ML</p></div></p>
<p>Conti acknowledged that there&#8217;s other discount-optimizing software out there, but he suggested none of them offers what Bandit ML does: &#8220;off the shelf tools that use machine learning the way giants like Uber, Amazon and Walmart do.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that Bandit ML&#8217;s technology is unique in its support for full automation (&#8220;some stores sent their first batch of offers within 10 minutes of signing up&#8221;) and its ability to optimize for longer-term metrics, like purchases over a 120-day period, rather than focusing on one-off redemptions. In fact, Conti said the technology the startup uses to make these decisions is similar to <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/open-sourcing-reagent-a-platform-for-reasoning-systems/">the ReAgent project</a> that he worked on at Facebook.</p>
<p>Bandit ML is currently focused on merchants with Shopify stores, though it also supports other stores not on Shopify, like Calii. Conti said the platform has been used to send millions of dollars&#8217; worth of promotions since July, with one clothing company seeing a 20% increase in net revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Starting with an always-on incentive engine for every online business, we aim to build functioning out-of-the-box machine learning tools that a small online business needs to compete with the Walmarts and Amazons of the world,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nasa" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nasa">NASA <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has finished work on a new launchpad at its Kennedy Space Center in Florida &#8212; Launch Complex 48 (LC-48), a pad that will be able to support smaller launch vehicles than either LC-39A or B, or SLC-41, which currently host SpaceX, SLS and ULA launches, respectively. It&#8217;s designed to be able to be used by multiple providers, with an absence of permanent structures that allows for flexible configuration depending on who&#8217;s using it.</p>
<p>The purpose of LC-48 is very explicitly to fill &#8220;a need for new, low-cost launch systems with very fast turnaround cycles,&#8221; according to KSC senior project manager Keith Britton speaking to <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2020/12/kennedy-expands-complex-48-opens/">NASASpaceflight.com</a>. That sounds an awful lot like some of the forthcoming launch models being developed and tested by companies including Astra, a small launcher that designed its business around the now-ended DARPA competition for a responsive launch demonstration.</p>
<p>While companies like Virgin Orbit are aiming to create responsive, mobile launch capabilities by obviating the need for a specialized pad altogether, they are in the minority when it comes to small launch startups in terms of skipping the need for vertical take-off altogether. Many more companies, including Astra, as well as Firefly, Orbex and the newly revived Vector Launch, are focusing on small rockets that can be launched with scaled-down requirements in terms of both people and infrastructure required on site to add flexibility and mobility into their models.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>LC-48 doesn&#8217;t yet have any actual customers booked &#8212; NASA says it&#8217;s in discussions with a number of companies, but none are yet officially signed customers. The agency does, however, anticipate some launches potentially taking place from the new pad as early as next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>, Amazon’s flourishing cloud arm, has been growing at a rapid clip for more than a decade. An early public cloud infrastructure vendor, it has taken advantage of first-to-market status to become the most successful player in the space. In fact, one could argue that many of today&#8217;s startups wouldn&#8217;t have gotten off the ground without the formation of cloud companies like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aws" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="aws">AWS <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> giving them easy access to infrastructure without having to build it themselves.</p>
<p>In <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> most-recent earnings report, AWS generated revenues of $11.6 billion, good for a run rate of more than $46 billion. That makes the next AWS milestone a run rate of $50 billion, something that could be in reach in less than two quarters if it continues its pace of revenue growth.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The good news for competing companies is that in spite of the market size and relative maturity, there is still plenty of room to grow.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>While the cloud division&#8217;s growth is slowing in percentage terms as it comes firmly up against the law of large numbers in which AWS has to grow every quarter compared to an ever-larger revenue base. The result of this dynamic is that while AWS’ year-over-year growth rate is slowing over time &#8212; from 35% in Q3 2019 to 29% in Q3 2020 &#8212; the pace at which it is adding $10 billion chunks of annual revenue run rate is accelerating.</p>
<p>At the AWS re:Invent customer conference this year, AWS CEO Andy Jassy talked about the pace of change over the years, saying that it took the following number of months to grow its run rate by $10 billion increments:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2089363" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089363" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2089363" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/aws-run-rate-ec-chart.png?w=680" alt="123 months ($0-$10 billion) 23 months ($10 billion-$20 billion) 13 months ($20 billion-$30 billion) 12 months ($30 billion to $40 billion)" width="680" height="398" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/aws-run-rate-ec-chart.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/aws-run-rate-ec-chart.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/aws-run-rate-ec-chart.png?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/aws-run-rate-ec-chart.png?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/aws-run-rate-ec-chart.png?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/aws-run-rate-ec-chart.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089363" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch (data from AWS)</p></div></p>
<p>Extrapolating from the above trend, it should take AWS fewer than 12 months to scale from a run rate of $40 billion to $50 billion. Stating the obvious, Jassy said “the rate of growth in AWS continues to accelerate.&#8221; He also took the time to point out that AWS is now the fifth-largest enterprise IT company in the world, ahead of enterprise stalwarts like SAP and Oracle.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s amazing is that AWS achieved its scale so fast, not even existing until 2006. That growth rate makes us ask a question: Can anyone hope to stop AWS’ momentum?</p>
<p>The short answer is that it doesn&#8217;t appear likely.</p>
<h2>Cloud market landscape</h2>
<p>A good place to start is surveying the cloud infrastructure competitive landscape to see if there are any cloud companies that could catch the market leader. According <a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/cloud-market-growth-rate-nudges-amazon-and-microsoft-solidify-leadership">to Synergy Research</a>, AWS remains firmly in front, and it doesn&#8217;t look like any competitor could catch AWS anytime soon unless some market dynamic caused a drastic change.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2089391" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089391" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2089391" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CIS-Q320.jpg?w=680" alt="Synergy Research Cloud marketshare leaders. Amazon is first, Microsoft is second and Google is third." width="680" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CIS-Q320.jpg 1178w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CIS-Q320.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CIS-Q320.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CIS-Q320.jpg?resize=768,510 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CIS-Q320.jpg?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CIS-Q320.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089391" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Synergy Research</p></div></p>
<p>With around a third of the market, AWS is the clear front-runner. Its closest and fiercest rival Microsoft has around 20%. To put that into perspective a bit, last quarter AWS had $11.6 billion in revenue compared to Microsoft&#8217;s $5.2 billion Azure result. While Microsoft&#8217;s equivalent cloud number is growing faster at 47%, like AWS, that number has begun to drop steadily while it gains market share and higher revenue and it falls victim to that same law of large numbers.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[If 2020 showed us how hard “Zoom school” really is, then 2021 should not be about creating more versions of Zoom schools.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The edtech market raked in more than $10 billion in venture capital investment globally in 2020, but for students, parents and teachers, the year was defined more by its scramble than its surge.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nandini-talwar/">Nandini Talwar</a>, a student and teacher’s assistant at Columbia University, wants to hold more efficient office hours so students don&#8217;t have to wait on a Zoom call. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tralizaking3189205/">TraLiza King</a>, a director at PWC and single mother, needs a Zoom alternative for her 4-year-old, who is too young to understand how to mute and unmute. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edukings/">Brian Kinglsey</a>, chief academic officer at Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools in North Carolina, is looking for ways to reengage remote students that don&#8217;t require socially distant home visits.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			As we enter the rest of the decade, the sector will have to shake off its short-term-fix mentality to evolve from tunnel vision to wide-pan ambition.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Naturally, any company that shifts overnight from being a tool to a necessity will have growing pains, and edtech as a sector is no exception. Startups with the long-term ambitions of solving education&#8217;s inequities had to come up with quick fixes that would serve millions of learners. A sector that was notoriously undercapitalized had to reach venture scale while adapting to the realities of a remote work landscape like never before. As schools seesawed between hybrid and remote, education technology companies had to be nimble as well. The ubiquity of remote learning surely brought a boom to new users, but may have in fact limited the sector&#8217;s ability to innovate in lieu of fast, easy scale.</p>
<p>For edtech in 2020, flexible and scrappy was a survival tactic that led to profits, growth and most of all, aha moments that technology was needed in the way we learn. Now, as we enter the rest of the decade, the sector will have to shake off its short-term-fix mentality to evolve from tunnel vision to wide-pan ambition.</p>
<h2><strong>The innovation that must grow</strong></h2>
<p>If nothing else is clear after a tumultuous remote learning experience, it’s that the world needs effective and accessible technology that allows education to scale with learning for all in mind. In fact, the comeback story and surges of massive open online course providers (MOOCS) shows how in-demand digital curricula truly are.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/edtech-investors-are-panning-for-gold/?tpcc=ECTW2020">usage is not a replacement for effectiveness</a>. In reality, most people don’t have the drive, motivation or comprehension capabilities to learn from a one-hour lecture &#8212; even if they technically show up.</p>
<p>The mad rush to track engagement is underway. In the past few months, <span style="font-weight: 400;">Zovio launched Signalz, a tool that helps universities track student engagement and see who is most at risk for dropping out of courses. Piazza also launched a tool focused on college and high school student participation that allows instructors to send personalized messages and measure activity on their assignments. There&#8217;s also Rhithm, an app that allows educators to check in daily with students for emotional-learning insights, and Edsights, a chatbot for undergraduate students. </span></p>
<p>Still, instead of bringing the classroom experience online and trying to track the heck out of it, what if you completely upend it? The answer might begin with flashcards.</p>
<p>Quizlet, which started off as a flashcard app, has spent the past three years building out its artificial-intelligence-powered tutoring arm. CEO Matthew Glotzbach says the feature is now the most-used Quizlet offering, signaling how students want a more in-depth solution than flashcards.</p>
<p>The most recent example I saw of innovation was <a href="https://sketchy.com/">Sketchy</a>, a startup that teaches medical <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/sketchy-medical-series-a-tcg-reach-capital/">concepts through illustrations</a>. It allows students to skip notecards and textbooks and comprehend through animated videos; think of a countryside kingdom scene about coronavirus or a salmon dinner about salmonella.</p>
<p>While the technology itself isn’t from Mars, Sketchy’s strategy does what many edtech solutions don’t: learning theory. The company uses the memory-palace technique to help students replace textbooks with videos and actually retain information. Plus, after seven years as a bootstrapped company, Sketchy just raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/sketchy-medical-series-a-tcg-reach-capital/">$30 million dollars in venture capital</a>. The round was led by TCG with involvement from <a href="https://www.reachcapital.com/">Reach Capital</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharysims/">Zach Sims</a>, the founder of<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/"> Codecademy</a>, told me that the startups that will “win” the next wave are the ones that are “using interactivity and technology to create an educational experience you just couldn&#8217;t have in the classroom.”</p>
<p>To retain recent gains, edtech companies need to replicate Sketchy’s strategy: Replace outdated systems and methods with new, tech-powered solutions. No more of the endless bundling and unbundling of the school experience. As we evolve into a world of life-long learning and cohort-based learning platforms, founders will need to be especially innovative with the way they deliver content. Don’t simply put engaging content on a screen, but innovate on what that screen looks like, tracks and offers. Is it rooted in true learning principles, or is it just a repacked lecture?</p>
<p>In other words, if 2020 showed us how hard “Zoom school” really is, then 2021 should not be about creating more versions of Zoom schools. It should be about playing an entirely different universe.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2072640" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2072640" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2072640" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/edtech-campus-experience.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="332" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/edtech-campus-experience.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/edtech-campus-experience.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/edtech-campus-experience.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/edtech-campus-experience.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/edtech-campus-experience.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/edtech-campus-experience.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/edtech-campus-experience.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/edtech-campus-experience.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2072640" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bryce Durbin</p></div></p>
<h2><strong>The hurdle that remains</strong></h2>
<p>The biggest elephant in the room for edtech is the one that every human in the world can&#8217;t wait for: the end of the coronavirus pandemic. And with promising vaccine news, the light at the end of the tunnel certainly feels within reach for those who dare to dream.</p>
<p>When the world recovers, startups that have based their entire business around remote learning and remote work will likely see a drop in usage. The surge will slow, and everyone in edtech is wondering how to extract post-pandemic value.</p>
<p>This in mind, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashleymbittner/">Ashley Bittner</a>, co-founding partner of <a href="https://www.firework.vc/">Firework Ventures</a>, a new future of work fund, thinks that the next generation of edtech founders should continue to make moonshot bets, but be realistic about what will work for the decades ahead.</p>
<p>“Anyone can pitch an idea about how we should do math curriculum,” she said. “But there’s a reason behind why we teach kids to do it this way. I don’t think there’s enough respect for the experience learning science behind products.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In this country, we have a longstanding peaceful transfer of power for the executive office, even in the wake of the hardest-fought elections. Certain circumstances have led many to question whether the tradition will continue come January 20. Despite his very vocal protestations, however, the current president has<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-he-will-leave-if-electoral-college-votes-for-biden/2020/11/26/7883351c-303b-11eb-96c2-aac3f162215d_story.html"> agreed to step aside</a>, should all of his legal maneuvers fall short (something that seems all but a certainty at this point).</p>
<p>There is, of course, nothing in the Constitution that offers guidance the peaceful transition of passwords &#8212; strangely, the forefathers of this country didn’t possess the foresight to predict <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. The service has already outlined what happens to Trump’s account when he leaves office. Namely, he loses the protections that come with being a political figure.</p>
<p>CEO Jack Dorsey noted this at last month’s congressional hearings, stating, “If an account suddenly is not a world leader anymore, that particular policy goes away.” But what of the incoming president? What will the transition look like for Biden? And what happens if Trump doesn’t willingly give up the official @Potus account as has also been suggested?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Biden transition says Trump admin has refused to transfer the <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@POTUS</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WhiteHouse</a> Twitter accounts with followers and that Biden must start from zero — reversing goodwill gesture from Obama admin in 2016.</p>
<p>&mdash; Hugo Lowell (@hugolowell) <a href="https://twitter.com/hugolowell/status/1341432767888957442?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>He hasn’t exactly been eager to accept the results of this election and he’s not the sort to willingly give up a platform &#8212; particularly one with 33 million followers (admittedly a fraction of Trump’s main account).</p>
<p>Nick Pacilio, of Twitter’s Communications, Government &amp; News team, offered TechCrunch the following statement, on the matter: “Twitter has been in ongoing discussions with the Biden transition team on a number of aspects related to White House account transfers.”</p>
<p>The company, perhaps understandably, didn’t answer the question directly, but working with the incoming team is a simple enough way to circumvent any issues transferring more than one dozen accounts, as <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-will-face-different-twitter-rules-when-he-leaves-office-11608642198?st=qipqi5w4hwb57f8&amp;reflink=share_mobilewebshare">The Wall Street Journal notes</a>. As has been reported, existing tweets will be deleted and the incoming administration will start from scratch &#8212; a net positive for the Biden team, given the…polarizing nature of the previous president’s feed.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/531292-biden-campaign-official-says-twitter-will-wipe-potus-accounts-followers">Biden’s digital director</a>, the POTUS and White House accounts will also reset to zero followers, marking a change over the Obama to Trump transition. Donald Trump’s personal Twitter account has already lost one prominent follower. Earlier this week, CEO Jack Dorsey <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/us-elections-government/ny-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-unfollow-trump-biden-20201221-keobkswhqfbzhekd67g36zpjue-story.html">unfollowed the president</a>, along with other prominent politicians, including Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even in a non-hell year, running a successful startup is a tremendous lift. After the events of 2020, however, no doubt many already lean businesses are hanging on by the skin of their teeth. For every company that saw increased interest in their offerings during the pandemic, there were several that simply couldn’t make it through the finish line.</p>
<p>We’ve put this list together for several years now. It’s not a fun task, but it seems worthwhile to commemorate the startups that have closed up shop over the past 12 months. (Some of them were acquired by larger companies before shutting down, but all of them began their life as startups, and it still felt worthwhile to mark the end of their stories.) It also offers an opportunity to examine those issues from a bit of distance to see if there are any broader takeaways for the community at large.</p>
<p>This year’s list is among the most diverse we’ve done, ranging from standard smaller-name closures to big blockbuster crashes like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/quibi" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="quibi">Quibi <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/essential-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="essential-2">Essential <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. For some, the pandemic was the final nail in the coffin, but in many cases, cracks in business models were already starting to surface well before COVID-19 ground the global economy to a screeching halt.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/atrium-shuts-down/">Atrium (2017-2020)</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Total Raised:</strong> $75 million</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1954069" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/atrium-scale-pitch.png" alt="" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/atrium-scale-pitch.png 2568w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/atrium-scale-pitch.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/atrium-scale-pitch.png?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/atrium-scale-pitch.png?resize=768,508 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/atrium-scale-pitch.png?resize=680,450 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/atrium-scale-pitch.png?resize=1536,1017 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/atrium-scale-pitch.png?resize=2048,1356 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/atrium-scale-pitch.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Atrium, a 100-person legal tech startup founded by Justin Kan, shut down in March after failing to find an efficient way to replace the arduous systems of law firms. The startup even returned some of its $75.5 million in funding to its investors, including Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<p>The shutdown comes after the platform had pivoted just months earlier, laying off in-house lawyers and turning into a clearer SaaS play. Ultimately, Atrium’s failure shows how difficult and unprofitable it could be to disrupt a traditional and complicated system.</p>
<p>The closure came just three years after it launched with the goal to build software for startups to navigate fundraising, hiring, acquisition deals and collaboration with their legal team.</p>

<p>Big plans, big names and a boatload of money should have been enough to buy Essential a lengthy runway. Sure, Essential was entering a mature and oversaturated market, but the Playground-backed startup was doing so with $330 million in funding, a team of top industry executives and some genuinely innovative ideas.</p>
<p>When I spoke to the company at launch, an executive outlined a 10-year plan to become a major player in both the mobile and smart home categories. Ultimately, the company was able to eke out just under three years of life after coming out of stealth. And while it did give the world a promising handset, its connected home hub never arrived.</p>
<p>Timing, broader marketing issues and troubling allegations of sexual misconduct were all contributing factors that stopped Essential’s big plans dead in their tracks.</p>

<p>HubHaus, founded by Shruti Merchant, was a long-term housing rental platform rooted in the belief that adult dormitories would take off. The startup targeted working professionals in cities, and raised only around $11 million in known venture capital. When it came to raising a Series B, Merchant says the company struggled to close and lost investor interest due to WeWork’s failed IPO.</p>
<p>After then pivoting to a self-funded company, HubHaus was just finding footing when the coronavirus pandemic arrived in the United States, drastically hurting the rental market (as shown by Airbnb’s public struggles, as well). The housing company eventually decided to close down in September, leaving landlords, members and vendors in limbo and bringing on a fresh sweep of critique and controversy.</p>
<p>Affordable housing continues to be an issue in the Bay Area, and HubHaus’s departure from the scene underscores this truth.</p>

Goldstein and Reddit co-founder Steve Huffman, was one of the first travel aggregation platforms on the market. The company put together information on flights, hotels and car rental all into one place so consumers could compare and contrast prices with ease.</p>
<p>The focus was enough for the platform to get acquired by Concur, but now after four years, the travel startup shut down. Notably, the travel startup’s closure wasn’t necessarily tied to the coronavirus pandemic. The site officially went dark on January 23, months before lockdowns came to the United States.</p>

<p>IfOnly had created a marketplaces of exclusive events — such as &#8220;goat yoga&#8221; — a business that faced obvious challenges during the pandemic. The startup was actually acquired by one of its investors, Mastercard, late last year, but the acquisition wasn&#8217;t announced until IfOnly revealed over the summer that it was shutting down.</p>

<p>Microsoft shut down its Twitch competitor Mixer this year, handing off its partnerships to Facebook Gaming. The service had its roots in the software giant&#8217;s acquisition of Beam Interactive shortly after the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/09/beam-wants-to-turn-gaming-streams-wildly-dynamic/">won TechCrunch&#8217;s Startup Battlefield</a> in 2016.</p>
<p>Before giving up, Microsoft made some big investments in Mixer&#8217;s success, most notably signing streaming superstars Ninja and Shroud to exclusive deals. (They became free agents after the shutdown.) However, Microsoft&#8217;s gaming chief Phil Spencer said the company suffered from starting out &#8220;pretty far behind&#8221; the biggest players in the streaming market.</p>

<p>Despite a busy year of innovation and venture for news media platforms, The Outline, which branded itself as “the next generation version of the New Yorker” was shut down. The media site was started by Josh Topolsky and had an explicit focus on serving millennials with a digital-first news media brand.</p>
<p>The shutdown was part of a broader layoffs at Bustle Digital Group, which acquired the publication in 2019. Pre-acquisition, The Outline had already scaled back its editorial staff and refocused on freelance articles. (Input — a tech site that Topolsky founded for BDG — continues to publish.)</p>

<p>Periscope went out with more of a whimper than a bang. The startup was acquired by Twitter before it had even launched a product. With Meerkat bursting on the scene that year at SXSW, Twitter went on the offensive, buying the startup to build out its own live video offering.</p>
<p>Periscope’s run was decent as far as these things go, and its technology will live on as part of Twitter’s video offerings, even after the app is officially discontinued next March. But in the end, Periscope was a shell of its former self. In fact, this is a rare instance where the pandemic may have actually delayed its shutdown.</p>
<p>The company notes, “We probably would have made this decision sooner if it weren’t for all of the projects we reprioritized due to the events of 2020.”</p>

<p>The company made beer-brewing machines that used coffee pod-style PicoPaks, then expanded into other categories like coffee and tea, but never quite attracted enough customers to make the business viable. It sold its assets earlier this year to PB Funding Group — a group of lenders recruited by then-CEO Bill Mitchell in 2018 to keep it afloat.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that PicoBrew will live on in some form, as PB Funding Group says it&#8217;s seeking buyers for the company&#8217;s patents and other intellectual property, and that it will keep the website running in the short term so that the machines don&#8217;t stop working.</p>

<p>More so than any tech company in recent memory (with the possible exception of Theranos), Quibi’s existence feels like a fever dream. $1.75 billion in funding later and what do we have to show for it? “Fierce Queens,” a nature documentary about female animals. The HGTV-style program, “Murder House Flip.” And, of course, “The Shape of Pasta.” A show about pasta.</p>
<p>Early reports of the service’s demise seemed premature &#8212; if only because there was seemingly no way a company could burn through that much capital that quickly. By late-October, however, it was over. “All that is left now is to offer a profound apology for disappointing you and, ultimately, for letting you down,” founders Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman wrote in an open letter.</p>
<p>Sometimes startup failures are bad timing. Sometimes it’s just plain bad luck. With Quibi, the diagnoses of what went wrong can be summed up in one word: everything.</p>

<p>Rubica spun out of security company Concentric Advisors with the aim of offering tools that were more advanced than antivirus software, while still remaining accessible to individuals and small businesses. CEO and co-founder Frances Dewing said that when customers cut back on spending during the pandemic, the company tried to shift its focus to larger enterprise, but it failed to convince investors there was a business there.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were all really surprised given how relevant and needed this is right now,” she said. “Investors didn’t agree with that or see it in the same way.”</p>

<p>ScaleFactor was a startup claiming to offer artificial intelligence tools that could replace accountants for small businesses; it blamed the pandemic for cutting its revenue in half and forcing the company to shut down. However, former employees and customers <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/07/20/scalefactor-raised-100-million-in-a-year-then-blamed-covid-19-for-its-demise-employees-say-it-had-much-bigger-problems/?sh=5a7dcbd52928">told Forbes a different story</a> — that ScaleFactor actually relied on human accountants (including an outsourced team in the Philippines) to do the work.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s hardly unprecedented for a startup to fudge the truth about their level of automation versus human labor, this reportedly resulted in error-filled accounting for ScaleFactor clients. (Responding to a fact-checking email, former CEO Kurt Rathmann said the email was &#8220;filled with numerous factual inaccuracies and misrepresentation&#8221; and declined to comment further.)</p>

<p>“In 2019, our truck became the first fully-unmanned truck to drive on a live highway,” Starsky Robotics co-founder and CEO Stefan Seltz-Axmacher wrote in a Medium post in March. &#8220;And in 2020, we’re shutting down.” After five years and $20 million in funding, the autonomous trucking company shut its doors that month. It wasn’t for lack of ambition or demand &#8212; it seems safe to assume there’s still a bright future for self-driving trucks.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, Starsky won’t be along for that ride &#8212; a fact Seltz-Axmacher blames largely on timing. A crowded market is certainly at play, as well, with countless companies currently pushing to bring autonomous technology to the road.</p>

<p>Founded in 2018 by ex-Googlers, Stockwell AI shut down after being unable to find business for its in-building smart vending machines that stocked everything from condoms to La Croix. The company blamed the “current landscape” (also known as the global pandemic we are experiencing) for its closure.</p>
<p>Stockwell AI, formerly known as Bodega, was well-funded and well-known, with more than $45 million in funding from investors that included NEA, GV, DCM Ventures, Forerunner, First Round and Homebrew. Still, even venture capital couldn’t make vending machines work well enough.</p>

<p>Another travel-focused startup bites the dust as the coronavirus limits the chance to safely explore the world (let alone your neighborhood). Trover, a photo-sharing hub for travelers acquired by Expedia, shut down in August. The startup was founded by Rich Barton and Jason Karas and was meant to connect people travelling to the same places. The startup had quite the life: it began out of the remains of TravelPost, a travel review site, and got scooped up by its parent company when it only had $2.5 million in funding. Unfortunately, its nine-year journey is over for now.</p>

<p>The Media Lab is famed for its freewheeling techno-intellectual prowess, but for more than a year has been leaderless following the resignation of former head Joi Ito. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/07/joi-ito-resigns-as-mit-media-lab-head-in-wake-of-jeffrey-epstein-reporting/">Ito resigned</a> when it was discovered that billionaire and alleged child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein had given funding and reportedly received special treatment and access to the Media Lab under his leadership.</p>
<p>The ensuing leadership search no doubt looked for, if not exactly new blood (Newman has been involved with MIT for decades) then certainly a break from the past. Out of 60 candidates, they interviewed 13 and ended up picking Newman for a variety of reasons.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In a field of outstanding candidates, Professor Newman stood out for her pioneering research, wide range of multidisciplinary engagements, and exemplary leadership. She is a designer, a thinker, a maker, an engineer, an educator, a mentor, a convener, a communicator, a futurist, a humanist and, importantly, an optimist,&#8221; wrote Dean Hashim Sarkis in a letter announcing the appointment.</p>
<p>Coincidentally (or is it?), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/building-the-workforce-of-the-future-2/">Newman just last week was a speaker at TC Sessions: Space</a>, where she seemed to give a preview of her new responsibilities talking about the importance of inclusion in major efforts like NASA&#8217;s Artemis.</p>
<p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to bring the scientists and engineers together, but we need the artists, we need the designers, they&#8217;re the visionaries,&#8221; she said. (If you missed the event, you can watch this and all our other panels on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extracrunch/">Extra Crunch</a>.)</p>
<p>Newman seems to be starting off the job by emphasizing one of the best qualities a leader should have: listening to the people she&#8217;ll be leading.</p>
<p>&#8220;I plan to start by doing a lot of listening and learning,&#8221; she said in the MIT announcement. &#8220;I like to meet people where they are, and to encourage them to put all their great ideas on the table. I think that’s the best way to go forward, working with the whole community — faculty, students and staff — to tap into everyone’s creativity. I can’t wait to get started.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It goes without saying, but 2020 was a bad year for a lot of people.</p>
<p>For many, it was a year of stress, sadness and anxiety. It was a year of missing friends and family; of just getting to the next day, even as each day seemed to blur into the last.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve done at the end of each of the past few years, we invited our team to look back and highlight some of their &#8220;favorite things&#8221; — the things that, as we look back from the depths of December, put smiles on our faces, or helped us pass the time, or taught us some new skill. Most years this question feels like &#8220;What made your year better?&#8221; This year it felt more like &#8220;What made your year suck less?&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Our definition of &#8220;things&#8221; on this list has always been incredibly fuzzy by design. &#8220;Things&#8221; can be whatever makes sense to the writer. &#8220;Things&#8221; can be podcasts, or songs, or movies, or people, or concepts. Some of these things are new to the world in 2020. Others are things that have been around for years (decades, even!), but popped back up in our lives this year. Whatever the case, we hope you find some inspiration, some new thread to pull, some new song to sing or some new thing to love.</p>

<h3>WBGO 88.3FM</h3>
<p>As a kid I used to fall asleep listening to the late-night talk radio shows from my bedroom in England. These days I&#8217;m all about WBGO, a New Jersey public radio station broadcast from Times Square. It plays jazz all day, every day, and that&#8217;s about it. Jazz doesn&#8217;t want to talk about politics around the dinner table or post anti-vax conspiracy theories to Facebook. It&#8217;s perfect escapism from the news firehose. We have WBGO playing quietly on the radio in the kitchen throughout the day. And since it&#8217;s an easy listen, I often put it on as I work from my desk. I even bought a HomePod mini as an early Christmas treat so I can listen all day long.</p>
<h3>Cross-stitching</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2089961" style="width: 929px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089961" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2089961" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cross-stitch.jpg" alt="" width="919" height="747" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cross-stitch.jpg 919w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cross-stitch.jpg?resize=150,122 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cross-stitch.jpg?resize=300,244 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cross-stitch.jpg?resize=768,624 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cross-stitch.jpg?resize=680,553 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cross-stitch.jpg?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 919px) 100vw, 919px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089961" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zack Whittaker</p></div></p>
<p>The TV dried up pretty early on and there wasn&#8217;t much else to do, so I took up cross-stitching. It&#8217;s easy to learn — similar to a Paint by Numbers but with sewing — and requires little skill so it&#8217;s ideal for me. It&#8217;s a fantastic way to wind down and forget about the actual dumpster fire of a year it&#8217;s been.</p>

<h3>Call Your Girlfriend (Podcast)</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2089964" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089964" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2089964" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/call-your-girlfriend.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="388" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/call-your-girlfriend.jpg 1769w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/call-your-girlfriend.jpg?resize=150,57 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/call-your-girlfriend.jpg?resize=300,114 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/call-your-girlfriend.jpg?resize=768,291 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/call-your-girlfriend.jpg?resize=680,258 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/call-your-girlfriend.jpg?resize=1536,583 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/call-your-girlfriend.jpg?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089964" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Call Your Girlfriend</p></div></p>
<p>In a year where every relationship is a long distance relationship, Call Your Girlfriend has been a must-listen podcast. It&#8217;s been running since 2014, but I only picked it up this year because I was looking for ways to think about adult friendships that are platonic. I think the topics put a lot of coronavirus fatigue into eloquent context, such as consent conversations when people have different risk tolerances, how to find joy in this time and the science behind friendship. The show, co-hosted by Aminatou Sow and Ann Friedman, describes itself as a &#8220;podcast for long-distance besties everywhere.&#8221; I&#8217;d add that it&#8217;s an exhale during a time where all of us are very, sometimes subconsciously, tense.</p>
<h3>Graffeo coffee</h3>
<p>San Francisco&#8217;s Graffeo Coffee is one of North Beach&#8217;s remaining treasures. The little coffee roaster was my bi-weekly stop during my quarantine sanity walks all throughout this year. And I still order the beans even though I&#8217;m not in SF anymore! Good people, small business, and I get the beans whole and dark roasted.</p>

<h3>Waxahatchee <i>Saint Cloud</i></h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2089966" style="width: 607px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089966" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2089966" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/saint-cloud.jpg" alt="" width="597" height="587" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/saint-cloud.jpg 597w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/saint-cloud.jpg?resize=150,147 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/saint-cloud.jpg?resize=300,295 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/saint-cloud.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/saint-cloud.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/saint-cloud.jpg?resize=64,64 64w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089966" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Waxahatchee</p></div></p>
<p>Not to put too fine a point on it, but music might have saved my life this year. And thankfully there were some terrific albums this year — Lomelda, Thundercat, Denzel Curry, Open Mike Eagle and Death Valley Girls to name a few. But Waxahatchee’s latest was just a huge ray of country twang-infused pop-indie folk. Start with “Fire” and go from there.</p>
<h3>Moby Dick by Herman Melville</h3>
<p>Some things are worth revisiting throughout life. They’ll never change, but the lives we’ve led can’t help but profoundly impact our relationship to them. It’s been said that Moby Dick holds the secrets to the universe within its 135 chapters. But while Melville may have laid the groundwork for such revelation, it’s clear he couldn’t make heads or tails of the results. Moby Dick is a singular work in American literature. It’s profoundly strange and funny and disjoined and beautiful and sad. It’s also wildly, wildly weird. It’s a perfect quarantine companion.</p>
<h3>Orba by Ariphon</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2075687" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2075687" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2075687" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-18-080657797.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-18-080657797.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-18-080657797.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-18-080657797.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-18-080657797.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-18-080657797.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-18-080657797.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-18-080657797.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-18-080657797.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2075687" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>I’d been waiting to play with Artiphon’s Orba since meeting with the company back at CES 2020 (those weird and wild days when we used to jam humans into a room to look at products). The $99 gadget is probably the closest I’ve come so far to a device that can foster music creation among the non-musical. It’s also a terrific little time killer and great for blowing off a bit of steam between meetings.</p>
<h3>Lodge 49</h3>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/g2p1osv0jj8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Maybe Lodge 49 is an uncynical critique of a deeply cynical time. It’s a goddamn ray of sunshine in a dark moment that was, naturally, too beautiful to live. Perhaps the (cancelled) AMC show is an inadvertent object lesson in appreciating what we had, rather than lamenting what we lost. Maybe some day it will return as a one-off Netflix season or a Kickstarter movie when everyone is on-board with the show three years from now and we’ll all be excited while bemoaning the fact that it just couldn’t capture the magic of the original.</p>

<h3>1-min dance parties</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2089968" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/maggie.gif" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>With very high-risk parents and a doctor brother, the COVID fear starts to settle in your bones. To keep the sad panda at bay, I started to do one-minute dance parties in the morning. Just me and Spotify on random &#8212; no judgement, no expectations, just movement. If it feels hard to get started, start with your big toe and watch the good vibes start to flow : ) A little free and crazy dancing to start the day makes for a bright and beautiful day.</p>
<h3>Baking</h3>
<p>With the privilege of working from home, I&#8217;ve gotten very much into baking and cooking. I love gifting cooked and baked goods &#8212; fresh bread, brownies, pumpkin tarts, sauces, soups etc. to my friends. It&#8217;s amazing how a little gift of food always brings an immediate smile to the faces of the people we care about! (Especially if they are vegan lol.)</p>
<h3>Digital Phone Banking</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that we need to remain actively engaged to keep our democracy strong. I&#8217;m extremely grateful for digital autodialers that allow me to advocate for those that most need the support without actually having to be in a specific place or outside. Not only is it our duty, but it makes me feel good to know that I am making a difference in my small way helping folks make it to the polls. It&#8217;s so fun to talk to people all across the country and connect with them on the humanitarian issues that matter most. Yay democracy!</p>

<p>In a year when seemingly nothing was as it should be, I discovered the puzzle genre that I&#8217;ve been looking for all my life — and apparently it has been around just as long. Filling in the rows and columns according to the provided numbers is simple and peaceful, yet occupies my mind almost completely, allowing a safe, mobile dissociation from the perils of real life. The best one I&#8217;ve found is Konami&#8217;s Pixel Puzzle collection, which is free, easy to use and has fun pixel art from retro games.</p>
<h3>Tenet</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2089969" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089969" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2089969" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tenet.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="535" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tenet.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tenet.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tenet.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tenet.jpg?resize=768,401 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tenet.jpg?resize=680,355 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tenet.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089969" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Warner Bros.</p></div></p>
<p>Christopher Nolan&#8217;s latest isn&#8217;t the best movie I saw this year, but as with Inception, no one even tries to make movies like this except him, and I marvel at the pure plate-spinning audacity of his filmmaking. Maybe you think it&#8217;s pseudo-intellectual wankery, but&#8230; well, perhaps it is. But it&#8217;s a prime example of the species.</p>
<h3>Hyori&#8217;s Bed &amp; Breakfast</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2089970" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089970" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2089970" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hyori.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hyori.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hyori.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hyori.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hyori.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hyori.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hyori.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089970" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Netflix</p></div></p>
<p>After the heartbreak and disillusionment of Terrace House&#8217;s tragic end, we needed another gentle reality show showcasing the ordinary (yet still strange to me) everyday lives of people in another country. I found Hyori&#8217;s Bed &amp; Breakfast very late and it has filled the gap (though another Korean entry, Three Meals a Day, is also worthy). Featuring a retired pop star and her husband as they attempt to convert their home to a B&amp;B, it&#8217;s funny, weird and full of dogs and genuine human moments.</p>

<p>I cannot leave a grocery store without scouring the beverage section for kombucha. And not just any kombucha. The sweet red label of a GT&#8217;s Strawberry Serenity kombucha must be in stock and ready for pillaging or it will have been a wasted trip. I have a problem.

<p>When I left Australia in 2010 after having lived there for three years, I brought back with me a love of cricket. Time zones, as well as virtually no one in the States to discuss it with, made it hard for me to keep track of what was happening on pitches all over the world. My subscription to <a href="http://willow.tv/">Willow.tv</a> almost fixes all of that. I&#8217;m still facing some sleepless nights as Australia takes on India in the summer tour Down Under, but at least I can watch it live.</p>

<p>With many months of 2020 spent confined almost entirely to a one-bed apartment, with all gyms closed and a total ban on going outdoors for exercise, staying fit has required some changing up of the usual routines. To wit: I&#8217;ve found <a href="http://www.fitnessblender.com">Fitness Blender&#8217;s</a> gimmick-free training videos a total God-send. Now I almost look forward to HIIT! Thanks so much guys. Plus one more (related) positive vibe this year: My favorite yoga teacher, who lives in another city, started doing Zoom classes remotely &#8212; truly a silver lining to 2020&#8217;s virtual everything. Thx <a href="https://www.chloefaulkner.co.uk">Chloe</a>!</p>

<p>No, not a surveillance camera for safely riding in Ubers &#8212; UberTape is a brand of kinesiology tape that&#8217;s been another saving grace in an injury-prone year when I also discovered some new and unfun skin sensitivities (happily this tape is &#8220;hypoallergenic and latex free&#8221;).</p>
<p>What actually is kinesiology tape? It&#8217;s support tape for joints and muscle. I was introduced to it by my physiotherapist and can confirm it has made the difference between being able to train pain-free or not. It&#8217;s miraculous stuff &#8212; so long as you position it correctly (with the right amount of stretching). So whether 2020 has hit you with Achilles&#8217; tendonitis, shin splints, plantar fasciitis, tennis elbow or runner&#8217;s knee &#8212; and this year has surely hit most of us with some new and unusual injury (and plenty more besides) &#8212; I&#8217;m happy to report a little stretchy tape goes a long way. So thanks, <a href="https://www.ubertape.co.uk">UberTape</a>, for helping make 2020 a little less painful.</p>
<h3>The Wire (again)</h3>
<p>I first watched The Wire about 10 years ago when it was first screened on U.K. terrestrial TV. I remember taking a while to sink into it at first &#8212; Baltimore gang slang was pretty exotic (to a Brit) back then &#8212; but after a few episodes we were hooked on McNulty, D&#8217;Angelo, Omar &amp; crew just like McNulty is hooked on Jameson and cheap bar thrills. The full five seasons were duly consumed and judged an incomparable master work.</p>
<p>A decade on and our 24/7 connected world is now one gigantic phone-enabled wiretap. (Nor do any of the mega corporations surveilling our every blink have a proper legal base, much like Lester didn&#8217;t for that last wiretap. Tsk.) The show was also prescient in pointing out the fragile business of reporting truth versus the tacky lure of fake news. Truly ahead of its time &#8212; before you even start in on the marvelous cast of characters and intricate societal portrait, showing how corrupt, stupid, vindictive, self-interested decisions by a handful of people in positions of power trickle down, again and again, wreaking misery on the next generation and condemning the already vulnerable to yet more suffering.</p>
<p>Rewatching The Wire at the end of 2020 has, fittingly enough, kept me sane through a second lockdown and Europe&#8217;s second (or third) waves of COVID-19, now</p>

<p>with an unfestive holiday season fast approaching. I&#8217;m just sad they only made five seasons. Can someone please call David Simon?</p>
<h3>My DIY training wall (and other projects)</h3>
<p>Staying sane in lockdown has definitely meant keeping busy. So when not hard at work reporting for TechCrunch (or training for climbing), I&#8217;ve made sure to have a few creative projects on the go &#8212; including a fun collaborative writing gig with my friend (and former TCer, John Biggs). But the project that&#8217;s delivered the most tangible results (so far) is my DIY training wall &#8212; which is part training tool, part artwork (I can&#8217;t take art credit but painting the wall was my idea). Planning and making the board kept me busy through the first lockdown. Being able to use it for training circuits has kept me going through the second wave of gym closures, so I think that&#8217;s a good result.</p>

<p>This one was released in 2016, but somehow flew under my radar until it was added to Netflix in late 2020. Directed by the <em>WAY TOO DAMNED TALENTED</em> Taika Waititi (who also directed What We Do In The Shadows, JoJo Rabbit and the best episode of The Mandalorian), it tells the tale of Ricky Baker, a defiant teen who reluctantly finds himself under the guardianship of new foster parents in the New Zealand bush. I can&#8217;t say much more without spoiling it, but Waititi managed to cram a whole lot of movie (and emotional ups and downs) into an hour and forty minutes. Skip the trailer and just dive in.</p>

<p>I miss friends. I miss board games. I miss board games with friends. The Jackbox series, streamed over Zoom, brings back a little bit of that energy without requiring too much setup or explanation. Pick a game, fire up a Zoom screen share, play. Each &#8220;box&#8221; has a handful of different games, and everyone plays using the phones they already have as controllers. There are seven boxes, and you can often find the older ones on sale. My favorite boxes are the ones that include Quiplash, Drawful, Fibbage and, with the right group of trivia-loving weirdos, Trivia Murder Party.</p>

<p>I’ve been a chocolate addict since I was a wee one &#8212; back when a Hershey’s chocolate bar only cost $0.35 at my local corner store. Tony’s Chocolonely costs a pricey $5.95 per bar, but it is so worth it.</p>

<h3>Zoom Yoga</h3>
<p>The number one way I stayed sane this year was with the amazing opportunities to practice yoga with my favorite SF teachers, like Janet Stone, Rusty Wells, Jeremy Falk, Peter Walters and Melody Pfeiffer, just to name a few. This gave me something to focus on (especially during these winter months of lockdown). Janet Stone in particular created a platform that basically became group therapy and such an amazing support system. <a href="https://www.outdooryogasf.com">Outdooryogasf</a> saved my life while living alone during a pandemic! The innovation around yoga and creating Zoom classes, integrating music and creating community was bar none the best experience for me in 2020.</p>
<h3>Friday night Zoom movie nights</h3>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe I am still doing this a year later. Every Friday, my friends log in to watch movies together. Most of the time I fall asleep, but we&#8217;ve watched so many movies and it&#8217;s a great way to stay connected.</p>

<p>I started using this app on a whim in January and kept going after I realized it was free (albeit ad-supported). The courses, built around sample sentences that test reading, speaking and hearing, introduce vocabulary and grammar with fun animated characters. Nothing can take the place of practicing the language with native speakers, but this is a good place to start.</p>

<p>The best new podcast of the year is two dudes talking, but not just any dudes: polymath Open Mike Eagle interviews legendary producer Prince Paul over the course of 12 episodes about the many varied projects of his 30-plus-year career. Whether you are deeply familiar with groups such as De La Soul and Handsome Boy Modeling School or are ready to dive in, these stories are fascinating.</p>
<h3>Local pub trivia (Online)</h3>
<p>A pub in my town would host trivia every Thursday, pre-pandemic. The same week things shut down, clever organizers cobbled together an online version using a YouTube stream and Google forms, attracting dozens more teams than could ever attend in person. The pub has recently shut down but the game goes on, now in its fortieth week. (My small team has yet to win.)</p>

<p>Since all the fitness classes that I used to take are no longer available (OrangeTheory, Barry&#8217;s, SoulCycle), the Peloton has kept me active and sane. I love the variety of classes it offers, from yoga to bootcamp. Also, being able to take a class at my schedule and convenience makes it even more convenient. It&#8217;s going to be hard to go back to a studio once (if ever) we&#8217;re back to normal.</p>

<h3>Audiobooks read by Juliet Stevenson</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve depended on audiobooks for a lot of my reading over the past months and realized how rare a narrator like Juliet Stevenson is. She subtly uncovers depths of meaning in sentences, especially dialogue, without overpowering them with her own interpretation. Each phrase feels like it&#8217;s been lit from within.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not the only person who relied on Stevenson&#8217;s narration to mentally escape this year. In a <a href="https://lithub.com/in-utter-celebration-of-juliet-stevensons-brilliance-as-an-audiobook-narrator/">Lit Hub article</a>, Scott Spencer, who has spent more than 300 hours listening to Stevenson reading, wrote, &#8220;Even a fatuous idea becomes interesting as she has enlarges and illuminates it with her voice—that voice which is the audible expression of her profundity and humanity.&#8221; Fortunately for Stevenson&#8217;s fans, she is a prolific narrator, with over 180 titles listed on Audible. Her work spans many genres, so if you&#8217;re looking for somewhere to start, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Paying-Guests-Sarah-Waters-audiobook/dp/B00M7RNBGY">&#8220;The Paying Guests&#8221; by Sarah Waters</a>.</p>
<h3>Lovecraft Country</h3>

<p>&#8220;Lovecraft Country&#8221; is a show that stays with you for a long time after you watch it. Honestly, I kind of regret binge watching it, because in hindsight it would have been better to let each episode marinate in my head for a couple days before plowing back into the narrative.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in the same place, I highly recommend reading <a href="https://www.theroot.com/author/kdbrooks">Kinitra Brooks&#8217; reviews</a> on The Root to help you unpack the show. Dr. Brooks is a literary scholar who focuses on Black women and genre fiction, and her essays explore each episode&#8217;s treatment of horror themes and historical context (though &#8220;historical&#8221; feels like the wrong word to use here because even though the show takes place in 1955, all of its commentary on racism is still highly relevant today). HBO&#8217;s <a href="https://www.hbo.com/lovecraft-country/podcast">official podcast</a>, hosted by Ashley C. Ford and &#8220;Lovecraft Country&#8221; writer Shannon Houston, is also wonderful.</p>

<p>Now that Cinemax has stopped producing original content, the future of &#8220;Warrior,&#8221; based on a concept developed by Bruce Lee, is unclear. I&#8217;m really hoping that it gains enough new viewers on HBO Max to warrant another season and tie up loose ends, because I&#8217;ve become emotionally invested in many of the characters.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s Ah Sahm (the lead, played by Andrew Koji), of course, but I also want to see how Young Jun (Jason Tobin) copes with finally gaining real power, and learn more about the women characters, especially Mai Ling (Dianne Doan) and Ah Toy (Olivia Cheng), whose motivations were really only hinted at in the first two seasons. As someone who grew up when yellowface was still routinely broadcast on TV, it&#8217;s extremely meaningful to see a show where the majority of the cast is Asian. I love how the show plays with language and accents to depict how the Chinese characters appear to one another, versus how they appear to white characters, and also how it deftly switches between honoring and subverting martial arts movie tropes.</p>

<h3>Virtual events</h3>
<p>I actually feel slightly guilty about this one &#8212; hey, I&#8217;m British, it&#8217;s what we do best &#8212; but the move away from in-person to virtual events has been an amazing leveler for me and net positive overall.</p>
<p>I use a wheelchair and have other physical challenges that make traveling for work more difficult and energy-sapping, so historically I&#8217;d only get to do one or two events per year as a moderator or speaker. That all changed in 2020 and by my count I&#8217;ve done well over 10 events, including high-profile conferences like our own Disrupt, CogX and Slush. Ceilings are often broken when and in ways you least expect them to be.</p>

<p>Launched on March 31st, just as the U.K. and many other countries around the world first entered lockdown, Endlesss is a collaborative music-making app (iOS and Mac) that combines software recreations of drum machines, samplers, synths and FX, with a “tap to loop” workflow that should be familiar to anyone who has used a looper pedal or loop-based sequencer.</p>
<p>What makes Endlesss different and exciting is the way these loops or riffs can be shared or remixed by others participating in your jam — essentially sending musical messages back and forth as if it were a chatroom. Unsurprisingly, for many (myself included), the app has been a creative, and dare I say, therapeutic outlet during the pandemic.</p>

<p>As someone who grew up loving classic adventure games, I found this Apple Arcade title to be a near-perfect update of the old-school formula.</p>
<p>You play as Robert Foster, a man whose search for a missing child draws him back to a seemingly utopian city after years in the wilderness. The game is filled with colorful characters and locations (designed by &#8220;Watchmen&#8221; artist Dave Gibbons), with puzzles that rely less on ridiculous combinations of inventory items and more on conversation and hacking all the technology around the city. The game is a sequel to the 25-year-old &#8220;Beneath a Steel Sky,&#8221; but I didn&#8217;t have a problem jumping in fresh, and although it&#8217;s a bit prone to crashing on my iPad, I&#8217;ve been happy to endure a few bugs while exploring the fascinating world.</p>

<p>David Barr Kirtley&#8217;s science fiction-focused podcast has been around for more than a decade, and it&#8217;s been my favorite podcast for most of that time. My appreciation only increased this year, when I frequently found myself desperate to think about things other than the pandemic and the election.</p>
<p>The show&#8217;s in-depth author interviews and panel discussions allowed me to lose myself in hours of conversation about bad video game movies, or &#8220;book club&#8221; discussions of science fiction classics like &#8220;Dune.&#8221; Dave was also kind enough to invite me to join for several episodes, including one about probably my favorite book of all time, &#8220;Foundation,&#8221; and that conversation was one of the highlights of my year. (But now I can&#8217;t listen to <a href="https://www.wired.com/2020/10/geeks-guide-foundation-asimov/">the episode</a> without hearing my dumb voice!)</p>

<h3>Time</h3>
<p>Working from home has allowed me to gain back time with my family. This was the silver lining to 2020 for me. I was able to spend more time with my family. There wasn&#8217;t time taken to travel to work and home. I was at my workplace at home. I could spend time with my wife and kids within three steps of my work area. It was sometimes rambunctious, noisy, loud, chaotic or all of the above, but it was well worth being able to spend more time with them.</p>

<h3>Future subscription</h3>
<p>I’ve been paying for Future’s exercise plan subscription since covering the company’s Series B raise back in October. The app pairs you with a personal trainer who communicates with you over text and makes guided workout plans for you. The service’s $150/mo is certainly nothing to balk at, but during a year when gyms have shuttered and the amount of time I’ve spent inside my apartment skyrocketed, it’s grown a lot harder to draw boundaries inside my day, and the app has done wonders helping me mentally carve out time to get active.</p>
<p>The weakness of the program is a lack of live feedback, especially when it comes to safely pulling off a new lift or routine, but the key to making the most of the platform is asking more of your trainer in between sessions and getting that guidance. Paying for Future has been a luxury but it’s been a game changer these past few months and I’m hoping I can keep this quarantine habit going.</p>
<h3>Luxury sweatpants</h3>

<p>By about early April of this year, it was clear that comfort was king but that getting dressed up for the work day was a radical act of self care. I’ll admit, I’ve gone through ebbs and flows, but I eventually landed on a solution that skewed heavily toward comfort. I doled out some cash on some very comfy activewear sweatpants from Outdoor Voices. I opted for the Sunday sweatpants during a sale and stocked up on a couple pairs. Spending as much on sweatpants as I would on some dress pants required some mental gymnastics to justify, but surviving 2020 is an exercise in flexibility.</p>
<h3>Daily Latte</h3>
<p>I got real lazy with coffee this year. Last year, I was hipstered to the nines with a great pour-over coffee setup, including a gooseneck kettle and a Chemex. In early quarantine after nearly everything had shut down in SF, an afternoon trip to the coffee shop became one of the few moments in the day to clear my head and refocus my brain. That got expensive over time as my latte addiction grew, I also gained like 15 pounds, which I can attribute to several bad habits. Fast-forward to the present and I’ve boarded the Nespresso train again after a hiatus, this time using a new machine from their Vertuo line, which boasts double espresso shot pods which have been a godsend. I’ve been teaming a double shot with some oat milk frothed in one of their Aeroccino machines. Yum.</p>

<p>I love these masks, they’re comfy, easy to clean and were a great upgrade from other face-hugging solutions. Lots of sizes and fun colors have made these a great option to inject some personality into pandemic wear.</p>

<h3>Barry&#8217;s At-Home</h3>
<p>Exercising during the pandemic hasn&#8217;t been easy. Gyms are closed, and most people don&#8217;t have exercise machines at home. I&#8217;ve always been a big fan of Barry&#8217;s Bootcamp for HIIT exercise classes, and now they&#8217;ve brought the experience into your living room with Barry&#8217;s At-Home. The 45-minute virtual classes will get your heart rate up and help shed the pounds you put on in 2020. I&#8217;ve done well over 100 Barry&#8217;s At-Home classes this year, and it&#8217;s been a wonderful way to keep my mind and body optimized for performance.</p>
<h3>National Parks Annual Pass</h3>
<p>Digital detox was much needed in 2020. My wife and I had a chance to visit three national parks this year, and it was one of the best ways to get away from our devices. It&#8217;s amazing what a day of hiking will do for your mindfulness. The National Parks Annual Pass will run you $80 and gets you access to all the National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Being &#8220;underbanked&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean that someone lacks access to financial services. Instead, it often means they don&#8217;t have traditional bank accounts or credit cards. But in markets like Indonesia, many still use digital wallets or e-commerce platforms, creating alternative sources of user data that can help them secure working capital and other financial tools. <a href="https://finantier.co/">Finantier</a>, a Singapore-based open finance startup, wants to streamline that data with a single API that gives financial services access to user data, with their consent. It also includes machine-learning-based analytics to enable credit scoring and KYC verifications.</p>
<p>Currently in beta mode with more than 20 clients, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/finantier" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="finantier">Finantier <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is busy getting ready to officially launch. It announced today that it has been accepted into Y Combinator’s Winter 2021 startup batch. The startup also recently raised an undisclosed amount of pre-seed funding led by East Ventures, with participation from AC Ventures, Genesia Ventures, Two Culture Capital and other investors.</p>
<p>Finantier was founded earlier this year by Diego Rojas, Keng Low and Edwin Kusuma, all of whom have experience building products for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aax-b20d" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="aax-b20d">fintech <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> companies, with the mission of enabling open finance in emerging markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Open finance grew out of open banking, the same framework that Plaid and Tink are built on. Meant to give people more control over their financial data instead of keeping it siloed within banks and other institutions, users can decide to grant apps or websites secure access to information from their online accounts, including bank accounts, credit cards and digital wallets. Open banking refers mainly to payment accounts, while open finance, Finantier&#8217;s specialty, covers a larger gamut of services, including business lending, mortgages and insurance underwriting.</p>
<p>While Finantier is focusing first on Singapore and Indonesia, it plans to expand into other countries and become a global fintech company like Plaid. It&#8217;s already eyeing Vietnam and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Before launching Finantier, Rojas worked on products for peer-to-peer lending platforms Lending Club and Dianrong, and served as chief technology officer for several fintech startups in Southeast Asia. He realized that many companies struggled to integrate with other platforms and fetch data from banks, or purchase data from different providers.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are discussing open banking, embedded finance and so on,&#8221; Rojas, Finantier’s chief executive officer, told TechCrunch. &#8220;But those are the building blocks of something bigger, which is open finance. Particularly in a region like Southeast Asia, where about 60% to 70% of adults are unbanked or underbanked, we believe in helping consumers and businesses leverage the data that they have in multiple platforms. It definitely doesn’t need to be a bank account, it could be in a digital wallet, e-commerce platform or other service providers.&#8221;</p>
<p>What this means for consumers is that even if someone doesn’t have a credit card, they can still establish creditworthiness: For example, by sharing data from completed transactions on e-commerce platforms. Gig economy workers can access more financial services and deals by giving data about their daily rides or other types of work they do through different apps.</p>
<h2>Building Southeast Asia&#8217;s financial infrastructure</h2>
<p>Other open-banking startups focused on Southeast Asia include Brankas and Brick. Rojas said Finantier differentiates by specializing on open finance and creating infrastructure for financial institutions to build more services for end users.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7h7DFWSFfk"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/07/brankas/">Brankas wants to bring Southeast Asia&#8217;s banks and e-commerce into the digital era</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Brankas wants to bring Southeast Asia&#8217;s banks and e-commerce into the digital era&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/07/brankas/embed/#?secret=7h7DFWSFfk" data-secret="7h7DFWSFfk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The benefit of open finance for financial institutions is that they can create products for more consumers and find more opportunities for revenue sharing models. In Southeast Asia, this also means reaching more people who are underbanked or otherwise lack access to financial services.</p>
<p>While taking part in Y Combinator’s accelerator program, Finantier will also be participating in the Indonesia Financial Service Authority&#8217;s regulatory sandbox. Once it completes the program, it will be able to partner with more fintech companies in Indonesia, including bigger institutions.</p>
<p>There are 139 million adults in Indonesia who are underbanked or unbanked, said East Ventures co-founder and managing partner Willson Cuaca.</p>
<p>The investment firm, which focuses on Indonesia, conducts an annual survey called the East Ventures Digital Competitiveness Index and found that financial exclusion was where one of the largest divides existed. There are significant gaps in between the number of financial services available in heavily populated islands like Java, where Jakarta is located, and other islands in the archipelago.</p>
<p>To promote financial inclusion and alleviate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/07/01/govt-aims-for-10-million-msmes-to-go-digital-by-year-end.html">government has set a goal</a> for 10 million micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to go digital by the end of the year. There are currently about eight million Indonesian MSMEs that sell online, representing just 13% of MSMEs in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Providing equal access to financial services will create multiplier effects to the Indonesian economy,&#8221; Cuaca told TechCrunch about East Ventures&#8217; decision to back Finantier. &#8220;Currently, hundreds of companies work with their own unique solutions to bring financial services to more people. We believe Finantier will help them offer more products and services to this underserved section of the population.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/iac" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="iac">IAC <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announced today that it plans to turn <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/vimeo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="vimeo">Vimeo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> into an independent, publicly traded company.</p>
<p>Last month, IAC CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/vimeo-funding-spin-off/">Joey Levin wrote a letter to shareholders</a> in which he said the holding company had &#8220;begun contemplating spinning Vimeo off to our shareholders.&#8221; It sounds like the company has moved beyond the contemplation phase, with plans that will be submitted for stockholder approval in the first quarter of 2021, and the actual spin off happening in Q2.</p>
<p>&#8220;The combination of Vimeo’s remarkable growth, solid leadership position and enormous market opportunity have made clear its future,” Levin said in a statement today. “It’s time for Vimeo to spread its wings and become a great independent public company.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While Vimeo once competed with YouTube as a consumer video destination, its strategy has shifted in recent years to providing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/vimeo-record/">video tools for businesses</a>. In November, the company said it had 1.5 million paying subscribers and 3,500 enterprise clients — and that its most recent quarter was with positive EBITDA, plus year-over-year revenue growth of 44%.</p>
<p>The announcement notes that this is the eleventh company that IAC has spun off, a process in which it distributes its ownership stake to IAC shareholders. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/match-group-iac-separaton/">Match Group completed its separation</a> from IAC over the summer.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Today we have a rare opportunity to help every team and organization in the world integrate video throughout their operations, across all the ways they communicate and collaborate,&#8221; said Vimeo CEO Anjali Sud in a statement. &#8220;Our all-in-one solution radically lowers the barriers of time, cost and complexity that previously made professional-quality video unattainable. We’re ready for this next chapter and focused on making video far easier and more effective than ever before.”</p>

<p>The pitch to investors and customers is that the need to manage employees and ensure that workspaces are free from health risks is only going to grow in a post-COVID-19 world.</p>
<p>Of course, the best way for employers to ensure the safety and security of their employees is to provide adequate leave and time off if employees are sick, and to ensure that everyone has access to adequate testing at regular intervals should they not be able to work remotely.</p>
<p>Like other companies in the market, ReturnSafe offers a symptoms screener, a testing dashboard, a case management dashboard and a new vaccine management service. In addition to those software tools, ReturnSafe pitches a set of wearable devices with built-in social distancing alarms to ensure that employees maintain safe distances. <b><i></i></b></p>
