					<description><![CDATA[Amazon, Microsoft and IBM have each elevated people who ran their cloud divisions to the CEO role.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Amazon announced last week that founder and CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/jeff-bezos-will-no-longer-be-ceo-of-amazon-as-of-later-this-year/">Jeff Bezos planned to step back</a> from overseeing operations and shift into an executive chairman role, it also revealed that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/what-andy-jassys-promotion-to-amazon-ceo-could-mean-for-aws/"> AWS CEO Andy Jassy</a>, head of the company&#8217;s profitable cloud division, would replace him.</p>
<p>As Bessemer partner Byron Deeter <a href="https://twitter.com/bdeeter/status/1356806032836628483?s=20">pointed out on Twitter</a>, Jassy&#8217;s promotion was similar to Satya Nadella&#8217;s ascent at Microsoft: in 2014, he moved from executive VP in charge of Azure <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/04/microsofts-new-ceo-is-officially-satya-nadella/">to the chief exec&#8217;s office</a>. Similarly, Arvind Krishna, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/10/incoming-ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-faces-monumental-challenges-on-multiple-fronts/">who was promoted to replace Ginni Rometti</a> as IBM CEO last year, also was formerly head of the company&#8217;s cloud business.</p>
<p>Could Nadella&#8217;s successful rise serve as a blueprint for Amazon as it makes a similar transition? While there are major differences in the missions of these companies, it&#8217;s inevitable that we will compare these two executives based on their former jobs. It&#8217;s true that they have an awful lot in common, but there are some stark differences, too.</p>
<h2>Replacing a legend</h2>
<p>For starters, Jassy is taking over for someone who founded one of the world&#8217;s biggest corporations. Nadella replaced Steve Ballmer, who had taken over for the company&#8217;s face, Bill Gates. Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, says this notable difference could have a huge impact for Jassy with his founder boss still looking over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of similarity in the two situations, but Satya was a little removed from the founder Gates. Bezos will always hover and be there, whereas Gates (and Ballmer) had retired for good. [ … ] It was clear [they] would not be coming back. [ … ] For Jassy, the owner could [conceivably] come back anytime,&#8221; Mueller said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What Andy Jassy&#8217;s promotion to Amazon CEO could mean for AWS&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/what-andy-jassys-promotion-to-amazon-ceo-could-mean-for-aws/embed/#?secret=u8bfpFR6Gr" data-secret="u8bfpFR6Gr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But Andrew Bartels, an analyst at Forrester Research, says it&#8217;s not a coincidence that both leaders were plucked from the cloud divisions of their respective companies, even if it was seven years apart.</p>
<p>&#8220;In both cases, these hyperscale business units of Microsoft and Amazon were the fastest-growing and best-performing units of the companies. [ … ] In both cases, cloud infrastructure was seen as a platform on top of which and around which other cloud offerings could be developed,&#8221; Bartels said. The companies both believe that the leaders of these two growth engines were best suited to lead the company into the future.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://matefertility.com/">Mate Fertility</a>, the new Los Angeles startup launching today with $2.8 million in financing, has a mission to create a more inclusive network of family planning services for people struggling with the high cost and low availability of fertility clinics around the country.</p>
<p>Founded by serial entrepreneur Oliver Bogner and his brother Gabriel, Mate was born from both brothers&#8217; struggles with trying to start a family. For Oliver, that was when he and his partner were looking at IVF as a way to screen for the BRCA1 gene from her embryos after she found out that she was a carrier. Meanwhile, Gabriel, an IVF baby who is a member of the LGBTQ community, felt that the services for family planning weren&#8217;t always accepting of the gay community.</p>
<p>&#8220;IVF<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and surrogacy were the only options for me to have kids,&#8221; the younger Bogner said. &#8220;And the queer community has been locked out of these services. It became my mission to democratize healthcare for my community.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once Oliver started doing research into the market and discovered that there were only 460 fertility clinics in the U.S. and that over 80% were concentrated in five major metropolitan areas, he knew there was an opportunity for a new business.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111177" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111177" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2111177" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111177" class="wp-caption-text">Mate Fertility co-founders Gabriel and Oliver Bogner. Image Credit: Mate Fertility</p></div></p>
<p>The Bogner brothers enlisted famed reproductive endocrinologist Dr. Jeffrey Steinberg, who trained under the British doctors that pioneered In Vitro Fertilization, to come on board and together the three men launched Mate Fertility.</p>
<p>The co-founders have enlisted an impressive array of financiers to back their business boasting an investor base that includes Andy Dunn, the founder of Bonobos; Peter Pham, the co-founder of the LA-based consumer focused company incubator, Science; Patrick Schwarzenegger; Brian Schwartz; the investors behind Roman, Allbirds, and Caspar, Rosecliff Ventures; Pure Imagination Brands; Mana Ventures, and Maschmeyer Group Ventures.</p>
<p>Mate is launching first in Oklahoma City, where two legacy providers are charging anywhere from 10% to 15% above the national average for family planning services. &#8220;We&#8217;re going in at anywhere from 50% to 60% lower costs than they are,&#8221; said Oliver Bogner.</p>
<p>The company said it would offer egg freezing services for as low as $5,000 and IVF for $8,000, while the national average for IVF cycle costs ranges from $15,000 to $18,000, including medication.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’re still making healthy margins that allow us to operate the business. It’s not a matter fo these procedures costing more. These 460 clinics are allowed to radically mark up the process,&#8221; said the elder Bogner. &#8220;One of these clinics is making approximately 1,000% profit margin on every procedure.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Given the fact that the company estimates roughly 18% of the U.S. population will face some fertility issue, the need for more clinics &#8212; setting aside the lower costs &#8212; would be enormous.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We need 3,000 clinics to properly serve our population, today we have 460. There’s a huge gap in care,&#8221; said Bogner. </span></p>
<p>The company is working with the architects behind Dry Bar, Heitler Houstoun, to design its clinics in an effort to popularize and destigmatize the services.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We were really intrigued by Oliver and Gabe. In terms of what the biggest risks are… you’re not playing around. You’re not creating software, you’re creating life,&#8221; said Adam Struck, the founder of Mate Fertility&#8217;s lead investment firm, Struck Capital. &#8220;The ultimate KPI which is success rate for our patients is top tier. There’s a lot that Nate is doing to ensure that some of the best medical personnel in the world are part of the Mate mission.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>Mate Fertility offers modern EHR platforms, an e-pharmacy, proven protocols, payment assistance and digital patient and provider portals for services that include IVF, genetic screening, egg freezing, surrogacy and LGBTQ family building treatments, the company said.</p>
<p>Its first locations will be clinics in Oklahoma City, Anchorage, Ark., Bakersfield, Calif. Lancaster, Pa., Austin, and Portland.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Although the popular audio chat platform <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">Clubhouse</a> today includes a way to share your upcoming hangouts and events across social media, the resulting link that displays is fairly boring. A new link-sharing tool called <a href="https://clublink.to/">ClubLink</a> can help. The tool allows hosts to better promote their events by offering a more customized social media preview featuring a photo that includes the room name, who&#8217;s attending, the date and time (using the host&#8217;s time zone), and even profile icons of the hosts themselves.</p>
<p>The tool was built by two Germany-based colleagues, online marketer <a href="https://twitter.com/Jens_Polo">Jens Polomski</a> and coder and digital marketer, <a href="https://twitter.com/spekulatius1984">Peter Thaleikis.</a></p>
<p>Polomski says he came up with the idea last month because he kept seeing Clubhouse links shared on Twitter and thought they just didn&#8217;t look that good.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I noticed many people share &#8212; especially on Twitter &#8212; because Clubhouse has this built-in sharing feature,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But the preview image is not well-optimized and lacks any relevant information.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polomski reached out to Thaleikis and convinced him to help build a better version.</p>
<p>Their resulting <a href="https://clublink.to/">ClubLink</a> tool is simple to use. You just paste in your Clubhouse event link on the ClubLink website, and it automatically generates the ClubLink you can use. It&#8217;s a similar process as to how URL shorteners like tinyurl.com work, for example.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111124" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111124" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2111124" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="496" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg 2186w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg?resize=300,219 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg?resize=768,560 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg?resize=680,496 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1120 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1493 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111124" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ClubLink</p></div></p>
<p>In ClubLink&#8217;s case, though, it&#8217;s doing a bit more than just returning a shorter URL. The tool visits the Clubhouse link provided and takes a screenshot to help create the image &#8212; but it&#8217;s not scraping data from Clubhouse, Polomski says. The tool also renames the image file it creates to include the host&#8217;s name for better discoverability and, perhaps, for better search engine optimization in the future.</p>
<p>In fact, the SEO aspects of the ClubLink URLs were considered when the tool was built, given its creators have digital marketing backgrounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re taking care that the technical SEO background from the links are as good as possible &#8212; and that&#8217;s something Clubhouse, right now, didn&#8217;t do,&#8221; notes Polomski. However, he notes that it&#8217;s too soon to tell how well those efforts have paid off, as the first ClubLink URLs were just launched last week and only a few have been indexed by Google so far.</p>
<p>After you&#8217;ve created the link on the ClubLink website, you&#8217;re directed to a page where you have the option to immediately share it out to Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Being able to publicize your rooms in advance is a important way to build a following on the audio-based social network, so likely many hosts will begin to put this new tool to use in the days ahead.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one example of a ClubLink in action:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Of course, sharing a link while you&#8217;re in a room is useful too &#8212; especially if you&#8217;ve landed in a great room you think others should know about. Clubhouse, in its most recent update, noted that you&#8217;re now able to click the &#8220;+&#8221; sign while in room to get a link that you can post to social media. Unfortunately, these &#8220;room&#8221; links don&#8217;t work yet in the ClubLink tool, but the team said they&#8217;re already discussing a solution for that.</p>
<p>ClubLink is one of now several small tools that&#8217;s popped up in recent days to offer expanded functionality and new features for Clubhouse power users.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also come across the Clubhouse Bio Creator at <a href="https://clubhousebio.xyz/">clubhousebio.xyz</a>, which helps people perfect their profile bio on the desktop then copy it over to Clubhouse on their phone. Other popular tools help users make their profile picture stand out, like <a href="https://www.clubhouseglow.com/">Clubhouse Glow</a>, <a href="https://avatar.lvwzhen.com/">Clubhouse Avatar Maker,</a> and <a href="https://www.thriveepic.com/clubhouse">Thriveepic</a>&#8216;s Canva template.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Last year, in the midst of a particularly spiky U.S. presidential election campaign, a startup called <a href="http://sentropy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sentropy</a> emerged <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/sentropy-emerges-from-stealth-with-an-ai-platform-to-tackle-online-abuse-backed-by-13m-from-initialized-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from stealth with an AI-based platform</a> aimed at social media and other companies that corralled people together for online conversation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sentropy had built a set of algorithms, using natural language processing and machine learning, to help these platforms detect when abusive language, harassing tendencies and other harmful content was coming around the bend, and to act on those situations before they became an issue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Today, the startup is unveiling a new product, now aimed at consumers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Using the same technology that it originally built for its enterprise platform, <a href="https://protect.sentropy.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sentropy Protect</a> is a free consumer product that detects harmful content on a person&#8217;s social media feed and, by way of a dashboard, lets a person have better control over how that content and the people producing it are handled.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Starting initially with Twitter, the plan is to add more social feeds over time, based initially on which services provide APIs to let Sentropy integrate with them (not all do.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sentropy CEO John Redgrave said the consumer product launch is not a pivot but an expansion of what the company is building.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The idea is that Sentropy will continue to work with enterprise customers &#8212; its two products in that department are called <span class="il">Sentropy</span> Detect, which provides API-based access to its abuse detection technologies; and <span class="il">Sentropy</span> Defend, a browser-based interface that enables end-to-end moderation workflows for moderators.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But at the same time, the Protect consumer product will give people an added option &#8212; whether or not Sentropy is being used by a particular platform &#8212; to take the reins and have more hands-on control over their harassment graph, as it were.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We always had deep conviction of going after the enterprise as a start, but Sentropy is about more than that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Cyber safety has to have both enterprise and consumer components.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&#8217;s refreshing to hear about startups building services that potentially affect millions of people also being cognizant of how individuals themselves want to keep an element of self-determination in the equation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&#8217;s not just, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s your choice if you use service X or not,&#8221; but a grasp of the concept that when someone chooses to use a service, especially a popular one, there should be and can be more than just a hope that the platform will always be looking out for that user&#8217;s best interests, by providing tools to help the user do that, too.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And it&#8217;s not a problem that is going away, and that goes not just for the hottest platforms today, which are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/tiktok-expands-community-guidelines-rolls-out-new-well-being-focused-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">continuing to look for ways to handle complex content</a> &#8212; but also on emerging platforms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The recent popularity of Clubhouse, for example, highlights not just new frontiers in social platforms, but how, for example, those new models &#8212; with Clubhouse based on &#8220;rooms&#8221; for conversations and a reliance on audio rather than written text for interactions &#8212; are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-26/as-tech-darling-clubhouse-grows-so-does-scrutiny" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">handling issues of harassment and abuse</a>. Some striking examples so far point to the problem being one that definitely needs addressing before it grows any bigger.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Protect is free to use today, and Redgrave said that Sentropy is still working on deciding how and if it will charge for it. One likely scenario will be that Protect might come in freemium tiers: a free and limited product for individuals with &#8220;pro&#8221; services featuring enhanced tools, and perhaps a tier for companies who are managing accounts on behalf of one or several high-profile individuals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Of course, services like Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, YouTube and many others have made a big point over the years &#8212; and especially recently &#8212; to put in more rules, moderators and automated algorithms to help identify and stop abusive content in its tracks, and to help users report and stop content before it gets to them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But if you are one of the people who gets targeted regularly, or even occasionally, you know that this is often not enough. Sentropy Protect seems to be built with that mindset in mind, too.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Indeed, Redgrave said that even though the company had consumers on its roadmap all along, its strategy was accelerated after the launch of its enterprise product last year in June. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We started getting pinged by people saying, &#8216;I get abused online. How can I get access to your technology?'&#8221; He recalled that the company realized that the problem was at once bigger and more granular than Sentropy could fix simply by working its way through a list of companies, hoping to win them over as customers, and then successfully integrating its product.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We had a hard decision to make then,&#8221; he recalled. &#8220;Do we spend 100% of our time focused on enterprises, or do we take a portion of our team and start to build out something for consumers, too?&#8221; It decided to take the latter route.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the enterprise side, Sentropy is continuing to work with social networks and other kinds of companies that host interactions between people &#8212; for example, message boards connected to gaming experiences or dating apps. It&#8217;s not publicly disclosing any customer names at the moment, but Redgrave describes them as primarily smaller, fast-growing businesses, as opposed to larger and more legacy platforms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sentropy&#8217;s VP of product, Dev Bala &#8212; who has previously been an academic, and also worked at Facebook, Google and Microsoft &#8212; explained that bigger, legacy platforms are not outside of Sentropy&#8217;s remit. But more often than not, they are working on bigger trust and safety strategies and have small armies of engineers in-house working on building products.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While larger social networks do bring in third-party technology for certain aspects of their services, those deals will typically take longer to close, even in urgent cases such as around working with online abuse.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;I think abuse and harassment are rapidly evolving to be an existential challenge for the likes of Facebook, Reddit, YouTube and the rest,&#8221; Bala said. &#8220;These companies will have a 10,000 person organization thinking <em>just</em> about trust and safety, and the world is seeing the ills of not doing that. What&#8217;s not as obvious to people on the outside is that they are also taking a portfolio approach, with armies of moderators and a portfolio of technology. Not all is built in-house.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We believe there is value from Sentropy for these bigger guys but also know there are a lot of optics around companies using products like ours. So we see the opportunities of going earlier, in cases where the company in question is not a Facebook, and having a less sophisticated approach.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a sign of the changing tides and sentiment in the market. It seems that the tackling of abuse and content is starting to get taken seriously as a business concept. And so Sentropy is not the only company tackling this opportunity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Two other startups &#8212; one called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/spectrum-labs-raises-10m-for-its-ai-based-platform-to-combat-online-toxicity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectrum Labs</a>, and another called <a href="https://l1ght.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">L1ght</a> — have also built a set of AI-based tools aimed at various platforms where conversations are happening to help those platforms detect and better moderate instances of toxicity, harassment and abuse.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spectrum Labs raises $10M for its AI-based platform to combat online toxicity&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/spectrum-labs-raises-10m-for-its-ai-based-platform-to-combat-online-toxicity/embed/#?secret=X9piSctN3D" data-secret="X9piSctN3D" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p dir="ltr">Another, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/block-party-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Block Party</a>, is also looking to work across different social platforms to give users more control over how toxicity touches them, and has, like Sentropy, focused first on Twitter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With Protect, after content is detected and flagged, users can set up wider, permanent blocks against specific users (who can also be muted through Protect) or themes, manage filtered words, and monitor content that gets automatically flagged for being potentially abusive, in case you want to override the flags and create &#8220;trusted&#8221; users. Tweets get labelled when they are snagged by Sentropy by the type of abuse (for example, threat of physical violence, sexual aggression or identity attacks).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since it&#8217;s based on a machine-learning platform, Sentropy then takes all of those signals, including the tweets that have been flagged and uses them to teach Protect to identify future content along those same lines. The platform is also monitoring chatter on other platforms all the time, and that too feeds into what it looks for and moderates.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you&#8217;re familiar with Twitter&#8217;s own abuse protection, you&#8217;ll know that all this takes the situation several steps further than the controls Twitter itself provides.</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">This is still a version one though. Right now, you don&#8217;t see your full timeline through Protect, so essentially it means that you toggle between Protect and whatever Twitter client you are using. Some might find that onerous, although on the other hand Bala noted that a sign of Sentropy&#8217;s success is that people will actually let it work in the background and you won&#8217;t feel the need to constantly check in.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Redgrave also noted that the service is still exploring how to add in other features, such as the ability to also filter direct messages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Audi revealed Tuesday the 2022 e-tron Quattro GT and its higher-performing sibling the RS e-tron GT — flagships of the German automaker&#8217;s growing electric vehicle portfolio and its first departure from the crossovers and SUVs that have so far dominated the lineup.</p>
<p>The Audi e-tron GT and RS are the third and fourth all-electric vehicles in the company&#8217;s U.S. portfolio, followed by the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/17/the-audi-e-tron-suv-is-an-electric-shot-at-tesla/">e-tron SUV</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/audis-next-all-electric-vehicle-the-e-tron-sportback-is-a-coupe-suv/">e-tron Sportback</a> that debuted in 2019. The Audi Q4 e-tron — another SUV — will be the automaker&#8217;s fifth electric vehicle. All of these e-tron models are part of Audi&#8217;s plan to launch more than 30 electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids by 2025.</p>
<p>&#8220;This car is a new, very progressive interpretation of the classical GT,&#8221; <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">Marc Lichte, head of Audi design, said in Tuesday&#8217;s presentation.</span> &#8220;That means proportions like a super sports car, and the usability of a real four seater. And that&#8217;s something completely new.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2111035" style="width: 4971px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111035" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2111035 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg" alt="audi gt" width="4961" height="3310" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg 4961w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4961px) 100vw, 4961px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2111035" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: Audi</strong></p></div></p>
<p>The e-tron GT, which goes into production this spring and will hit the U.S. market this summer, packs in the performance and luxury in its sporty package. The base e-tron GT has two motors that produce the equivalent of 469 horsepower — or 522 hp with &#8220;overboost&#8221; — and can travel an estimated 238 miles on the 93.4-kilowatt battery. Under the European WLTP standard, the e-tron GT range is 298 miles.</p>
<p>The RS e-tron has the same front motor as the entry-level GT, but has a more powerful rear motor. Together, the motors can produce 590 horsepower and up to 637 horsepower with overboost. As a result, the RS e-tron GT can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.1 seconds and has a 155 mph top track speed, the company said. The RS has an estimated EPA range of 232 miles.</p>
<p>The company has yet to receive an official EPA estimate for either variant.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The vehicles also have an 800-volt electrical architecture — the same that is in the Porsche Taycan. That architecture allows the e-tron GT, like the Taycan, to replenish its battery from 5% to 80% in 22.5 minutes, one of the quickest charging rates in the industry. </span></p>
<p>The e-tron GT shares more than just the <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">800-volt electrical architecture with Porsche. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Audi and Porsche, which are both </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">VW Group companies, </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">co-developed the e-tron GT and the Taycan. The two vehicles also have the same chassis and J1 EV battery platform. </span></p>
<p>Inside, the e-tron GT comes standard with a 12.3-inch Audi virtual cockpit digital instrument cluster and a central 10.1-inch touchscreen, where drivers can control music, navigation and other controls as well as electric vehicle-specific features such as searching for charging stations. Owners can opt for an upgrade and add a head-up display as well.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111042" style="width: 4971px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt-.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111042" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2111042 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt-.jpg" alt="audi etron gt" width="4961" height="3243" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt-.jpg 4961w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt-.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt-.jpg?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt-.jpg?resize=768,502 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt-.jpg?resize=680,445 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt-.jpg?resize=1536,1004 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt-.jpg?resize=2048,1339 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt-.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4961px) 100vw, 4961px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2111042" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Audi</p></div></p>
<p>The vehicle also comes standard in a leather-free interior featuring recycled materials including an artificial suede called Dinamica, although a Nappa leather option is also available as an upgrade.</p>
<p>All of this performance and luxury comes at a price. The base model of the e-tron GT quattro starts at $99,900, followed by a higher trim level priced at $107,100. The RS e-tron GT starts at $139,900. Those prices push even higher for those that opt for the additional features, notably the company&#8217;s Matrix LED headlights, which are only available in Europe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aerion has been working on ushering in a new era of commercial supersonic flight for nearly a decade now, and the company just revealed that it has signed a new partnership with NASA to put that experience to use in the pursuit of supersonic point-to-point travel &#8212; the technical name for putting to use the kind of high-speed flight typically associated with space launches for helping people move very quickly from one place on Earth to another.</p>
<p>The new collaboration comes via the Space Act Agreement, which basically allows NASA to enlist the aid of private companies to help it achieve its various goals. NASA has been developing high-Mach, supersonic aircraft technologies for some time now, in particular through its arrangement with Lockheed Martin to build and fly the X-59 QueSST, a demonstrator aircraft that will show how supersonic craft can also operate relatively quietly, with so-called &#8220;low-boom&#8221; capabilities that avoid the loud sonic booms produced by most supersonic vehicles when they break the sound barrier.</p>
<p>NASA announced a similar partnership under the Space Act Agreement with Virgin Galactic last year, with the goal of helping the agency develop technologies that will assist in the eventual deployment of sustainable supersonic commercial flight. Aerion&#8217;s team-up with the agency will focus specifically on studying commercial flight capabilities in speeds ranging between Mach 3 and Mach 5, with a focus on propulsion and thermal management systems, power generation and technologies for use in the passenger and crew cabins.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Aerion&#8217;s own high-speed commercial aviation efforts are currently on track to see its AS2 private jet for business customers enter production in 2023, which will set the stage for its AS3 commercial supersonic passenger aircraft to follow after that.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t Aerion&#8217;s first team-up with NASA: The two have collaborated twice previously on similar projects, with the first collaboration begun way back in 2012. Now that Aerion&#8217;s closer to actual production, it&#8217;s likely that both partners will gain a lot toward their mutual goals of helping the U.S. develop commercially viable and sustainable supersonic passenger flight technologies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a popular misconception that the cryptocurrency industry is a realm of rogue tech-bro cowboys. But the reality is many of the most ambitious entrepreneurs in fintech are betting big on institutional bitcoin adoption. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is the case with Lebanese-American venture capitalist Soona Amhaz of Volt Capital, whom </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/soona-amhaz/?sh=d61d1ae1bd2f"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently listed as one of the most influential people in Silicon Valley. She discovered bitcoin through Reddit, back when she was an engineering student at the University of Michigan. Now her firm has invested in 11 crypto startups and is working alongside institutional players like TD Ameritrade, Cumberland and CMT Digital as part of the </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/chicagos-trading-firms-look-to-defi-with-new-alliance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago DeFi Alliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CDA). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where institutions are at now is they&#8217;re looking to back quality founders in the space early on. They&#8217;re looking to be market makers for a lot of these [crypto] projects, and they&#8217;re looking to help with integrations and partnerships between decentralized finance [DeFi] projects and more established financial firms,” Amhaz said. “They see where the puck is going and the smart ones are getting ahead of the curve.” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to “DeFi,” Amhaz said the term includes bitcoin and the variety of </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/defi-aims-to-bridge-the-gap-between-blockchains-and-financial-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain-based systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gaining popularity among day traders during the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specific DeFi projects that are gaining more traction now include automated market makers (AMMs), stablecoins and platforms for decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregation, lending and derivatives,” Amhaz said. “Recent DeFi projects simply offer more avenues to use bitcoin as a productive asset, not just a reserve asset.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until now, most institutions have preferred indirect exposure to cryptocurrency. Goldman Sachs alum </span><a href="https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/juthica-chou-on-the-first-physically-settled-bitcoin-futures"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juthica Chou</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who co-founded the derivatives exchange LedgerX back in 2013, pioneered the physically settled bitcoin futures that are now mainstay offerings among firms like </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bakkt-goes-live-with-options-cash-settled-futures-products"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bakkt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/education/bitcoin/cme-bitcoin-futures-frequently-asked-questions.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CME Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Futures contracts and bitcoin options offer a way for institutions to bet on the price of bitcoin without actually owning bitcoin directly. A cash-settled product means the buyer is paid in dollars, such as getting $10,000 when the option to buy at $10,000 expires, instead of getting paid in bitcoin. Rumor has it the asset management giant</span><a href="https://decrypt.co/54787/blockrock-to-start-cash-settled-bitcoin-futures-trading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> BlackRock</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will soon become the next player offering bitcoin futures products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, many institutions are willing to forgo some profits in exchange for lower risk. One of the most popular institutional product providers, </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1588489/000156459021001769/gbtc-8k_20210115.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, reportedly saw $1.2 billion in fresh investor funds in January 2021. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m still bullish on options and derivatives,” Chou said, adding there’s enough demand from institutions for trust shares like GBTC, bitcoin options and even prospective exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to all generate substantial wealth in 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The environment has way more infrastructure than we had back in 2013,” Chou said. “There’s security infrastructure and best practices for custodians, auditing infrastructure &#8230; banking is another great example. Compared to 2013, the difference between where we were and where we are today is night and day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With regards to GBTC, in particular, insatiable demand for shares with lower risks than custodying bitcoin leads to </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2020/08/30/grayscale-the-worlds-largest-bitcoin-and-crypto-asset-manager-has-a-massive-premium-problem/?sh=35f6e26d46a2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sky-high premiums</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sometimes up to </span><a href="https://www.thestreet.com/etffocus/market-intelligence/osprey-bitcoin-trust-gbtc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">100% </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">more expensive than buying cryptocurrency directly. That’s why Valkyrie CEO Leah Wald launched her own Texas-based asset management firm in 2020. According to </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-to-female-founders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crunchbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she was one of roughly 800 women founders who raised capital last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was really difficult to raise during a pandemic&#8230; not being able to organically expand my network,” Wald said. “I couldn’t have a meeting with someone even if I wanted to. And so much of seed investing is trusting in the team; trust built through high-quality, in-person conversations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet by January 2021, her startup had raised an undisclosed seed round from angel investors like Coinbase alum Charlie Lee, then applied to the </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1841175/000138713121001118/valkyrie-s1_012221.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Securities and Exchange Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for permission to launch a bitcoin ETF. Chou said such a bitcoin ETF would boost the whole ecosystem because it would “open access for people who are already users brokers or securities services.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/more-bitcoin-futures-etf-proposals-withdrawn-after-sec-pushback"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETF proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been rejected over the years, starting with a proposal by </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7938cc88-911e-11e8-b639-7680cedcc421"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2013. However, Wald says now she believes there’s never been better timing for an ETF to get approved. Among futures and options, trust shares and ETFs, all these products have different regulatory shapes that allow them to be redeemed faster, or traded in different ways, than the underlying asset, bitcoin, could be at-scale. Generally speaking, institutions seek indirect ways to gain exposure to these nascent, and often lucrative, crypto markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bitcoin’s market cap has grown large enough that it may have finally surpassed an important threshold in the minds of the regulators,” Wald said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe the biggest reason the regulators were nervous about approving a bitcoin ETF in 2017 was concerns around custodial solutions and security. And I agree with that. We’re much closer to better security and custody now with institutional-grade options.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wald added that both Valkyrie&#8217;s bitcoin trust shares and prospective ETF are structured to reduce volatility and premiums.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We wanted to create a more transparent product. I wanted our product to trade closer to the net asset value [NAV],” Wald said. “We’re the only bitcoin trust launching an ETF fund so everyday investors can buy exposure to bitcoin.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This propensity among women entrepreneurs using cryptocurrency isn’t restricted to American tech bubbles. According to Toya Zhang, head of marketing at the Hong Kong-based crypto and futures exchange </span><a href="https://www.aax.com/en-US/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AAX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, women make up 25% of her platform’s users and a third of the top users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our biggest market is in Russia. Other than Russia, our biggest markets are Hong Kong, Korea, Indonesia and India,” Zhang said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asian women are more often the one to take care of finances. If you look at stock investment user groups in China and Hong Kong, women are more than half of them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The highly specialized crypto landscape is quickly gaining diversity, compared to other financial sectors. At India’s Coinswitch.co exchange, women reportedly make up </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/why-bitcoin-bulls-are-betting-on-explosive-growth-in-india"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50% of around 25,000 users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, depending on the specific region. Women also make up at least </span><a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/gemini-survey-finds-over-40-of-uk-crypto-investors-are-women-2021-01-29"><span style="font-weight: 400;">40%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of British cryptocurrency users, according to a survey by the crypto exchange </span><a href="https://www.gemini.com/state-of-uk-crypto"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gemini</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across borders, the clear gender disparity may be associated with net worth rather than any lack of interest. In 2018, the World Bank estimated women only held </span><a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/gender/publication/unrealized-potential-the-high-cost-of-gender-inequality-in-earnings"><span style="font-weight: 400;">38%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of capital wealth. Plus, Crunchbase tallied just </span><a href="https://about.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Funding-To-Female-Founders_Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15,379 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">companies, less than 20% of startups that raised capital, that had women founders from 2009-2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond startups, there are also several companies like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the New York Digital Investments Group (NYDIG), where women executives took the helm in order to innovate on established brokerage models.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December 2020, the insurance company </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-10/169-year-old-insurer-massmutual-invests-100-million-in-bitcoin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> purchased $100 million in bitcoin and acquired NYDIG equity, a move that signaled a bullish outlook on institutional demand for bitcoin exposure in 2021. Then, on February 8, 2021, Elon Musk’s publicly traded car company Tesla validated the institutional thesis by buying </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1-5b-in-bitcoin-may-accept-the-cryptocurrency-as-payment-in-the-future/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.5 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worth of bitcoin. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In 2021, the greater acceptance of bitcoin by traditional investors and allocators is really exciting,” said NYDIG president Yan Zhao. “We’ll give banks and wealth managers the ability to offer bitcoin products and exposure. We’ll handle the back end.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zhao said her bitcoin-focused firm has roughly $4 billion under management, including derivatives, and is currently courting prospective clients like private banks and various asset managers. Her firm is open to exploring ideas like a bitcoin ETF or trust shares, she said, but isn’t interested in Ethereum-based DeFi products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve made a conscious decision to focus on bitcoin,” Zhao said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, Chou was skeptical about many of the Ethereum-based DeFi options available today, while remaining cautiously optimistic about the future of DeFi derivative options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Crypto-native products are important because that’s how you can really harness the power of not having centralized authorities involved to facilitate the transaction,” Chou said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, now traditional options offer indirect access to cryptocurrency gains. At the same time, cryptocurrency itself is experimentally being used to offer comparable, yet more accessible, financial products. These DeFi products are designed for new functionality, not just price exposure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile in California, from network scaling crusader Elizabeth Stark, CEO of </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/15/lightning-labs-just-raised-millions-from-jack-dorsey-and-others-to-supercharge-blockchain-transactions/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE5w4MrN3UQLWMn8PlG-ApRxDhOCX3C1snTwHUUrBsAezZq31nU8quwq43TqAuWgdHM9q9XITBzxypKIs-Cmnp_K0iF8JAMH3O3PWEu4GTQizdJwpiHMhCmFq0Rx-AIL0WmBh4gmUSH12VdCaRP_m0k-SnmfTZ6yQzi9WH67XdaO"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightning Labs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to Amhaz at Volt Capital, the next generation of bitcoin whales may look remarkably different from Silicon Valley’s past unicorn-building bros. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The face of our industry looks different than how the tech industry looked in the early 90s or how finance has looked since forever,” Amhaz said. “We&#8217;re starting at a higher, more informed baseline. So, although there&#8217;s still work to be done here, I&#8217;m optimistic.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Oldsmar is a small town in Florida that became the center of the cyber world this week when a hacker broke into its drinking water supply and tried to poison it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the nightmare scenario that the security community has warned for years, one that could kill thousands by targeting the critical infrastructure that we all rely on. The hacker gained access to a computer at the water facility used for running remote control software TeamViewer, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-florida-idUSKBN2A82FV">according to Reuters</a>, and jacked up the levels of sodium hydroxide, aka lye, which would have made the water highly toxic to drink.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not known what security was in place to prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to the critical system. Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said in <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/pinellas/2021/02/08/someone-tried-to-poison-oldsmars-water-supply-during-hack-sheriff-says/">a press conference</a> that there were fail-safes and alarms in place to prevent tainted water from reaching residents, and as a result there was little risk to the population of some 15,000 residents.</p>
<p>But suffice to say, running remote control software in a facility that controls the local water supply is a disaster waiting to happen. These networks are supposed to be isolated from the internet to prevent this exact scenario. But you can look for clues in this <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-florida-idUSKBN2A82FV">Reuters report</a>: The water facility is a public utility owned by the town and has its own internal IT staff.</p>
<p>Gualtieri, in his remarks, said: &#8220;The important thing is to put everyone on notice.&#8221; He&#8217;s not kidding; it&#8217;s a similar picture to a lot of small-town America, where much of these facilities are under-resourced and underfunded. Robert Lee, founder and chief executive at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/dragos-series-c-industrial-systems-security/">industrial security startup Dragos</a>, set the context:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hiring, workforce development, culture shifts, working within national priorities and regulations, state and local regulations, resourcing other areas that are organizational challenges, modernizing infrastructure beyond &quot;cyber&quot;, etc. There&#39;s not 1 easy answer tech or not</p>
<p>&mdash; Robert M. Lee (@RobertMLee) <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertMLee/status/1358882431516999682?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The FBI confirmed it has been called in to investigate. But what&#8217;s unlikely to change any time soon is that small towns are underfunded and <a href="https://twitter.com/hacks4pancakes/status/1358877332988166147">don&#8217;t get the resources</a> that other critical infrastructure gets. In the end, a TeamViewer subscription will be cheaper than a person&#8217;s salary, and there is no greater incentive to cut costs than during a pandemic.</p>

<p>As COVID-19 vaccines begin to roll out, ransomware actors are hitting back. NBC News this week revealed two hospitals that were hit by data-stealing ransomware. After the hospitals <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/hackers-post-detailed-patient-medical-records-two-hospitals-dark-web-n1256887">refused to pay</a> the ransom, the hackers started to publish highly sensitive health and medical data stolen from the hospital networks.</p>

<p>McGinniss&#8217; company is aiming to boost renewable energy adoption and slash energy usage in the built environment by creating a service that operates on both sides of the energy marketplace.</p>
<p>The company combines energy management services for commercial buildings through the software it has developed with the ability to sell energy directly to customers in an effort to reduce the energy consumption and the attendant carbon footprint of the built environment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s software, Mycor, leverages building demand data and the assets that the building has at its disposal to shift user energy consumption to the times when renewable power is most available, and cheapest. </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a novel approach to an old idea of creating environmental benefits by reducing energy consumption. Using its technology, David Energy tracks both the market price of energy and the energy usage by the buildings it manages. The company sells energy to customers at a fixed price and then uses its windows into energy markets and energy demand to make money off the difference in power pricing.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why the company needed to raise $15 million in a monthly revolving credit facility from Hartree Partners. So it could pay for the power its customers have bought upfront.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2039325" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2039325" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2039325" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-182061540.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-182061540.jpg 6800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-182061540.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-182061540.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-182061540.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-182061540.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-182061540.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-182061540.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-182061540.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2039325" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>There are a number of tailwinds supporting the growth of a business like David Energy right now. Given the massive amounts of money that are being earmarked for energy conservation and energy efficiency upgrades, companies like David, which promise to manage energy consumption to reduce demand, are going to be huge beneficiaries.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Looking at the macro shift and the attention being paid to things like battery storage and micro grids we do feel like we’re launching this at the perfect time,&#8221; said McGinniss. &#8220;We&#8217;re</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offering [customers] market rates and then rebating the savings back to them. They’re getting the software with a market energy supply contract and they are getting the savings back. B</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ringing that whole bundled package together really brings it all together.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>In addition to the credit facility, the company also raised $4.1 million in venture financing from investors <span style="font-weight: 400;">led by Equal Ventures and including Operator Partners, Box Group, Greycroft, Sandeep Jain and Xuan Yong of RigUp, returning angel investor Kiran Bhatraju of Arcadia and Jason Jacobs’ recently launched My Climate Journey Collective, an early-stage climate tech fund. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Renewable energy generators are fundamentally different in their variable, distributed, and digitally-native nature compared to their fossil fuel predecessors while customer loads like heating and driving are shifting to electricity consumption from gas. The sands of market power are shifting and incumbents are poorly-positioned to adapt to evolving customer needs, so there’s a massive opportunity for us to capitalize.” </span></p>
<p>Founded by McGinniss, Brian Maxwell and Ahmed Salman, David Energy raised $1.5 million in pre-seed financing back in March 2020.</p>
<p>As the company expands, its relationship with Hartree, an energy and commodities trading desk, will become even more important. As the startup noted, Hartree is the gateway that David needs to transact with energy markets. The trader provides a balance sheet for working capital to purchase energy on behalf of David&#8217;s customers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Renewables are causing fundamental shifts in energy markets, and new models and tools need to emerge,” said Dinkar Bhatia, co-head of North American Power at Hartree Partners. “James and the team have identified a significant opportunity in the market and have the right strategy to execute. Hartree is excited to be a commodity partner with David Energy on the launch of the new smart retail platform and is looking forward to helping make DE Supply the premier retailer in the market<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">,&#8221; said McGinniss.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David now has</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> retail electricity licenses in New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts and is looking to expand around the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;David Energy stands to reinvent the way that hundreds of billions of dollars a year in energy are consumed,&#8221; said Equal Ventures investor Rick Zullo. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business model creativity and finding ways to change user behavior with new models is just as important if not more important than the technology innovation itself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Zullo said his firm pitched David Energy on leading the round after years of looking for a commercial renewable energy startup. The core insight was finding a service that could appeal not to the new construction that already is working with top-of-the-line energy management systems, but with the millions of square feet that aren&#8217;t adopting the latest and greatest energy management systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finding something that will go and bring this to the mass market was something we had been on the hunt for really since the inception of Equal Ventures,&#8221; said Zullo.</p>
<p>The innovation that made David attractive was the business model. &#8220;There is a landscape of hundreds of dead companies,&#8221; Zullo said. &#8220;What they did was find a way to subsidize the service. They give away at low or no cost and move that in with line items. The partnership with Partree gives them the opportunity to be the cheapest and also the best for you and the highest margin regional energy provider in the market.&#8221;</p>

<h1>AGENDA</h1>
<h2>Wednesday, March 3</h2>
<p><strong>State of the Union with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Parul Koul (Google)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Grace Reckers (Office and Professional Employees International Union)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Clarissa Redwine (NYU)</a></strong></p>
<p>Labor unions have been fairly uncommon in tech. That’s finally starting to change in recent years, as workers have pushed to organize at some the industry’s biggest companies, from Alphabet to Kickstarter. Parul Koul (Google), Grace Reckers (Office and Professional Employees International Union) and Clarissa Redwine (NYU) will join us to discuss the growing movement.</p>
<p><strong>Finding the Next Unicorn with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Arlan Hamilton (Backstage Capital)</a></strong></p>
<p>Arlan Hamilton, the founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, has raised more than $12 million to back 150 companies led by underrepresented founders. In this session, Hamilton will discuss how she vets the biggest opportunities in investment, and how to disrupt in a positive way.</p>
<p><strong>The Path Forward for Essential Tech Workers with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Vanessa Bain (Gig Workers Collective)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Jessica E. Martinez (National Council for Occupational Safety and Health)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Christian Smalls (The Congress of Essential Workers)</a></strong></p>
<p>Gig workers and warehouse workers have become essential in a pandemic-ravaged economy. In California, a law went into effect earlier this year that makes gig workers independent contractors. Meanwhile, Amazon warehouse workers in Alabama are actively seeking to form a union to ensure better protections at the workplace. You’ll hear from workers and organizers about what’s next for gig workers and tech’s contractor workforce, and what battles lie ahead for these essential workers.</p>
<p><b>Identifying and Dismantling Tech&#8217;s Deep Systems of Bias with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Haben Girma (Disability Justice Lawyer)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Mutale Nkonde (AI for the People)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Safiya Umoja Noble (UCLA)</a></b></p>
<p>Nearly every popular technology or service has within it systems of bias or exclusion, ignored by the privileged but obvious to the groups affected. How should these systems be exposed and documented, and how can we set about eliminating them and preventing more from appearing in the future? AI for the People&#8217;s Mutale Nkonde, disability rights lawyer Haben Girma and author of &#8220;Algorithms of Oppression&#8221; Safiya Umoja Noble discuss a more inclusive future.</p>
<p><b>Founders in Focus with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Tracy Chou (Block Party)</a></b></p>
<p>We sit down with the founders poised to be the next big disruptors in this industry. Here we chat with Tracy Chou of Block Party, which works to protect people from abuse and harassment online.</p>
<p><b>The Role of Online Hate and Where Social Media Goes from Here with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Naj Austin (Somewhere Good and Ethel&#8217;s Club)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Jesse Lehrich (Accountable Tech)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Rashad Robinson (Color of Change)</a></b></p>
<p>Toxic culture, deadly conspiracies and organized hate have exploded online in recent years. We’ll discuss how much responsibility social networks have in the rise of these phenomena and how to build healthy online communities that make society better, not worse.</p>
<p><strong>Networking Break</strong></p>
<p>With our virtual platform, attendees can network via video chat, giving folks the chance to make meaningful connections. CrunchMatch, our algorithmic matching product, will be available to ensure you’re meeting the right people at the show, as well as random matching for attendees who are feeling more adventurous.</p>
<p><b>Demystifying First-Check Fundraising with First-Check Investors with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Brian Brackeen (Lightship Capital)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Astrid Scholz (Zebras Unite)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Sydney Thomas (Precursor Ventures) </a></b></p>
<p>There are so many ways to finance your startup that don’t include Y combinator or a traditional fund. In this stacked panel, founders will hear from a trio of decision-makers about how to leverage unconventional communities and resources to get the first dollars they need to execute.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting of the Minds with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Wade Davis (Netflix)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Bo Young Lee (Uber)</a></strong></p>
<p>Diversity and inclusion as an idea has been on the agenda of tech companies for years now. But the industry still lacks true inclusion, despite best efforts put forth by heads of diversity, equity and inclusion at these companies. We’ll seek to better understand what’s standing in the way of progress and what it’s going to take to achieve real change.</p>
<p><b>Access All Areas: Designing Accessibility from Day One with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Cynthia Bennett (Carnegie Mellon University)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Srin Madipalli (formerly of Accomable and Airbnb)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Mara Mills (NYU)</a></b></p>
<p>The session will examine the importance of ensuring accessible product design from the beginning. We’ll ask how the social and medical models of disability influence technological evolution. Integrating the expertise of disabled technologists, makers, investors, scientists, software engineers into the DNA of your company from the very beginning is vital to the pursuit of a functioning and equitable society. And could mean you don’t leave money on the table.</p>
<p><b>Creating New Opportunities for Formerly Incarcerated People with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Jason Jones (The Last Mile)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Deepti Rohatgi (Slack)</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">and Aly Tamboura (Chan Zuckerberg Initiative)</a></b></p>
<p>Reentering society after having been incarcerated presents challenges few of us can understand. In this panel, we will examine the role tech can play in ensuring pathways to employment for returned citizens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">LiveRamp has <a href="https://liveramp.com/blog/liveramp-to-acquire-datafleets/">acquired DataFleets</a>, a fresh young startup that made it possible to take advantage of large volumes of encrypted data without the risk or fuss of decrypting or transferring it. LiveRamp, an enterprise data connectivity platform itself, paid more than $68 million for the company, a huge multiple on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/datafleets-keeps-private-data-useful-and-useful-data-private-with-federated-learning-and-4-5m-seed/">DataFleet&#8217;s $4.5 million seed</a> announced just last fall.</p>
<p>DataFleets saw the increasing need for sensitive data like medical or financial records to be analyzed or used to train machine learning models. Not only are such databases bulky and complex, making transfers difficult, but allowing them to be decrypted and used elsewhere opens the door to errors, abuse and hacks.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9VGpg8YGNe"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/datafleets-keeps-private-data-useful-and-useful-data-private-with-federated-learning-and-4-5m-seed/">DataFleets keeps private data useful and useful data private with federated learning and $4.5M seed</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DataFleets keeps private data useful and useful data private with federated learning and $4.5M seed&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/datafleets-keeps-private-data-useful-and-useful-data-private-with-federated-learning-and-4-5m-seed/embed/#?secret=9VGpg8YGNe" data-secret="9VGpg8YGNe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s solution was essentially to have software on both sides of the equation, the data provider (perhaps a hospital or bank) and the client (an analyst or AI developer), and act as a secure go-between. Not for the sensitive data itself, but for the systems of analysis and machine learning models that the client wanted to set loose on the data. This allows the client to perform an automated task on the data, such as harvesting and comparing values or building an ML model, without ever having direct access to it.</p>
<p>Clearly this approach seemed valuable to LiveRamp, which provides a number of data connectivity services to major enterprise customers, household names in fact. They announced in their earnings statement last night that they paid $68 million up front for DataFleets, though that price does not reflect the various other incentives and deferred payments that many such deals involve, and in this case seem likely to remain private.</p>
<p>The deal will probably result in the retiring of the DataFleets brand (young as it was), but their various customers will probably make the trip to LiveRamp. The most recent of those is HCA Healthcare, a major national provider that just announced a COVID-19 data sharing consortium that would be using DataFleets&#8217;s services. That&#8217;s a pretty powerful validation for an approach just commercialized late last year, and a nice catch for LiveRamp to add to its healthcare client collection.</p>
<p>For its part LiveRamp plans to use its augmented services to expand its operations and offerings in Europe, Asia and Latin America over the coming year. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/lets-close-the-gap-and-finally-pass-a-federal-data-privacy-law/">The company has also called for a federal data privacy law</a>, something that hopefully that will be achieved under the new administration.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commercial real estate industry is facing its share of challenges, considering the fact that so many people are working from home (and not in offices) and retail is riding a slippery slope as more people shop online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But from downturns, opportunity emerges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter <a href="https://www.optiolend.com">OptioLend</a>, a new startup that wants to help individual investors take advantage of opportunities in commercial real estate by connecting them with “the best possible” lenders. The Columbus, Ohio-based company launched its marketplace Tuesday after months of operating in private beta.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new platform uses an AI-powered algorithm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and a database of more than 9,500 capital sources</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help prospective real estate borrowers in search of debt financing find lenders “with the best terms.” In other words, the company’s self-proclaimed mission is to become the “LendingTree for commercial real estate.” (For the unacquainted, Charlotte, North Carolina-based LendingTree is an online marketplace that provides c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">onsumers multiple offers from several lenders for things like mortgage, student and personal loans.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel Lowery, a former LendingTree executive who built the back end of that company’s platform, helped build out the OptioLend portal serving in a technical advisor capacity along with former data scientists at IBM.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once an investor applies for a loan, OptioLend identifies up to 20 lenders best suited for that application based on recent lending history and other criteria. Borrowers and brokers can negotiate and close deals from within the company’s platform via the mostly automated process, the company claims. But it’s also launching “with a concierge service of experienced capital advisors” to help guide users who need help during the loan procurement process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get off the ground, OptioLend last year raised about $1 million in seed funding led by the <a href="http://www.schottycapital.com">Schottenstein Family Office</a> with participation from Loud Capital and MLG Ventures. For context, the Schottenstein family is one of the largest private real estate owners in the country.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Valon closes on $50M a16z-led Series A to grow mobile-first mortgage servicing platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/valon-closes-on-50m-a16z-led-series-a-to-grow-mobile-first-mortgage-servicing-platform/embed/#?secret=QUhcBaBI9R" data-secret="QUhcBaBI9R" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Richard Geisenfeld said there’s a plethora of lenders that can lend at that price point, whereas there is “a relatively small pool of capital sources” that focus on deals above $10 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Capital markets are experiencing a 50% surge in refis and new loans as the markets start to rebound from COVID,” he said. “And as existing loans start coming due, we think we’re in a perfect timing to roll out. Properties are going to be repurposed, and are already starting to be.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while OptioLend can work with institutions and individual investors, it’s more focused on the latter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institutions have a lot of choices,” Geisenfeld said. “Individual investors do not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geisenfeld said he comes from a family of developers and himself has closed about $1.7 billion worth of transactions in 44 states as founder of Capital Commercial Partners. He’d been representing the Schottenstein family for nearly 20 years before the concept behind OptioLend emerged.</span></p>
<p>As an experiment prior to the formation of OptioLend, the family office had reached out to more than 50 lenders in an effort to finance the purchase of a small single tenant, triple net portfolio. They were surprised to discover that the interest rates varied as much as a full percentage point.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every time we did a deal with them, we’d hear anecdotally there were better [loan] rates out there and they agreed that we needed to create some kind of efficiency and automation,” Geisenfeld told TechCrunch. “So I went to one of my colleagues and asked ‘how do we change the paradigm from the traditional methodology?’ And that’s the problem we’re out to solve &#8212; by increasing an investor’s access to capital by 10 times in 10 minutes.”</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GBAkbba9vD"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/vc-investment-in-proptech-can-yield-profits-and-change-lives/">VC investment in proptech can yield profits and change lives</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup says it not only helps investors with new loan applications, but it can also help them refinance existing assets. Its sweet spot is on transactions in the middle market &#8212; in the $1 million to $10 million range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OptioLend will work with commercial real estate and mortgage brokers alike either by allowing them to use the platform directly or to refer property owners to it. Their incentive for referrals is earning up to 50% of the original fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Schottenstein, principal of Schottenstein Family Office, noted in a written statement that in today’s market, borrowers with limited access to capital sources sometimes sign onto loan terms with interest rates “as much as 100 basis points higher than they have to.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;OptioLend’s ability to get deals in front of multiple lenders quickly helps ensure that borrowers are getting the best terms possible,” he added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aurora has reached a deal with Toyota and auto-parts supplier Denso to develop and test vehicles equipped with the self-driving startup&#8217;s technology, beginning with a fleet of Toyota Sienna minivans.</p>
<p>Engineering teams from Aurora and Toyota will work together to design and build the self-driving Sienna minivans with an aim to start testing a fleet by the end of 2021, the companies said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The announcement follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/">Aurora&#8217;s acquisition</a> of Uber Advanced Technologies Group, which spun out from Uber in 2019 after the unit raised $1 billion in funding from Toyota, Denso and SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund. The acquisition, which closed January 20, was a complex deal in which Uber handed over its equity in ATG and invested $400 million into Aurora. Uber now holds a 26% stake in the combined company. Toyota also has a minority stake in Aurora as a result of the acquisition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The partnership announced Tuesday is similar &#8212; at least in part &#8212; to an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/27/toyota-invests-500-million-into-uber/">agreement reached in 2018</a> between Toyota and Uber to bring an on-demand autonomous ride-hailing service to market. Under that deal, which included a $500 million investment by Toyota, the companies agreed to integrate Uber ATG&#8217;s self-driving technology into the Sienna minivans for use in Uber&#8217;s ride-hailing network. The vehicles later could be owned and operated by third-party fleet managers, Toyota and Uber ATG said at the time.</p>
<p>Aurora co-founder and chief product officer Sterling Anderson emphasized that this is a new partnership and not just an extension of Toyota&#8217;s agreement with Uber ATG.</p>
<p>Toyota and Aurora declined to disclose details such as the size of the team or whether there were financial incentives tied to the deal, making it difficult to determine the scope of the collaboration.</p>
<p>However, Aurora describes this as a long-term strategic deal and laid out an ambitious vision for a partnership that extends far beyond testing. Aurora said that the joint development work in 2021 will lay the groundwork for the mass production and launch of these vehicles with Toyota on ride-hailing networks, including Uber&#8217;s. Aurora said it will also explore mass production of autonomous driving components with Denso and the creation of a services platform with Toyota that could manage financing, insurance and maintenance of the self-driving vehicles.</p>
<p>Anderson noted that the development of these commercial downstream services such as fleet management has become increasingly important for the company following its agreement with trucking firm PACCAR and now Toyota.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need a vehicle, we need a driver and we need support services,&#8221; Anderson said in a recent interview. &#8220;One of the areas that we&#8217;re exploring with Toyota as part of this, is the scaled deployment of Toyota-built vehicles, powered by the Aurora driver, supported by a combination of Aurora&#8217;s support services as well as Toyota&#8217;s network. This is one of the areas where Toyota&#8217;s scale becomes so significant to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The path from testing to commercialization is a long one, riddled with potential speed bumps, including technical and regulatory challenges, competing with rivals over skilled workers and raising enough capital. Achieving these doesn&#8217;t always equate to success as operating an autonomous ride-hailing network has its own set of hurdles. The upshot: Aurora&#8217;s partnership with Toyota is no guarantee.</p>
<p>Still, locking in a partnership with a large automaker is still important for Aurora.</p>
<p>&#8220;Toyota has an unparalleled legacy, engineering expertise, leadership and ability to deliver high-quality, affordable and reliable vehicles,&#8221; Aurora co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson wrote in a blog post Tuesday. &#8220;They&#8217;re also the preferred vehicle brand for transporting riders on ride-hailing networks, so we&#8217;re excited and honored to work with them to unlock driverless mobility services with the Aurora Driver.&#8221;</p>
<p>Urmson added that Aurora&#8217;s development work on highway driving to support its first commercial product, a driverless truck, &#8220;will also be critical for safely moving people, as a significant fraction of ride-share bookings today require the ability to drive over 50 mph.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify this morning confirmed it&#8217;s testing a new, synced lyrics feature in the U.S. market, following a report from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-live-lyrics-united-states-test-ios-android-140045159.html">Engadget</a>. Though the streaming music service today offers live lyrics in a number of markets &#8212; 27, in fact, including its <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-02-01/spotify-launches-in-south-korea/">recent launch</a> in South Korea &#8212; it has not offered lyrics in the U.S. for many years. Instead, Spotify here runs the &#8220;Behind the Lyrics&#8221; feature provided in partnership with Genius, which offers a combination of lyrics and trivia about the song being played.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Spotify said the new lyrics feature rolled out as a test for some users in the U.S. starting today.</p>
<p>“We can confirm we’re currently testing our lyrics feature to a select number of users in the U.S.,&#8221; a spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;At Spotify, we routinely conduct a number of tests in an effort to improve our user experience. Some of those tests end up paving the way for our broader user experience and others serve only as an important learning.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company declined to share additional details about its plans, but did note that its U.S. partner on the new lyrics feature is <a href="https://www.musixmatch.com/">Musixmatch</a> &#8212; a service that already powers Spotify&#8217;s lyrics feature in various non-U.S. markets.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Spotify has run a lyrics feature in the U.S., to be clear. The streaming service had originally worked with Musixmatch from 2011 through 2016, before <a href="https://blog.musixmatch.com/i-know-its-over-a-parting-of-ways-and-it-s-done-but-didn-t-we-have-fun-8bb27193494d#.fzcobucji">ending that relationship</a> to instead partner with Genius. But despite ongoing user demand for lyrics&#8217; return, Spotify never brought the feature back to the U.S.</p>
<p>In more recent years, however, Spotify rekindled its relationship with Musixmatch. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/in-a-significant-expansion-spotify-to-launch-real-time-lyrics-in-26-markets/">it announced the launch of real-time lyrics</a> in, then, 26 worldwide markets across Southeast Asia, India and Latin America. This had been the first time lyrics were offered in 22 of these 26 markets, as only Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Mexico had some form of prior lyrics support via other providers.</p>
<p>Spotify&#8217;s ongoing lack of support for lyrics in the U.S. has given its streaming music competitors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/15/spotify-is-falling-behind-on-lyrics-and-voice/">an advantage</a>. Amazon Music, for example, allowed users to <a href="https://www.popsci.com/best-tips-for-amazon-music-unlimited/">view lyrics</a> as songs played and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/24/amazon-musics-app-adds-hands-free-listening-courtesy-of-alexa/">tied the feature</a> to its Alexa voice platform, so consumers could ask Alexa to search for songs by lyrics. Meanwhile, the updated version of Apple Music that <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/06/05/apple-music-in-ios-12-adds-song-search-by-lyrics-new-artist-pages">rolled out with iOS 12</a> in 2018 included a way to search by lyrics, instead of just artist, album or song title. It <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3430316/how-to-use-synchronized-lyrics-in-apple-music-on-your-iphone-ipad-or-apple-tv.html">later added</a> live, synced lyrics with the launch of iOS 13. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208279">Siri can also respond to commands</a> that involve lyrics.</p>
<p>Musixmatch additionally confirmed it has partnered with Spotify on the new U.S. test.</p>
<p>&#8220;Musixmatch is growing at a fast pace thanks to [the] continued investment we&#8217;ve made [over] a decade. We&#8217;re focused now on bringing more data to continue enriching the audio experience globally,&#8221; Musixmatch CEO and founder Max Ciociola told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Because the lyrics feature is only a test, you may not see it yourself in the Spotify app, due to its limited availability. Spotify has not said if or when the test may be expanded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once upon a time, the idea of 3D-printed homes felt like a thing of the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as housing gets less and less affordable &#8212; especially in ultra-expensive markets such as the Bay Area &#8212; companies are getting creative in their quest to build more affordable homes using technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of those companies, Oakland-based <a href="http://mightybuildings.com/">Mighty Buildings</a>, just raised $40 million in Series B funding for its quest to create homes that it says are “beautiful, sustainable and affordable” using 3D printing, robotics and automation. It claims to be able to 3D print structures “two times as quickly with 95% less labor </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hours </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and 10-times less waste” than conventional construction. For example, it says it can 3D print a 350-square-foot studio apartment in just 24 hours.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four-year-old startup’s efforts caught the eye of Khosla Ventures, which co-led the financing along with Zeno Ventures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryno Blignaut, an operating partner at Khosla, believes that Mighty Buildings &#8212; which launched out of stealth </span><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/05/2073089/0/en/Mighty-Buildings-Launches-to-Accelerate-Homebuilding-with-3D-Printing-and-Automation.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last August</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; has the potential to cut both the cost and carbon footprint of home construction “by 50% or more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company takes a hybrid approach to home construction, combining 3D printing and prefab (meaning built offsite) building, according to co-founder and COO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexey Dubov</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It has invented a proprietary thermoset composite material called Light Stone Material (LSM) as part of its effort to reduce the home construction industry’s reliance on concrete and steel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The material can be 3D printed and hardens almost immediately, according to the company, while also maintaining cohesion between layers to create a monolithic structure. Mighty Buildings can then 3D print elements like overhangs or ceilings without the need for additional supporting formwork. That way, it’s able to fully print a structure and not just the walls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robotic arms can post-process the composite, which combined with the company’s ability to automate the pouring of insulation and the 3D printing gives Mighty Buildings the ability to automate up to 80% of the construction process, the company claims.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How 3D printing is revolutionizing the housing industry &#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/08/how-3d-printing-is-revolutionizing-the-housing-industry/embed/#?secret=YJwyvj5LNn" data-secret="YJwyvj5LNn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Khosla was drawn to the Mighty Buildings’ innovative approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe in dematerializing buildings and non-linearly reducing the amount of cement and steel used, thereby reducing the cost of construction in order to increase affordable access to housing together with improved sustainability,” Blignaut wrote via email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mighty Building&#8217;s use of 3D printing, advanced manufacturing techniques, modern robotics and “new lighter and stronger materials” gives it an edge, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its launch, the company has produced and installed a number of accessory dwelling units (ADUs) and is now taking orders for Mighty Houses &#8212; its newest product line that will range from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">864 to 1,440 square feet at an estimated cost of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$304,000 to $420,500</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (Similarly sized houses in some parts of the Bay Area can sell for upwards of $1 million).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The units are created with a 3D-printed exterior panelized shell while certain elements &#8212; such as bathrooms for example &#8212; are prefabricated in the company’s 79,000-square-foot production facility in Oakland. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the company is only building in California, but Dubov says it’s open to exploring other markets as its factory can be replicated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, Mighty Buildings plans this year to market its Mighty Kit System and a new fiber-reinforced material for multi-story projects as part of a </span><a href="https://b2b.mightybuildings.com/developers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">planned B2B platform for developers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In fact, the company already has secured contracts with developers for its single family housing product line. It also plans to use the new capital in part to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">scale its production capacity with increased automation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, Mighty Building&#8217;s vision is to provide production-as-a-service, with builders and architects designing their own structures and then developers using Mighty Factories to produce them at scale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mighty Buildings is not the only startup doing 3D-printed homes. Last August, Austin-based ICON</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://finledger.com/2020/08/19/icon-raises-35-million-for-3d-printed-homes/"> raised $35 million in Series A funding</a>. The company also aims to reinvent building affordable homes with the use of 3D printers, robotics and advanced materials. The biggest difference between the two companies, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubov, is that ICON does primarily onsite construction while Mighty Buildings prefabricates in a factory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than a dozen other investors also participated in Mighty Building&#8217;s latest round, including returning backers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bold Capital Partners, Core Innovation Capital and Foundamental and new investors including ArcTern Ventures, Abies Ventures, Modern Venture Partners, MicroVentures, One Way Ventures, Polyvalent Capital and others. Mighty Buildings was also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">included in </span><a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Y Combinator’s Top companies </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">list, all of which have valuations over $150 million (although the company declined to reveal its current valuation). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, Khosla’s Blignaut believes that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">buildings are “a big part of our urban landscape and a large consumer of resources.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Construction and building account for more carbon emissions in the U.S. than transportation or industry,” he said. Other portfolio companies addressing such challenges include Ori Living, Vicarious, Katerra and Arevo.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://justo.mx/">Jüsto</a>, an online supermarket based in Mexico City, announced Tuesday it has raised $65 million in a Series A round led by General Atlantic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amount is sizable for a Series A in general, but supersized for a LatAm startup. In fact, according to PitchBook data cited by General Atlantic, the round represents the largest Series A raised in Latin America in the past decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers also participated in the round, including Foundation Capital and Mountain Nazca.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ricardo Weder</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, former president of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cabify </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(a large ridesharing company operating in Latin America, Spain and Portugal) founded </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jüsto </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2019 with a mission to “disrupt the Latin American grocery industry.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It claims to be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the first supermarket in Mexico with no physical store. Customers can buy their groceries directly from the website or via the app and Jüsto delivers the order to the customer’s location of choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept is clearly resonating with consumers as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jüsto </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">saw impressive growth in 2020 with a 16-fold increase in revenue. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;What COVID did was accelerate the adoption curves,&#8221; Weder told TechCrunch. &#8220;Over the summer of 2020, in only a few months, penetration rates tripled in the region.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jüsto prides itself on working directly with fresh produce suppliers so that it can offer “the freshest” fruits, vegetables, meats and fish in the market. It also offers a variety of products such as pantry staples, personal hygiene and beauty, home and cleaning, drinks and pet-related items.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mexico City&#8217;s Jüsto raises a $12 million bridge round for its delivery-only grocery stores&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/mexico-citys-justo-raises-a-12-million-bridge-round-for-its-delivery-only-grocery-stores/embed/#?secret=FAOd08haxf" data-secret="FAOd08haxf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup only sells items from local suppliers, with whom it prides itself on developing fair trade agreements (“Jüsto” means fair in Spanish). It also uses artificial intelligence to forecast demand and to try to reduce food waste at its micro-fulfillment centers. The company’s approach results in “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">competitive prices, lower transaction costs, and improved convenience to consumers by eliminating intermediaries in the supply chain,” according to the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Jüsto plans to use its new capital to expand across Mexico and Latin America as a whole, enhancing its last-mile logistics infrastructure and marketing initiatives. The company currently has 425 employees, 40% of which are female.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luis Cervantes, managing director and head of Mexico City for General Atlantic, believes Mexico is at an inflection point in its transition to a digital economy.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are seeing that Mexico is at a pivotal point in its transition to a digital ecosystem given decreasing data costs and an increase of internet penetration, which has propelled digital engagement at the same time that the legacy grocery market is ripe for disruption,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;Jüsto stands out given its focus on creating an innovative solution that better serves both consumers and suppliers, leveraging technology and a seamless purchasing platform.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jüsto marks General Atlantic’s fifth investment in Mexico since 2014. Since then, the firm has invested nearly $1 billion in what it describes as “high-growth” Mexican companies.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It&#8217;s also invested about $4 billion in Latin American startups over the past two decades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing brings Jüsto’s total raised to over $100 million. Other investors include FEMSA Ventures, S7V, Elevar Equity, Bimbo Ventures, Quiet Capital, Sweet Capital, H2O Capital and SV LatAm Capital, among others.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.askzeta.com/">Zeta</a> co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditishekar">Aditi Shekar</a> has spent the past three years <a href="https://www.askzeta.com/money-manager/?utm_medium=press_release_Feb_9&amp;utm_source=press-release-Feb-9&amp;utm_campaign=press-release-feb-9">tracking the ways</a> couples share and manage their finances, from each card swipe to every split bill. Her effort led to tens of thousands of couples signing up for a free budgeting app experiment. Today, those learnings have been formed into a venture-backed startup.</p>
<p>Zeta is a new fintech platform that helps couples join their finances. Zeta isn’t creating the concept of joint accounts; it’s simply trying to rebuild them for the modern family. Currently, joint accounts lack transparency or the option to add multiple users that come from different relationships in your life. Many standard joint accounts just give every user entire access to other users’ finances, versus tiered ways to spend.</p>
<p>Shekar, who started the company after experiencing the stress of dividing and dealing with money in her own relationship, says the goal of Zeta is to take the “cognitive load” of dealing with money off of people in a relationship.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Off that vision, Shekar and her co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinlhopkins">Kevin Hopkins</a> have raised $1.5 million in a round co-led by Deciens Capital and Precursor with participation from executives from Chime, Square, PayPal, Venmo, Google, Facebook and Weight Watchers. Shekar says that 57% of its cap table is women or people of color.</p>
<p>“In some ways, we see ourselves as part of a replacement for Venmo,” Shekar said. “We saw couples Venmoing back and forth to each other sometimes six times a day&#8230;we want to take over your money chores.” While Zeta is entering the market as a tool for couples, Shekar sees the startup’s moonshot as being the go-to operational account for any modern household.</p>
<p>A tool like Zeta is trying to give already existent transactions &#8212; begging for a rent check, splitting the grocery bill, going halfsies on dinner, giving allowance &#8212; an easier way to be completed.</p>
<p>In reality, the startup works as a First Republic or Chase replacement, providing a digital layer of banking services that can integrate with pre-existing bank accounts. Couples who download Zeta will each get a Zeta joint card and a joint account to layer atop their finances. The joint card will serve as the way that couples can spend from the same account.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Venmo to gain crypto, budgeting, savings and Honey integrations this year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/venmo-to-gain-crypto-budgeting-bill-pay-and-honey-integrations-this-year/embed/#?secret=5S056sV4cm" data-secret="5S056sV4cm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So far, users use their Zeta account in two main ways: have it take over standing bills such as rent or mortgage, or have it serve as a savings account for mutual goals, such as a post-COVID trip or big shared purchase like a car or home. Users can direct-deposit as much money as they want from their main bank accounts into Zeta, and then use the Zeta debit card to swipe couple money instead of individual money.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of fintechs that will go after the direct deposit,” Shekar said. “But we really thought about Zeta as the layer on top of existing accounts so you don’t have to move everything over.”</p>
<p>Similar to Chime, Zeta makes money from interchange fees, the cost it takes for a merchant to process your payment, on card transactions. A portion of the interchange fee is paid to Zeta, and a portion goes to your bank.</p>
<p>“If you and your partner wanted to share rent and pay bills together we’d be the natural place to plug into,” she said.</p>
<p>“Frankly, institutions have treated people as single-player games,” Shekar said. “Fintech is way more social than we realize.”</p>
<p>The success of Zeta hinges on the idea that people want to share their finances in an ongoing and meaningful way, and that the world of finance is ready to shift from individualism to collectivism earlier and louder. It sounds daunting, but we already know that social finance is big, as shown by apps like Venmo and Splitwise, and phenomena like the GameStop saga from just a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Other startups have taken notice too, entering the world of multiplayer fintech, a term that categorizes socially focused and consumer-friendly financial services. Braid, a group-financing platform, is trying to make transactions work for various entities, from shared households to side hustles to creative projects.</p>
<p>Braid founder Amanda Peyton breaks down the concept of multi-player, social finance into two phases: if 1.0 was Venmo, then 2.0 will “enable sharing money at the account and transaction level,” she says.</p>
<p>“I think about it this way: The current set of mainstream financial products supports my money and your money. Social finance 2.0 will be all about our money,” Peyton said.</p>
<p>“Banks have historically prioritized growing their own customer base. They haven&#8217;t invested a lot in products that promote sharing money, regardless of where your primary checking account lives&#8230;Zelle is a noticeable exception here,” she said. “And it&#8217;s not hard to see why, there&#8217;s little tangible benefit for them to do so.”</p>
<p>Zeta differentiates from Braid in that it is solely focused on couples and families, which lets it do things like pay bills and save money to plan for the financial future. Shekar says that it plans to support families in broader ways over time, such as being part of taxes or prenuptial agreements. That said, Zeta currently only supports two people per account, while Braid already has the capability to add multiple parties to its joint account.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Zelle forecast to overtake Venmo this year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/15/zelle-forecast-to-overtake-venmo-this-year/embed/#?secret=B7MhslUU4N" data-secret="B7MhslUU4N" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The biggest hurdle for Zeta is if people trust each other enough to get into operational accounts with each other to do it. Individualism isn’t just a lazy reaction to lack of tooling out there; for many people, keeping your money to yourself is a preference. Of course, the flip-side of shared finances is dealing with the repercussions of ending that relationship if life gets in the way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new study from Mount Sinai researchers published in the peer-reviewed &#8220;Journal of Medical Internet Research&#8221; found that wearable hardware, and specifically the Apple Watch, can effectively predict a positive COVID-19 diagnosis up to a week before current PCR-based nasal swab tests.</p>
<p>The investigation dubbed the <a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/covid19/warrior-watch-study">&#8220;Warrior Watch Study,&#8221;</a> used a dedicated Apple Watch and iPhone app and included participants from Mount Sinai staff. It required participants to use the app for health data monitoring and collection, and also asked that they fill out a day survey to provide direct feedback about their potential COVID-19 symptoms and other factors, including stress.</p>
<p>During the course of the study, the research team enlisted &#8220;several hundred healthcare workers&#8221; to participate, and collected data over several months, between April and September. The primary biometric signal that the study&#8217;s authors were watching was heart rate variability (HRV), which is a key indicator of strain on a person&#8217;s nervous system. This information was combined with information around reported symptoms associated with COVID-19, including fever, aches, dry cough, gastrointestinal issues, and loss of taste and smell, among others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Warrior Watch Study was not only able to predict infections up to a week before tests provided confirmed diagnoses, but also revealed that participants&#8217; HRV patterns normalized fairly quickly after their diagnosis, returning to normal roughly one to two weeks following their positive tests.</p>
<p>As to what the study could lead to in terms of actual interventions, the study&#8217;s authors note that it can help anticipate outcomes and isolate individuals from others who are at risk. Most importantly, it provides a means for doing so remotely, allowing caregivers to anticipate or detect a COVID-19 case without even doing a physical exam or administering a nasal swab test, which can help take precautionary measures in high-risk situations when cases are suspected, possibly preventing any spread before someone is highly contagious.</p>
<p>The study is ongoing and will expand to examine what else wearables like the Apple Watch and their onboard sensors can tell us about other impacts of COVID-19 on the health of care workers, including what factors like sleep and physical activity can have in association with the disease.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“Seed rounds are up!” “Seed rounds are higher valued than ever!” “There were 10% less VCs investing in seed rounds last year!” !!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>We’ve all seen these stories, and we’re fine connoisseurs of them here at TechCrunch, for sure. Trend data about VC investing are always enticing to startup founders and investors, since they affect so much of the strategy and planning of building a company. If seed rounds are becoming more elusive, maybe skip on that last hire, extend the runway and try to gain some revenues. If Series A is the new bottleneck, well, invest more in product and growth so you don’t slam into the capital wall. If money is raining down from the sky, double the team, double growth marketing spend and go blitzscale.</p>
<p>It’s key market intelligence, and important. Which is why it is so frustrating that the aggregate data on VC rounds is so goddamn bad.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here’s a friendly reminder: There are no comprehensive datasets on VC rounds (at least in the United States) and the data quality has only gotten worse over time, particularly at the seed stage.</p>
<p>It’s a theme I have been harping on for years now. SEC Form D filings, which form the backbone of most trend data of VC investment rounds, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/07/the-disappearing-form-d/">have been disappearing for years now</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="q0v1lPIFdJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/07/the-disappearing-form-d/">The disappearing Form D</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The disappearing Form D&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/07/the-disappearing-form-d/embed/#?secret=q0v1lPIFdJ" data-secret="q0v1lPIFdJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As I described in my analysis from way back in 2018, the biggest reason is also one that isn’t very visible: a transformation in the culture among lawyers from a culture of “always file” to a culture of avoiding filings if at all possible.</p>
<p>That cultural change has been driven by founders and investors who want to keep their startups stealthy and their competitors in the dark about where their finances are. Plus, founders can avoid the spectacle of salespeople beating down their door when they find out the startup has cash in the coffers.</p>
<p>When I talked to lawyers about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/28/how-to-delay-your-form-ds/">how to delay filing a Form D</a>, all gave the standard perfunctory response about the necessity of filing — until we went off the record. Then, lawyers opened up about how much they skirt around SEC securities regulations. As one lawyer essentially put it, there’s what the law says is required, and then what the SEC ever bothers to enforce. No one in Silicon Valley has ever been charged with a crime related to skipping out on a Form D filing, or even paid a fine that anyone seems to have any memory of.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="szraIzS3UP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/28/how-to-delay-your-form-ds/">How to delay your Form Ds (or not file them at all)</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How to delay your Form Ds (or not file them at all)&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/28/how-to-delay-your-form-ds/embed/#?secret=szraIzS3UP" data-secret="szraIzS3UP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>One lawyer at the time described to me a prototypical conversation he has with founders. He doesn’t tell them not to file their Form Ds. Instead, he says that almost none of their peer founders will file securities paperwork, and thus, if they <i>do</i> follow the law, they would be at a competitive disadvantage. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of founders follow the directed course.</p>
<p>While it might seem like the law is the law, what’s far more important than what is written in the law or SEC regulations is how the law is interpreted, which is really about the sociology of attorneys. Years ago, I was talking to a securities attorney about company valuations. He was describing to me how East Coast-based securities lawyers at the time would blanche at some of the valuation tricks that West Coast/Silicon Valley lawyers would use with startups. You can follow the law closely, and you can follow the law loosely — and neither group is altogether breaking the law.</p>
<p>A change in legal culture driven by founders is one aspect of the dilemma facing VC investment trend surveyors. Another, particularly at the seed stage, is the complexity of rounds today.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/are-safes-obscuring-todays-seed-volume/">As my colleague Alex Wilhelm wrote this morning in The Exchange newsletter</a>, alternative investment models are having a large effect on aggregate VC data. Rolling rounds, convertible notes, SaaS securitization products, crowdfunding and other mechanisms have massively transformed the seed-stage investing world from the ol’ write-a-check-and-buy-equity approach. While some of these forms of investment trigger filings requirements, many of these models are so new that lawyers have been willing to skip filings given the paucity of case law associated with the regulations.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="W8ugW1WpnJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/are-safes-obscuring-todays-seed-volume/">Are SAFEs obscuring today&#8217;s seed volume?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Are SAFEs obscuring today&#8217;s seed volume?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/are-safes-obscuring-todays-seed-volume/embed/#?secret=W8ugW1WpnJ" data-secret="W8ugW1WpnJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Finally, you can generally avoid a Form D by filing in the relevant state jurisdictions of the company and its investors. As much as securities law may seem federal (we talk about the SEC a heck of a lot more than the California Department of Financial Protection &amp; Innovation), the reality is that much of securities law is still practiced at the state level. What that means is that startups can use state filings in lieu of federal filings, and those are essentially invisible since literally no one besides me and a few other journalists in the world read state securities filings.</p>
<p>Take for instance a cool company I covered a little while back called Hebbia, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/hebbia-wants-to-make-ctrl-f-or-command-f-actually-useful-through-better-ai/">which is reinventing search on the desktop</a>. They raised a $1.1 million pre-seed round led by Floodgate with a lot of other great investors. Now, go to the SEC search page and look for the Form D. Nothing. But if you go to the California DFPI, you will find three filings submitted on September 21, 2020 for a $1.2 million total round. There’s your filing.</p>
<p>Even late-stage companies can mostly go without any Form D filings. Take DoorDash, for instance, which just had a monster IPO last year. If you search through the SEC database for “DoorDash Inc,” you will find nary a Form D filing for any of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/doordash/company_financials">the company’s 11 venture rounds that Crunchbase identifies</a>. The first filings with the SEC are for its originally confidential draft registration statement to go IPO in early 2020. Now, if you head over to California’s database again, you will find filings going back to 2016, which I presume is the five-year limit for the site’s search function.</p>
<p>Using state filings is not wrong, illegal or unethical — it’s just the standard way to do business today. But few industry datasets go beyond federal Form D filings to take into account every state’s database for securities filings. There are 50 states, and many of them (looking at you Florida) are all but impenetrable to researchers and investigators.</p>
<p>So if the legal culture around filings has changed, more rounds are using alternative investment models, and startups aren’t filing federally, what are analysts supposed to do?</p>
<p>Well, they try to compensate for this sparsity by augmenting the dataset they have with publicly reported information from sites like TechCrunch, Twitter conversations, self-reported data from startups, surveys of lawyers and accountants and more to attempt to statistically estimate how many rounds were actually conducted given the limited information they have on hand. For example, if lawyers report a 15% uptick in rounds, we can guesstimate roughly how many rounds took place in a given year.</p>
<p>At least, that’s the idea. Unfortunately, there really is no way to measure the inaccuracy of this approach, since there is no administrative dataset to compare our estimations to.</p>
<p>What percentage of rounds go undisclosed? It’s impossible to count something we can’t count, but my guess covering the industry is something on the order of 50%-60% of seed rounds, a third of Series A/B rounds and a declining percentage the later a company goes (at a certain point, Form Ds solve <i>a lot</i> of problems for companies when it comes to securities paperwork and mitigating legal risk).</p>
<p>Even the government doesn’t have data better than us. Take a story from last week in The Wall Street Journal about how <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-swat-team-is-reviewing-past-startup-deals-tied-to-chinese-investors-11612094401">the Department of Justice is investigating startups that took money from Chinese investors</a>. The DOJ isn’t taking advantage of some secret database to identify all the investors that are hidden from the general public. They don’t know themselves! From the article:</p>
<blockquote><p>Startup investments are exempt from many of the disclosures required from public companies. Last year, Cfius launched a new confidential tip line to help surface deals. In some cases, companies have alerted Cfius to a rival’s connections with foreign investors, said startup executives and lawyers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, VC investment trend data is interesting and key market intelligence, and it might be — at a very high level — directionally right. There are just huge constraints on the ability of market researchers and data companies to comprehensively analyze the market in an accurate way. Everyone tries their best, but the reality is that if startups don’t have to disclose their investor data, there’s literally no other source for the information.</p>

The ability for researchers to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55388846">track genetic codes</a> around the world in near real-time is crucial to our response.</p>
<p>St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital was able to <a href="https://thenewstack.io/why-covid-19-is-ushering-in-innovation-with-citizen-developers/">digitize its contract signature process</a> in just 10 days during this critical time. A team of four developers hailing from Taiwan, Brazil, Mongolia and India <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/agrolly/">helped farmers</a> navigate climate change by using weather data to make more informed crop management decisions.</p>
<p>From the civil rights and anti-war movements of the 1950s and 1960s through the recent rallies supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, people have used passion and protests to shape the conversations that lead to a better future. Now, this rich history of people-powered action has an important new set of tools: The data, software and tech know-how that’s needed to mount a coordinated global and local response to our greatest challenges.</p>
<p>Today’s software developers are akin to civil engineers in the 1940s and 1950s who designed bridges and roads, creating an infrastructure that paved the path for enormous widespread progress.</p>
<p>The open-source code community already collaborates and shares, producing innovations that belong to everyone, focusing on progress over perfection. If a hurricane is about to create havoc in your community, don’t just fill sandbags, hit your keyboard and use open-source technologies to not only help your community, but to scale solutions to help others. <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/droneaid-is-now-open-source/">DroneAID</a>, for example, is an open-source tool that uses visual recognition to detect and count SOS icons on the ground from drones flying overhead, and then automatically plots emergency needs on a map for first responders.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">recent GitHub study </a>shows that open-source project creation is up 25% since April of last year. Developers are signing on to contribute to open-source communities and virtual hackathons during their downtime, using their skills to create a more sustainable world.</p>
<p>In 2018, I helped found <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/">Call for Code</a> with IBM, David Clark Cause and United Nations Human Rights to empower the global developer community, and a big part of our mission was to create the infrastructure needed to shepherd big ideas into real-world deployments. For our part, IBM provides the 24-million-person developer community access to the same technology being used by our enterprise clients, including our open hybrid cloud platform, AI, blockchain and quantum computing.</p>
<p>One winner, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-kq18qV3AE">Prometeo</a>, with a team including a firefighter, nurse and developers, created a system that uses artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things to safeguard firefighters as they battle blazes and has been tested in multiple regions in Spain. We’ve seen developers help teachers share virtual information for homeschooling; measure the carbon footprint impact of consumer purchases; update small businesses with COVID-19 policies; help farmers navigate climate change; and improve the way businesses manage lines amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>This past year, <a href="https://devpost.com/">Devpost</a> partnered with the World Health Organization (WHO) and <a href="https://covid-global-hackathon.devpost.com/">challenged developers to create COVID-19 mitigation solutions</a> in categories including health, vulnerable populations and education. The Ford Foundation and Mozilla led <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/introducing-our-10-newest-mozilla-fellows/">a fellowship program</a> to connect technologists, activists, journalists and scientists, and strengthen organizations working at the convergence of technology and social justice. <a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/">The U.S. Digital Response (USDR)</a> connected pro-bono technologists to work with government and organizations responding to crisis.</p>
<p>The most complex global and societal issues can be broken down into smaller solvable tech challenges. But to solve our most complex problems, we need the brains of every country, every class, every gender. The skills-gap crisis is a global phenomenon, making it critical that we equip the next generation of problem solvers with the training and resources they need to turn great ideas into impactful solutions.</p>
<p>This year, we can expect to see a newly energized community of developers working across the boundaries of companies, states and countries to take on some of the world’s biggest problems.</p>
<p>But they can’t do it alone. These developer activists need our support, encouragement and help pinpointing the most crucial problems to address, and they need the tools to bring solutions to every corner of the world.</p>
<p>The true power of technology lies with those who want to change the world for good. To ensure anyone who wants to create change has the tools, resources and skillsets to do so, we must renew our focus on closing the skills gap and addressing deep inequalities in our society.</p>
<p>Our future depends on getting this right.</p>
