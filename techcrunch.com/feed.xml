										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Everyone is scrambling to build a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/twitter-spaces-arrives-on-android-ahead-of-clubhouse/">Clubhouse</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/">clone</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/facebooks-clubhouse-rival-looks-a-lot-like-clubhouse-right-now/">right now</a>, but for Discord it makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>With everyone stuck at home searching for safe ways to rekindle their social lives over the last year, Discord&#8217;s appeal exploded. The company cites new behavior it observed during the pandemic as the inspiration for Stage Channels, a new feature that will facilitate more structured voice chats with designated speakers and listeners.</p>
<p>Voice chat is already Discord&#8217;s core feature. It&#8217;s been that way for years, offering gamers a crystal clear, seamless voice chat service that blew the functionality of in-game chat services out of the water. But there&#8217;s no denying the Clubhouse-inspired voice event zeitgeist at the moment, even if ultimately Discord was there first in many ways.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2132346 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png?w=680" alt="Discord Stage Channels" width="680" height="484" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png?resize=1536,1092 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png?resize=2048,1456 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Discord says the new kind of channel will be useful for stuff like voice-based AMAs and interviews, book clubs and even karaoke. The new channels will capture activity that&#8217;s already happening on Discord, making it way easier for anyone who runs a server to host formalized conversations without needing to mess around with a bunch of granular user permissions stuff.</p>
<p>The new channel type fits right in with Discord&#8217;s existing vibe. Stage Channels do what&#8217;s on the label, allowing anyone who runs a Discord to curate a speaker experience and use moderator tools to control who gets the mic and when. Much like Clubhouse (or Zoom), participants can raise their hand to speak. They can also slink out quietly.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2132356 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="484" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png?resize=1536,1092 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png?resize=2048,1456 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Stage Channels will be specific to community servers, which are geared around larger groups on Discord. To enable the new kind of channel, server owners will need to convert a channel to a community server if it isn&#8217;t one already.</p>
<p>Because Discord is Discord, discovery for voice-based events won&#8217;t work like it does on Clubhouse, which serves up user-created live events front and center to anyone who opens the app. Community servers on Discord can apply to be featured in the server discovery menu, but the app&#8217;s focus remains on private, intimate groups and larger interest-based communities that you&#8217;re already a part of.</p>

<p>Given its healthy user base and existing utility as the go-to app for casual, seamless voice chat, Discord is well positioned to capture a completely different market for voice-based events. The app is a mainstay of the gaming community and generally skews young, putting it in contrast with the entrepreneurs, VCs and brands that flocked to Clubhouse&#8217;s early buzz.</p>
<p>Discord&#8217;s gaming DNA isn&#8217;t holding it back. In recent years, Discord has grown beyond its gaming roots without betraying them, expanding into a seamless chat experience for everything from college study groups to influencer fan hubs. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/filing-discord-is-raising-up-to-140m-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-7b/">Discord doubled its valuation</a> within <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/discord-now-has-a-3-5b-valuation-and-100m-for-a-sales-pitch-lighter-on-the-gaming/">six months.</a> Just a quarter later, Microsoft is reportedly in talks with the company on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/23/technology/microsoft-discord-deal.html">$10 billion deal</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Finance for Founders</strong></p>
<p><em>As a founder, you not only have to master your company’s finances, but you also have to tackle your own personal finances. Managing your money as a founder comes with a unique set of questions (see: QSBS). Leveraging her expertise from LearnVest and as a Certified Financial Planner<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, Alexa von Tobel (founder/managing partner, Inspired Capital Partners) will share financial planning best practices so founders can remove this layer of stress from the pressure of building a business.</em></p>
<p><strong>Building and Leading a Sales Team</strong></p>
<p><em>Contrary to popular opinion, even the very best products don’t sell themselves. Salespeople do. Hear from Zoom’s Chief Revenue Officer, at the helm of the company’s sales team during the biggest period of growth of any software company ever, lay out how to build a stellar sales team.</em></p>
<p><strong>Bootstrapping and the Power of Product-Led Growth</strong></p>
<p><em>Building a bootstrapped company forces you to be creative. For Calendly, it pointed the company toward a product-led growth model built on virality. Hear from Calendly’s Tope Awotona and OpenView’s Blake Bartlett, as they cover pro tips on bootstrapping, PLG and when a profitable company should consider raising capital.</em></p>
<p>There’s plenty more to explore, and TC Early Stage offers something for everyone. Here’s what Chloe Leaaetoa, founder of Socicraft, told us about her experience at Early Stage last year.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This conference caters to early stage founders no matter where you are in your process. Maybe your pitch deck is set but you need to hire internationally — they had a session on that. The range of topics was all-encompassing.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Don’t worry about missing out. Your ticket includes access to video on demand, so you can catch any presentation you miss once the conference ends.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/snehal-kundalkar">Snehal Kundalkar</a> is the chief technology officer at <a href="https://www.valence.community/">Valence</a>. She has been leading Silicon Valley firms for the last two decades, including work at Apple and Reddit.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">We’re living in a phenomenal moment for machine learning (ML), what<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonali-sambhus/"> Sonali Sambhus</a>, head of developer and ML platform at Square, describes as “the democratization of ML.” It’s become the foundation of business and growth acceleration because of the incredible pace of change and development in this space.</p>
<p>But for engineering and team leaders without an ML background, this can also feel overwhelming and intimidating. I regularly meet smart, successful, highly competent and normally very confident leaders who struggle to navigate a constructive or effective conversation on ML &#8212; even though some of them lead teams that engineer it.</p>
<p>I’ve spent more than two decades in the ML space, including work at Apple to build the world&#8217;s largest online app and music store. As the senior director of engineering, anti-evil, at Reddit, I used ML to understand and combat the <a href="https://redditblog.com/2019/07/29/the-benefits-of-machine-learning-to-study-small-dataset-of-social-conversations/">dark side of the web</a>.</p>
<p>For this piece, I interviewed a select group of successful ML leaders including Sambhus; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lgavish/">Lior Gavish</a>, co-founder at Monte Carlo; and<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yotamhadass/"> Yotam Hadass</a>, VP of engineering at Electric.ai, for their insights. I’ve distilled our best practices and must-know components into five practical and easily applicable lessons.</p>
<h2>1. ML recruiting strategy</h2>
<p>Recruiting for ML comes with several challenges.</p>
<p>The first is that it can be difficult to differentiate machine learning roles from more traditional job profiles (such as data analysts, data engineers and data scientists) because there’s a heavy overlap between descriptions.</p>
<p>Secondly, finding the level of experience required can be challenging. Few people in the industry have substantial experience delivering production-grade ML (for instance, you’ll sometimes notice resumes that specify experience with ML models but then find their models are rule-based engines rather than real ML models).</p>
<p>When it comes to recruiting for ML, hire experts when you can, but also look into how training can help you meet your talent needs. Consider upskilling your current team of software engineers into data/ML engineers or hire promising candidates and provide them with an ML education.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132730" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132730" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2132730" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/snehalsays-ML-essentials.jpg" alt="machine learning essentials for leaders" width="1000" height="759" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/snehalsays-ML-essentials.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/snehalsays-ML-essentials.jpg?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/snehalsays-ML-essentials.jpg?resize=300,228 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/snehalsays-ML-essentials.jpg?resize=768,583 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/snehalsays-ML-essentials.jpg?resize=680,516 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/snehalsays-ML-essentials.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2132730" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snehal Kundalkar</p></div></p>
<p>The other effective way to overcome these recruiting challenges is to define roles largely around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product: Look for candidates with a technical curiosity and a strong business/product sense. This framework is often more important than the ability to apply the most sophisticated models.</li>
<li>Data: Look for candidates that can help select models, design features, handle data modeling/vectorization and analyze results.</li>
<li>Platform/Infrastructure: Look for people who evaluate/integrate/build platforms to significantly accelerate the productivity of data and engineering teams; extract, transform, load (ETLs); warehouse infrastructures; and CI/CD frameworks for ML.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The gaming sector has never been hotter or had higher expectations from investors who are dumping billions into upstarts that can adjust to shifting tides faster that the existing giants will.</p>
<p>Bay Area-based <a href="https://www.manticoregames.com/">Manticore Games</a> is one of the second-layer gaming platforms looking to build on the market&#8217;s momentum. The startup tells TechCrunch they&#8217;ve closed a $100 million Series C funding round, bringing their total funding to $160 million. The round was led by XN, with participation from Softbank and LVP alongside existing investors Benchmark, Bitkraft, Correlation Ventures and Epic Games.</p>
<p>When Manticore closed its Series B back in September 2019, VCs were starting to take Roblox and the gaming sector more seriously, but it took the pandemic hitting to really expand their expectations for the market. &#8220;Gaming is now a bonafide super category,&#8221; CEO Frederic Descamps tells TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Manticore&#8217;s Core gaming platform is quite similar to Roblox conceptually, the big difference is that the gaming company is aiming to quickly scale up a games and creator platform geared towards the 13+ crowd that may have already left Roblox behind. The challenge will be coaxing that demographic faster than Roblox can expand its own ambitions, and doing so while other venture-backed gaming startups like Rec Room, which recently raised at a $1.2 billion valuation, race for the same prize.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rec Room raises at $1.25B valuation from Sequoia and Index as VCs push to find another Roblox&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/rec-room-raises-at-1-25b-valuation-from-sequoia-and-index-as-vcs-push-to-find-another-roblox/embed/#?secret=Z21IiStLyS" data-secret="Z21IiStLyS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Like other players, Manticore is attempting to build a game discovery platform directly into a game engine. They haven&#8217;t built the engine tech from scratch, they&#8217;ve been working closely with Epic Games which makes the Unreal Engine and made a $15 million investment in the company last year.</p>
<p>A big focus of the Core platform is giving creators a true drag-and-drop platform for game creation with a specific focus on &#8220;remixing&#8221; allowing users to pick pre-made environments, drop pre-rendered 3D assets into them, choose a game mode and publish it to the web. For creators looking to inject new mechanics or assets into a title, there will be some technical know-how necessary but Manticore&#8217;s team hopes that making the barriers of entry low for new creators means that they can grow alongside the platform. Manticore&#8217;s big bet is on the flexibility of their engine, hoping that creators will come on board for the chance to engineer their own mechanics or create their own path towards monetization, something established app store wouldn&#8217;t allow them to.</p>
<p>&#8220;Creators can implement their own styles of [in-app purchases] and what we&#8217;re really hoping for here is that maybe the next battle pass equivalent innovation will come out of this,&#8221; co-founder Jordan Maynard tells us.</p>
<p>This all comes at an added cost, developers earn 50% of revenues from their games, leaving more potential revenue locked up in fees routed to the platforms that Manticore depends on than if they built for the App Store directly, but this revenue split is still much friendlier to creators that what they can earn on <a href="https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/developer-economics">platforms like Roblox</a>.</p>
<p>Building cross-platform secondary gaming platforms is host to plenty of its own challenges. The platforms involved not only have to deal with stacking revenue share fees on non-PC platforms, but some hardware platforms that are reticent to allow them all, an area where Sony has been a particular stickler with PlayStation. The long-term success of these platforms may ultimately rely on greater independence, something that seems hard to imagine happening on consoles and mobile ecosystems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic&#8217;s remarkable impact on the app industry has not slowed down in 2021. In fact, consumer spending in apps has hit a new record in the first quarter of this year, <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/consumers-spent-32-billion-on-apps-in-q1-2021-the-biggest-quarter-since-records-began/">a new report from App Annie</a> indicates. The firm says consumers in Q1 2021 spent $32 billion on apps across both iOS and Google Play, up 40% year-over-year from Q1 2020. It&#8217;s the largest-ever quarter on record, App Annie also notes.</p>
<p>Last year saw both app downloads and consumer spend increase, as people rapidly adopted apps under coronavirus lockdowns &#8212; including apps for work, school, shopping, fitness, entertainment, gaming and more. App Annie <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">previously reported</a> a record 218 billion in global downloads and record consumer spend of $143 billion for the year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132696" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132696" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2132696" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Consumer-Spend.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Consumer-Spend.png 2002w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Consumer-Spend.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Consumer-Spend.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Consumer-Spend.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Consumer-Spend.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Consumer-Spend.png?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Consumer-Spend.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2132696" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These trends have continued into 2021, it seems, with mobile consumers spending roughly $9 billion more in Q1 2021 compared with Q1 2020. Although iOS saw larger consumer spend than Android in the quarter &#8212; $21 billion vs. $11 billion, respectively &#8212; both stores grew by the same percentage, 40%.</p>
<p>But the types of apps driving spending were slightly different from store to store.</p>
<p>On Google Play, Games, Social and Entertainment apps saw the strongest quarter-over-quarter growth in terms of consumer spending, while Games, Photo &amp; Video, and Entertainment apps accounted for the strongest growth on iOS.</p>
<p>By downloads, the categories were different between the stores, as well.</p>
<p>On Google Play, Social, Tools, and Fiance saw the biggest download growth in Q1, while Games, Finance and Social Networking drove download growth for iOS. Also on Google Play, other top categories included Weather (40%) and Dating (35%), while iOS saw Health and Fitness app downloads grow by a notable 25% &#8212; likely a perfect storm as New Year&#8217;s Resolutions combined with continued stay-at-measures that encouraged users to find new ways to stay fit without going to a gym.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132692" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132692" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2132692" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Downloads.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Downloads.png 2002w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Downloads.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Downloads.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Downloads.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Downloads.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Downloads.png?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Downloads.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2132692" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie</p></div></p>
<p>The top apps in the quarter remained fairly consistent, however. TikTok beat Facebook, in terms of downloads, and was followed by Instagram, Telegram, WhatsApp and Zoom. But the short-form video app only made it to No. 2 in terms of consumer spend, with YouTube snagging the top spot. Tinder, Disney+, Tencent Video, and others followed. (Netflix has dropped off this chart as it now directs new users to sign up directly, rather than through in-app purchases).</p>

<p>Though Facebook&#8217;s apps have fallen behind TikTok by downloads, its apps &#8212; including Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram &#8212; still led the market in terms monthly active users (MAUs) in the quarter. TikTok, meanwhile, ranked No. 8 by this metric.</p>
<p>Up-and-comers in the quarter included privacy-focused messaging app Signal, which saw the strongest growth in the quarter by both downloads and MAUs &#8212; a calculation that App Annie calls &#8220;breakout apps.&#8221;  Telegram closely followed, as u<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/following-riots-alternative-social-apps-and-private-messengers-top-the-app-stores/">sers bailed from mainstream social after the Capitol riot.</a> Another &#8220;breakout&#8221; app was MX TakaTak, which is filling the hole in the market for short-form video that resulted from India&#8217;s ban  of TikTok.</p>

<p>Gaming, meanwhile, drove a majority of the quarter&#8217;s spending, as usual, accounting for $22 billion of the spend &#8212; $13 billion on iOS (up 30% year-over-year) and $9 billion on Android (up 35%). Gamers downloaded about a billion titles per week, up 15% year-over-year from 2020.</p>
<p>Among Us! dropped to No. 2 in the quarter by downloads, replaced by Join Clash 3D, while DOP 2: Delete One Part jumped 308 places to reach No. 3.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132688" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132688" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2132688" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Top-Games-Rankings.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="385" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Top-Games-Rankings.png 2002w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Top-Games-Rankings.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Top-Games-Rankings.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Top-Games-Rankings.png?resize=768,435 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Top-Games-Rankings.png?resize=680,385 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Top-Games-Rankings.png?resize=1536,869 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Top-Games-Rankings.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2132688" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie</p></div></p>
<p>Roblox led by consumer spend, followed by Genshin Impact, Coin Master, Pokemon Go and others. And although Among Us! dropped on the charts by downloads, it remained No. 1 by monthly active users in the quarter, followed by PUBG Mobile, Candy Crush Saga, Roblox and others.</p>
<p>App Annie notes that the pandemic also accelerated the mobile gaming market, with game downloads outpacing overall downloads by 2.5x in 2020. It predicts that mobile gaming will reach  $120 billion in consumer spending this year, or 1.5x all other gaming formats combined.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is adding two new voices to Siri&#8217;s English offerings, and eliminating the default &#8216;female voice&#8217; selection in the latest beta version of iOS. This means that every person setting up Siri will choose a voice for themselves and it will no longer default to the voice assistant being female, a topic that has <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/05/22/female-by-default/">come up quite a bit</a> with regards to bias in voice interfaces over the past few years.</p>
<p>The beta version should be live now and available to program participants.</p>
<p>I believe that this is the first of these assistants to make the choice completely agnostic with no default selection made. This is a positive step forward as it allows people to choose the voice that they prefer without the defaults bias coming into play. The two new voices also bring some much needed variety to the voices of Siri, offering more diversity in speech sound and pattern to a user picking a voice that speaks to them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In some countries and languages Siri already defaults to a male voice. But this change makes the choice the users’ for the first time.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to introduce two new Siri voices for English speakers and the option for Siri users to select the voice they want when they set up their device,&#8221; a statement from Apple reads. &#8220;This is a continuation of Apple’s long-standing commitment to diversity and inclusion, and products and services that are designed to better reflect the diversity of the world we live in.”</p>
<p>The two new voices use source talent recordings that are then run through Apple&#8217;s Neural text to speech engine, making the voices flow more organically through phrases that are actually being generated on the fly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard the new voices and they sound pretty fantastic, with natural inflection and smooth transitions. They&#8217;ll be a welcome addition of choice to iOS users. I&#8217;ll embed some samples here after the beta drops.</p>
<p>This latest beta also upgrades the Siri voices in Ireland, Russia and Italy to Neural TTS, bringing the total voices using the new tech to 38. Siri now handles 25 billion requests per month on over 500M devices and supports 21 languages in 36 countries.</p>
<p>The new voices are available to English speaking users around the world and Siri users can select a personal preference of voice in 16 languages.</p>
<p>It seems very likely that these two new voices are just the first expansion in Siri&#8217;s voice selections. More diversity in voice, tone and regional dialect can only be a positive development for how inclusive smart devices feel. Over the past few years we have finally begun to see some movement from Amazon, Google and Apple to aggressively correct situations where the assistants have revealed bias in their responses to queries that use negative or abusive language. Improvements there, as well as in queries on social justice topics and overall accessibility improvements are incredibly key as we continue to see an explosion of voice-first or voice-native interfaces. These kinds of choices matter, especially at a scale of hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast-growing fintech <a href="https://www.pipe.com/">Pipe</a> has raised another round of funding at a $2 billion valuation, just weeks after </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/this-pipe-ing-hot-startup-just-raised-50m-to-be-the-nasdaq-for-revenue/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raising $50M in growth funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to sources familiar with the deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the round is still ongoing, Pipe has reportedly raised $150 million in a “massively oversubscribed” round led by Baltimore, Md.-based <a href="http://www.greenspringassociates.com">Greenspring Associates</a>. While the company has signed a term sheet, more money could still come in, according to the source. Both new and existing investors have participated in the fundraise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increase in valuation is “a significant step up” from the company’s last raise. Pipe &#8212; which only launched its platform last June &#8212; has declined to comment on the deal.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A little over one year ago, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/pipe-a-financing-platform-for-saas-companies-raises-6m-seed-led-by-craft-ventures/">Pipe raised a $6 million seed round led by Craft Ventures</a> to help it pursue its mission of giving SaaS companies a funding alternative outside of equity or venture debt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The buzzy startup’s goal with the money was to give SaaS companies a way to get their revenue upfront, by pairing them with investors on a marketplace that pays a discounted rate for the annual value of those contracts. (Pipe describes its buy-side participants as “a vetted group of financial institutions and banks.”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a few weeks ago, Miami-based Pipe announced a new raise — $50 million in “strategic equity funding” from a slew of high-profile investors. Siemens’ Next47 and Jim Pallotta’s Raptor Group co-led the round, which also included participation from Shopify, Slack, HubSpot, Okta, Social Capital’s Chamath Palihapitiya, Marc Benioff, Michael Dell’s MSD Capital, Republic, Alexis Ohanian’s Seven Seven Six and Joe Lonsdale.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="XajkIV9Oy3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/this-pipe-ing-hot-startup-just-raised-50m-to-be-the-nasdaq-for-revenue/">This Pipe-ing hot startup just raised $50M to be the &#8216;Nasdaq for revenue&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;This Pipe-ing hot startup just raised $50M to be the &#8216;Nasdaq for revenue&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/this-pipe-ing-hot-startup-just-raised-50m-to-be-the-nasdaq-for-revenue/embed/#?secret=XajkIV9Oy3" data-secret="XajkIV9Oy3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, Pipe co-CEO and co-founder Harry Hurst said the company was also broadening the scope of its platform beyond strictly SaaS companies to “any company with a recurring revenue stream.” This could include D2C subscription companies, ISP, streaming services or a telecommunications companies. Even VC fund admin and management are being piped on its platform, for example, according to Hurst.</span></p>
<p>“When we first went to market, we were very focused on SaaS, our first vertical,” he told TC at the time. “Since then, over 3,000 companies have signed up to use our platform.” Those companies range from early-stage and bootstrapped with $200,000 in revenue, to publicly-traded companies.</p>
<p>Pipe’s platform assesses a customer’s key metrics by integrating with its accounting, payment processing and banking systems. It then instantly rates the performance of the business and qualifies them for a trading limit. Trading limits currently range from $50,000 for smaller early-stage and bootstrapped companies, to over $100 million for late-stage and publicly traded companies, although there is no cap on how large a trading limit can be.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 2021, tens of millions of dollars were traded across the Pipe platform. Between its launch in late June 2020 through year’s end, the company also saw “tens of millions” in trades take place via its marketplace. Tradable ARR on the platform is currently in excess of $1 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the world changes rapidly, so too do the most traditional of industries. That includes property tech and insurtech. Luckily for us, two of the top minds in those spaces are joining us on an upcoming episode of Extra Crunch Live.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-fifth-wall-and-hippo">April 21 at noon PT/3pm ET, Fifth Wall&#8217;s Brendan Wallace and Hippo&#8217;s Assaf Wand will hang out with us</a> to discuss fundraising across these evolving verticals and explain specifically how fundraising went down for Hippo. The duo will also take a look at pitch decks sent in by the audience and give their live feedback. (If you&#8217;d like your deck to be featured on a future episode of Extra Crunch Live, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">hit up this link</a>.)</p>
<p>But first, a little more information on our guests.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Brendan Wallace is cofounder and managing partner at Fifth Wall, one of the top VC firms dealing in property tech, future of work, new retail and more. Fifth Wall portfolio companies include OpenDoor, Classpass, AllBirds, Clutter, Eden, Lime, and Lyric, among others.</p>
<p>Before Fifth Wall, Wallace was an entrepreneur himself, cofounding Identified (acquired by Workday) and Cabify, a huge ridesharing service in Latin America. He was also an angel investor, with investments in Bonobos, Dollar Shave Club, Lyft, and SpaceX, to name a few.</p>
<p>The TL;dr version on Wallace is that he&#8217;s been around the block in the tech world plenty of times, and has experience across a variety of sectors. There&#8217;s lots to learn here.</p>
<p>Assaf Wand is cofounder and CEO of Hippo, a home insurance provider for the digital age. Wand is also a serial entrepreneur, founding a company that designed and developed consumer products called Sabi. It was acquired in 2015.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Wand has also worn the hat of an investor, serving as strategic investor for Intel Capital and also spending time at McKinsey as a consultant.</p>
<p>Hippo has raised more than $700 million from investors that include Bond, Felicis, Comcast and Horizons.</p>
<p>Wallace invested in Hippo&#8217;s Series B round, and we&#8217;re anxious to hear why Wand and Wallace chose each other, how they work together today, and what advice they have for founders looking to raise capital and scale their businesses.</p>
<p>The episode goes down at noon PT/3pm ET on April 21 and is free to all who want to check it out live. On-demand access to the content is reserved for Extra Crunch members only. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-fifth-wall-and-hippo">Register to come hang out with us here.</a></p>

<p><b>Dear Sophie: </b></p>
<p><b>I’m a founder of a startup on an E-2 investor visa and just got engaged! My soon-to-be spouse will sponsor me for a green card. </b></p>
<p><b>Are there any minimum salary requirements for her to sponsor me? Is there anything I should keep in mind before starting the green card process?</b></p>
<p><b>— Betrothed in Belmont</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear Betrothed,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congratulations on your engagement and thanks for reaching out!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several things to keep in mind before you tie the knot. These important considerations are particularly relevant since you’re a startup founder, currently on an </span><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/016-e-2-visa-for-founders-and-employees/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-2 visa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and if you’ll continue to live in California. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My law partner, </span><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/member/anita-koumriqian/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anita Koumriqian</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who is an expert in family immigration law, recently interviewed </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lydiaehsu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lydia Hsu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kara-foster-86572825/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kara Foster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the co-founders of </span><a href="https://www.fosterhsu.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foster Hsu, LLP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a California family law firm, on our </span><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/064-immigration-prenups-divorce-with-lydia-hsu-and-kara-foster/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">podcast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They cover the ins and outs of family law and prenups, and what to know before you tie the knot and pursue the green card process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California is a community property state, which means if your marriage doesn’t work out, all of the assets acquired by you and your spouse during the marriage will be divided up equally unless you have a prenuptial agreement (prenup) in place before you get married. Since you are an </span><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/e-2-visa-treaty-investors/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-2 investor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and I imagine you have significant assets, it’s beneficial to consider entering into a prenup before you become legally married. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is especially important for you in pursuing a </span><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/marriage-based-green-cards/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marriage-based green card</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) often looks to see whether couples are commingling funds in a joint bank account when assessing if your marriage is good-faith to approve your green card.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2100312" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="1024" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A prenup may not be right for you,” says Kara, “but at least you should be educated going into a marriage and know what you’re going to be responsible for, what your obligations are going to be, and how California is going to treat your property, assets and income during the marriage. We have a lot of people coming in later for a divorce saying, ‘If I had known this, I would have done everything differently.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to California, there are several other community property states in the U.S., including Arizona, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the immigration side of things, keep in mind that the Affidavit of Support (</span><a href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-864"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Form I-864</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), which is required for a marriage-based green card, will remain in effect even in the event of a divorce — and takes precedence over any spousal support designated in a prenup.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Weeknd and Nifty Gateway will be holding a sale on Saturday with two main components, both of them involving a previously unreleased song — which will not be available on any other platforms in the future — plus visual art developed by Strange Loop Studios in consultation with The Weeknd.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There will be a flash sale of three different pieces of art, each with different filtered clip of the song. These pieces will be available in unlimited quantities, albeit for a limited amount of time. And there will be a 24-hour exclusive auction of a one-of-a-kind piece — accompanied by the song, in full and unfiltered.</p>

<p>“Blockchain is democratizing an industry that has historically been kept shut by the gatekeepers,&#8221; The Weeknd said in a statement. &#8220;I’ve always been looking for ways to innovate for fans and shift this archaic music biz and seeing NFT’s allowing creators to be seen and heard more than ever before on their terms is profoundly exciting. I intend to contribute to this movement and can see that very soon it will be weaved into the music industry&#8217;s mechanics.”</p>
<p>NFTs are basically assets on the blockchain tied to digital art, whether that&#8217;s images, audio, video or another format. The art itself is usually reproducible, but the NFTs indicate the true ownership.</p>
<p>Interest has exploded in recent months, thanks to auctions at eye-popping prices, as well as hopes that the technology will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/explosive-inclusive-potential-nfts/">bring more financial benefits to artists in the digital world</a>. At the same time, they&#8217;ve also faced criticism for factors including their energy usage and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change">resulting impact on climate change</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://niftygateway.com/profile/theweeknd">The auction</a> will begin at 11am Pacific on Saturday, April 3.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">President Joe Biden has earmarked $174 billion from his ambitious infrastructure plan to build out domestic supply chains for electric vehicles, noting the imperative for United States automakers to “compete globally” to win a larger share of the EV market.</p>
<p>The funds are just one part of Biden’s plan, which calls for an ambitious $2 trillion infrastructure investment across multiple sectors. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/">The Fact Sheet</a> for the plan includes six references to China – one of these in reference to the size of the Chinese EV market, which is two-thirds larger than the domestic U.S. market. Chinese manufacturer Foxconn, Apple’s main supplier, said in February it was considering producing EVs at its Wisconsin plants – just weeks after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/apple-supplier-foxconn-reaches-tentative-agreement-to-build-fiskers-next-electric-car/">tentatively agreeing</a> to manufacture an EV for startup-turned-SPAC Fisker.</p>
<p>To ensure Americans actually purchase these domestically manufactured EVs, Biden also plans to establish sales rebates and tax incentives for the purchase of American-made EVs, though the size of the credit has not been released. Customers can already cash in a $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs, but it is not available to automakers that have sold more than 200,000 electric cars – people looking to purchase a Tesla, for instance, would not qualify for the credit. It’s unclear whether the new tax credit would raise or abolish the sales limit for automakers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The plan also proposes using some of the funds to build a national EV charging network of 500,000 stations by 2030. A <a href="https://article.images.consumerreports.org/prod/content/dam/surveys/Consumer_Reports_Electric_Vehicles_Fuel_Economy_National_August_2020">recent survey from Consumer Reports</a> found that the availability of public charging stations was a major concern deterring people from looking into an EV for their next vehicle purchase.</p>
<p>On the transit side, Biden’s administration said the funds will also go towards replacing 50,000 diesel transit vehicles and electrifying at least 20 percent of school busses, through a new program administered by the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p>The plan places a huge emphasis on providing good-paying jobs to American workers, but it still has a long way to go. It must be approved by Congress before becoming law.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/">sweeping infrastructure package</a> put forward today by President Joe Biden comes with a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/03/31/biden-infrastructure-climate-plan/">price tag of roughly $2 trillion (and hefty tax hikes)</a> but gives startups and the broader tech industry about $1 trillion worth of reasons to support it.</p>
<p>Tech companies have spent the past decade or more developing innovations that can be applied to old-world industries like agriculture, construction, energy, education, manufacturing and transportation and logistics. These are industries where structural impediments to technology adoption have only recently been broken down by the advent of incredibly powerful mobile devices.</p>
<p>Now, these industries are at the heart of the President&#8217;s plan to build back better, and the hundreds of billions of dollars that are earmarked to make America great again will, either directly or indirectly, be a huge boost to a number of startups and large tech companies whose hardware and software services will enable much of the work the Biden administration wants done.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The climate-oriented investment in Biden&#8217;s new plan would be roughly ten times what came through ARRA,&#8221; wrote Shayle Kann, a partner with the investment firm, Energy Impact Partners. &#8220;It would present a huge opportunity for a variety of climate tech sectors, ranging from clean electricity to carbon management to vehicle electrification.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much of this will look and feel like a Green New Deal, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/a-biden-presidency-doesnt-need-a-green-new-deal-to-make-progress-on-climate-change/">but sold under a package of infrastructure modernization and service upgrades that the country desperately needs</a>.  Indeed, it&#8217;s hard to invest in infrastructure without supporting the kind of energy efficiency and renewable development plans that are at the core of the Green New Deal, since efficiency upgrades are just a part of the new way of building and making things.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A Biden presidency doesn&#8217;t need a Green New Deal to make progress on climate change&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/a-biden-presidency-doesnt-need-a-green-new-deal-to-make-progress-on-climate-change/embed/#?secret=d6HrPfmpO5" data-secret="d6HrPfmpO5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Over $700 billion of the proposed budget will go to improving resiliency against natural disasters; upgrading critical water, power, and internet infrastructure; and rehabilitating and improving public housing, federal buildings, and aging commercial and residential real estate.</p>
<p>Additionally there&#8217;s another roughly $400 billion in spending earmarked for boosting domestic manufacturing of critical components like semiconductors; protecting against future pandemics; and creating regional innovation hubs to promote venture capital investment and startup development intended to &#8220;support the growth of entrepreneurship in communities of color and underserved communities.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Climate resiliency </strong></p>
<p>Given the steady drumbeat of climate disasters that hit the U.S. over the course of 2020 (and their combined estimated price tag of nearly $100 billion), it&#8217;s not surprising that the Biden plan begins with a focus on resiliency.</p>
<p>The first big outlay of cash outlined in the Biden plan would call for $50 billion in financing to improve, protect and invest in underserved communities most at risk from climate disasters through programs from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and new initiatives from the Department of Transportation. Most relevant to startups is the push to fund initiatives and technologies that can help prevent or protect against extreme wildfires; rising sea levels and hurricanes; new agriculture resource management; and &#8220;climate-smart&#8221; technologies.</p>
<p>As with most of Biden&#8217;s big infrastructure initiatives, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/as-wildfires-burn-through-california-heres-what-startups-are-doing/">there are startups tackling these issues</a>. Companies like <a href="https://cornea.is/">Cornea</a>, <a href="https://emergencyreporting.com/">Emergency Reporting</a>, <a href="https://www.zonehaven.com/">Zonehaven</a> are trying to solve different facets of the fire problem; while<a href="https://www.greenbiz.com/article/4-tech-startups-are-fighting-coastal-climate-resilience-and-winning"> flood prediction and weather monitoring startups</a> are floating up their services too. Big data analytics, monitoring and sensing tools, and robotics are also becoming<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/agriculture/"> fixtures on the farm</a>. For the President&#8217;s water efficiency and recycling programs, companies like <a href="https://epiccleantec.com/">Epic CleanTec</a>, which has developed wastewater recycling technologies for residential and commercial buildings.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Fables of the reconstruction</strong></p>
<p>Energy efficiency and building upgrades represent by far the biggest chunk of the Biden infrastructure package &#8212; totaling a whopping $400 billion of the spending package and all devoted to upgrading homes, offices, schools, veteran&#8217;s hospitals and federal buildings.</p>
<p>It gives extra credence to the thesis behind new climate-focused funds from <a href="https://www.gspv.vc/">Greensoil Proptech Ventures</a> and <a href="https://fifthwall.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Traffic&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLUGcTMuGm8wLVjzpeTmlvRBjJMWoVi-6P591j__EFrBqeocmZwXJNBoCeL0QAvD_BwE">Fifth Wall Ventures</a>, which is raising<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/fifth-wall-adds-new-partner-as-it-seeks-at-least-200-million-for-a-new-climate-impact-fund/"> a $200 million investment vehicle</a> to focus on energy efficiency and climate tech solutions.</p>
<p>As Fifth Wall&#8217;s newest partner Greg Smithies noted last year, there&#8217;s a massive opportunity in building retrofits and startup technologies to improve efficiency.</p>
<p>“What excites me about this space is that there’s so much low-hanging fruit. And there’s $260 trillion worth of buildings,” Smithies said last year. “The vast majority of those are nowhere up to modern codes. We’re going to have a much bigger opportunity by focusing on some not-so-sexy stuff.”</p>
<p>Decarbonizing real estate can also make a huge difference in the fight against global climate change in addition to the its ability to improve quality of life and happiness for residents. “Real estate consumes 40% of all energy. The global economy happens indoors,” said Fifth Wall co-founder Brendan Wallace, in a statement. “Real estate will be the biggest spender on climate tech for no other reason than its contribution to the carbon problem.”</p>
<p>The Biden plan calls on Congress to enact new grant programs that award flexible funding to jurisdictions that take concrete steps to eliminate barriers to produce affordable housing. Part of that will include $40 billion to improve the infrastructure of the public housing in America.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a project that startups like<a href="https://www.blocpower.io/"> BlocPower</a> are already deeply involved in supporting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get the superhero masks and capes out. The Biden Harris Climate announcement is literally a plan to save the American economy and save the planet. This is Avengers Endgame in real life. We can&#8217;t undo the last five years&#8230; but we can make smart, massive investments in the climate infrastructure of the future,&#8221; wrote Donnel Baird, the chief executive and founder of BlocPower. &#8220;Committing to electrify 2 million American buildings, moving them entirely off of fossil fuels is exactly that &#8212; an investment in America leading theway towards creating a new industry creating American jobs that cannot be outsourced, and beginning to reduce the 30% of greenhouse gas emissiosn that come from buildings.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of the package that directly impacts startups, there&#8217;s a proposal for a $27 billion Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator to mobilize private investment, according to the White House. The focus will be on distributed energy resources, retrofits of residential, commercial and municipal buildings; and clean transportation. A focus there will be on disadvantaged communities that haven&#8217;t had access to clean energy investments.</p>
<p><b>Financing the future startup nation </b></p>
<p>&#8220;From the invention of the semiconductor to the creation of the Internet, new engines of economic growth have emerged due to public investments that support research, commercialization, and strong supply chains,&#8221; the White House wrote. &#8220;President Biden is calling on Congress to make smart investments in research and development, manufacturing and regional economic development, and in workforce development to give our workers and companies the tools and training they need to compete on the global stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>To enable that, Biden is proposing another $480 billion in spending to boost research and development &#8212; including $50 billion for the National Science Foundation to focus on semiconductors and advanced communications technologies, energ technologies and biotechnology. Another $30 billion is designed to be targeted toward rural development; and finally the $40 billion in upgrading research infrastructure.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also an initiative to create ARPA-C, a climate focused Advanced Research Projects Agency modeled on the DARPA program that gave birth to the Internet. There&#8217;s $20 billion heading toward funding climate-focused research and demonstration projects for energy storage, carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, advanced nuclear and rare earth  element separations, floating off shore wind, biofuel/bioproducts, quantum computing and electric vehicles.</p>
<p>The bulk of Biden&#8217;s efforts to pour money into manufacturing represents another $300 billion in potential government funding. That&#8217;s $30 billion tickets for biopreparedness and pandemic preparedness; another $50 billion in semiconductor manufacturing and research; $46 billion for federal buying power for new advanced nuclear reactors and fuel, cars, ports, pumps and clean materials.</p>
<p>Included in all of this is an emphasis on developing economies fairly and equally across the country &#8212; that means $20 billion in regional innovation hubs and a Community Revitalization Fund, which is designed to support innovative, community-led redevelopment efforts and $52 billion in investing in domestic manufacturers &#8212; promoting rural manufacturing and clean energy.</p>
<p>Finally for startups there&#8217;s a $31 billion available for programs that give small businesses access to credit, venture capital, and R&amp;D dollars. Specifically, the proposal calls for funding for community-based small business incubators and innovation hubs to support growth in communities of color and underserved communites.</p>
<p><strong>Water and power infrastructure </strong></p>
<p>America&#8217;s <a href="https://infrastructurereportcard.org/">C- grade infrastructure</a> has problems extending across the length and breadth of the country. It encompasses everything from crumbling roads and bridges to a lack of clean drinking water, failing sewage systems, inadequate recycling facilities, and increasing demands on power generation, transmission and distribution assets that the nation&#8217;s electricity grid is unable to meet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Across the country, pipes and treatment plants are aging and polluted drinking water is endangering public health. An estimated six to ten million homes still receive drinking water through lead pipes and service lines,&#8221; the White House wrote in a statement.</p>
<p>To address this issue, Biden&#8217;s calling for an infusion of $45 billion into the Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund and Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act grants. While that kind of rip and replace project may not directly impact startups, another $66 billion earmarked for upgrades to drinking water, wastewater and stormwater systems and monitoring and managing the presence of contaminants in water will be a huge boon for the vast array of water sensing and filtration startups that have flooded the market in the past decade or more (<a href="https://www.imagineh2o.org/mission">there&#8217;s even an entire incubator dedicated to just water technologies</a>).</p>
<p>The sad fact is that water infrastructure in America has largely failed to keep up in large swaths of the country, necessitating this kind of massive capital infusion.</p>
<p>And what&#8217;s true for water is also true increasingly true for power. Outages cost the U.S. economy upwards of $70 billion per year, according to the White House. So when analysts compare those economic losses to a potential $100 billion outlay, the math should be clear. For startups that math equals dollar signs.</p>
<p>Calls to build a more resilient transmission system should be music to the ears of companies like <a href="https://veir.com/team/">Veir,</a> which is developing a novel technology for improving capacity on transmission lines (a project that the Biden administration explicitly calls out in its plan).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Biden&#8217;s infrastructure plans could boost startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/startups-in-energy-storage-housing-transportation-and-agriculture-could-see-boost-under-biden-plans/embed/#?secret=O222Ze9J8O" data-secret="O222Ze9J8O" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Biden plan also includes more than money, calling for the creation of a new Grid Deployment Authority within the Department of Energy to better leverage rights-of-way along roads and railways and will support financing tools to develop new high-voltage transmission lines, the White House said.</p>
<p>The administration doesn&#8217;t stop there. Energy storage and renewable technologies are going to get a boost through a clutch of tax credits designed to accelerate their deployment. That includes a ten-year extension and phase down of direct-pay investment tax credits and production tax credits. The plan aslo calls for clean energy block grants and calls for the government to purchase nothing but renewable energy all day for federal buildings.</p>
<p>Complimenting this push for clean power and storage will be a surge in funding for waste remediation and cleanup, which is getting a $21 billion boost under Biden.</p>
<p>Companies like <a href="https://www.renewellenergy.com/">Renewell Energy</a>, or various non-profits<a href="https://grist.org/energy/plugging-abandoned-oil-wells-carbon-offsets/"> that are trying to plug abandoned oil wells</a>, can play a role here. There&#8217;s also the potential to recover other mineral deposits or reuse the wastewater that comes from these wells. And here, too, investors can find early stage businesses looking for an angle. Part of the money frm the Biden plan will aim to redevelop brownfields and turn them into more sustainable businesses.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where some of the indoor agriculture companies, like Plenty, Bowery Farms, AppHarvest could find additional pots of money to turn unused factory and warehouse space into working farms. Idled factories could also be transformed into hubs for energy storage and community based power generation and distribution facilities, given their position on the grid.</p>
<p>&#8220;President Biden’s plan also will spur targeted sustainable, economic development efforts through the Appalachian Regional Commission’s POWER grant program, Department of Energy retooling grants for idled factories (through the Section 132 program), and dedicated funding to support community-driven environmental justice efforts – such as capacity and project grants to address legacy pollution and the cumulative impacts experienced by frontline and fenceline communities,&#8221; the White House wrote.</p>
<p>Key to these redevelopment efforts will be the establishment of pioneer facilities that demonstrate carbon capture retrofits for large steel, cement, and chemical production facilities. But if the Biden Administration wanted to, its departments could go a step further to support lower emission manufacturing technologies like the kind companies including Heliogen, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/24/business/heliogen-solar-bill-gates-rio-tinto/index.html">which is using solar power to generate energy for a massive mining operation</a>, or Boston Metal, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/eying-sustainability-gains-for-its-supply-chain-bmw-backs-boston-metals-co2-free-iron-production-tech/">which is partnering with BMW</a> on developing a lower emission manufacturing process for steel production.</p>

<p>Critical to ensuring that this money gets spent is a $25 billion commitment to finance pre-development activities, that could help smaller project developers, as Rob Day writes in <em>Forbes</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I’ve written about elsewhere, <a class="color-link" title="https://impactalpha.com/local-project-developers-are-key-to-ensuring-a-just-energy-transition/" href="https://impactalpha.com/local-project-developers-are-key-to-ensuring-a-just-energy-transition/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://impactalpha.com/local-project-developers-are-key-to-ensuring-a-just-energy-transition/" aria-label="local project developers are key">local project developers are key</a> to getting sustainability projects built where they will actually do the most good — in the communities hit hardest by both local pollution and climate change impacts. These smaller project developers have lots of expenses they must pay just to get to the point where private-sector infrastructure construction investments can come in,&#8221; Day wrote. &#8220;Everyone in sustainability policy talks about supporting entrepreneurs, but in reality much of the support is aimed at technology innovators and not these smaller project developers who would be the ones to actually roll out those technology innovations. Infrastructure investors are typically much more reticent to provide capital before projects are construction-ready.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Building a better Internet </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Broadband internet is the new electricity. It is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, to participate equally in school learning, health care, and to stay connected,&#8221; the White House wrote. &#8220;Yet, by one definition, more than 30 million Americans live in areas where there is no broadband infrastructure that provides minimally acceptable speeds. Americans in rural areas and on tribal lands particularly lack adequate access. And, in part because the United States has some of the highest broadband prices among OECD countries, millions of Americans can’t use broadband internet even if the infrastructure exists where they live.&#8221;</p>
<p>The $100 billion that the Biden Administration is earmarking for broadband infrastructure includes goals to meet 100 percent high-speed broadband coverage and prioritizes support for networks owned, operated, or faffiliated with local governments, non-profits and cooperatives.</p>
<p>Attendant with the new cash is a shift in regulatory policy that would open up opportunities for municipally-owned or affiliated providers and rural electric co-ops from competing with prive providers and requiring internet providers to be more transparent about their pricing. This increased competition is good for hardware vendors and ultimately could create new businesses for entrepreneurs who want to become ISPs of their own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Americans pay too much for the internet – much more than people in many other countries – and the President is committed to working with Congress to find a solution to reduce internet prices for all Americans, increase adoption in both rural and urban areas, hold providers accountable, and save taxpayer money,&#8221; the White House wrote.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://getleeway.com/en">Leeway</a>, a French startup that is building an end-to-end software-as-a-service solution for your contracts. Leeway lets you centralize all your contracts in a single repository, go through multiple negotiation steps and trigger a DocuSign event for the signature.</p>
<p>The company raised a $4.2 million seed round from HenQ, Kima Ventures as well as several business angels, such as the founders of Algolia, Eventbrite, Spendesk, MeilleursAgents, Livestorm and Luko.</p>
<p>If you’re working for the legal department of your company, you’re probably working with multiple tools. Chances are you’re using Microsoft Word to write a contract, a cloud service to store and share the contract with your teammates and business partners, an e-signature and archival service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Leeway is optimizing this worklfow at every step. First, you can store all your contracts on Leeway. In addition to making it easier to find a contract later down the road, you can get reminders when a contract is about to expire so that you can renew a contract.</p>
<p>Second, you can edit your contract from Leeway directly. For instance, a manager can review a contract and write changes in Leeway’s interface. The employee can then start a revision and save a new version of the contract.</p>
<p>After that, you can send the contract from the same interface. Administrators can set up approval workflows so that several people need to approve a contract before it is signed. As everything is centralized, you can get an overview of all your contracts that are currently in the pipeline.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132609" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132609" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Leeway-Workspace.png" alt="" width="1024" height="566" class="size-full wp-image-2132609" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Leeway-Workspace.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Leeway-Workspace.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Leeway-Workspace.png?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Leeway-Workspace.png?resize=768,425 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Leeway-Workspace.png?resize=680,376 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Leeway-Workspace.png?resize=1536,849 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Leeway-Workspace.png?resize=2048,1132 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Leeway-Workspace.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2132609" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Leeway</p></div></p>
<p>Up next, Leeway is thinking about integrating conditional clauses within the product. Usually, big companies have several versions of the same clause —&nbsp;very favorable, favorable, not so favorable, etc. When a client is negotiating, Leeway customers could switch the clause from very favorable to favorable for instance.</p>
<p>Right now, around 30 companies are using Leeway to manage their contracts. Clients include Voodoo, Evaneos, Ifop and Fitness Park. “We have a very specific customer base — the legal department of companies with 100 to 500 employees,” co-founder and CEO Antoine Fabre told me.</p>
<p>It doesn’t mean that smaller and bigger companies shouldn’t be using Leeway. But companies with less than 100 employees don’t necessarily have a full-fledged legal department. The sales team or the finance department could act as the legal-ish team. But Leeway still has a lot of room to grow.</p>

	</p>
<p>We can find inspiration on how to do just that by taking a look at how 20th-century lawmakers reined in the railroad monopolies, which similarly turned from darlings of industry to destructive forces of stagnation.</p>
<h2>We’ve been here before</h2>
<p>More than a century ago, a familiar story of a nation coming to terms with the unanticipated effects of technological disruption was unfolding across a rapidly industrializing United States.</p>
<p>While the first full-scale steam locomotive debuted in 1804, it took until 1868 for more powerful and cargo-friendly American-style locomotives to be introduced.</p>
<p>The more efficient and cargo-friendly locomotives caught on like wildfire, and soon steel and iron pierced through mountains and leaped over gushing rivers to connect Americans from coast to coast.</p>
<p>Soon, railroad mileage <a href="https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/united-states-history-primary-source-timeline/rise-of-industrial-america-1876-1900/railroads-in-late-19th-century/">tripled</a> and a whopping<a href="https://www.lib.uiowa.edu/exhibits/previous/railroad/"> 77% of all intercity traffic and 98% of passenger business</a> would be running on rails, ushering in an era of cost-efficient transcontinental travel that would recast the economic fortunes of the entire country.</p>
<p>As is often the case with disruptive technologies, early success would come with a heavy human cost.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, abuse and exploitation ran rampant in the railroad industry, with up to 3% of the labor force suffering<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=4q2wAAAAIAAJ"> injuries or dying during the course of an average year.</a></p>
<p>Railroad trust owners soon became key constituents of the widely maligned group of businessmen colloquially known as robber barons, whose corporations <a href="https://archive.org/details/railroadedtransc0000whit">devoured everything in their path</a> and made life difficult for competitors and new entrants in particular.</p>
<p>The railroad proprietors achieved this by maintaining carefully constructed walled gardens, allowing them to run competitors into the ground by means of extortion, exclusion and everything in between.</p>
<p>While these methods proved wildly successful for railroad owners, the rest of society languished under stifled competition and an utter lack of concern for consumers’ interests.</p>
<h2>Everything old is new again</h2>
<p>Learning from past experiences certainly doesn’t seem to be humankind’s strong suit.</p>
<p>In fact, most of our concerns with the tech industry are mirror images of the objections 20th-century Americans had against the railroad trusts.</p>
<p>Similar to the robber barons, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, et al., have come to dominate the major thoroughfares of trade in a fashion that leaves little space for competitors and startups.</p>
<p>By instating double-digit platform fees, establishing strict limitations on payment processing protocols, and jealously hoarding proprietary data and APIs, Big Tech has erected artificial barriers to entry that make replicating their success all but impossible.</p>
<p>Over the past several years, tech giants have also taken to cannibalizing third-party solutions by providing private-label versions — à la AmazonBasics — to the point where Big Tech’s clients are finding themselves undercut and outplayed by the platform-holders themselves.</p>
<p>Given the above, it is not surprising that the pace at which tech startups are created in the U.S. <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/201505/leigh-buchanan/the-vanishing-startups-in-decline.html">has been declining for years</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, VC veterans such as Albert Wenger have called attention to the “<a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2018/06/02/american-tech-giants-are-making-life-tough-for-startups">kill zone</a>” around Big Tech, and if we are to reinvigorate the competitive fringe around our large tech conglomerates, something has to be done fast.</p>
<h2>Why we need to stop talking about breaking up Big Tech</h2>
<p>The 20th-century playbook for taming monopolistic railroad trusts offers several helpful lessons for dealing with Big Tech.</p>
<p>For first steps, Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in 1887 and tasked it with administering reasonable and just rates for access to proprietary railroad networks.</p>
<p>Due to partisan politicking, the ICC proved relatively toothless, however. It wasn’t until Congress passed the 1906 Hepburn Act, which separated the function of transportation from the ownership of the goods being shipped, that we started seeing true progress.</p>
<p>By disallowing self-dealing and double-dipping in proprietary platforms, Congress succeeded in opening up access on equal terms both to existing competitors and startups alike, making a once-unnavigable thicket of exploitative practices into the metallic backbone of American prosperity that we know today.</p>
<p>This could never have been achieved by simply breaking the railroad trusts into smaller pieces.</p>
<p>In fact, when it comes to platforms and networks, bigger often is better for everyone involved thanks to <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/01/why-some-platforms-thrive-and-others-dont">network effects</a> and several other factors that conspire against smaller platforms.</p>
<p>Most importantly, when access and interoperability rules are done right, bigger platforms can sustain wider and wider constellations of startups and third parties, helping us grow our economic pie instead of shrinking it.</p>
<h2>Making digital markets work for startups</h2>
<p>In our post-pandemic economy, our attention should be in helping tech platforms <em>grow better</em> as they grow bigger instead of cutting them down to size.</p>
<p>Ensuring that startups and competitors can access these platforms on equitable terms and at fair prices is a necessary first step.</p>
<p>There are numerous other tangible actions policymakers can take today. For example, rewriting the rules on data portability, pushing for wider standardization and interoperability across platforms, and reintroducing net neutrality would go a long way in addressing what ails the industry today.</p>
<p>With President Joe Biden’s recent <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/22/president-biden-announces-his-intent-to-nominate-lina-khan-for-commissioner-of-the-federal-trade-commission/">nod</a> toward “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/technology/monopoly-antitrust-lina-khan-amazon.html">Amazon’s Antitrust Antagonist</a>” Lina Khan as the next commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, these changes suddenly seem more likely than ever.</p>
<p>In the end, all of us would stand to benefit from a robust fringe of startups and competitors that thrive on the shoulders of giants and the platforms they have made.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Deliver<em>oops</em>.</p>
<p>After a lackluster IPO pricing run, shares of Deliveroo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/deliveroo-prices-its-shares-on-the-lse-at-3-90-at-the-lower-end-of-the-range-with-a-market-cap-of-7-59b/">are lower today</a>, marking a disappointing debut for the hot delivery company.</p>
<p>A good question to ask at this juncture is why Deliveroo struggled with its IPO during a historically strong moment for tech flotations. The European unicorn listed on the London Stock Exchange, however, possibly placing its public offering in a different climate than recent IPO successes listed in the United States.</p>

<hr />
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/equity-monday-deliveroo-servicetitan-and-robinhood-for-everywhere/">noted on Monday</a> that there were local concerns regarding Deliveroo&#8217;s governance and treatment of workers. At the time, however, those worries merely led to a decrease in the company&#8217;s IPO valuation.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1995214 size-medium alignright" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Why did Deliveroo struggle when it began to trade? Is it suffering from cultural dissonance between its high-growth model and more conservative European investors? Let&#8217;s peek at the numbers and find out.</p>
<h2>Deliveroo versus DoorDash</h2>
<p>To ground us, let&#8217;s explore how differently the public markets value Deliveroo and DoorDash. If they are valued somewhat closely, we&#8217;ll be able to dismiss the question of whether the British delivery giant is really being treated with more skepticism than its American comp.</p>
<p>Not that we care, really, one way or the other about any single company&#8217;s value. But we do care if listing on a European exchange &#8212; I refuse to acknowledge Brexit this morning &#8212; means that companies valuing growth over profits are going to generate more stick than praise when they list.</p>
<p>So, briefly, here&#8217;s the data we need to make our comparison. We&#8217;ll start <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/280253921/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/2020_Q4_GAAP-and-Non-GAAP-tables_CLEAN.pdf">with DoorDash</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>DoorDash 2020 revenue: $2.886 billion.</li>
<li>DoorDash 2020 revenue growth (YoY): 226%.</li>
<li>DoorDash market cap: $41.98 billion.</li>
<li>Implied 2020 revenue multiple: 14.54x.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now, <a href="https://corporate.deliveroo.co.uk/protected_file/175/">Deliveroo</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deliveroo 2020 revenue: £1.191 billion.</li>
<li>Deliveroo 2020 revenue growth (YoY): 54.3%.</li>
<li>Deliveroo market cap: £5.55 billion.</li>
<li>Implied 2020 revenue multiple: 4.66x.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies embrace the use of data, hiring more data scientists, a roadblock persists around sharing that data. It requires too much copying and pasting and manual work. <a href="http://hex.tech">Hex</a>, a new startup, wants to change that by providing a way to dispense data across the company in a streamlined and elegant way.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced a $5.5 million seed investment, and also announced that it&#8217;s opening up the product from a limited beta to be more widely available. The round was led by Amplify Partners with help from Box Group, XYZ, Data Community Fund, Operator Collective and a variety of individual investors. The company closed the round last July, but is announcing it for the first time today.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Barry McCardel says that it&#8217;s clear that companies are becoming more data-driven and hiring data scientists and analysts at a rapid pace, but there is an issue around data sharing, one that he and his co-founders experienced first-hand when they were working at Palantir.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>They decided to develop a purpose-built tool for sharing data with other parts of the organization that are less analytically technical than the data science team working with these data sets. &#8220;What we do is we make it very easy for data scientists to connect to their data, analyze and explore it in notebooks. [&#8230;] And then they can share their work as interactive data apps that anyone else can use,&#8221; McCardel explained.</p>
<p>Most data scientists work with their data in online notebooks like Jupyter where they can build SQL queries and enter Python code to organize it, chart it, and so forth. What Hex is doing is creating this super-charged notebook that lets you pull a data set from Snowflake or Amazon Redshift, work with and format the data in an easy way, then drag and drop components from the notebook page &#8212; maybe a chart or a data set &#8212; and very quickly build a kind of app that you can share with others.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132551" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132551" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2132551" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-9.58.28-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="Hex app example with data elements at the top and live graph below it." width="680" height="566" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-9.58.28-AM.jpg 978w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-9.58.28-AM.jpg?resize=150,125 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-9.58.28-AM.jpg?resize=300,250 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-9.58.28-AM.jpg?resize=768,639 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-9.58.28-AM.jpg?resize=680,566 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-9.58.28-AM.jpg?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2132551" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hex</p></div></p>
<p>The startup has 9 employees including co-founders McCardel, CTO Caitlin Colgrove and VP of architecture Glen Takahashi. &#8220;We&#8217;ve really focused on the team front from an early stage, making sure that we&#8217;re building a diverse team. And actually today our engineering team is majority female, which is definitely the first time that that&#8217;s ever happened to me,&#8221; Colgrove said.</p>
<p>She is also part of a small percentage of female founders. A report last year <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/more-than-half-of-us-startups-lack-women-in-leadership-according-to-silicon-valley-banks-2020-women-in-us-technology-leadership-report-301016878.html#:~:text=The%20percentage%20of%20US%20startups,a%20least%20one%20female%20founder.">from Silicon Valley Bank</a>, found that while the number was heading in the right direction, only 28% of US startups have at least one female founder. That was up from 22% in 2017.</p>
<p>The company was founded in late 2019 and the founders spent a good part of last year building the product and working with design partners. They have a small set of paying customers, and are looking to expand that starting today. While customers still need to work with the Hex team for now to get going, the plan is to make the product self-serve some time later this year.</p>
<p>Hex&#8217;s early customers include Glossier, imgur and Pave.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coursera, an edtech unicorn, will begin its life today as a public company after <a href="https://investor.coursera.com/news/news-details/2021/Coursera-Announces-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering/default.aspx">pricing</a> its IPO at $33 per share yesterday evening. Using a simple share count, the company&#8217;s valuation comes to $4.30 billion, or $4.38 billion if its underwriters exercise their option to purchase shares at its offering price.</p>
<p>A more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/coursera-set-to-roughly-double-its-private-valuation-in-impending-ipo">diluted share count</a> pushes the valuation of Coursera over the $5 billion mark.</p>
<p>Coursera was last valued at $2.57 billion after <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2020/07/17/online-learning-platform-coursera-raises-130-million-at-reported-25-billion-valuation/?sh=397231d8688f">raising $130 million</a> in mid-2020, per <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook data</a>. The company&#8217;s simple valuation is around a 67% gain on that final private figure; that gain rises to just over 70% if its underwriters purchase their available shares.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Using a diluted valuation, Coursera has roughly doubled its final private price. In under a year. For edtech investors looking to Coursera to help determine public market sentiment regarding the exit-value of their investments, TechCrunch reckons it&#8217;s a pretty good day.</p>
<p>The amount of private capital at play in edtech startups is staggering; billions and billions of potential returns could get a further shot in the arm if Coursera trades well this morning. And the very same billions of invested capital could lose the smile that Coursera&#8217;s seemingly-strong IPO pricing brought them.</p>
<p>There are other edtech debuts in the wings. TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/nerdy-varsity-tutors-spac/?tpcc=ECTW2020">covered Nerdy&#8217;s plans to go public</a>, via a SPAC, for example.</p>
<p>Private investors, who put well north of $10 billion into edtech companies globally in 2020, are modestly bullish on edtech exit volume this year. In a prior <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/edtech-valuations-arent-skyrocketing-but-investors-see-more-exit-opportunities/">TechCrunch venture capitalist survey</a>, GSV managing partner Deborah Quazzo said the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Exit volume is rising already with a wide range of strategic and financial buyers of edtech companies — something that didn’t exist before. You will see numerous high-value exits in the first half of 2021. It’s the public market “exits” that have really lagged and that I hope turns around in 2021 and 2022. There are numerous global companies that could go public and the addition of SPAC IPOs creates another positive dynamic.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Coursera IPO <em>pricing</em> at least, meets the mark for a high-value exit. Which could lead where? Extending Quazzo&#8217;s thinking a single step, perhaps a strong Coursera first-day trading session will bolster SPAC interest in taking more edtech startups and unicorns public.</p>
<p>Such a move could lock-in valuations for a number of currently illiquid edtech startups, and perhaps begin to return chunks of invested capital in the historically out-of-fashion technology sector.</p>

<p>Adding to that sentiment is Owl Ventures&#8217; managing director Ian Chiu, who told TechCrunch in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/edtech-valuations-arent-skyrocketing-but-investors-see-more-exit-opportunities/">the same survey</a> that &#8220;the pipeline for potential IPO candidates coming from the edtech sector continues to grow larger.&#8221; Let&#8217;s hope &#8212; parsing the Coursera S-1 filing was good fun and we&#8217;d like another at-bat with an edtech IPO document.</p>
<p>More when Coursera trades.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Spotify this morning announced it&#8217;s significantly expanding its selection of personalized playlists with the addition of three new categories of playlists under the heading of &#8220;Spotify Mixes.&#8221; This collection will include artist mixes, genre mixes, and decade mixes &#8212; meaning you&#8217;ll gain access to a sizable number of new mixes with easy-to-understand titles, like 2010s [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify this morning <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-31/introducing-new-spotify-mixes-personalized-playlists-featuring-your-favorite-artists-genres-and-decades/">announced</a> it&#8217;s significantly expanding its selection of personalized playlists with the addition of three new categories of playlists under the heading of &#8220;Spotify Mixes.&#8221; This collection will include artist mixes, genre mixes, and decade mixes &#8212; meaning you&#8217;ll gain access to a sizable number of new mixes with easy-to-understand titles, like 2010s Mix, R&amp;B Mix, Pop Mix, Drake Mix, Selena Gomez Mix, and so on &#8212; or whatever reflects your own tastes and interests.</p>
<p>The company says the idea for the Spotify Mixes was inspired by its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/27/spotify-daily-mix/">Daily Mixes, launched in fall 2016.</a></p>
<p>The Daily Mixes had been one of the company&#8217;s first big expansions in personalization beyond its flagship playlist, Discover Weekly, as they introduced a large set of playlists that reflected users&#8217; listening history. Today, Daily Mixes bring together your recent listens with other tracks to keep you engaged &#8212; and the new Spotify Mixes essentially do the same, as they&#8217;re populated with music you like plus &#8220;fresh tracks.&#8221; The difference is that the new mixes have clearer names and a more specific focus, in some cases.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Spotify Mixes will be available to all users globally, including both Free users and Premium subscribers. At launch, you can find them within Search in the &#8220;Made for You&#8221; hub.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll easily spot them, too, as Spotify has already populated its app with a selection of mixes in the top three rows of the &#8220;Made for You&#8221; hub. Here, you&#8217;ll find &#8220;Your Genre Mixes,&#8221; &#8220;Your Artist Mixes,&#8221; and &#8220;Your Decade Mixes&#8221; &#8212;  each with a horizontally scrollable selection of mixes to get you started. Spotify says each mix category will be updated frequently and will always have several playlists available.</p>
<p>The new feature somewhat competes with a similar offering on Pandora, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/28/pandora-takes-on-spotify-with-dozens-of-personalized-playlists-built-using-its-music-genome/">launched</a> three years ago. The SiriusXM-owned music app had used its Music Genome technology to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/28/pandora-takes-on-spotify-with-dozens-of-personalized-playlists-built-using-its-music-genome/">create personalized playlists across a number of attributes</a>, including also genre and mood. While not an apples-to-apples comparison, necessarily, Pandora&#8217;s launch had instantly expanded its users&#8217; access to personalized playlists by the dozens. It&#8217;s actually a bit surprising that it took Spotify as long as it did to offer a competitive response.</p>
<p>The launch comes shortly after the addition of <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-29/run-to-spotifys-workout-hub-for-all-new-celebrity-inspired-playlists/">new celebrity-inspired playlists</a> to Spotify&#8217;s &#8220;Workout Hub&#8221; earlier this week.</p>
<p>Spotify says the new playlists are rolling out today to global users.</p>
