					<description><![CDATA[Like Microsoft and Apple in the wake of their after-hours earnings reports, Shopify shares are having a muted reaction to the better-than-expected results.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Canadian e-commerce juggernaut Shopify this morning reported its <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/572064924/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Press-Release-Q2-2021.pdf">second-quarter financial performance</a>. Like Microsoft and Apple in the wake of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/microsoft-bests-earnings-estimates-as-azure-posts-51-growth-shares-fall/">their after-hours earnings reports</a>, its shares are having a muted reaction to the better-than-expected results.</p>
<p>In the second quarter of 2021, Shopify reported revenues of $1.12 billion, up 57% on a year-over-year basis. The company&#8217;s subscription products grew 70% to $334.2 million, while its volume-driven merchant services drove their own top line up 52% to $785.2 million.</p>
<p>Investors <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/shopify-tops-1-billion-in-quarterly-sales-for-the-first-time-as-e-commerce-spending-stays-strong-11627471417">had expected</a> Shopify to report revenue of $1.05 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shopify also posted an enormous second-quarter profit. Indeed, from its $1.12 billion in total revenues, Shopify managed to generate $879.1 million in GAAP net income. How? The outsized profit came in part thanks to $778 million in unrealized gains related to equity investments. But even with those gains filtered out, Shopify&#8217;s adjusted net income of $284.6 million more than doubled its year-ago Q2 result of $129.4 million. Shopify&#8217;s earnings per share sans unrealized gains came to $2.24, far ahead of an expected 97 cents.</p>
<p>After reporting those results, Shopify shares are up less than a point.</p>
<p>In light of somewhat muted reactions to Big Tech earnings surpassing expectations, it&#8217;s increasingly clear that investors were anticipating that leading tech companies would trounce expectations in the second quarter; their earnings beats were largely priced-in ahead of the individual reports.</p>
<p>The rest of Shopify&#8217;s quarter is a series of huge figures. In the second three-month period of 2021, the company posted gross merchandise volume (GMV) of $42.2 billion, up 40% compared to the year-ago period. That was more than a billion dollars <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3719731-shopify-q2-2021-earnings-preview">ahead of expectations</a>. And the company&#8217;s monthly recurring revenue (MRR) grew 67% to $95.1 million in the quarter. That&#8217;s quick.</p>
<p>Shopify is priced like the growth will continue. Using its Q2 revenue result to generate an annual run rate for the firm, Shopify is currently valued at around 43x its present top line. That&#8217;s aggressive for a company that generates the minority of its revenues from recurring software fees, an investor favorite. Instead, investors seem content to pay what is effectively top dollar for the company&#8217;s blend of GMV-based service revenues and more traditional software incomes.</p>
<p>Consider the public markets bullish on the continued pace of e-commerce growth.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how BigCommerce, a Shopify competitor and fellow public company, performs when it reports earnings in early August. Shares of BigCommerce are up more than 3% today in wake of Shopify&#8217;s results. Ironic given Shopify&#8217;s relaxed market reaction to its own results? Sure, but who said the public markets are fair?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the minutes before its quarterly earnings call this morning, Spotify played advertisements for its Originals &amp; Exclusives, like the true crime show &#8220;Deathbed Confessions,&#8221; and the sex and relationships podcast &#8220;Call Her Daddy,&#8221; which Spotify recently acquired in <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/spotify-call-her-daddy-alex-cooper-exclusive-1234996840/">a deal worth $60 million</a>. Sure, it&#8217;s kind of hilarious to hear a recording of host Alex Cooper&#8217;s voice say, &#8220;Hey, daddy gang!&#8221; as investors log in to an 8 AM call, but the subtext rang clear: Spotify is serious about growing its podcast business.</p>
<p>Given how many <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/spotify-acquires-podz-a-podcast-discovery-app/">podcasting companies</a> Spotify has acquired over the past few years, it would be concerning if there hadn&#8217;t been significant growth in this realm. Among Spotify users who already listen to podcasts, podcast listening increased 30% year over year, with total hours consumed up 95%. Meanwhile, podcast ad revenue increased by 627%, which out-performed expectations. Spotify attributes this success to a triple-digit year over year gain at its in-house studios (The Ringer, Parcast, Spotify Studios, and Gimlet), and exclusive deals with &#8220;The Joe Rogan Experience&#8221; and the Obamas&#8217; Higher Ground studio. Spotify also referenced its November <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spotify-buying-podcast-hosting-and-ad-company-megaphone-for-235m/">acquisition of Megaphone</a>, a podcast hosting and ad company.</p>
<p>&#8220;The continued out-performance is is currently limited only by the availability of our inventory, which is something we&#8217;re actively solving for,&#8221; said CEO Daniel Ek. &#8220;The days of our ad business accounting for less than 10% of our total revenue are behind us, and going forward, I expect ads to be a substantial part of our revenue mix.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>In April, Spotify launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/spotify-launches-paid-podcasts-through-new-anchor-feature/">paid podcast subscriptions</a> &#8212; through Anchor, the podcast host that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/spotify-gimlet-anchor-340-million/">bought in 2019</a>, creators can choose to certain content behind a paywall. Apple launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-go-live-worldwide/">similar feature</a> too, but it&#8217;s still too early to know how these subscription services will impact listeners and creators. However, Spotify did share a bit more information about its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-spotify-audience-network-an-audio-ad-marketplace/">Audience Network</a>, an audio ad marketplace. Since its rollout in April, Spotify&#8217;s &#8220;monetizable podcast inventory&#8221; tripled. Spotify has also seen a &#8220;meaningful&#8221; increase in unique advertisers and a &#8220;double-digit lift&#8221; in CPMs (cost per thousand ad impressions), but didn&#8217;t provide specific figures.</p>
<p>Still, the more power a platform like Spotify has over the podcasting industry, the fewer options creators will have for monetization &#8212; already, the ubiquity of streaming platforms has taken a toll on musicians, who are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/justice-at-spotify-demands-better-compensation-and-increased-transparency-for-musicians/">working together</a> to demand better compensation from Spotify. The <a href="https://www.unionofmusicians.org/justice-at-spotify">Justice at Spotify</a> movement points out that on average, artists get $0.0038 per stream of a song, which means that a song needs to be streamed 263 times to make a single dollar. Spotify has continued to grow during the pandemic, but since live shows are musicians&#8217; best way to make money in the age of streaming, artists have struggled while it&#8217;s unsafe to go on tour.</p>

<p>On this morning&#8217;s earnings call, Ek pointed to live performances on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">Greenroom</a>, Spotify&#8217;s Clubhouse clone, as a potential way for musicians to increase revenue. In the past quarter, Spotify has tested <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/spotify-launches-a-virtual-concert-series-with-the-black-keys-and-more/">live concerts</a> as an income stream, partnering with artists like The Black Keys. Still, smaller artists might not trust the platform given its refusal to make streaming itself a more viable way to get paid for their work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Live is a meaningful thing for many of our creators, and it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re excited about,&#8221; said Ek, adding that Spotify saw positive results from its digital live events thus far. &#8220;We want to provide as many opportunities for creators to create more ways to turn a listen into a fan, and turn fans into super fans, and increase the monetization for those creators.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Spotify missed its target for monthly active users (MAUs) in Q2, other key metrics trended upward, like paid subscriber growth and revenue. The platform attributes this road bump in MAU growth to the lingering impact of COVID-19, as well as an issue Spotify had with its third-party email verification system.</p>
<p>&#8220;In full disclosure, this was an issue on our end,&#8221; said CFO Paul Vogel. &#8220;The estimate right now was that it was about 1 to 2 million of MAU growth that was impacted by the friction created by this email verification change. It&#8217;s since been corrected and should not be an impact in Q3.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of Spotify&#8217;s 365 million MAUs, 165 million (about 42.5%) are paid subscribers &#8212; that&#8217;s still far beyond its next biggest competitor, Apple Music, which had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/apple-music-surpasses-60-million-subscribers/">60 million subscribers</a> in 2019, but hasn&#8217;t released updated figures since.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Anomaly detection is one of the more difficult and underserved operational areas in the asset-servicing sector of financial institutions. Broadly speaking, a true anomaly is one that deviates from the norm of the expected or the familiar. Anomalies can be the result of incompetence, maliciousness, system errors, accidents or the product of shifts in the underlying structure of day-to-day processes.</p>
<p>For the financial services industry, detecting anomalies is critical, as they may be indicative of illegal activities such as fraud, identity theft, network intrusion, account takeover or money laundering, which may result in undesired outcomes for both the institution and the individual.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">

			There are different ways to address the challenge of anomaly detection, including supervised and unsupervised learning.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Detecting outlier data, or anomalies according to historic data patterns and trends can enrich a financial institution’s operational team by increasing their understanding and preparedness.</p>
<h2>The challenge of detecting anomalies</h2>
<p>Anomaly detection presents a unique challenge for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, the financial services industry has seen an increase in the volume and complexity of data in recent years. In addition, a large emphasis has been placed on the quality of data, turning it into a way to measure the health of an institution.</p>
<p>To make matters more complicated, anomaly detection requires the prediction of something that has not been seen before or prepared for. The increase in data and the fact that it is constantly changing exacerbates the challenge further.</p>
<h2>Leveraging machine learning</h2>
<p>There are different ways to address the challenge of anomaly detection, including supervised and unsupervised learning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Single-use plastic containers make up a huge amount of the world&#8217;s waste, but so far no one has come up with a good way to replace them that&#8217;s also easy for consumers and cost-effective. <a href="https://algramo.com/en/home/">Algramo</a> may have cracked this nut with a combination of reusable containers and distribution points that both makes and saves money, and it&#8217;s about to expand its footprint in a big way with a new $8.5M funding round.</p>
<p>Founded in Chile nearly a decade ago, Algramo is now findings its legs as companies in multiple industries find themselves under immense pressure to go green.</p>
<p>One compelling way to reduce waste is to cut down on single-use plastics, which of course are common for everything from cleaning supplies to soft drinks. The difficulty is figuring out how exactly to do that while not passing the cost on to consumers. If the product is eco-friendly but costs twice as much, only the wealthy will buy it and those working on a tight budget have to go, against their better judgment, with the cheaper, worse option.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;People are deciding between their pocket or their planet,&#8221; said CEO José Manuel Moller. &#8220;So we needed to be cheaper and better. So rather than make things more complex, we&#8217;re trying to make things more simple.&#8221;</p>

<p>The solution they&#8217;ve arrived at after years of testing is a modified label for existing products, like detergent or shampoo, that includes an RFID tag that lets the consumer easily refill the bottle at a dispenser. Sold at bulk prices and having removed the cost of packaging (30 percent of the product&#8217;s cost, Moller estimated), it&#8217;s cheaper and requires nothing but going to a different shelf at the store.</p>
<p>The breakthrough wasn&#8217;t the idea, though, it was the relationships with big brands. If someone has to drive past their normal grocery store to refill your dish soap, they&#8217;re more likely to just buy a new bottle. Similarly, if only products on offer for bulk refilling are random off-brand ones, the same thing happens. So Algramo has had to make the case to the Walmarts and Unilevers of the world — and very recently they started to listen, at least at the local level.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was going to happen with or without Algramo,&#8221; said CEO José Manuel Moller. &#8220;But we&#8217;re integrating into their supply chains, working with the retailers and the brand so they don&#8217;t disrupt existing relationships. And actually, ordering the product in bulk saves them about 60 percent of the space.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are arrangements in place with Unilever, Nestlé, Colgate-Palmolive, and Walmart Chile.  By offering a turnkey solution that brings together big brands and big retailers and saves consumers a little cash, everyone gets what they want. Originally Algramo operated using a fleet of small vehicles equipped with dispensers, but ultimately the retail avenue proved to be the more successful one.</p>

<p>There are now Algramo stations all over Chile, with around 50,000 users repurchasing products in bulk. Those products, by the way, were determined not by profitability but by which is the worst polluter. The worst by far, Moller said, is beverages, but those present a different challenge — one the company is happily taking on but not quite ready to debut.</p>
<p>Instead, there are frequently used products like laundry soap and toiletries — even dog food (dry, obviously&#8230; for now). And Algramo was careful to ensure that users can buy as much or as little as they want at the bulk rate, making it more accessible for people who have to make every penny count.</p>
<p>The work in Chile has helped validate the idea at scale, and now the company is raising money ahead of a smattering of pilots around the world. There are projects underway in Jakarta, New York, Mexico, and London, all of which no doubt require a lot of local footwork, since different regulations, sub-companies, and distribution networks will necessitate new contracts and agreements everywhere they attempt to make a beachhead.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what the $8.5M series A is all about: the global push. It was led by Mexico&#8217;s Dalus Capital, with participation from (deep breath) Angel Ventures, FEMSA Ventures, Volta Ventures, Impact Assets, University Venture Fund, Century Oak Capital and Closed Loop Partners’ Ventures Group (the last of which led the 2019 seed).</p>

<p>Moller said that there are parallel efforts along the lines of Algramo, but that ultimately their platform may very well end up compatible with the others. Owning both the retail and brand relationships is paramount, then those with the customer, but the last step may be adapted to different circumstances. For instance, if there&#8217;s a successful reverse logistics system in place (such as the reusable food containers common all over India) that may be part of the solution, and if someone like a grocery chain were to build their own hardware solution, Algramo would be happy to operate at least partly behind the scenes. (Also, they own several patents.)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all pie in the sky for now, as Algramo focuses on building its own presence in various major markets. If you&#8217;re in one of the locations mentioned, keep your eye out at your local big retail or grocery chain for the Algramo station, or just <a href="https://algramo.com/en/home/">check the map at the bottom of their website</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What’s big enough, bold enough and influential enough to inspire more than 10,000 people around the world to carve out three days from their intensely busy schedules? If you said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=48hoursleft&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=48hoursleft&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a>, the grand matriarch of startup tech conferences, well friend, you’d be right on the money.</p>
<p>And speaking of money, you have just 48 hours left to score the early-bird price on TC Disrupt Innovator, Founder and Investor passes. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=48hoursleft&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=48hoursleft&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy any of these passes</a> and attend all three days of Disrupt for less than $100. Here’s the catch: The early bird price expires on <strong>July 30 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>.</p>
<p>Don’t miss the dynamic 1:1 interviews and panel discussions on the Disrupt Stage. We’ve tapped high-profile speakers — all leading voices in their fields — to download their insight, trends and sage advice. You’ll hear U.S. Secretary of Transportation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/us-secretary-of-transportation-pete-buttigieg-is-coming-to-disrupt-draft/">Pete Buttigieg</a> discuss some of the major challenges of moving people and packages around the block and across the globe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Houseplant COO, Haneen Davies will join company co-founders Michael Mohr and Seth Rogen — who, it seems, has a somewhat successful side hustle as a Hollywood writer, director and actor — for a lively CBD: Cannabis Business Discussion.</p>
<p>Head on over to the Extra Crunch Stage where you’ll find strategic insight across a range of essential startup skills. Think fundraising, product iteration, tech stack development and growth marketing.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick peek at just some of what’s going down Extra Crunchy.</p>
<p><strong>How to Cultivate a Community for your Company that Actually Lasts:</strong> The word of the year in startup-land is “community.” In this panel, Community Fund’s Lolita Taub, Commsor’s Alex Angel and Seven Seven Six’s Katelin Holloway will extract buzz from reality and help founders understand the growing importance of chief community officers in startup culture and, ultimately, financial success today.</p>
<p><strong>The Path for Underrepresented Entrepreneurs:</strong> Founding a startup comes with a wide array of challenges but, unfortunately, underrepresented founders face an extra layer of bias, both conscious and unconscious. We’ll talk with Hana Mohan (MagicBell), Leslie Feinzaig (Female Founders Alliance) and Stephen Bailey (ExecOnline) about their journeys, as founders, through fundraising and scaling — and as advocates who can offer tactical insights and advice.</p>
<p>We’re just warming up, folks. You’ll hear from execs, founders and CEOs from companies like Twitter, Calendly, Mirror, Evil Geniuses, Andreessen Horowitz and plenty more. Check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">the Disrupt 2021 agenda</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We know how much you love a good startup pitch-off. Who doesn&#8217;t? It combines the thrill of live, high-stakes entertainment with learning about the hottest new thing. Plus, you get to hear feedback from some of the smartest folks in the industry, thus learning how to absolutely crush it at your next pitch meeting with a VC.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, we&#8217;re introducing a special summer edition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> that&#8217;s all pitch-off, all the time.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-startup-alley-edition?ref=12c1c3225394">July 21</a> and <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-startup-alley-edition-july-28?ref=05f802c5b3e8">July 28</a>, Extra Crunch Live will feature startups exhibiting in the Startup Alley at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=ecljuly2021suapost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=eclsuajuly&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> in September. Those startups will pitch their products/businesses to a pair of expert VC judges, who will then give their live feedback.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is usually a combination of an interview with a founder/investor duo and an audience pitch-off. But as it&#8217;s summer, and Disrupt is right around the corner, we thought it would be fun to bring you even more pitches and even more feedback.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On July 21, our expert VC judges will be Alexa von Tobel of Inspired Capital and Anis Uzzaman from Pegasus Tech Ventures. As a special thank you, all attendees of this episode of Extra Crunch Live will be entered into a random drawing for a chance to win one of three free tickets to TechCrunch Disrupt 2021.

					<description><![CDATA[In the user interface concept Google debuted today, developers are now able to see how this feature will look to the end user.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the wake of Apple&#8217;s advances into consumer privacy with initiatives like <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency">App Tracking Transparency</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/apple-launches-its-new-app-privacy-labels-across-all-its-app-stores/">App Store privacy labels</a>, Google recently announced its own plans to introduce a new &#8220;<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html">safety section</a>&#8221; on Google Play that offers more information about the data apps collect and share, and other security and privacy details. Today, the company is sharing for the first time what the new section&#8217;s user interface will look like, along with other requirements for developers.</p>
<p>In May, Google <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html">explained</a> the safety section would be designed to easily communicate to users how apps are handling their data so they could make informed choices. It said app developers would need to disclose to users whether their app uses security practices like data encryption, whether it follows Google Play&#8217;s Families policy for apps aimed at kids, whether users have a choice in data sharing, whether the app&#8217;s safety section had been verified by a third party, and if the app allowed users to request data deletion at the time of uninstalling, among other things.</p>
<p>In the user interface concept Google debuted today, developers are now able to see how this feature will look to the end user.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2183100" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2183100" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2183100" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-play-safety-section.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-play-safety-section.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-play-safety-section.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-play-safety-section.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-play-safety-section.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-play-safety-section.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-play-safety-section.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-play-safety-section.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2183100" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In the safety section, users will be able to see the developer&#8217;s explanation of what data the app collects followed by those other details, each with its own icon to serve as a visual indicator. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">When users tap into the summary, they&#8217;ll be able to then see other details like what data is collected or shared &#8212; such as location, contacts, personal information (e.g., name, email address), financial information and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">They&#8217;ll also be able to see how the data is used &#8212; for app functionality, </span>personalization<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, etc. &#8212; and whether data collection is optional. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2183102" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2183102" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2183102" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/developer-privacy-policy-google-play.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/developer-privacy-policy-google-play.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/developer-privacy-policy-google-play.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/developer-privacy-policy-google-play.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/developer-privacy-policy-google-play.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/developer-privacy-policy-google-play.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/developer-privacy-policy-google-play.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/developer-privacy-policy-google-play.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2183102" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Google says it wants to give developers plenty of time to prepare for these Play Store changes, which is why it&#8217;s now sharing more information about the data type definitions, user journey and policy requirements of the new feature. </span></p>
<p>It notes that all developers will have to provide a privacy policy by April 2022. Before, only apps that collected personal and sensitive user data were required to do so. Developers will also be required to share accurate and complete information about all the data in their safety section, including how it&#8217;s used by the app&#8217;s third-party libraries and SDKs. This is in line with what Apple demands for its apps.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2183103" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2183103" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2183103" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/timeline.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="340" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/timeline.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/timeline.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/timeline.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/timeline.png?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/timeline.png?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/timeline.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2183103" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>In October 2021, developers will be able to submit their information in the Google Play Console for review ahead of the planned launch of the safety section in Google Play, which is scheduled for the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>The company also notes it&#8217;s offering some buffer time after the section&#8217;s launch before apps must have their safety section approved by Google. However, the company says apps will have to be approved by Q2 2022 or risk having their app submissions or app updates rejected. And if an app doesn&#8217;t provide an approved safety section, the app will say &#8220;No information available.&#8221;</p>
<p>The change will help highlight how many active developers are present on Google Play, because those will be the ones who will adopt the new policy and showcase how their apps collect and use data.</p>
<p>The question that remains is how stringent Google will be about enforcing its new guidelines and how carefully apps will be reviewed. One interesting note here is that conscientious developers will be able to submit their safety section for a third-party review and then be able to promote that to users concerned about app data privacy and security.</p>
<p>This could help to address some potential criticism that these safety sections aren&#8217;t factual. That&#8217;s been a problem for Apple since the launch of its App Store privacy labels. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/29/apple-privacy-nutrition-label/">The Washington Post discovered</a> that a number of apps were displaying false information, making them less helpful to the users whose data they aimed to protect.</p>
<p>When reached for comment, however, Google declined to share more details about how the third-party verification process will work.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Duolingo, a consumer edtech company, is now more valuable per revenue dollar than the median public enterprise SaaS business.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the Chinese technology market digests a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/">new regulatory landscape</a> impacting the country&#8217;s edtech market in a sharply negative manner, U.S. education technology companies have something to cheer about: Duolingo&#8217;s IPO priced very well.</p>
<p>The language-learning unicorn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/duolingos-ipo-could-cast-golden-halo-on-edtech-startups/">initially targeted an $85 to $95 per share IPO price range</a>. That interval was later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/duolingo-boosts-ipo-price-target-in-boon-to-edtech-startups/">raised to $95 to $100 per share</a>. And then, last night, Duolingo <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/duolingo-announces-pricing-of-initial-public-offering-301342683.html">priced at $102 per share</a>, just over its raised range.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the sort of IPO pricing run that we tend to see from hot enterprise software companies (SaaS) that investors have favored heavily in recent quarters. But the stock market has also provided nigh-indulgent valuations to consumer-facing tech companies with strong brands, like Airbnb. So, the Duolingo IPO&#8217;s pricing strength should not be an utter surprise.</p>
<p>But it is a welcome result for U.S. edtech, regardless. When the company set its first IPO price range, TechCrunch noted that it was on track to earn a new, higher valuation. This led us to the following set of conclusions:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Duolingo poses a strong debut, consumer edtech startups will be able to add a golden data point to their pitch decks. A strong Duolingo listing could also signal that mission-driven startups can have impressive turns.</p></blockquote>
<p>And now Duolingo has managed to price <em>above</em> its <em>raised</em> range. Yeehaw, as they say.</p>
<p>In more prosaic terms, Duolingo has set a higher multiple for edtech revenue than we expected it to, implying that the exit value of edtech top line could be greater than private-market investors anticipated. After all, Duolingo was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/language-learning-app-duolingo-confirms-it-has-raised-35m-on-a-2-4b-valuation/">valued at around $2.4 billion last November</a>. At its IPO price, the company&#8217;s nondiluted valuation is now $3.66 billion, not counting 765,916 shares that its underwriters may purchase at the $102-per-share price if they so choose.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[The startup gives teams a way to streamline the commission process and avoid inaccurate budgets, payouts, and 'unhappy sales reps due to poor sales commission planning, reporting and administration.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://quotapath.com">QuotaPath</a>, which has developed a commission-tracking solution for sales and revenue teams, has raised $21.3 million in a Series A funding round led by Insight Partners.</p>
<p>Existing backers ATX Ventures, Integr8d Capital, Stage 2 Capital and HubSpot Ventures also participated in the financing, which brings the startup&#8217;s total funding to $26.3 million since its 2018 inception.</p>
<p>The funding comes amid a year of growth for the startup, which has dual headquarters in Austin and Philadelphia. Specifically, QuotaPath has seen 600% revenue growth since January 2021. It has over 5,000 users on the platform, 40% of which are paid. Customers include Guru, Contractbook, Mailgun, Cloud Academy, SaaSOptics and OSG.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>AJ Bruno, Cole Evetts and Eric Heydenberk founded QuotaPath with the mission of helping “companies build and scale high-performing, motivated growth teams.” The startup said it gives teams a way to streamline the commission process and avoid inaccurate budgets, incorrect payouts, and “unhappy sales reps due to poor sales commission planning, reporting and administration.”</p>
<p>Through real-time CRM integrations with Salesforce, HubSpot and Close.com, sales reps are able to glean more insight into earnings and quota attainment, the company said.</p>

<p>Bruno is no stranger to startups, having co-founded Austin-based PR analytics company TrendKite, which sold to rival Cision in 2019 for $225 million. It was there that Bruno ran the sales and management teams, and about “30 folks into it,” was having some issues with compensation and commission. It took a month and getting several people involved to get the situation sorted. After trying to onboard a sales and commission tool for eight months and “failing miserably,” Bruno saw an opportunity.</p>
<p>“The reps needed to understand what their comp plans were and they didn&#8217;t have real-time visibility into the earnings and forecasting of their compensation,” he said. So he and Evetts (who was director of revenue and sales operations at TrendKite) ultimately set about creating a workflow to solve the problem. Heydenberk joined as a technical co-founder and the company went on to raise about $5 million in pre-seed and seed funding.</p>
<p>“What we ultimately said was going to be our north star is that we want the sales team and the sales reps to easily understand the compensation plans, and to do that, we had to build an onboarding setup where it didn&#8217;t look like a spreadsheet that was in Excel because most sales reps don&#8217;t understand Excel,” Bruno recalled. The team then spent a year working with end users and sales reps to build the back-end infrastructure of the platform so that sales teams could “interpret what was actually happening and all the mechanisms behind it.”</p>
<p>Requirements were that it was fast to onboard (less than one week) and easily adjustable so that customers could make changes in real-time themselves and not have to wait on a company to make them.</p>
<p>“With QuotaPath, a sales team can forecast more earnings and create more goals around what they want to do,” Bruno said, “and connect those goals to the bottom line of the company.”</p>

<p>The startup launched its paid platform in June 2020 and works with companies with as few as three reps to as many as a few hundred that range from SaaS to commerce shops to low-tech businesses such as wedding venues and funeral homes.</p>
<p>“With 10.5 million salespeople in the U.S., this is a very large market,” Bruno said. Indeed, there are a number of other startups addressing the space. Earlier this year,<a href="http://captivateiq.com/"> CaptivateIQ</a>, which has developed a no-code platform to help companies design customized sales commission plans, announced it had raised $46 million in a Series B round led by Accel.</p>

<p>QuotaPath currently has 28 employees and plans to use its new capital to double its headcount by year’s end. It also plans to work on scaling partnerships and expanding product offerings to finance and HR functions.</p>
<p>Rachel Geller, managing director at Insight Partners, is taking a seat on the company’s board as part of the financing. She said that a priority of Insight Onsite, the firm’s ScaleUp engine, is to help its portfolio “build high-performing and scalable sales and marketing functions.”</p>
<p>“Our sales experts are in the trenches understanding the challenges sales teams face, and tracking sales commissions is top of mind,” she said. “Organizations need a formula-free solution to their current pain of spreadsheets and legacy solutions, and QuotaPath presents a clear alternative.”</p>
<p>In particular, Geller said Insight was impressed by QuotaPath’s “ease of use and fast time to deploy” compared to other solutions.</p>
<p>“QuotaPath customers can be up and running in days,” she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter this morning will launch a pilot in the U.S. aimed at testing the potential for e-commerce on its platform. The company is introducing a new &#8220;Shop Module&#8221; that offers brands, businesses and other retailers the ability to showcase their products to Twitter users directly on the business&#8217; profile. Users will then be able to scroll through a carousel of product images in the module and tap through on a product they&#8217;re interested in purchasing. This opens up the business&#8217;s website inside the Twitter app itself, where the customer can learn more about the product in question and opt to make a purchase.</p>
<p>The Shop Module will appear in a new, dedicated space at the top of a supported Twitter profile, which can be seen by U.S. users in English on iOS devices.</p>
<p>The company told TechCrunch that only businesses with a Professional Profile will be able to use the feature at this time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Professional Profiles, which <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBusiness/status/1384968745156755458">began testing in April</a>, give businesses, nonprofits, publishers and creators the ability to display specific information about their business directly on their profile, including things like their address, phone number, operating hours and more. Essentially, it&#8217;s the Twitter equivalent to something like a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/pages/set-up">Facebook Page</a> for a business.</p>
<p>At launch, the new Shop Module will be made available to only a small group of pilot testers. In addition to gaming retailer <a href="https://twitter.com/GameStop" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/GameStop&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627564431868000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHg0cqZDRjihyEmld5SL90gWhxMyQ">@GameStop</a> and travel brand <a href="https://twitter.com/ArdenCove" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/ArdenCove&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627564431868000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8ppJKhlLMylrdio9TEqhhboJCqg">@ArdenCove</a>, Twitter says there will only be approximately 10 other brands across the lifestyle, traditional retail, gaming, media and entertainment, tech and telco industries who will gain access to the new feature.</p>
<p>At present, Twitter isn&#8217;t offering a way for interested businesses to sign up for the pilot because the company is only in the initial phases of testing this feature, it said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2183081" style="width: 325px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2183081" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2183081" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Arden-Cove-GIF.gif?w=315" alt="" width="315" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2183081" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>While Twitter users often discuss products on the app and even reach out to companies directly for help with purchases, it&#8217;s unclear whether users will come to view Twitter as a shopping platform.</p>
<p>With the pilot, Twitter aims to better understand what could help it make that shift by tracking which types of products drive traffic to online retailers. For example, it wants to determine whether people are inspired by online conversations in the heat of the moment &#8212; like sports fans buying team apparel &#8212; or whether Twitter users could be encouraged to make purchases of a more lasting impact, like products for a new skincare routine. Having a diverse lineup of early pilot testers will help the company to compare data across verticals to learn what works best.</p>
<p>Twitter says it will also work directly with businesses to better understand their needs through the creation of a new Merchant Advisory Board, which will consist of &#8220;best-in-class examples&#8221; of merchants on Twitter.</p>
<p>The company earlier this year mentioned its plans to expand into e-commerce. At <a href="https://investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/twitter-analyst-day/default.aspx">Twitter&#8217;s Analyst Day</a> presentation in February, where it first announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">its Super Follow platform</a> for creators, the company also briefly spoke about its e-commerce investments.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re … starting to explore ways to better support commerce on Twitter,” Twitter revenue lead Bruce Falck said during the event. “We know people come to Twitter to interact with brands and discuss their favorite products. In fact, you may have even noticed some businesses already developing creative ways to enable sales on our platform.</p>
<p>“This demand gives us confidence in the power of combining real-time conversation with an engaged and intentional audience. Imagine easily discovering, and quickly purchasing, a new skincare product or trendy sneaker from a brand you follow with only a few clicks,” Falck added.</p>
<p>Since then, Twitter has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/twitter-tests-new-e-commerce-features-for-tweets/">tested a new e-commerce feature for tweets</a>, which allowed businesses to link out to online product pages &#8212; like those on a Shopify store, for instance.</p>

<p>Twitter CFO Ned Segal <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/social-commerce/2021/twitter-cfo-points-to-ecommerce-for-future-monetization/">also touted</a> the potential to shop on Twitter when speaking to investors at the J.P. Morgan Technology, Media and Communications conference in May, noting that people &#8220;do a lot of research on Twitter before they buy something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s entry into online shopping comes at a time when major tech companies and social platforms are ramping up their investments in e-commerce. Facebook has made significant moves into e-commerce with shopping features across <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/facebook-shops/">Facebook, Instagram</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/facebook-whatsapp-e-commerce-features/">WhatsApp</a>, including with initiatives like online storefronts, integrated <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-instagram-checkout">checkout</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/instagram-launches-a-new-section-for-shopping-product-drops/">product drops</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/instagram-expands-shopping-on-igtv-plans-test-of-shopping-on-reels/">video shopping</a> and more.</p>
<p>Shopify has also partnered with a number of tech platforms, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/shopify-expands-its-one-click-checkout-shop-pay-to-any-merchant-on-facebook-or-google/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/tiktok-invests-in-social-commerce-via-new-shopify-partnership/">TikTok</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-partners-with-shopify-on-online-shopping-expansion/">Google</a>, to make it easier for consumers to connect with products sold by its merchants.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Twitter previously attempted to run a commerce operation and failed. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/17/bye-buy-on-twitter/">In 2017, the company began to wind down its &#8220;Buy&#8221; button product</a>, which had allowed Twitter users to click to make purchases, and the retailer partnerships associated with that effort due to lack of traction. Clearly, the company believes the time is now right to try again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you parked your car in one of the thousands of parking spots across Calgary, there&#8217;s a good chance you paid the Calgary Parking Authority for the privilege. But soon you might be hearing from the authority after a recent security lapse exposed the personal information of vehicle owners.</p>
<p>The parking authority oversees about 14% of the paid parking spots in the Calgary region, and lets drivers pay to park their cars by a parking kiosk, online, or through the phone app by entering their vehicle&#8217;s license plate and their payment details.</p>
<p>But a logging server used to monitor the authority&#8217;s parking system for bugs and errors was left on the internet without a password. The server contained computer-readable technical logs, but also real-world events like payments and parking tickets that contained a driver&#8217;s personal information.</p>
<p>A review of the logs by TechCrunch found contact information, like driver&#8217;s full names, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses and postal addresses, as well as details of parking tickets and parking offenses — which included license plates and vehicle descriptions — and in some cases the location data of where the alleged parking offense took place. The logs also contained some partial card payment numbers and expiry dates.</p>
<p>None of the data was encrypted.</p>
<p>Because the server&#8217;s data was entangled with logs and other computer-readable data, it&#8217;s not known exactly how many people had their information exposed by the security lapse. (In 2019, the Calgary Parking Authority issued <a href="https://financialpost.com/entrepreneur/fp-startups/for-small-business-success-listening-to-your-critics-is-just-as-important-as-listening-to-your-fans">more than 450,000 parking tickets</a>, up by 69% in five years.)</p>
<p>Security researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/hak1mlukha">Anurag Sen</a> found the exposed server and asked TechCrunch for help in reporting it to its owner. The server was secured on Tuesday, a day after TechCrunch contacted the authority.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the authority confirmed that the server was exposed since May 13, though data seen by TechCrunch shows records dating back to at least the start of the year. The authority also told TechCrunch that the exposure was due to human error and that it was investigating its logs to determine if anyone else had access to the server.</p>
<p>&#8220;We at the CPA take this very seriously,&#8221; said Moe Houssaini, the acting general manager for the Calgary Parking Authority, told TechCrunch in a statement. &#8220;Any public access has been disabled and we are actively investigating to determine what exact data was impacted and what unauthorized access may have occurred. We apologize to our customers and will be reaching out to all individuals who may have been impacted. Protecting the security of our systems and privacy of our customers is a top priority of the CPA. It was an isolated error, and the database has now been secured. We are reviewing our procedures to ensure that this does not happen again,&#8221; said Houssaini.</p>
<p>The Calgary Parking Authority recently made headlines after it canceled more than a thousand parking tickets for drivers who were attending a COVID-19 vaccination center in the city.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, New York-based cashless parking startup ParkMobile <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/parkmobile-breach-exposes-license-plate-data-mobile-numbers-of-21m-users/">reported a data breach</a> that saw personal account information and license plates on some 21 million customers taken by hackers. The company blamed the breach on <a href="https://support.parkmobile.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058639032-Security-Notification-March-2021">a vulnerability</a> in an unspecified piece of third-party software.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Elon Musk mused that Tesla's batteries may eventually be two-thirds iron-based and one-third nickel-based across its products. 'And this is actually good because there’s plenty of iron in the world.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Elon Musk earlier this week made his most bullish statements yet on iron-based batteries, noting that Tesla is making a “long-term shift” toward older, cheaper lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) cells in its energy storage products and some entry-level EVs.</p>
<p>The Tesla CEO mused that the company&#8217;s batteries may eventually be roughly two-thirds iron-based and one-third nickel-based across its products. “And this is actually good because there’s plenty of iron in the world,” he added.</p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s comments reflect a change that is already underway within the automotive sector, mainly in China. Battery chemistries outside of China have been predominantly nickel-based &#8212; specifically nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) and nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA). These newer chemistries have become attractive to automakers due to their higher energy density, letting original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) improve the range of their batteries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If Musk&#8217;s bullishness is heralding a genuine shift across the EV industry, the question is whether battery makers outside of China will be able to keep up.</p>
<p>Musk is not the only automotive executive to signal a return to the LFP formula. Earlier this year, Ford CEO Jim Farley said the company would use LFP batteries in some commercial vehicles. Meanwhile, Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess announced during the company’s inaugural battery day presentation that LFP would be used in some VW entry-level EVs.</p>
<p>On the energy storage front, Musk&#8217;s comments about using LFP-based chemistries in Powerwall and Megapack are in line with other stationary energy storage companies pushing for iron-based formulas. “The stationary storage industry wants to move to LFP because it&#8217;s cheaper,” Sam Jaffe, who heads the battery research firm Cairn Energy Research Advisors, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>LFP battery cells are attractive for a few different reasons. For one, they’re not dependent on ultra-scarce and price-volatile raw materials like cobalt and nickel. (Cobalt, which is predominantly sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo, has undergone additional scrutiny due to inhumane mining conditions.) And while they are less energy-dense than nickel-based chemistries, LFP batteries are much cheaper. This is good news for those looking to spur the shift to electric vehicles because lowering the cost per vehicle will likely be key to greater EV adoption.</p>
<p>Musk clearly sees a major future for iron-based chemistries at Tesla, and his comments have helped thrust LFP back into the spotlight. But there&#8217;s one place where they&#8217;ve remained the star of the show: China.</p>
<h2>China’s monopoly on LFP</h2>
<p>“LFP is pretty much only produced in China,” Caspar Rawles, head of price and data assessments at the research firm Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, explained in a recent interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>China’s dominance in LFP battery production in part relates to a series of key LFP patents, which are managed by a consortium of universities and research institutions. This consortium came to an agreement with Chinese battery makers a decade ago under which the manufacturers would not be charged a licensing fee providing that the LFP batteries were used only in Chinese markets.</p>
<p>Hence, China cornered the LFP market.</p>
<p>Battery makers in China may benefit most from a potential tectonic shift toward LFP &#8212; specifically BYD and CATL, the latter of which already manufactures LFP batteries for Tesla vehicles built and sold in China. (Volkswagen, meanwhile, has a substantial stake in Chinese LFP maker Gotion High-Tech.) These b<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">attery makers aren’t slowing down: In January, CATL and Shenzhen Dynanonic signed an agreement with a local Chinese province to build an LFP cathode plant at a cost of $280 million over three years.</span></p>
<p>The LFP patents are due to expire in 2022, industry analyst <a href="https://roskill.com/news/batteries-the-true-drivers-behind-lfp-demand-new-safety-standards-costs-ip-rights-esg-simplified-battery-pack-designs/">Roskill explains</a>, which could give battery manufacturers outside China time to start shifting some of their production toward iron-based formulas. However, all of the planned battery factories in Europe and North America, many of which are joint ventures with South Korean industry giants like LG Chem or SK Innovation, are still focused on nickel-based chemistries.</p>
<p>“For the U.S. to take advantage of LFP&#8217;s strengths, North American manufacturing will be necessary,” Jaffe explained. “Everyone building a gigafactory in the U.S. today is planning on making high nickel chemistries. There&#8217;s an enormous unmet need for locally manufactured LFP batteries.”</p>
<p>Rawles said he expects some LFP capacity in North America and Europe in the coming years, particularly after the patents expire. He pointed out that both CATL and SVOLT, another battery maker, have been making moves in Germany &#8212; but both of these companies are Chinese, which leaves open the question of whether other Asian or Western companies can compete in the LFP market. (Stellantis chose SVOLT as one of its battery suppliers from 2025 onwards.)</p>
<p>On the energy storage front, Jaffe said he thinks “it&#8217;s inevitable that most stationary storage systems will eventually be LFP.”</p>
<p>However, not all is lost for domestic manufacturing in the United States. “The good news for building local LFP manufacturing is that the supply chain is simple: Outside of lithium, it&#8217;s iron and phosphoric acid, two cheap materials already made [in the U.S.] in large quantities,” Jaffe added.</p>
<p>In the end, it is not a question of one battery chemistry versus another. What’s more likely is what we’ve already started to see from automakers, including Tesla: Iron-based batteries will be used predominately in entry-level and cheaper vehicles, while nickel-based cells will be used for higher-end and performance cars. Many consumers will likely be content with a 200- to 250-mile-range vehicle that&#8217;s thousands of dollars cheaper than one with a range of 300 to 350 miles.</p>
<p>Automakers have also begun making moves to take control of the battery supply, whether through vertical manufacturing or joint ventures with established battery companies. That means that growing LFP capacity in North America and Europe is not only likely, but inevitable.</p>

		Wilkin Sanchez is the founder of the Rhode Island Group for Hispanic Technology (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/rihispanictech/">RIGHT</a>).	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">When I first came to the United States from the Dominican Republic, nobody wanted to hire me for a job in tech.</p>
<p>Rather than recognize the skills I possessed, employers could only see my still-developing English and my lack of a college degree. They failed to take into account my years of experience working with technology and electronics because the route I had taken was too unfamiliar.</p>
<p>It’s a situation all too common for the more than <a href="https://opportunityatwork.org/our-solutions/stars-insights/reach-stars-report/">70 million workers in the U.S.</a> who are <a href="https://opportunityatwork.org/stars/">skilled through alternative routes (STAR)</a> — especially for the <a href="https://opportunityatwork.org/our-solutions/stars-insights/hispanic-stars/">13.5 million Hispanic STAR</a> workers like me out there today. If the employers who are <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cybersecurity-job-openings-united-states/">struggling to fill open tech roles</a> want to overcome the growing “skills gap,” then it’s a situation that must change.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When I arrived in the U.S., I applied to countless IT jobs, from customer service to computer repair. Every company rejected me before they even gave me the chance to show what I could do. Had employers taken the time to talk to me, they would have learned I started fixing my neighbors’ phones and computers at the age of 12, and that I had already sailed through a series of computer classes on networking, basic coding, cybersecurity, scripting and computer repairs.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			About 31 million workers — including millions of Hispanic workers — possess skills that qualify them for higher-paying roles they are never considered for.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Even as I continued to learn English and mastered coding and cybersecurity concepts, companies failed to recognize what I could bring to the table. My background was too unfamiliar to make it past most employment filters that relied on degree requirements. I was often screened out of the hiring process before showcasing my talents, and I faced the biases of hiring managers who weren’t used to candidates like me. I could only get cleaning jobs or work at factories and fast food restaurants — places where I felt all my skills were going to waste.</p>
<p>I ended up getting lucky, and thanks to mentoring and hiring support through a follow-on to President Obama’s <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/issues/technology/techhire">TechHire Initiative</a>, doors began to open. After years of struggling, I could finally get my foot in the door, meet hiring managers and showcase my skills. I am now working as a cybersecurity associate, but my career could have begun much earlier.</p>
<p>Sadly, this story is a familiar one for far too many STAR workers, especially Hispanic people. Many of them aren’t as lucky as I am.</p>
<p>The statistics are sobering. About 31 million workers — including millions of Hispanic workers — possess skills that qualify them for higher-paying roles they are never considered for. Recent research shows, for instance, that there are 114,000 Hispanic workers employed as food and hospitality service managers, who have the skills to transition to similarly skilled jobs as community and social services managers, where wages are nearly 50% higher.</p>
<p>Hispanic STAR workers <a href="https://opportunityatwork.org/our-solutions/stars-insights/navigating-stars-report/#wpcf7-f2868-o1">are also less likely</a> to transition to higher-wage jobs than their white counterparts, and even when they are able to make such a transition, they are compensated less for their skills.</p>
<p>Employers must begin building more promising pathways that are accessible to all workers. The need for this shift has only grown over the last year as the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacted Hispanic and Latino communities. Hispanic or Latino workers accounted for <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2021/03/05/496733/latinos-face-disproportionate-health-economic-impacts-covid-19/">nearly one-quarter</a> of the pandemic’s initial job losses. Even as the economy continues to slowly recover, the unemployment rate for those workers sits at 8.6%, compared with 5.7% for white workers. The fallout has been especially pronounced among Hispanic and Latina women. In December, they <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/08/covid-job-losses-women-december-us-unemployment-rate/">accounted for 45%</a> of all job losses.</p>
<p>All this is happening while employers say they are struggling to find workers to fill open positions, even as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/15/966376492/millions-are-out-of-a-job-yet-some-employers-wonder-why-cant-i-find-workers">millions remain unemployed</a> and job postings have <a href="https://www.hiringlab.org/2021/02/02/job-postings-through-jan-29/">begun to return</a> to pre-pandemic levels. The narrative around <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/09/09/the-labor-market-doesnt-have-a-skills-gap-it-has-an-opportunity-gap/">skills gaps</a> continue to be perpetuated by employers, and they <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2021-02-01-covid-19-has-widened-the-skills-gap-but-it-also-presents-an-opportunity-to-close-it">may have worsened</a> during the COVID-19 crisis. These gaps are <a href="https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/projecting-future-skill-shortages-through-2029/">expected to cost</a> the U.S. economy $1.2 trillion over the following decade, but most of these gaps aren’t actually real. They’re just the consequence of employers ignoring workers who learned their skills through alternative routes.</p>
<p>By rethinking hiring barriers like degree requirements, employers can more easily find job-ready talent and improve diversity at the same time. Such shifts can lead to even more systemic change down the road.</p>
<p>My success doesn’t end with me, as there is a multiplier effect to hiring STAR workers. Now that I have a strong foothold in the industry, I am able to help other members of my community. I formed an organization called Rhode Island Group for Hispanic Technology (RIGHT) to provide training in basic computing, coding, cybersecurity and digital literacy — all in Spanish.</p>
<p>If America is going to build back better, employers need to seek out and hire more workers who are skilled through alternate routes. They must begin to look beyond the traditional signals of employability and expand their understanding of what makes a good employee. Those who fail to do so will continue to miss out on the more than 13 million talented Hispanic STAR workers like me.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Things are changing in China, and the regulatory landscape of tech work in the country won't be the same from here on out.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Watching the Chinese technology sector over the last week has been a fascinating exercise. The Chinese government took on entire industries like edtech while also coming down on individual companies (Tencent, Meituan) in a broad effort to change the country&#8217;s technology landscape.</p>
<p>The sum of the financial damage is easy to understand. The <a href="https://indexes.nasdaqomx.com/Index/History/HXC">NASDAQ Golden Dragon China Index</a>, for example, which tracks U.S.-listed companies that do their business in China, fell from a 52-week high set earlier this year of 20,893.02 to 10,672.37 yesterday. You can also track the decline in value of various Chinese technology companies both on shore and on foreign exchanges if you want to get an even fuller picture of the financial carnage.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s common among commentators and analysts to draw a direct line between the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/pulled-ant-group-ipo-costs-alibaba-nearly-60b-in-market-cap/">blocked Ant Group IPO last year</a>, the ensuing fall from grace of Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma and the latest news out of the Chinese Communist Party&#8217;s (CCP) regulatory bodies. That&#8217;s reasonable. Things are changing in China, and the regulatory landscape of tech work in the country won&#8217;t be the same from here on out.</p>

<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve explored the moment a little, noting last week that edtech investment <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/">could slow</a> in the country provided that the government went through with its plan to force tutoring companies to go nonprofit. The government then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/">did so</a>, and more, also blocking tutoring companies from being formed, going public, raising external capital from foreign sources and more. It was comprehensive. Natasha Mascarenhas has a great read on the matter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/edtechs-venture-backed-globalization-pauses-at-china/">here</a>.</p>
<p>So, bad news for startups? After all, if edtech investment could slow in the face of regulatory changes, what about other technology-influenced areas of business?</p>
<p>The negative case is somewhat easy to make. The positive case is more interesting. Some market watchers are making the argument that by taking on some of China&#8217;s largest technology companies, more room could be cleared in the country for smaller companies to snag a piece of business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jason Saltzman is a serial entrepreneur. He first cofounded SeamlessDocs and then went on to found The Alley, a coworking space based out of New York City. Following Alley&#8217;s joint venture partnership with Verizon, Saltzman left to build something new and became fascinated with the debt consolidation and relief space.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how <a href="https://www.relief.app/">Relief</a>, cofounded by Saltzman, Bryan Okeke, and Ram Barrouet, was born. Today, the startup is announcing it has raised $2 million via a convertible note, led by Collaborative Fund, BFV, Necessary Venture, The Fund. Angels also participated in the round, including Justin Kan, Ben Kaplan, Elliot Tabule, and David Galanter.</p>
<p>Saltzman&#8217;s thesis came out of his observation of the space. Third-party debt collection agencies use lots of automation tools but those same services aren&#8217;t extended to the individuals seeking debt relief. Relief is an app that uses machine learning algorithms and collective bargaining to reduce debt balances. In essence, Relief does the math on behalf of users and negotiates directly with creditors to bring down the balance (in half of more, according to Saltzman), all for free.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Not unlike Justworks, Relief uses the power of its entire user base to negotiate with creditors to bring down balances and lower interest rates. Once the negotiation is complete, Relief sets up a payment plan for users to pay off the rest of their debt.</p>
<p>Offering debt consolidation and loans for folks in financial peril is not new, but the ability to negotiate on behalf of the user is not a broadly available feature on most similar platforms.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is not a platform to help folks save money. Saltzman explained that Relief app is an alternative to bankruptcy.</p>
<p>To start, Relief will generate revenue by the credit issuers who pay to have settlements handled, with Relief taking the place of a debt collector. The startup can also generate revenue by issuing loans and earning off of the interest. But Saltzman hopes to get enough users to start thinking creatively about how to make other forms of revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust is the biggest challenge,&#8221; said Saltzman. &#8220;We have to get into consumers houses and de-stigmatize this horrible problem. The solution is not there right now. The data shows us that one in three Americans is behind on their credit card bills right now. So we need them to trust us.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s Note: An earlier version of this article stated that Verizon acquired Alley. It has been updated for accuracy.</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The NuraTrue earbuds announced today mark the company’s third entry into the headphone market, following the over-ear Nuraphones and the tethered Nuraloop.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As I write this, I have no fewer than five recently reviewed earbuds sitting on the desk in front of me. And you know what? They’re all pretty good. Some are better than others, of course — that’s why they invented gadget reviews. But as far as consumer electronics go, the category seemed to mature &#8212; and the products became ubiquitous &#8212; virtually overnight.</p>
<p>Nearly every hardware maker has entered the category — some several times over. You can get a truly great pair for over $200 and a pretty decent one for under $100. There’s a broad range in quality across that spectrum, of course. But features? A few things, here and there, but on the whole, earbuds settled into a similar sort of homogeneity as smartphones before them.</p>

<p>Differentiation was certainly a big topic during today’s launch of Nothing’s Ear (1). It’s also been a core part of Nura’s DNA since the beginning. But where a company like Nothing views its earbuds as the first piece in a larger ecosystem, Nura is, simply put, a headphone company. And there’s a pretty simple reason behind that. Everything Nura does is built around its audio technology — something that’s held true since before I had the opportunity to try the original Nuraphones as a prototype with a big, unsightly circuit board attached.</p>
<p>The $200 NuraTrue earbuds announced today mark the company’s third entry into the headphone market, following the over-ear Nuraphones and the tethered Nuraloop. The “true,” one assumes, refers to the truly wireless design, abandoning the behind-the-neck design that gave last year’s Nuraloop their name.</p>
<p>The decision to launch earbuds with a wire seemed an odd one at the $199 price point four years after Apple released the first AirPods (the year Nura was founded). There were some practical technical concerns, and Nura made the most of them with a magnetic connector that lets them double as wired headphones/monitors (something I appreciated when I still took a couple of plane rides a month).</p>

<p>When I put the question of going fully wireless to Nura co-founder Dragan Petrovic, he answered:</p>
<blockquote><p>We wanted to release a fully wireless product only once we could ensure an outstanding user experience and (most importantly) outstanding sound quality. Fully wireless earbuds have been around for about five years now, but only recently has the underlying technology matured to the point of being able to do justice to the music. These improvements were delivered by the wireless chip providers, which is why many of the fully wireless products that have come out this year are considerably better than what was available before. For NuraTrue, we took the finally mature wireless technology provided by the chip makers and added Nura&#8217;s (or rather, the listener&#8217;s) personalized sound to deliver the best sound quality in the most convenient form factor.</p></blockquote>
<p>While it’s true that everyone and their uncle has offered their own take on the category, Nura’s entry wasn’t as simple as pulling together some off-the-shelf components. The company offers one of the more unique listening experiences, courtesy of on-board technology that beams sound into the wearer’s ear and reads back the faint transmissions that return.</p>
<p>Per Nura,</p>
<blockquote><p>Encoded in the returning sound wave is information about how well you heard the sound that went in. The Nuraphone uses an extremely sensitive microphone to detect this returning sound wave, and a self-learning engine built into the Nuraphone to create your profile. No buttons or knobs. It all happens automatically and in about 60 seconds. It is a little bit magic.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2172649" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172649" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2172649" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9575.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172649" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The experience is the same across the three devices, so we’ve written about it a few times. Essentially the system creates a sort of custom sonic fingerprint based on the reading it gets back and uses that to adjust the settings accordingly. It does feel like a bit of wizardry the first time you try it, especially when you flip back and forth between the default and custom settings.</p>
<p>The original Nuraphones quickly became one of my most recommended headphones — a solid accomplishment for such a young hardware startup. Since the launch of the original over-ear headphones, however, I’ve been waiting to see what the company might be able to do in a fully wireless form factor. And on most accounts, I’d say the NuraTrue buds are a success.</p>
<p>The great sound is largely intact — a notable achievement. There are nuances you’ll hear in these headphones that you too often miss in comparably priced tech — subtle details that get lost in the mix with less balanced headphones. Of course, you’ll continue to lose other nuances depending on the source of the music you’re listening to. What Nura’s able to do is impressive, but not miraculous.</p>
<p>You do, obviously, lose something with the smaller size. The Nurphones’ big differentiator is the addition of a powerful, tactile bass, courtesy of the ear cups. This experience is accomplished to some extent by the immersion slider in the app, which is designed to adjust the experiential level provided by the buds. But again, there’s no replacing the cocooning effect of the over-ear cups.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172646" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172646" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2172646" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9563.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172646" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>But listen, at this point, I think we all implicitly understand that different form factors offer different compromises. Otherwise, we would only have one style of headphone. The NuraTrue are quite light — I was actually surprised, given their size. Each bud weighs 7.4 grams. They’re also extremely comfortable. As with other Nura products, the headphones will detect whether you have a tight seal when doing the initial testing. Of its three products, however, the NuraTrue gave me the fewest problems on that front.</p>
<p>As someone who frequently experiences ear pain from different buds, they’ve not given me an issue wearing them around effectively all day. The weight distribution and a design that you basically twist into your ear means they stay put quite well. I’ve had no issues with them falling out at the gym or on a few short runs.</p>
<p>The active noise canceling is decent. It’s not industry-leading by any stretch, but it gets the job done for sure. It’s a bit of an annoyance, however, that you have to go into the app to toggle it on and off — as well as the immersion feature. These things, coupled with the fundamental importance of sound profiles, means the buds are tied to their app a lot more than other earbuds. It’s the price you pay for being different, I suppose.</p>
<p>The battery is rated at six hours on the buds and 24 with the case factored in. There’s no superfast charging here — it takes about 2.5 hours to get the case’s 500 mAh battery from zero to full. Likely that won’t be an issue unless you never remember to charge the thing or you’re planning to go on a couple of long-haul flights. The inclusion of four battery lights on the front of the case is a nice touch.</p>

<p>My biggest complaint here is a bit of a surprise to me. A majority of the headphones I’ve tested recently haven’t had any Bluetooth connectivity issues. Honestly, I’d thought we’d moved past that. While the NuraTrue isn’t using the latest version of Bluetooth (5.2), the 5.0 it does uses is the same version found in, say, the AirPods Pro (Apple, of course, has the decided advantage of making its own phone, operating system and chips). The connection is fine around the house, but I’ve experienced drops while walking around that I haven’t with other recent pairs.</p>
<p>It’s more annoying than end-of-the-world, but it’s worth keeping in mind — and certainly something the company should consider addressing for gen 2. The built-in microphone also left something to be desired, creating distortion when I took calls.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there’s really not a lot to complain about. The NuraTrue are well rounded (figuratively and literally), comfortable, and the company’s sound profiling technology is enough of a standout feature to set them apart from an army of similar buds. For my own specific needs, I’d say they also make the Nuraloop largely redundant, though Petrovic tells me the company is keeping the product around because it “complement[s] our product portfolio by offering things that no true wireless product has, most importantly 16+ hours of battery life, and the ability to connect to an analog audio jack.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172643" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172643" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2172643" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9557.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172643" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Fair enough on those two points. Again, if any headphone did everything, there wouldn’t be much point in variety. On the whole, I do think NuraTrue carry the far broader appeal for a majority of users. The ability to hardwire has its appeal but is pretty limited for most of us at this point. And 16 hours of battery built-in is great, but most of the time six on the bud and 24 with the case should suffice.</p>
<p>Mostly, it’s just nice to see a legit hardware startup continue to make some waves in the consumer space by taking on the big names with differentiated technology. In the earliest days, I’d imagined Nura would get snapped up by a Samsung or Apple, but I’m glad the company opted to go its own way.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For our Wednesday show this week, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> had prior Equity guest Phil Libin back for a chat. Libin was first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/12/listen-to-us-talk-about-undercorns-ipos-and-what-going-public-is-really-about/">on our show a while back</a> to chat about his startup studio. But since then, he&#8217;s been a little busy.</p>
<p>You may recall that mmhmm, Libin&#8217;s project to build a better video communication service, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/mmhmm-raises-100m-which-is-a-fun-thing-to-say-to-people-who-dont-follow-tech/">raised $100 million the other week</a>. And we here on the Equity pod made a little bit of fun at the number. It was just so very much money for a roughly one-year-old company. What was mmhmm going to use it for?</p>
<p>Well, Libin&#8217;s folks got in touch, and so we decided to just have him on to talk. And we wanted him back because he was one of the most memorable guests on the show, frankly, thanks to his candor the last time around.</p>
<p>So, what did we get into? A refresh on the mmhmm story, and notes from Libin about what&#8217;s ahead for his company. It certainly has the cash to pursue its vision. But as we learned, building software for a variety of platforms comes with challenges. Challenges that are ameliorated by having lots of smart staff. So, that&#8217;s where the money is going.</p>
<p>Regardless, it was sporting of Libin to come back for another chat. Equity is back Friday morning with our news roundup. Make sure to follow the show on Twitter &#8212; we&#8217;re doing the odd Twitter Space that you won&#8217;t want to miss.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Music rights giant ASCAP said today that a quartet of early-stage startups/university music projects will compete in its Immersive Music Studio Challenge. The 12-week project is a partnership between ASCAP Lab and NY Media Lab (NYCML) that offers the teams grants and access to development resources. They&#8217;ll also be showcasing at the upcoming <a href="http://www.ascapexperience.com">ASCAP Experience</a>.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting little cohort, aiming to tackle some wide-ranging music industry issues. Some have already laid out commercialization plans, while others essentially came together for the program and really haven’t thought that far down the road.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.misynth.io/"><strong>MiSynth</strong></a></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2182064" style="width: 696px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182064" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2182064" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/60b03b12cdfa239a0a8000d0_9bbb582773599b1ea69cac93bf416178.gif" alt="" width="686" height="420" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182064" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MiSynth</p></div></p>
<p><strong>Who&#8217;s on your founding team? </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>MiSynth began as a fictional business proposal created by Senaida Ng in her freshman year class, “Are Friends Electric?” taught by professor Errol Kolosine. After the class ended, Ng continued with the idea and worked closely with Kolosine to bring the idea to life. She recruited Ph.D. biomedical engineer Sinem Eriksen to lead the R&amp;D alongside the guidance of NYU Music and Audio Research Lab (MARL) researchers Pablo Ripollés and Elena Georgieva.</p>
<p><strong>Please describe your product. What problems in the market are you trying to address?</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>MiSynth is a revolutionary music software plugin that will allow musicians, songwriters and producers to synthesize any sounds they hear in their heads. They will bridge the gap between your imagination and your music by taking data from brain computer interfaces (BCIs) and turning them into playable MIDI instruments. The team at MiSynth strongly believes that everyone can and should have the tools to be an artist. Rather than spending hours learning about sound design and trying to re-create the perfect synth, MiSynth is making music more accessible and efficient for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any plans to commercialize? If so, what? Have you identified revenue streams?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we plan on continuing to build our prototype and testing it after the ASCAP NYCML Challenge and we hope to launch our software by August 2024. MiSynth will be sold as a software plugin compatible with any digital audio workstation (DAW), including Logic Pro X, Ableton Live, Pro Tools, FL Studio, Cubase and Reason. Customers can buy the license to use the software by paying either a one-time fee or a monthly subscription fee until they pay off the full price of the license.</p>
<p><strong>What is your funding to date?</strong></p>
<p>We are a relatively new company that began only in December 2020, but we plan on continuing to seek funding from investors, research grants and challenges like the ASCAP NYCML Challenge to continue our venture.</p>

<p><strong>Please describe your product. What problems in the market are you trying to address?</strong></p>
<p>Social is a best-in-class online event platform where users can easily meet and chat with other people while exploring virtual spaces with games and live performances. We saw the need to bring serendipitous social moments and ways to spark real-life relationships into the remote, virtual experience, especially at events and live performances.</p>
<p>Every world comes with proximity-activated audio, live-streaming avatars, beautiful customizable visuals and unique brand opportunities. With options to showcase video content, host a social livestream, add entertaining challenges and game packages so attendees and audience members connect through playful exploration and leave wowed by the experience.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any plans to commercialize? If so, what? Have you identified revenue streams?</strong></p>
<p>Social is being used commercially for product launches, conferences, team-building events, art exhibitions and performances. Revenue streams include monetization through ticketing, donation widgets and sponsorship packages. Our commercial clients include fashion and beauty brands, media, tech and finance.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has redefined how we think about virtual communication and experiences. We have seen a level of behavioral change that would typically take more than 10 years happen in just 12 months. There is now a viable market for virtual engagement and therefore an opportunity to consider a hybrid approach for how we can engage audiences as we move out of the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>What is your funding to date? </strong></p>
<p>We are currently funded through white-labeled development for event companies and brands. Social is growing organically based on user needs, through pilots with physical venues, artists and passionate communities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Voice-based and other personal assistant apps &#8212; which use natural language and hefty AI engines in the backend to source information to address your various questions, do your e-commerce bidding, or control one electronic device or another in your home &#8212; have been around for years, but too often they have come up short when it comes to user experience, failing to nail the right solutions to your queries. Today a new app is launching from a startup that has largely been in stealth mode up to now to try to address that disparity. <a href="https://brain.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brain Technologies</a> is today announcing $50 million in funding, and along with that is releasing <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/natural-simply-get-anything/id1521375720" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natural</a>, an iOS app, in the US market.</p>
<p>The $50 million (which is actually described as &#8220;over $50 million&#8221; by the company, with an exact number undisclosed), meanwhile, is coming from a very interesting mix of investors &#8212; backers include Laurene Powell Jobs&#8217; Emerson Collective, Goodwater Capital, Scott Cook and WTT Investment, a list that underscores some of the attention that Brain has been getting, even before having released a single product.</p>
<p>Prior to this round, Brain had raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/25/meet-brain-the-ai-engine-that-wants-to-replace-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.5 million back in 2016</a> from an unnamed investor while still in stealth mode.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jerry Yue, the young founder and CEO of Brain &#8212; a repeat entrepreneur and robotics enthusiast whose last company, a grocery delivery service in China called Benlai, is <a href="https://www.benlai.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still going strong</a> &#8212; said in an interview that he does not like to call Natural a &#8220;personal assistant&#8221; app, not because of the shortcomings of so many of these in the past, but because of the voice association many have with the concept.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don’t position ourselves as a voice assistant because we don’t think the future is voice only,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It should be the right combination of voice and native app experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead, he describes what Natural is as the world&#8217;s first &#8220;generative computer interface&#8221;, the logical progression in digital information search.</p>
<p>That progression, in his view, started with the web, progressed to search engines, and then apps, before landing where he sees it today. Natural brings all of these together in some degree. Currently, you speak or type any kind of question or command into the app, which then provides a solution that might be in the form of links to other apps you might have.</p>
<p>For example, &#8220;I&#8217;d like sushi tonight,&#8221; will bring back options (in theory) for ordering sushi, and possibly your most favored dishes, from a selection of restaurants by way of food ordering apps that you use, or places to go eat it, as well as options for making that sushi yourself (and buying the ingredients online to do so, as well as a method).</p>
<p>Similarly, travel searches return results that dip into multiple silos from, say, airlines and airline aggregators that are easily editable and that you can buy directly from those results, if you already have payment details on your device. (While Google provides this to some degree, you eventually have to navigate to sites to buy tickets, which might end up significantly more expensive when you actually visit said sites.)</p>
<p>The more you use the app, the theory is that it will learn more about what you might want from your questions.</p>
<p>AI that anticipates what we are trying to say or do is something that has been attempted before, of course, but the difference here, Yue said, is in Brain&#8217;s approach, which is based on the concept of &#8220;one shot&#8221; learning, which he described as a kind of general purpose AI, &#8220;a tool that learns to use other tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>The alternative is a more labor-intensive approach that AI-based systems are typically built on today, largely based around keywords. &#8220;AIs from Google or Amazon are based on thousands of people and human coding to connect services,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This approach treats natural language processing as a classification problem.&#8221; In contrast, the breakthrough system he and his team have devised, he said, &#8220;has learned more than 4 million functions on its own.&#8221; Ironically, the end result of a successful AI like this is not to make us feel more technologically powerful, but to get us away from our devices, and spending time fussing on them, and into the world.</p>
<p>Given that this is a consumer app, it will be interesting to see how and if there is mass takeup of Natural, and whether the right combination of anticipatory AI with natural language and design come together to pique collective attention. The team and what they&#8217;ve built in any case will be a hot property, given that AI will continue to be a strong and growing presence in the tech landscape for years to come.</p>
<p>“What Jerry and his team are developing is incredibly special. I’m not aware of anyone doing more interesting work to demonstrate how fundamentally AI can enhance our everyday lives,” said investor Scott Cook, who was also the founder of financial software giant Intuit, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Many of us remember the first time we used an iPhone. The software felt magical, and every animation felt dynamic yet subtle,” said Tom Goodwin, a Natural beta customer. “Experiencing this app is the closest thing I’ve felt to that for a long time. I love the idea of one place to go for everything.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company's post-funding valuation is $3.7 billion, according to a source familiar with the investment round.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Redwood Materials CEO JB Straubel <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/why-amazon-and-panasonic-are-betting-on-this-battery-recycling-startup/">shared his aspirations</a> last year to turn the startup he co-founded in 2017 into one of the world’s major battery recycling companies. Now, the former Tesla co-founder and CTO has the money to accelerate those plans.</p>
<p>Redwood Materials said Wednesday it raised $700 million from high-profile institutional investors and venture firms, providing the capital needed to expand its existing operations well beyond its Carson City, Nevada, home base to locations throughout North America and even into Europe.</p>
<p>The Series C round was led by funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates and included Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Baillie Gifford, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and Fidelity. Previous investors &#8212; Capricorn&#8217;s Technology Impact Fund, Bill Gates&#8217; Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund &#8212; returned to put more capital into Redwood. Valor Equity Partners, Emerson Collective and Franklin Templeton also participated, the company said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Redwood previously raised $40 million in a Series B and some seed money, which brings its total raise under $800 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s post-funding valuation is $3.7 billion, according to a source familiar with the investment round. Redwood declined to comment on the figure.</p>
<p>Redwood Materials is aiming to create a circular supply chain. This closed-loop system, Straubel said, will be essential if the world&#8217;s battery cell producers hope to have the supply needed for consumer electronics and the coming wave of electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Redwood recycles scrap from battery cell production and consumer electronics like cell phone batteries, laptop computers, power tools, power banks, scooters and electric bicycles. It then processes these discarded goods, extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, and supplies those back to its customers, which today includes Panasonic at the Gigafactory in Nevada that it operates with Tesla and Envision AESC&#8217;s battery plant in Tennessee. Redwood has also partnered with Amazon to recycle EV and other lithium-ion batteries and e-waste from parts of their businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;In our view, the need for these materials will grow exponentially over time as we enter the era of de-carbonization,&#8221; Joe Fath, portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund, said in a statement, adding that &#8220;Redwood is well-positioned to be at the forefront of tackling this emerging and critically important problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Straubel sees a bottleneck coming as the whole supply chain seeks to access critical materials. That will affect the growth rate and challenge automakers like Ford, GM and Volkswagen that have laid out ambitious plans to electrify their portfolios.</p>
<p>That problem is likely to compound as more automakers go down the electric path. Last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/mercedes-benz-to-build-eight-battery-factories-in-push-to-become-electric-only-automaker-by-2030/">Mercedes-Benz said</a> it will spend €40 billion ($47 billion) to become an electric-only automaker by the end of the decade. The German automaker determined it will need battery capacity of more than 200 gigawatt-hours. To meet those needs, Mercedes plans to set up eight battery factories with existing partners and one new partner to produce cells.</p>
<p>Straubel said it&#8217;s time for Redwood to scale more aggressively.</p>
<p>Those plans were already well underway even before it closed the $700 million round, Straubel noted. The company announced in June it had purchased 100 acres of land near the Gigafactory that Panasonic operates with Tesla in Sparks, Nevada. Redwood now has some operations at the site.</p>
<p>Redwood is also in the process of nearly tripling the size of its existing 150,000-square-foot facility in Carson City, Nevada. The new 400,000-square-foot addition onto the recycling facility is expected to be operational by the end of the year.</p>
<p>To support the growth, Redwood started hiring more employees, with plans to add more than 500 jobs over the next two years. Redwood employs more than 130 people today.</p>
<p>The company has expanded in other ways as well, including the launch of a program that allows consumers to send in personal electronics such as smartphones to be recycled.</p>
<p>&#8220;This additional equity to some extent helps us finish all those things, but it&#8217;s not really the primary purpose for all of it,&#8221; Straubel said.</p>
<p>The company is examining additional sites in North America and actively looking at entering the European market, he added without providing a specific timeline. He did say that for now, Redwood is focused on the North American and European markets. Asia would be its third market.</p>
<p>Redwood is also investing money into some large-scale projects that seek further improve its recycling process, specifically around material purification and how to most effectively get these raw materials back into the battery supply chain.</p>
