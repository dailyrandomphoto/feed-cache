										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Seksom Suriyapa was seemingly destined to land at a venture firm. A Stanford Law graduate, he worked at two blue-chip investment banks before joining the cybersecurity company McAfee as a senior corp dev employee, later logging six years at the human resources software company SuccessFactors and, in 2018, landing at Twitter, where he headed up its 12-person corporate development team until June.</p>
<p>The bigger surprise is that Suriyapa &#8212; who just joined the L.A.-based venture firm <a href="https://upfront.com/">Upfront Ventures</a> &#8212; didn&#8217;t make the leap sooner. &#8220;The catalyst was finding a firm that felt like the exact right fit for me,&#8221; says Suriyapa.</p>
<p>We talked earlier today with Suriyapa &#8212; who lives and will remain in the Bay Area &#8212; about his new role at Upfront, where he will be leading its expanding growth-stage practice with firm founder Yves Sisteron.</p>
<p>He also shed light on how Twitter &#8212; which has been on a bit of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/twitter-picks-up-acquisition-pace-driven-by-new-product-push?sref=gni836kR">buying spree</a> &#8212; thinks about acquisitions these days. Our chat has been edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How did you wind up joining Upfront?</strong></p>
<p>SS: [Longtime partner] Mark Suster and I were introduced through a mutual business acquaintance in the venture world, and I got to know him over a period of time and really came to find him to be a remarkable individual. He&#8217;s thoughtful about the business itself, he&#8217;s an incredible brand builder. I think you could argue that [Upfront] put L.A. on the venture map.</p>
<p><strong>TC: It was also, for a long time, an early-stage firm, but now it has a &#8216;barbell&#8217; strategy. Is your new job to make sure it can maintain its stake in its portfolio companies as they grow? Can you shop outside of that portfolio?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SS: The mission for me will be supporting the best of Upfront&#8217;s hundred-plus existing portfolio companies that are poised to scale, and also to invest in companies not currency on the platform, and I anticipate [the latter] will happen more and more over time.</p>

<p><strong>TC: Twitter was a lot more active on the corp dev front during the years when you were there. Why?</strong></p>
<p>SS: When i joined in 2018, Jack Dorsey had been CEO for about three years, and really his focus was on the core mission of driving the public conversation, and in doing that, Twitter shrunk itself out of a lot of businesses and [shrunk] people wise as well.</p>
<p><strong>TC: I remember it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/27/twitter-lays-off-9-of-its-workforce-as-it-posts-a-much-needed-positive-q3/">laid people off</a> in 2016.</strong></p>
<p>SS: And one of the offshoots of that was way less in the way of newer products, so there were no new acquisitions in the three years prior to me joining, and that muscle atrophies if you don&#8217;t exercise it. So [ahead of me] Jack had transformed the management team, which had been, relatively speaking, a revolving door of executives until that point, and I was brought in with a specific mandate of reviving a corporate development practice that had been quiet for a few years. I&#8217;d known [CFO] Ned Segal when he was a banker at Goldman Sachs and [while] I was at SuccessFactors, so when I heard about the role through the grapevine, I reached out.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And Twitter starts shopping, buying up the news reader service Scroll, the newsletter platform Revue. Were these decisions coming down from the top or vice versa?</strong></p>
<p>SS: The best way to describe it would be that it was product-need driven. The company had a few different objectives. One was to diversify Twitter from its dependency on being an ad-driven business. Something like 80% of revenue comes from ads.</p>
<p>Second, there&#8217;s an incredible need to ramp up its machine learning and artificial intelligence as a company. If you’re looking for toxicity in conversation, it&#8217;s not scalable to hire tens of thousands of people to do that. You need machine learning to find it. Twitter done well is also able to show you the conversations that are most interesting to you, and to do that, it has to take signals from what you follow and spend time reading and what you interact with, and that, at its core, is ML AI.  [Relatedly] Jack has a vision that anybody who tweets in whatever their native tongue is should be able to talk with someone else in their native tongue as part of a global conversation, and to do that, you need [natural language processing] techniques galore.</p>
<p><strong>TC: There&#8217;s also this focus on consumer applications.</strong></p>
<p>SS: That&#8217;s the third objective. What are the tools that followers and creators can use in conversation with each other? So [Twitter] added audio [via its Clubhouse rival Spaces]. We bought Revue, which is a competitor to Substack. So there&#8217;s a lot of innovation happening around the type of content that someone should expect to see or create on Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Would you describe these acquisitions as proactive or reactive?</strong></p>
<p>SS: From the outside it would seem reactive, but the reality is we’d been thinking a lot about something like Spaces even before Clubhouse took off. I think what’s noticeable to me is [Spaces] is one of the first times you’ve seen a company like Twitter build up a capability and a new product area that&#8217;s going head-to-head going against a company that&#8217;s focused only on that realm, and it&#8217;s competitive from day one. Twitter beat Clubhouse in [offering an] Android version because it poured resources into it, and I&#8217;d argue that a lot of the mechanics of Twitter and the fact that creators are on Twitter puts it in an awesome spot to win this segment.</p>
<p>Twitter also just has a huge amount of expertise in finding toxicity and things you want to be wary of when you&#8217;re a social media play, and a company of Clubhouse&#8217;s size, at least in its initial days, will have a hard time getting there.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Twitter has so many interests, including around cryptocurrencies and decentralization. </strong></p>
<p>SS: In terms of priorities at Twitter,  a lot is under wraps in terms of the technologies that we expect [will rise up over] the next five  to 10 years, but [a lot of thought is being given to] the impact of cryptocurrency and the underlying protocols around it and how Twitter participates in a trustless, permissionless [world] where there&#8217;s a decentralized internet that can protect people&#8217;s privacy and allow people not to worry where their content is stored. People think of Twitter as a consumer app but there&#8217;s amazing and considerable diversity under the hood.</p>

<p><strong>TC: Do you think because of the current regulatory environment that it has a better shot at working with companies and projects that might have gotten snapped up by Facebook and Google?</strong></p>
<p>In terms of the regulatory environment, the reality is that even if you take the Facebooks and Googles out of the equation, there are acquirers that are competitive that would step up and buy things, so it&#8217;s a little short-sighted to think of just those two. But even when they were active, we were winning [deals]. A lot of the companies we acquired self-selected to be at Twitter because they like what it stands for, they like the way that Jack Dorsey leads the organization, and they believe in the stands that he takes and the positions that he and his leadership espouse.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re now representing a very different brand. How will your work at Twitter help you compete for deals on behalf of Upfront?</strong></p>
<p>SS: I have this network of incredible entrepreneurs around the world because of companies across my career that I&#8217;ve helped acquire or tried to acquire or who are running businesses; I also [have relationships with] VCs at different stages who actively spot businesses around the world [and introduce them to corp dev teams]. You might also know that Twitter has a diversity and inclusion program where they intend to have 25% of leadership be diverse over the next several years, so my team was often involved in finding the best ways to find diverse targets to buy. I also led a series of LP investments into newly emerging funds, some LatinX-founded, some women-founded, some Black-founded, some that were diverse from a geographic standpoint that are scouting companies in far flung places . . .</p>
<p><strong>TC: Does Twitter also make direct investments?</strong></p>
<p>SS: We did direct investments but [backing fund managers] is a more leveraged approach. Most of them are seed funds and they&#8217;ll in turn invest in 30 to 60 companies each. But yes, I scouted companies in far flung places, including [India&#8217;s] ShareChat where I served on the board for two years. [Editor&#8217;s note: TechCrunch reported earlier this year that Twitter explored <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/twitter-explored-buying-indian-startup-sharechat-and-positioning-moj-as-a-global-tiktok-rival/">buying ShareChat</a> at an earlier point; the company has since raised numerous rounds of funding and was most recently valued by its investors at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/india-sharechat-valued-at-3-billion-in-145-million-fundraise/">nearly $3 billion</a>.]</p>
<p><strong>TC: You have a lot of relationships, but it would still seem really hard to compete for growth-stage deals when so many other outfits are now investing there, too. How do you plan to compete?</strong></p>
<p>SS: I will clearly be drawing on those networks to find deals. I&#8217;ll be investing in sectors where Upfront has already invested in, but initially I’ll be double-clicking that ihave a strong interest in, including around creator economy ecosystem, because I did o much of that at Twitter. And w3b 3.0, ow this permissionless comes togerh, edge computing ML AI and shared date that goes across a number of disciplines that i’ve workedin, i think one of strong points that will cinterdiscplianry areas, also in sustainability are but I won’t kid myself. You compete by learning what your value proposition is. At Twitter, my strategy was winning on speed, knowing people earlier, and [underscoring] Twitter’s value proposition [to close deals]. I can&#8217;t talk about my [VC] strategy without having implemented yet; I’ll have to figure out what’s most interesting to entrepreneurs that the megafunds don’t offer.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for September 3, 2021. As noted yesterday, most of TechCrunch has the day off so today’s newsletter is a <em>little</em> bit different than usual.</p>
<p>Up top let’s chat early-stage startups. The TechCrunch team spent an age this week cataloging a host of startups from Y Combinator’s marathon demo day, with our notes covering all presentations <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/here-are-all-the-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day-part-1/">from day one</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/here-are-all-the-companies-from-day-two-of-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day/">day two</a>. We also yanked our favorites in two batches, in case you wanted to avoid the full download and want to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/our-favorite-startups-from-ycs-summer-21-demo-day-part-1/">skip straight</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/our-favorite-startups-from-ycs-summer-21-demo-day-part-2/">the highlights</a>.</p>
<p>But that’s not all. We also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/tracking-startup-focus-in-the-latest-y-combinator-cohort/">dug into trends from the group</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/y-combinator-s-21-equity/">hopped on Twitter Spaces to chat about what we saw.</a> Of course, Y Combinator is a single accelerator, but given its mammoth cohort sizes we pay extra attention to the trends that its startups detail.</p>
<p>That behind us, let’s take a moment to highlight some great stuff from newer TechCrunch reporters:</p>
<ul>
<li>TechCrunch boomerang <strong>Ryan Lawler</strong> has been busy digging into the fintech world, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/all-the-reasons-why-you-should-launch-a-credit-or-debit-card/">dive into the pros and cons of credit and debit cards</a> at financial-focused startups. His look into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-and-brex-draw-diverging-market-plans-with-ma-strategy/">Brex and Ramp’s diverging strategies</a> was also a hit.</li>
<li><strong>Kate Park</strong> has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/29/korean-3d-spatial-data-tool-startup-urbanbase-closes-11-1m-series-b-round/">dug into Asian startups,</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">regulatory changes in South Korea that impact major smartphone players</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apple-announced-new-settlement-with-japan-allowing-developers-to-link-to-external-website/">news from Japan</a> that could shake up Apple’s grip on its App Store.</li>
<li><strong>Christine Hall</strong> has been <em>hall-ing</em> ass, covering a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/youtravel-me-packs-up-1m-to-match-travelers-with-curated-small-group-adventures/">barrage of startup funding rounds</a> and product news. She even found time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/box-zoom-chief-product-officers-discuss-how-the-changing-workplace-drove-their-latest-collaboration/">to dig into the Zoom-Box news while juggling the rest</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Aria Alamalhodaei</strong> has been killing the transportation beat, bringing all sorts of news to the site, including coverage of the startup space race. Which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/faa-grounds-virgin-galactic-amidst-investigation-into-july-mission/">isn’t always, well, very good news for the companies involved</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Carly Page</strong> kicked off her TechCrunch tenure digging into hackers attacking <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/hackers-phishing-post-covid-office/">employees returning to the office</a> and has written a deluge of stories for TechCrunch including news this week that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/fbi-china-hacking-uyghurs/">China is hacking Uyghurs on American soil</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, Disrupt is coming up. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=dailycrunch&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=dailycrunchad&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=dailycrunchad&amp;display=TRUE">So make sure that you have a ticket.</a> As it’s a virtual event they are cheaper than they have been in years past, despite the event having perhaps its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">strongest content lineup ever</a>. We’re excited!</p>
<p>With that, let’s head into the weekend &#8212; a long one here in the United States &#8212; and get some rest. What a week in the world at large and in our startup-focused niche. I&#8217;ll be taking all next week off, but I will leave the Daily Crunch in the very capable hands of one <a href="https://twitter.com/grg">Greg Kumparak</a>. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>Use cohort analysis to drive smarter startup growth</h2>
<p>Cohort analysis is a basic tool for startups that need to better understand customer behavior, but many early-stage companies let it slide.</p>
<p>Grouping users into &#8220;buckets&#8221; is common practice at most startups, but robust cohort analysis uncovers trends and missed opportunities that young companies can pounce on.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t wait to hire a senior marketing person or a consultant to start this critical work: In a guest column, Jonathan Metrick, chief growth officer at Sagard &amp; Portage Ventures, offers a detailed example explaining the value of this type of analysis.</p>
<p>If you have questions after reading this comprehensive step-by-step, please join us for a <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1OwxWVXZbLnJQ">Twitter Spaces</a> chat with Metrick on Tuesday, September 7, at 3 p.m. PDT/6 p.m. EDT.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian announced Friday that the first edition version of its all-electric R1T pickup truck has an official EPA range of 314 miles, while its R1T SUV comes in a skosh higher at 316 miles.</p>
<p>The official range and fuel economy values have been <a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=44462&amp;id=44461">posted on the U.S. EPA website</a>. The official numbers align with Rivian&#8217;s own previous estimates, which it has advertised as 300 miles.</p>
<p>While EPA estimates can&#8217;t account for different driving styles, the test cycle is robust enough to provide an accurate benchmark for customers shopping for an electric vehicle.</p>
<p>In this case, Rivian has the benefit of being the first electric truck on the market. Ford&#8217;s F-150 Lightning, which isn&#8217;t expected to come on the market until spring 2022, has a targeted range of 230 miles in the standard and up to 300 miles in the extended version. The EPA has not issued official ranges for the Ford Lightning.</p>
<p>Rivian&#8217;s &#8220;Launch edition&#8221; R1T truck and R1S SUV come equipped with a 135-kWh battery pack that is branded as the &#8220;large pack.&#8221; Deliveries of the Launch Edition vehicles are slated to begin this month.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The official EPA range values for our Launch Edition vehicles are in:<br />R1T Large Pack: 314 miles<br />R1S Large Pack: 316 miles<br />We&#39;ll share more EPA information about other editions as we have it. <a href="https://t.co/MPY1wVzkz9">https://t.co/MPY1wVzkz9</a> <a href="https://t.co/rzrCkQpggd">pic.twitter.com/rzrCkQpggd</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Rivian (@Rivian) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rivian/status/1433885852849999873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The R1T and R1S vehicles will be offered in two trims, both of which are offered with the same 135-kWh-pack size. The Adventure variant of the R1T, which has a premium interior, starts at $73,000. The R1T Explore trim starts at $67,500.</p>
<p>The Adventure trim in the R1S SUV starts at $75,500, while the Explore package has a base price of $70,000.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Rivian intends to begin deliveries of the Adventure and Explore packages in January 2022.</p>
<p>Rivian also plans to offer an even larger pack, dubbed the &#8220;Max pack,&#8221; for the R1T. That larger pack costs an additional $10,000 and is expected to push the range of the R1T past 400 miles. The EPA has not posted an official range for the max pack or other editions, including a planned smaller battery pack option.</p>

		Joe Devon is the co-founder of <a href="https://diamond.la/">Diamond</a>, a digital agency that builds accessible experiences. He is also a co-founder of Global Accessibility Awareness Day and chair of the GAAD Foundation. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The world of accessibility has experienced a tipping point thanks to the pandemic, which drove people of all abilities to do more tasks and shopping online.</p>
<p>For the last year, the digital world was the only place brands could connect with their customers. A <a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/digital-accessibility-enters-the-spotlight-as-a-business-priority/">Forrester</a> survey found that 8 in 10 companies have taken their first steps toward working on digital accessibility.</p>
<p>What’s driving this change besides the increased digital interactions? Fortune 500 companies are finally starting to realize that people with disabilities make up 1 billion of the world’s market. That population and their families control more than $13 trillion in disposable income, according to Return on Disability’s “<a href="http://rod-group.com/sites/default/files/Summary%20Report%20-%20The%20Global%20Economics%20of%20Disability%202020.pdf">The Global Economics of Disability</a>.”</p>
<p>However, only 36% of companies in Forrester’s survey are completely committed to creating accessible digital experiences.</p>
<p>Although digital accessibility has been around for decades, companies have not caught on to its benefits until recently. In its latest survey, the <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/">WebAIM Million</a> analysis of 1 million home pages found accessibility errors on 97.4% of the websites evaluated.</p>
<p>What does this mean for you? Why should you care about this? Because this is an opportunity for your company to get ahead of the competition and reap the rewards of being an early adopter.</p>
<h2>The benefits of digital accessibility</h2>
<p>Companies are now realizing the advantages of creating accessible products and properties that go beyond doing the right thing. For one, people are living longer. The <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ageing-and-health#:~:text=People%20worldwide%20are%20living%20longer.%20Today%2C%20for%20the,million%20people%20are%20aged%2080%20years%20or%20older.">World Health Organization</a> says people aged 60 and older outnumber children under 5. Moreover, the world’s population of those who are 60 and older is expected to reach 2 billion by 2050, up from 900 million in 2015.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>W3C Web Accessibility Initiative provides an overview on <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/older-users/literature/#summary">Web Accessibility for Older Users</a>. Here’s what it reveals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hearing loss affects 47% of people aged 61 to 80.</li>
<li>Vision decline affects 16% of people aged 65 to 74.</li>
<li>Mild cognitive impairment affects 20% of people over 70.</li>
<li>Arthritis affects more than 50% of people over 65.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, developing accessible digital products helps you reach a much larger audience, which will include you, your co-workers and your family. Everyone is going to become situationally, temporarily or episodically impaired at some point in their lives. Everyone enters a noisy or dark environment that can make it harder to see or hear. An injury or an illness can cause someone to use the internet differently on a temporary basis. People with arthritis, migraines and vertigo experience episodes of pain and discomfort that affect their ability to interact with digital devices, apps and tools.</p>
<p>Additionally, no one has ever advocated <em>against </em>making products and websites accessible to more people. Despite this, the relative universal appeal of accessibility as a principle does not mean that it will be as easy as explaining the need and getting people on board to make major organizational changes. A lot of work remains in raising awareness and educating people about <em>why </em>we need to make these changes and <em>how</em> to go about it.</p>
<p>You have the why. Now here are five things to help you with how to make changes in your company to integrate accessibility as a core part of your business.</p>
<h2>1. Tap the right people to create accessible experiences</h2>
<p>According to the second annual <a href="https://hubs.ly/H0Vm4kG0">State of Accessibility Report</a>, only 40% of the Alexa Top 100 websites are fully accessible, proving the needs of people with disabilities are, more often than not, being overlooked when creating web experiences.</p>
<p>To design for people with disabilities, it’s important to have an understanding of how they use your products or web properties. You’ll also want to know what tools will help them achieve their desired results. This starts with having the right people on board.</p>
<p>Hiring accessibility experts to advise your development team will proactively identify potential issues and ensure you design accessibly from the start, as well as create better products. Better yet, hiring people with disabilities brings a deeper level of understanding to your work.</p>
<h2>2. Hire designers passionate about accessibility</h2>
<p>Having accessibility experts on your team to provide advice and guidance is a great start. However, if the rest of your team is not passionate about accessibility, that can turn into a potential roadblock. When interviewing new designers, ask about accessibility. It’ll gauge a candidate’s knowledge and passion in the area. At the same time, you set an expectation that accessibility is a priority at your organization.</p>
<p>Being proactive about your hires and making sure they will contribute to a culture of accessibility and inclusion will save you major headaches. Accessibility starts in the design and user experience (UX) phase. If your team doesn’t deliver there, then you will have to fix their mistakes later, essentially delaying the project and costing your organization. It costs more to fix things than to build them accessibly in the first place.</p>
<h2>3. Remember that accessibility is for everyone</h2>
<p>People deciding whether to invest in accessibility often ask themselves how many people are going to use the feature. The reasoning behind the question is understandable from a business perspective; accessibility can be an expense, and it’s reasonable to want to spend money responsibly.</p>
<p>However, the question is rooted in one of the biggest misconceptions in the field. The myth is that accessibility only benefits people who are blind or deaf. This belief is frustrating because it greatly underestimates the number of people with disabilities and minimizes their place in society. Furthermore, it fails to acknowledge that people who may not have a disability still benefit greatly from accessibility features.</p>
<p>Disability is a spectrum that all of us will find ourselves on sooner or later. Maybe an injury temporarily limits our mobility that requires us to perform basic tasks like banking and shopping exclusively online. Or maybe our vision and hearing change as we age, which affects our ability to interact online.</p>
<p>When we understand that accessibility is about designing in a way that includes as many people as possible, we can reframe the conversation around whether it&#8217;s worth investing in. This approach sends a clear message: No business can afford to ignore a fast-growing population.</p>
<p>Think about it this way: If you have a choice of taking an elevator or the stairs, which would you take? Most pick the elevator. Those ramps on street corners called curb cuts? They were initially designed for allowing wheelchairs to cross the street.</p>
<p>Yet, many use these ramps, including parents pushing strollers, travelers pulling luggage, skateboarders rolling and workers moving heavy loads on dollies. A feature initially designed for accessibility benefits far more people than the original target audience. That’s the magic of the curb-cut effect.</p>
<h2>4. Hire agencies that build accessibly by default</h2>
<p>Whether you have a small team or are expanding an in-house accessibility practice, working with an agency can be an effective way to embrace and adopt accessible practices. The secret to a successful partnership is choosing an agency that will help your team grow into its accessibility practice.</p>
<p>The key to finding the right agency is selecting one that builds accessibly by default. When you know you are working with an agency that shares your organization’s values, you have a trusted partner in your mission of improving accessibility. It also removes any guesswork or revisions down the line. This is a huge win, as many designers overlook details that can make or break an experience for a user with a disability.</p>
<p>Working with an agency focused on providing accessible experiences narrows the likelihood of errors going unnoticed and unremedied, giving you confidence that you are providing an excellent experience to your entire audience.</p>
<h2>5. Integrate accessibility into your supply chain</h2>
<p>On any given day, enterprises and large organizations often work with dozens of stakeholders. From vendors and agencies to freelancers and internal employees, the nature of business today is far-reaching and collaborative. While this is valuable for exchanging ideas, accessibility can get lost in the mix with so many different people involved.</p>
<p>To prevent this from happening, it’s important to align these moving pieces of a business into a supply chain that is focused on accessibility at every stage of the business. When everyone is completely bought in, it cuts the risk of a component being inaccessible and causing issues for you in the future.</p>
<h2>The startup advantage</h2>
<p>A major challenge that comes up repeatedly is the struggle to change the status quo. Once an organization implements and ingrains inaccessible processes and products into its culture, it is hard to make meaningful change. Even if everyone is willing to commit to the change, the fact is, rewriting the way you do business is never easy.</p>
<p>Startups have an advantage here: They do not bear years of inaccessible baggage. It’s not written into the code of their products. It’s not woven into the business culture. In many ways, a startup is a clean slate, and they need to learn from the trials of their more established peers.</p>
<p>Startup founders have the opportunity to build an accessible organization from the ground up. They can create an accessible-first culture that will not need rewriting 10, 20 or 30 years from now by hiring a diverse workforce with a passion for accessibility, writing accessible code for products and web properties, choosing to work with only third parties who embrace accessibility and advocating for the rights of people with disabilities.</p>
<p>Many of these considerations here have a common denominator: culture. While most people in the technology industry will agree that accessibility is an important and worthy cause to champion, it has a huge awareness problem.</p>
<p>Accessibility needs to be everywhere in software development, from requirements and beyond to include marketing, sales and other non-tech teams. It cannot be a niche concern left to a siloed team to handle. If we, as an industry and as a society, recognize that accessibility is <em>everyone’s </em>job, we will create a culture that prioritizes it without question.</p>
<p>By creating this culture, we will no longer be asking, “Do we have to make this accessible?” Instead, we’ll ask, “How do we make this accessible?” It’s a major mindset shift that will make a tangible difference in the lives of 1 billion people living with a disability and those who eventually will have a disability or temporary, situational or episodic impairments affecting their ability to use online and digital products.</p>
<p>Advocating for accessibility may feel like an uphill battle at times, but it isn’t rocket science. The biggest need is education and awareness.</p>
<p>When you understand the people you build accessible products for and the reasons they need those products, it becomes easier to secure buy-in from people in all parts of your organization. Creating this culture is the first step in a long quest toward accessibility. And the best part is, it gets easier from here.</p>

		Ken Sutton is CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://yobeinc.com/">Yobe</a>, a software company that uses edge-based AI to unlock the potential of voice technologies for modern brands.	</div>

<p>Hospitality, travel, IoT and the auto industry are all on the cusp of leveling-up voice assistant adoption and the monetization of voice. The global voice and speech recognition market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.2% from 2019 to reach $26.8 billion by 2025, according to <a href="https://www.meticulousresearch.com/product/speech-and-voice-recognition-market-5038">Meticulous Research</a>. Companies like Amazon and Apple will accelerate this growth as they leverage ambient computing capabilities, which will continue to push voice interfaces forward as a primary interface.</p>
<p>As voice technologies become ubiquitous, companies are turning their focus to the value of the data latent in these new channels. Microsoft’s recent acquisition of Nuance is not just about achieving better NLP or voice assistant technology, it’s also about the trove of healthcare data that the conversational AI has collected.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Our voice technologies have not been engineered to confront the messiness of the real world or the cacophony of our actual lives.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Google has monetized every click of your mouse, and the same thing is now happening with voice. Advertisers have found that speak-through conversion rates are higher than click-through conversation rates. Brands need to begin developing voice strategies to reach customers — or risk being left behind.</p>
<p>Voice tech adoption was already on the rise, but with most of the world under lockdown protocol during the COVID-19 pandemic, adoption is set to skyrocket. Nearly <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/voice-assistant-and-smart-speaker-users-2020">40%</a> of internet users in the U.S. use smart speakers at least monthly in 2020, according to Insider Intelligence.</p>
<p>Yet, there are several fundamental technology barriers keeping us from reaching the full potential of the technology.</p>
<h2>The steep climb to commercializing voice</h2>
<p>By the end of 2020, <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS47534521">worldwide shipments</a> of wearable devices rose 27.2% to 153.5 million from a year earlier, but despite all the progress made in voice technologies and their integration in a plethora of end-user devices, they are still largely limited to simple tasks. That is finally starting to change as consumers demand more from these interactions, and voice becomes a more essential interface.</p>
<p>In 2018, in-car shoppers spent $230 billion to order food, coffee, groceries or items to pick up at a store. The auto industry is one of the earliest adopters of voice AI, but in order to really capture voice technology’s true potential, it needs to become a more seamless, truly hands-free experience. Ambient car noise still muddies the signal enough that it keeps users tethered to using their phones.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://kalepa.com/">Kalepa</a>, an insurance underwriting platform based out of New York, has raised a $14 million Series A funding round led by Inspired Capital, with participation from previous investor IA Ventures. Also participating was Gokul Rajaram of Doordash, Coinbase, and formerly of Google, Jackie Reses, formerly of Square, and Henry Ward of Carta.</p>
<p>Founded by Paul Monasterio and Daniel Hillman, the startup was launched in 2018 aimed at commercial insurance underwriters.</p>
<p>Co-Founder and CEO, Paul Monasterio said: “InsureTech has seen a massive evolution over the past decade, but commercial insurance—which supports hard-working business owners and protects their most important assets—has been left behind. We leverage billions of data points and unlock crucial insights in order to bring businesses and insurers a single version of the truth.”</p>
<p>Kalepa says its Copilot software automatically learns what the best underwriters are doing, allowing an underwriter to take a more accurate underwriting decision as quickly as possible vs. simply aggregating a lot of data for them. It competes with the legacy MGAs (e.g., RT Specialty, AmWins) as well as new entrants such as Pathpoint in the E&amp;S market.</p>
<p>Penny Pritzker, co-founder at Inspired Capital and former U.S. Secretary of Commerce said: “Commercial insurance represents a $1T industry globally and helps 30 million U.S. businesses. Kalepa has brought some of the sharpest minds in understanding risk to this segment of the insurance market.”</p>
<p>Veteran insurance player Mario Vitale is also joining Kalepa’s Board.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">There’s an old startup adage that goes: Cash is king. I’m not sure that is true anymore.</p>
<p>In today’s cash rich environment, options are more valuable than cash. Founders have many guides on how to raise money, but not enough has been written about how to protect your startup’s option pool. As a founder, recruiting talent is the most important factor for success. In turn, managing your option pool may be the most effective action you can take to ensure you can recruit and retain talent.</p>
<p>That said, managing your option pool is no easy task. However, with some foresight and planning, it’s possible to take advantage of certain tools at your disposal and avoid common pitfalls.</p>
<p>In this piece, I’ll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mechanics of the option pool over multiple funding rounds.</li>
<li>Common pitfalls that trip up founders along the way.</li>
<li>What you can do to protect your option pool or to correct course if you made mistakes early on.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A minicase study on option pool mechanics</h2>
<p>Let’s run through a quick case study that sets the stage before we dive deeper. In this example, there are three equal co-founders who decide to quit their jobs to become startup founders.</p>
<p>Since they know they need to hire talent, the trio gets going with a 10% option pool at inception. They then cobble together enough money across angel, pre-seed and seed rounds (with 25% cumulative dilution across those rounds) to achieve product-market fit (PMF). With PMF in the bag, they raise a Series A, which results in a further 25% dilution.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The easiest way to ensure you don’t run out of options too quickly is simply to start with a bigger pool.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>After hiring a few C-suite executives, they are now running low on options. So at the Series B, the company does a 5% option pool top-up pre-money — in addition to giving up 20% in equity related to the new cash injection. When the Series C and D rounds come by with dilutions of 15% and 10%, the company has hit its stride and has an imminent IPO in the works. Success!</p>
<p>For simplicity, I will assume a few things that don’t normally happen but will make illustrating the math here a bit easier:</p>
<ol>
<li>No investor participates in their pro-rata after their initial investment.</li>
<li>Half the available pool is issued to new hires and/or used for refreshes every round.</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, every situation is unique and your mileage may vary. But this is a close enough proxy to what happens to a lot of startups in practice. Here is what the available option pool will look like over time across rounds:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197721" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197721" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2197721" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Figure-1.png" alt="Option pool example" width="1024" height="404" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Figure-1.png 2031w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Figure-1.png?resize=150,59 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Figure-1.png?resize=300,118 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Figure-1.png?resize=768,303 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Figure-1.png?resize=680,268 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Figure-1.png?resize=1536,606 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Figure-1.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197721" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Allen Miller</p></div></p>
<p>Note how quickly the pool thins out — especially early on. In the beginning, 10% sounds like a lot, but it’s hard to make the first few hires when you have nothing to show the world and no cash to pay salaries. In addition, early rounds don’t just dilute your equity as a founder, they dilute everyone&#8217;s — including your option pool (both allocated and unallocated). By the time the company raises its Series B, the available pool is already less than 1.5%.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in July, <a href="https://www.yasa.com/">YASA</a> (formerly Yokeless And Segmented Armature), a British electric motor startup with a revolutionary &#8216;axial-flux&#8217; motor, was acquired by Mercedes-Benz. The acquisition didn’t exactly garner enormous press attention, as scant other details were announced. But YASA is likely to be an entity worth watching.</p>
<p>Founded in 2009 after being spun out of Oxford University, YASA will now develop ultra-high-performance electric motors for Mercedes-Benz’s AMG.EA electric-only platform. It will stay in the UK as a fully owned subsidiary, serving both Mercedes-Benz and existing customers like Ferrari. The company will retain its own brand, team, facilities, and location in Oxford.</p>
<p>YASA&#8217;s axial-flux electric motors generated EV industry interest because of their efficiency, high power density, small size, and low weight.</p>
<p>By contrast, the &#8216;radial&#8217; electric motor design is more common in today’s EV market. Even Tesla relies on radial electric motors, a legacy technology more than 40 years old with very little left to give in terms of innovation.</p>
<p>But YASA’s axial-flux design, which has very thin segments, means they can be combined into powerful single drive units. This makes them one-third the weight of other electric motors, more efficient, and with 3x higher power densities than Tesla.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/timwoolmer">Tim Woolmer</a>, YASA’s Founder and CTO, invented this very new approach to electric motor design. I caught up with him to find out what’s next.</p>
<p><strong>TC</strong>: What’s the journey so far:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TW</strong>: We started just over 12 years ago with really one remit: let&#8217;s accelerate electric cars, let&#8217;s do anything we can to make electric cars happen faster. We&#8217;re now 10 years into a 20-year revolution, every new car that gets sold in 10 years will be electric, no question. There&#8217;s nothing more exciting for an engineer than a period of revolution because the speed of innovation is what&#8217;s important. What is so exciting for us is we get to innovate fast, and that&#8217;s where the partnership with Mercedes is really interesting.</p>
<p><strong>TC</strong>: What was different about the engine you came up with?</p>
<p><strong>TW</strong>: We started with a blank sheet of paper at the beginning of my PhD. And the idea was to say, what could be created for the electric car industry in 10 or 15 years from now that they would need, that we could meet. Something that was lighter, more efficient, mass-producible in volume. In the 2000s, axial flux motors were not very common, but by combining axial flux technology and making a couple of little tweaks using some new materials, I basically stumbled into this new design which we call YASA: Yokeless And Segmented Armature. It takes what is a light topology in axial flux and makes it even lighter, about half as much again. There&#8217;s a benefit because the rotors are rotating at a bigger diameter. So, essentially torque is force times diameter, so for the same force, you get more torque. So if you double your diameter, you get double the torque for the same amount of materials. So that&#8217;s the benefit of axial flux.</p>
<p><strong>TC</strong>: You’ve done this with deal with Mercedes &#8211; what’s next?</p>
<p><strong>TW</strong>: We are basically a fully owned subsidiary. We&#8217;re going to utilize Mercedes’ industrialization powerhouse. But the key thing is, if you watch how technologies filter down in automotive, they start in the luxury sector, like the Ferraris of this world, and then filter down into mainstream sector and then go into higher volumes after that. That&#8217;s a space where Mercedes are world-class in terms of their industrialization, so that&#8217;s the kind of the idea behind the partnership.</p>
<p><strong>TC</strong>: What else can you do from here?</p>
<p><strong>TW</strong>: We will have a very high, high power, low density and lightweight engine so we can explore sport performance coupled with high levels of industrialization. That puts us in a really unique position for all sorts of things.</p>
<p>Although coy about his future plans, Woolmer is certainly one to watch in the EV and electric motor space. Post the acquisition YASA released this video:<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram made headlines (including this one) when product head Adam Mosseri <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CQwNfFBJr5A/">said in June</a> that the app is &#8220;no longer just a square photo-sharing app,&#8221; since it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/after-testing-instagram-launches-ads-in-the-instagram-shop-tab-globally/">pivoting its focus</a> to shopping and video. But where does that leave photographers who want a social photo-sharing experience?</p>
<p>According to Tom Watson, a former product designer at Facebook and Pinterest, photographers have lacked a social network for a while. That&#8217;s why, with co-founder Stefan Borsje, Watson built Glass, a subscription-based iOS app designed to be a home for photographers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always loved photography, and when Flickr got <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/23/flickrs-acquisition-9-years-later/">bought by Yahoo</a>, it was a sad moment for me. I love that kind of nerdy photography community,&#8221; Watson told TechCrunch. &#8220;Then you started to see it pick up with Instagram to take the torch into the mobile space. But I was at Facebook when Facebook purchased Instagram, and you could kind of see that it would inevitably be where it is today.&#8221;</p>
<p>For those of us accustomed to free, ad-supported social media, it might feel unfamiliar to pay a monthly fee for an app. Glass costs $4.99 a month (or $29.99 a year) to use, but you can try it without charge for 14 days. Still, the app takes your App Store payment info right away, so it could be a barrier to entry for people who worry they won&#8217;t remember to delete Glass before the trial period ends, should they not want to continue with it. But this model is intentional. Watson and Borsje are specifically trying to build their app &#8212; which only has five team members &#8212; without any venture funding or ad revenue. They only want to have to answer to their community of photographers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to do something different and start with a social subscription model and to bootstrap without venture capital,&#8221; said Watson. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen in the past what happens when you take on venture capital and go for the moon. You keep pivoting away from your photographer community in order to become more broad.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197793" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197793" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2197793" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="390" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg?resize=768,440 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg?resize=680,390 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg?resize=1536,881 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg?resize=2048,1174 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197793" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Glass</p></div></p>
<p>From the moment you open the Glass app, it&#8217;s clear that the emphasis is on the photography itself. When you follow photographers, their posts will appear in a feed of images designed to minimize distractions. The photos take up the entire screen, and you can only see who posted them if you drag them to the right. When you click on an image, you can see its caption and other information about how the photograph was shot. You can engage socially through comments, but there aren&#8217;t likes on photos &#8212; this is an intentional design choice, though Watson says some users are asking for a like button, even if it just helps them bookmark images for later browsing. In the coming weeks, Glass will launch<a href="https://glass.photo/updates/glimpse-into-glass"> discovery features</a>, like categories for photographs. Glass also has a feedback board, which allows users to request features and upvote or downvote other users&#8217; ideas. If Glass chooses to develop a suggestion, it is noted as &#8220;in progress&#8221; on the board.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though it&#8217;s only in its beginning stages, Glass already sets itself apart from Instagram or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/05/inside-vsco-a-gen-z-approved-photo-sharing-app-with-ceo-joel-flory/">VSCO</a> by offering EXIF data, which is like candy for the &#8220;photography nerds&#8221; that Glass hopes to attract. EXIF data shows what camera a photographer used, as well as the photo&#8217;s ISO, aperture, shutter speed, and focal length. This data and sense of community was what drew people to Flickr in its early days, but when Yahoo gave free users up to one terrabyte of data, it became more of a personal archive than a community. Then, when SmugMug bought Flickr from Yahoo in 2018, it tried to backpedal by only allowing free users to have 1000 photos, warning that they could <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/01/flickr-revamps-under-smugmug-with-new-limits-on-free-accounts-unlimited-storage-for-pros/">delete free users&#8217; photos</a> if they didn&#8217;t upgrade to a paid plan.</p>
<p>Glass also appeals to photographers by allowing for a wider variety of image sizes on the app &#8212; the maximum aspect ratio is 16 x 9, which accommodates the size of standard camera photos. But on Instagram, even after the platform moved away from its square image motif, it&#8217;s not possible to post vertical photographs from most cameras without cropping them. Like VSCO, Glass doesn&#8217;t show how many followers each user has, though you can see comments. While you can&#8217;t see how many followers someone else has, you can see who is following your own account.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought that was important for safety. If someone follows you, you need to know who that is, and to be able to block them,&#8221; Watson said. &#8220;We really wanted to build blocking and reporting features from day one.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Watson declined to share how many users have downloaded the app so far, but Watson said he&#8217;s &#8220;extremely happy with the response&#8221; to Glass. It launched with a waitlist in August, and Wednesday the app opened up to all iOS users. The goal of the waitlist wasn&#8217;t to generate hype, but rather, to make sure that the user experience remained smooth, and that the app wouldn&#8217;t get overloaded. At the time of the app&#8217;s waitlist launch in August, Watson told TechCrunch that Glass was sending hundreds of invites out every day. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been on the internet a long time, and I used to feel like there was a cozier, safer space,&#8221; Watson said. &#8220;I hope that by having this subscription model, these spaces can feel that way a little bit more again.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/1b3ba3cf-fb54-46b3-b9a6-7c8307897784?dark=false" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> gathered to dig through the week&#8217;s biggest happenings, including some news of our own. As a note, Equity&#8217;s Monday episode will be landing next <em>Tuesday, </em>thanks to a national holiday here in the United States. And we have something special planned for Wednesday, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>Ok! Here&#8217;s the rundown from the show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apollo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apollo-completes-its-5b-acquisition-of-verizon-media-now-known-as-yahoo/">completed its takeover of <del>Verizon Media Group</del> Yahoo</a>: Yep, we have new bosses, and we have feelings about it. But mostly the TechCrunch news was a useful segue to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/vista-equity-takes-majority-stake-in-saas-startup-drift-taking-it-to-unicorn-status/">Drift&#8217;s majority exit to Vista Equity Partners</a> at a price that made the Boston-based startup a unicorn. Terms were not disclosed, sadly, but Drift&#8217;s revenues looked strong going into the transaction. That left us with questions.</li>
<li>Then we chatted about Databricks, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/databricks-raises-1-6b-at-38b-valuation-as-it-blasts-past-600m-arr/">raised a small country&#8217;s GDP in a single funding round this week</a>, valuing the data-and-ML company at a staggering $38 billion valuation. Why isn&#8217;t Databricks going public? Because it doesn&#8217;t have to, mostly.</li>
<li>Hum Capital believes the future of startup fundraising <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/hum-capital-thinks-the-future-of-funding-is-a-return-to-old-school-wall-street/">requires a return to old school Wall Street. </a>The startup helps founders and investors navigate the overly fragmented market these days, and just raised millions to scale this service.</li>
<li>Form there we dug into two IPOs, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/5-takeaways-from-toasts-s-1-filing/">including the very interesting story of Toast</a>, another Boston-based company, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/31/business/allbirds-ipo.html">and AllBirds</a>. The AllBirds offering was less exciting from a numerical perspective, though Natasha and Alex both like their shoes from the company.</li>
<li>And to close out, we discussed how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/compounds-foods-brews-up-4-5m-to-make-coffee-without-beans/">Compound Foods wants to save the planet</a> by making coffee sans beans. Which we are willing to try as soon as we can.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s a wrap from us for the week! Keep your head atop your shoulders and have a great weekend!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup called <a href="https://www.playbyte.io/">Playbyte</a> wants to become the TikTok for games. The company&#8217;s newly launched <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/playbyte/id1551822717">iOS app</a> offers tools that allow users to make and share simple games on their phone, as well as a vertically scrollable, fullscreen feed where you can play the games created by others. Also like TikTok, the feed becomes more personalized over time to serve up more of the kinds of games you like to play.</p>
<p>While typically, game creation involves some aspect of coding, Playbyte&#8217;s games are created using simple building blocks, emoji and even images from your Camera Roll on your iPhone. The idea is to make building games just another form of self-expression, rather than some introductory, educational experience that&#8217;s trying to teach users the basics of coding.</p>
<p>At its core, Playbyte&#8217;s game creation is powered by its lightweight 2D game engine built on web frameworks, which lets users create games that can be quickly loaded and played even on slow connections and older devices. After you play a game, you can like and comment using buttons on the right-side of the screen, which also greatly resembles the TikTok look-and-feel. Over time, Playbyte&#8217;s feed shows you more of the games you enjoyed as the app leverages its understanding of in-game imagery, tags and descriptions, and other engagement analytics to serve up more games it believes you&#8217;ll find compelling.</p>
<p>At launch, users have already made a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@team_playbyte?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">variety of games</a> using Playbyte&#8217;s tools &#8212; including simulators, tower defense games, combat challenges, obbys, murder mystery games, and more.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We made an app called Playbyte that lets you make games on your phone, discover games made by other users, and challenge your friends <a href="https://t.co/FFnMbKG1ls">https://t.co/FFnMbKG1ls</a> <a href="https://t.co/eqhabN3kM1">pic.twitter.com/eqhabN3kM1</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Playbyte (@PlaybyteInc) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlaybyteInc/status/1397259875076481029?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>According to Playbyte founder and CEO Kyle Russell &#8212; previously of Skydio, Andreessen Horowitz, and (disclosure!) TechCrunch &#8212; Playbyte is meant to be a social media app, not just a games app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have this model in our minds for what is required to build a new social media platform,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>What Twitter did for text, Instagram did for photos and TikTok did for video was to combine a constraint with a personalized feed, Russell explains. &#8220;Typically. [they started] with a focus on making these experiences really brief&#8230;So a short, constrained format and dedicated tools that set you up for success to work within that constrained format,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Similarly, Playbyte games have their own set of limitations. In addition to their simplistic nature, the games are limited to five scenes. Thanks to this constraint, a format has emerged where people are making games that have an intro screen where you hit &#8220;play,&#8221; a story intro, a challenging gameplay section, and then a story outro.</p>
<p>In addition to its easy-to-use game building tools, Playbyte also allows game assets to be reused by other game creators. That means if someone who has more expertise makes a game asset using custom logic or which pieced together multiple components, the rest of the user base can benefit from that work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically, we want to make it really easy for people who aren&#8217;t as ambitious to still feel like productive, creative game makers,&#8221; says Russell. &#8220;The key to that is going to be if you have an idea &#8212; like an image of a game in your mind &#8212; you should be able to very quickly search for new assets or piece together other ones you&#8217;ve previously saved. And then just drop them in and mix-and-match &#8212; almost like Legos &#8212; and construct something that&#8217;s 90% of what you imagined, without any further configuration on your part,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>In time, Playbyte plans to monetize its feed with brand advertising, perhaps by allowing creators to drop sponsored assets into their games, for instance. It also wants to establish some sort of patronage model at a later point. This could involve either subscriptions or even NFTs of the games, but this would be further down the road.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The startup had originally began as a web app in 2019, but at the end of last year, the team scrapped that plan and rewrote everything as a native iOS app with its own game engine. That app launched on the App Store this week, after previously maxing out TestFlight&#8217;s cap of 10,000 users.</p>
<p>Currently, it&#8217;s finding traction with younger teenagers who are active on TikTok and other collaborative games, like Roblox, Minecraft, or Fortnite.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are young people who feel inspired to build their own games but have been intimidated by the need to learn to code or use other advanced tools, or who simply don&#8217;t have a computer at home that would let them access those tools,&#8221; notes Russell.</p>
<p>Playbyte is backed by $4 million in pre-seed and seed funding from investors including FirstMark (Rick Heitzmann), Ludlow Ventures (Jonathon Triest and Blake Robbins), Dream Machine (former Editor-in-Chief at TechCrunch, Alexia Bonatsos), and angels such as Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase; Nate Mitchell, co-founder of Oculus; Ashita Achuthan, previously of Twitter; and others.</p>
<p>The app is a free download <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/playbyte/id1551822717">on the App Store</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://technologyonecorp.co.uk/">TechnologyOne</a>, an Australian SaaS enterprise, has agreed to acquire UK-based higher education software provider <a href="https://www.scientia.com/">Scientia</a> for £12 million /$16.6 million in cash.<br />
 <br />
TechnologyOne claims to have 75% of Higher Education institutions in Australia using its software, while Scientia claims 50% market share in the UK.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The ongoing fintech revolution continues to level the playing field where legacy companies have historically dominated startups.</p>
<p>To compete with retail banks, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/all-the-reasons-why-you-should-launch-a-credit-or-debit-card/">many newcomers are offering customers credit and debit cards</a>; developer-friendly APIs make issuance relatively easy, and tools for managing processes like KYC are available off the shelf.</p>
<p>To learn more about the low barriers to entry — and the inherent challenges of creating a unique card offering — reporter Ryan Lawler interviewed:</p>

<p>The barrier to entry for launching hardware startups has fallen; if you can pull off a successful crowdfunding campaign, you&#8217;re likely savvy enough to find a factory overseas that can build your widgets to spec.</p>
<p>But global supply chains are fragile: No one expected an off-course container ship to block the Suez Canal for six days. Due to the pandemic, importers are paying almost $18,000 for shipping containers from China today that cost $3,300 a year ago.</p>
<p>After spending a career spinning up supply chains on three continents, Liteboxer CEO Jeff Morin authored a guide for Extra Crunch for hardware founders.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you’re clear-eyed about the challenges and apply some rigor and forethought to the process, the end result can be hard to match,&#8221; Morin says.</p>

<p>Few people thought about virtual events before the pandemic struck, but this format has fulfilled a unique and important need for organizations large and small since early 2020. But what will virtual events’ value be as more of the world attempts a return to “normal”?</p>
<p>To find out, we caught up with top executives and investors in the sector to learn about the big trends they’re seeing — as the sequel to a survey we did in March 2020.</p>
<p>We surveyed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xiaoyin Qu, founder and CEO, Run The World</li>
<li>Rosie Roca, chief customer officer, Hopin</li>
<li>Hemant Mohapatra, partner, Lightspeed Venture Partners India</li>
<li>Paul Murphy, former investor in Hopin with Northzone (currently co-founder of Katch)</li>

<p>Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim wrapped up TechCrunch’s coverage of the summer cohort from Y Combinator’s Demo Day with an evaluation of how the group fared in comparison to their expectations.</p>
<p>They were surprised by the number of startups focusing on no-and low-code software, and pleased by the unanticipated quantity of new companies focusing on space.</p>
<p>“It seems only fair to note that some categories of startup activity simply met our expectations in terms of popularity,” noting delivery-focused startups including dark stores and kitchens.</p>
<p>Popping up less than expected? Crypto and insurtech.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has delayed plans to roll out its child sexual abuse (CSAM) detection technology that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/">chaotically announced last month</a>, citing feedback from customers and policy groups.</p>
<p>That feedback, if you recall, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apples-csam-detection-tech-is-under-fire-again/">been largely negative</a>. The Electronic Frontier Foundation said this week it had amassed more than 25,000 signatures from consumers. On top of that, close to 100 policy and rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, also <a href="https://cdt.org/insights/international-coalition-calls-on-apple-to-abandon-plan-to-build-surveillance-capabilities-into-iphones-ipads-and-other-products/">called</a> on Apple to abandon plans to roll out the technology.</p>
<p>In a statement on Friday morning, Apple told TechCrunch:</p>
<p>&#8220;Last month we announced plans for features intended to help protect children from predators who use communication tools to recruit and exploit them, and limit the spread of Child Sexual Abuse Material. Based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features.”</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s so-called NeuralHash technology is designed to identify known CSAM on a user’s device without having to possess the image or knowing the contents of the image. Because a user’s photos stored in iCloud are encrypted so that even Apple can’t access the data, NeuralHash instead scans for known CSAM on a user’s device, which Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/interview-apples-head-of-privacy-details-child-abuse-detection-and-messages-safety-features/?tpcc=ECTW2020">claims is more privacy-friendly</a> than the current blanket scanning that cloud providers use.</p>
<p>But security experts and privacy advocates have expressed concern that the system <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life">could be abused</a> by highly resourced actors, like governments, to implicate innocent victims or to manipulate the system to detect other materials that authoritarian nation states find objectionable.</p>
<p>Within a few weeks of announcing the technology, researchers said they were able to create &#8220;hash collisions&#8221; using NeuralHash, effectively <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apples-csam-detection-tech-is-under-fire-again/">tricking the system</a> into thinking two entirely different images were the same.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>iOS 15 is expected out later in the next few weeks.</p>
<p><em>This report has been updated with more detail about NeuralHash and to clarify iCloud Photos are encrypted but not end-to-end encrypted. </em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The mobile app that provides information and reviews on barbers for potential customers while also managing appointments, mobile payments and pricing on the back end for barbers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.thecut.co/">TheCut</a>, a technology platform designed to handle back-end operations for barbers, raised $4.5 million in new funding.</p>
<p>Nextgen Venture Partners led the round and was joined by Elevate Ventures, Singh Capital and Leadout Capital. The latest funding gives theCut $5.35 million in total funding since the company was founded in 2016, founder Obi Omile Jr. told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Omile and Kush Patel created the mobile app that provides information and reviews on barbers for potential customers while also managing appointments, mobile payments and pricing on the back end for barbers.</p>
<p>“Kush and I both had terrible experiences with haircuts, and decided to build an app to help find good barbers,” Omile said. “We found there were great barbers, but no way to discover them. You can do a Google search, but it doesn’t list the individual barber. With theCut, you can discover an individual barber and discover if they are a great fit for you and won’t screw up your hair.”</p>
<p>The app also enables barbers, perhaps for the first time, to have a list of clients and keep notes and photos of hair styles, as well as track visits and spending. By providing payments, barbers can also leverage digital trends to provide additional services and extras to bring in more revenue. On the customer side, there is a search function with barber profile, photos of their work, ratings and reviews, a list of service offerings and pricing.</p>
<p>Omile said there are 400,000 to 600,000 barbers in the U.S., and it is one of the fastest-growth markets. As a result, the new funding will be used to hire additional talent, marketing and to grow the business across the country.</p>
<p>“We’ve gotten to a place where we are hitting our stride and seeing business catapulting, so we are in hiring mode,” he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indeed, the company generated more than $500 million in revenue for barbers since its launch and is adding over 100,000 users each month. In addition, the app averages 1.5 million appointment bookings each month.</p>
<p>Next up, Omile wants to build out some new features like a digital store and the ability to process more physical payments by rolling out a card reader for in-person payments. TheCut will also focus on enabling barbers to have more personal relationships with their customers.</p>
<p>“We are building software to empower people to be the best version of themselves, in this case barbers,” he added. “The relationship with customers is an opportunity for the barber to make specific recommendations on products and create a grooming experience.”</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Leadout founder and managing partner Ali Rosenthal joined the company&#8217;s board of directors. She said Omile and Patel are the kind of founders that venture capitalists look for — experts in their markets and data-driven technologists.</p>
<p>“They had done so much with so little by the time we met them,” Rosenthal added. “They are creating a passionate community and set of modern, tech-driven features that are tailored to the needs of their customers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Editor&#8217;s note:</strong> <em><a href="https://twitter.com/kylebrussell">Kyle Russell</a> is the founder of <a href="https://playbyte.io/">Playbyte</a>, a startup building an app that lets people make games on their phones.</em></p>
<p>Last Friday, Dom Hofmann tweeted the launch of <a href="https://www.lootproject.com/" rel="">Loot</a>, one of his new projects looking at games and game creation through the lens of NFTs:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>If “NFTs,” “gas” and “minting” sound unintelligible, the short version is that this project lets you spend some money to create <strong>a unique list of items</strong> that you could keep in the same wallet (an app like <a href="http://rainbow.me/" rel="">Rainbow</a>) where you’d keep cryptocurrencies or other digital collectibles, typically art (or, as skeptics gleefully note, JPEGs).</p>
<p>I repeat: <strong>a unique list of items. </strong>No artwork, stats to compare quality or even game rules that could inform such stats.</p>
<p>People spent money to get those unique lists. Thousands. And as happens in NFTs, a market quickly formed around these unique lists of items. The “floor,” or minimum price to buy into a Loot “bag,” <a href="https://twitter.com/mikedemarais/status/1432852925697646596?s=21" rel="">shot to thousands of dollars worth of Ethereum</a>. Certain kinds of items in these lists sounded cool and were found to be rare upon analysis of the entire set, and so bags containing them rose in value to extreme heights:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>And people began to fill in those missing elements like art — not fundamentally changing the underlying lists, but creating new works that explicitly reference the items in particular lists:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>And like the lists themselves, people began taking an algorithmic approach to generating that art:</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>By August 31st, there was a legible community of people…</p>
<ul>
<li>investing in bags containing certain kinds of items;</li>
<li>creating tools for visualizing Loot items and monitoring price fluctuations in this niche market;</li>
<li>working on new derivative projects, like creating Realms for a theoretical adventurer with the gear in a Loot bag to explore:</li>

<p>Except, there’s still no game rules for these items — including what it would even mean to have a character equipping them!</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In less than a week, a community has gone from lists of text to infinitely many illustrations of those items to worlds for those items to reside in and characters to wield them. All from taking simple primitives and generating context around them that gives them value.</p>
<p>It’s pretty magical stuff. But even if there’s some speculative angle to the creation happening, how many people get to participate if these bags cost tens of thousands of dollars at a minimum? On the one hand: If you just think the game of making up a game is fun, because all of these bags and items live on the Ethereum network, then you can still make things that incorporate them at no cost (short of the painful fees currently associated with using Ethereum).</p>
<p>And if it really matters to you to have those unique objects in a wallet of your own so you can really participate, people are thinking of interesting paths there, as well:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>If that’s all too jargon-y, I’ll again summarize: There are feasible paths to making it free to “have” these items for the purpose of playing with the growing set of inter-compatible apps or games that might incorporate Loot — you just won’t have a Legit Bag with rare items that could sell for lots of money.</p>
<p>Oh, and what if you like some of the items in a Loot bag, but wish your adventurer could mix-and-match with other items from the broader set that just dropped?</p>

<p>Less than a week and already getting disrupted by unbundling!</p>
<h2>I’m sorry, why is this interesting?</h2>
<p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe started with Marvel Comics taking out a billion-dollar loan to finance the first four movies based on its iconic superhero characters. The seeds of awareness of these characters had been planted in the minds of the masses through decades of appearances in comics and TV leading up to their first appearances in blockbuster films. Decades of perhaps hundreds of writers and artists were getting paid to create fantastical stories for those characters that people would want to read and that would get them hooked to come back for the next issue. People came to closely associate themselves with characters with kind of funny origins (bit by a radioactive spider!).</p>
<p>This all happened in a top-down, corporate, mass-production context. A few creatives at Marvel did high-leverage work on a freelance or in-house basis, printers made a ton of copies and a supply chain got those issues to comics shops and dime stores across the country. Like dominoes, Stan Lee thinks of some new superhero (pitch: this guy’s not a hippy, he’s a weapons manufacturer industrialist!) to five decades later, Avengers: Endgame and Black Panther warp the definition of blockbuster forever.</p>
<p>But what if someone wanted to create an MCU competitor as a community, instead of going head-to-head with Disney?</p>
<p>Extrapolating from the last week of Loot…</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2197922 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/https___bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_fa758d5e-644d-4c12-9d5a-9bcc41ed61ad_460x184.gif" alt="" width="460" height="184" /></p>
<p>You’d release a contract to generate sets of superhero names and associated powers. People would mint those heroes and they would begin to trade on the open market. People would build tools that determine which powers are more rare, especially around ones that sound cool (“flight” is a gimme).</p>
<p>They’d imagine their hero, illustrate them themselves and commission artists who could make them look cool. Eventually more technical folks in the community would do the heavy lifting to piece together tools that could generate art for characters in a common style, or be customizable by some key parameters.</p>
<p>Eventually, people would commission crossover art, and then you’re only a step away from shared storylines (increase the value of multiple characters with a single commissioned piece!).</p>
<p>DAOs, or decentralized groups who come together to create new projects in the crypto space or even &#8220;just” invest together, might buy up more popular characters and commission more elaborate visual stories with the aim of boosting the value of that underlying item containing a hero name + powers and any popular artworks that they inspired.</p>
<p>And assuming the project’s originators went with the direction of the Loot zeitgeist, all of this would be IP that could be re-used and remixed by anyone. That might sound crazy — isn’t the point to own it, and the point of owning it is to control how it’s used?</p>
<p>That’s the Disney status quo. In a world of projects like Loot, you want to reinforce the value of the NFT you own — and that value reflects that NFT’s renown and reputation. Echoing the phrase “all press is good press”: Any remix is a good remix. To be referenced is to still be culturally relevant. So if you own an NFT describing Arachnid Person, you want to contribute to an environment where as many people want to include Arachnid Person in their works as possible so that Arachnid Man No. 1 becomes something worth owning.</p>
<p>I’m really just expanding on Dylan Field:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Feels like two paths are emerging in NFT space.</p>
<p>(1) Build a universe but hold onto IP. Ex: <a href="https://twitter.com/larvalabs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@larvalabs</a> deal with UTA (<a href="https://t.co/OxOq106hiK">https://t.co/OxOq106hiK</a>)</p>
<p>(2) Form a community to build a universe. Give all the IP away. See what happens. Ex: <a href="https://twitter.com/lootproject?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@lootproject</a> </p>
<p>Personally like approach #2 better!</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>And John Palmer rightly emphasizes something special: The lack of anybody who can say “no,” as people try to figure out how to make Loot cool:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Getting inside the mind of customers is a challenge as behaviors and demands shift, but <a href="https://clootrack.com">Clootrack</a> believes it has cracked the code in helping brands figure out how to do that.</p>
<p>It announced $4 million in Series A funding, led by Inventus Capital India, and included existing investors Unicorn India Ventures, IAN Fund and Salamander Excubator Angel Fund, as well as individual investment from Jiffy.ai CEO Babu Sivadasan. In total, the company raised $4.6 million, co-founder Shameel Abdulla told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Clootrack is a real-time customer experience analytics platform that helps brands understand why customers stay or churn. Shameel Abdulla and Subbakrishna Rao, who both come from IT backgrounds, founded the company in 2017 after meeting years prior at Jiffstore, Abdulla’s second company that was acquired in 2015.</p>

<p>Business-to-consumer and consumer brands often use customer satisfaction metrics like Net Promoter Score to understand the customer experience, but Abdulla said current methods don’t provide the “why” of those experiences and are slow, expensive and error-prone.</p>
<p>“The number of channels has increased, which means customers are talking to you, expressing their feedback and what they think in multiple places,” he added. “Word of mouth has gone digital, and you basically have to master the art of selling online.”</p>
<p>Clootrack turns the customer experience data from all of those first-party and third-party touchpoints — website feedback, chat bots, etc. — into granular, qualitative insights that give brands a look at drivers of the experience in hours rather than months so that they can stay on top of fast-moving trends.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Abdulla points to data that show <a href="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/pdf/cxtrends/cx-trends-2020-full-report.pdf">a customer’s biggest driver of brand switch</a> is the experience they receive. And, that <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers">if brands can reduce churns by 5%</a>, they could be looking at an increase in profits of between 25% and 95%.</p>
<p>Most of the new funding will go to product development so that all data aggregations are gathered from all possible touchpoints. His ultimate goal is to be “the single platform for B2C firms.”</p>
<p>The company is currently working with over 150 customers in the areas of retail, direct-to-consumer, banking, automotive, travel and mobile app-based services. It is growing nine times year over year in revenue. It is mainly operating in India, but Clootrack is also onboarding companies in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>Parag Dhol, managing director of Inventus, said he has known Abdulla for over five years. He had looked at one of Abdulla’s companies for investment, but had decided against it due to his firm being a Series A investor.</p>
<p>Dhol said market research needs an overhaul in India, where this type of technology is lagging behind the U.S.</p>
<p>“Clootrack has a very complementary team with Shameel being a complete CEO in terms of being a sales guy and serial entrepreneur who has learned his lessons, and Subbu, who is good at technology,” he added. “As CMOs realize the value in their unstructured data inside of their own database of the customer reviews and move to real-time feedback, these guys could make a serious dent in the space.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[SimpliFed’s platform is a judgement-free zone providing evidence-based information on nutritional health for babies.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Feeding babies can take many different forms, and is also an area where parents can feel less supported as they navigate this new milestone in their lives.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://simplifed.us/">SimpliFed</a>, an Ithaca, New York-based company providing virtual lactation and a baby feeding support platform. The startup announced Friday that it raised $500,000 in pre-seed funding led by Third Culture Capital.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197924" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197924" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2197924" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Andrea-Ippolito-Pic.png?w=640" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Andrea-Ippolito-Pic.png 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Andrea-Ippolito-Pic.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Andrea-Ippolito-Pic.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Andrea-Ippolito-Pic.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197924" class="wp-caption-text">Andrea Ippolito, founder and CEO of SimpliFed. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> SimpliFed</p></div></p>
<p>CEO Andrea Ippolito, a biomedical engineer and mother of two young children, had the idea for SimpliFed three years ago. She struggled with breastfeeding after having her first child and, realizing that she was not alone in this area, set out to figure out a way to get anyone access to information and support for infant feeding.</p>
<p>“Post discharge is when the rubber meets the road for us,” she told TechCrunch. “This is a huge pain point for Medicaid, and it is not just about increasing access, but providing ongoing support for feeding and the quagmire that is health insurance. We want to help moms reach their infant feeding goals, no matter how they choose to feed, and to figure out what feeding looks like for them.”</p>
<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/faq/index.htm#:~:text=Top%20of%20Page-,How%20long%20should%20a%20mother%20breastfeed%3F,for%201%20year%20or%20longer.">mothers nurse for up to six months</a>. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/data/facts.html#:~:text=Sixty%20percent%20of%20mothers%20do,long%20as%20they%20intend%20to.&amp;text=How%20long%20a%20mother%20breastfeeds,Issues%20with%20lactation%20and%20latching.&amp;text=Concerns%20about%20infant%20nutrition%20and%20weight.">60% of mothers don’t breastfeed for as long as they intend</a> due to reasons like difficulty lactating or the baby latching, sickness or an unsupportive work environment.</p>
<p>SimpliFed’s platform is a judgement-free zone providing evidence-based information on nutritional health for babies. It isn’t meant to replace typical care that mother and baby will receive before and after delivery, but to provide support when issues arise, Ippolito said. Parents can book a free, initial 15-minute virtual consultation with a lactation expert and then subsequent 60-minute sessions for $100 each. There is also a future membership option for those seeking continuing care.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funds will be used to hire additional employees to further develop the telelactation platform and grow the company’s footprint, Ippolito said. The platform is gearing up to go through a clinical study to co-design the program with 1,000 mothers. She also wants to build out relationships with payers and providers toward a longer-term goal of becoming in-network and paid through reimbursement from health plans.</p>
<p>Julien Pham, managing partner at Third Culture Capital, said he met Ippolito at MIT Hacking Medicine a decade ago. A physician by training, he saw first-hand how big of an opportunity it is to demystify providing the best nutrition for babies.</p>
<p>“The U.S. culture has evolved over the years, and millennials are the next-generation moms who have a different ask, and SimpliFed is here at the right time,” Pham said. “Andrea is just a dynamo. We love her energy and how she is at the front line of this as a mother herself — she is most qualified to do this, and we support her.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australian buy now, pay later (BNPL) company Zip this week <a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/38746/zip-sets-sights-on-africa-with-acquisition-of-payflex">acquired South Africa-based BNPL player Payflex</a> for an undisclosed amount</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a piece of news that once again highlights the hype around BNPL services and the quest for global dominance among the leading players.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year we have</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> covered BNPL services from the likes of Afterpay, Klarna and Affirm. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And tech and payments giants Apple, Square, PayPal and Visa have joined in the action, too, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">massively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funneling cash to their respective BNPL initiatives (for one, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/why-square-is-shelling-out-29b-to-snag-bnpl-player-afterpay/">Square acquired Afterpay</a>)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why Square is shelling out $29B to snag BNPL player Afterpay&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/why-square-is-shelling-out-29b-to-snag-bnpl-player-afterpay/embed/#?secret=JTBugxRpwq" data-secret="JTBugxRpwq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australia, the U.K. and the U.S. are key markets for BNPL services. The U.S. market is so big that the number of BNPL service users </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to hit 45 million by year&#8217;s end, representing an 81% growth from last year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite its Western focus, BNPL is exploding in other markets driven by a collective effort from local and global players. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, in the Middle East</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/dubai-based-buy-now-pay-later-platform-tabby-raises-50m-at-300m-valuation/">tabby</a> and Tamara have raised millions in debt and equity financing to provide BNPL services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, Checkout <a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/37914/checkoutcom-leads-110-million-debt-and-equity-round-in-saudi-bnpl-startup-tamara">is a significant shareholder in Tamara</a>; Afterpay <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/australias-afterpay-takes-stake-in-gulf-buy-now-pay-later-firm-postpay-2021-06-28">is one in PostPay</a>, while Zip <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210523005030/en/Zip-Expands-into-Europe-and-the-Middle-East-with-the-Acquisitions-of-European-BNPL-Provider-Twisto-and-UAE-based-Spotii">acquired Spotii for $26 million</a> after initially investing in the company in December 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotii isn&#8217;t the only acquisition Zip has made this past year. The Australian company also bought U.S.-based QuadPay and Twisto, a BNPL service in the Czech Republic, to expand footprints in both regions.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payflex is the latest addition to that list. The company, founded in 2017, claims to be the first and largest BNPL player in South Africa with more than 1,000 merchants and 135,000 customers.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Before fully acquiring Payflex, Zip had a 25% stake when it invested in the South African BNPL service six months ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zip&#8217;s entry to Africa is important for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reasons. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, the continent is a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> untapped market that has enormous growth potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit appetite on the continent is very much in its infancy compared to Western markets, but it is growing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These days, people take loans to finance their needs at ridiculous interest rates while lending companies report low NPL ratios. Think of what happens when these consumers get a taste of low or no-interest alternative financing options that BNPL players like Zip provide: adoption rates will be off the charts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, there&#8217;s a lack of infrastructure and BNPL innovation that only new entrants like Zip can execute because it has a large monetary chest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And with the absence of credit cards and data on the continent, Zip can provide a competitive advantage with its technology, gather alternative data and build creditworthiness for customers in South Africa and other markets it plans </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to expand &#8220;with sizable underbanked, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digitally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> savvy populations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two of those markets are Egypt and Nigeria. If Zip expands to these regions, it will face competition from local players like Carbon, Shahry, M-Kopa, CredPal and CDCare, which are already pulling their weight. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">African e-commerce giant Jumia is also rumored to be revamping its BNPL service; it started one years ago but was discontinued after gaining little traction</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>That said, Africa doesn&#8217;t have a concrete market leader yet since most of these products are yet to reach mass scale. On the other hand, <span style="font-weight: 400;">Zip has been quite aggressive with its expansion into other markets &#8212; evident in some of its numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently serves 51,000 merchants and 7.3 million customers across 12 markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This fiscal year, June 2021, a period when most of its acquisitions have occurred, Zip hit $5.8 billion in total transaction volume, up 176% year-over-year (YoY).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zip numbers are impressive, but if there&#8217;s anything we&#8217;ve learnt from the BNPL business it&#8217;s that it isn&#8217;t a winner-takes-all market. If Zip makes significant headway and cracks the market, expect more global BNPL players to bring the heat. Also, local players will be encouraged to step up their game because global players have surplus cash to burn if they move into Africa, which is a win-win for the market.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In many ways, there has never been a better time to be a venture capitalist. Nearly everyone in the industry is raking in money, either through long-awaited exits or because more capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/tiger-global-just-closed-one-of-the-biggest-venture-funds-ever-with-6-7-billion/">flooding into the industry</a> has meant more money in management fees  &#8212; and sometimes both.</p>
<p>Still, a growing number of early-stage investors is becoming wary about the pace of dealmaking. It&#8217;s not just that it&#8217;s a lot harder to write checks at what feels like a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/fika-ventures-nearly-triples-its-assets-under-management-its-definitely-a-crazy-time/">reasonable clip</a> at the moment, or that most VCs feel they can <a href="https://twitter.com/rabois/status/1414953528162988032?lang=en">no longer afford to be price sensitive</a>. Many of the founders with whom they work are being handed follow-on checks before figuring out how best to deploy their last round of funding.</p>
<p>Consider that from 2016 through 2019, an average of 35 deals a month featured rounds of $100 million or more,<a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/reports/CB-Insights_Venture-Report-Q2-2021.pdf"> according to the data company CB Insights</a>. This year, that number is closer to 130 of these so-called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/14/technology/venture-capital-mega-round.html">mega-rounds</a> per month. The froth is hardly contained to maturing companies. According to CB Insights&#8217;s data, the median U.S. Series A valuation hit $42 million in the second quarter, driven in part crossover investors like Tiger Global, which closed 1.26 deals <em>per business day</em> in Q2. (Andreessen Horowitz wasn&#8217;t far behind.)</p>
<p>It makes for some bewildering times, including for longtime investor Jeff Clavier, the founder the early-stage venture firm Uncork Capital. Like many of his peers, Clavier is benefiting from the booming market. Among Uncork&#8217;s portfolio companies, for example is <a href="https://launchdarkly.com/">LaunchDarkly</a>, a company that helps software developers avoid missteps. The seven-year-old company announced $200 million in Series D funding last month at a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rashishrivastava/2021/08/10/launchdarkly-raises-200-million-at-3-billion-valuation/?sh=30e3f63d4381">$3 billion valuation</a>. That&#8217;s triple the valuation it was assigned early last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an awesome company, so I&#8217;m very excited for them,&#8221; says Clavier.</p>
<p>At the same time, he adds, &#8220;You have to put this money to work in a very smart way.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not so easy in this market, where founders are inundated with interest and, in some cases, are talking term sheets after the first Zoom with an investor. (&#8220;The most absurd thing we’ve heard are funds that are making decisions after a 30-minute call with the founder,&#8221; says TX Zhou, the cofounder of L.A.-based seed-stage firm Fika Ventures, which itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/fika-ventures-nearly-triples-its-assets-under-management-its-definitely-a-crazy-time/">just tripled</a> the amount of assets it&#8217;s managing.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More money can mean a much longer lifeline for a company. But as many investors have learned the hard way, it can also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/business/dealbook/softbank-vision-fund-wag.html">serve as a distraction</a>, as well as hide fundamental issues with a business until it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/business/softbank-wag.html">too late to address them</a>.</p>
<p>Taking on more money also oftentimes goes hand-in-hand with a bigger valuation, and lofty valuations comes with their own positives and negatives. On the plus side, of course, big numbers can attract more attention to a company from the press, from customers, and from potential new hires.  At the same time, &#8220;The more money you raise, the higher the valuation it is, it catches up with you on the next round, because you&#8217;ve got to clear that watermark,&#8221; says Renata Quintini of the venture firm Renegade Partners, which focuses largely on Series B-stage companies.</p>
<p>Again, in today&#8217;s market, trying to slow down isn&#8217;t always possible. Quintini says that some founders her firm has talked with have said that they&#8217;re not going to raise any more, explaining that they cannot go faster or deploy more than their business model is already supporting For others, she continues, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to look at what&#8217;s happening around you, and sometimes if your competitors are raising and they&#8217;re going to have a bigger war chest and [they&#8217;re] pushing the market forward and maybe they can out-hire you or they can outspend you in certain areas where they can generate more traction than you,&#8221; that next check, often at the higher valuation, begins to look like the only path to survival.</p>
<p>Many VCs have argued that today&#8217;s valuations make sense because companies are creating new markets, growing faster than before, and have more opportunities to expand globally, and certainly, in some cases, that it is true. Indeed, companies that were previously believed to be richly priced by their private investors, like Airbnb and Doordash, have seen their valuations soar as publicly traded companies.</p>
<p>Yet it&#8217;s also true that for many more companies, &#8220;valuation is completely disconnected from the [companies&#8217;] multiples,&#8221; says Clavier, echoing what other VCs acknowledge privately.</p>
<p>That might seem to be the kind of problem that investors love to face. But as been the case for years now, that depends on how long this go-go market lasts.</p>
<p>Clavier says that one of his own companies that &#8220;did a great Series A and did a great Series B ahead of its time is now being preempted for a Series C, and the valuation is just completely disconnected from their actual reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says he&#8217;s happy for the outfit &#8220;because I have no doubt they will catch up. But this is the point: they will have to catch up.&#8221;</p>
