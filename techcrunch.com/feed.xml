										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Copy and paste the converted output. --></p>
<p>A failed acquisition usually triggers the same series of questions: What does this mean for early-stage startups in the sector? Will a chilling effect occur and hurt valuations? Will VCs stop funding this category? How will the exit environment look going forward?</p>
<p>This week gave that narrative a bullish twist. Visa and Plaid announced that they have reached a mutual agreement to no longer pursue a merger. The $5.3 billion deal had been under antitrust scrutiny from the DOJ, and eventually ended amid these regulatory challenges.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fintech VCs and startups alike reacted to the fallen deal with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/venture-capitalists-react-to-visa-plaid-deal-meltdown">aggressive optimism</a> about Plaid’s future as an independently-owned fintech startup.</p>
<p>The most common arguments?</p>
<ul>
<li>Plaid’s price in this current moment is far beyond $5.3 billion, so now that it is a free bird it will pursue a much larger exit</li>
<li>Plaid will go public through SPAC because it is in charge of its own destiny.</li>
<li>And my favorite: One day, Plaid will buy Visa.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/plaid-ceo-touts-new-clarity-after-failed-visa-acquisition/ ">In an interview with TechCrunch,</a> Plaid CEO Zach Perret wouldn’t give too many details on the future (and whether a SPAC is involved), but he did say he has new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/plaid-ceo-touts-new-clarity-after-failed-visa-acquisition/ ">‘clarity’</a> going forward.</p>
<p>The fact that fintech is bullish on the future of fintech isn’t quite surprising. I will say that while one deal can never make or break a sector, a flopped merger certainly can surface the current temperature in the market. Startups Weekly readers will remember <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-next-zoom-wants-to-be-nothing-like-zoom/">last week’s edition</a> about how P&amp;G’s decision not to acquire Billie could hurt DTC exit opportunities. Fintech seems unbothered and, in fact, celebratory. The only counterargument I got, via Twitter DM, is that it could set a bad precedent on big fintech mergers.</p>
<p>“Or maybe&#8230;corporations learn from this and look to make riskier acquisitions earlier in a company’s lifecycle because they know that if they let the company get too big they’ll lose the chance,” <a href="https://twitter.com/ramiessaid">Rami Essaid</a>, founder of Finmark, told me.</p>
<p>Only in 2021 could a $5.3 billion break-up and a DOJ investigation be considered a blessing. Rock on, ‘Plaid for X’ startups.</p>

<h2><strong>Columbus is the new Miami which is new the San Francisco</strong></h2>
<p>I hope that sub-hed gave you a headache, because that’s exactly what debates about where the best place to start a company do to me. The rise of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/work-from-home-is-dead-long-live-work-from-anywhere/">Work From Anywhere </a>has emboldened VCs to leave San Francisco for markets such as Miami or Austin in search of the next unsung hero of their portfolios.</p>
<p>For investors, though, the financial benefit of moving to an emerging market might not be apparent within months, but instead years. Venture is a long game <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/two-year-old-nuvia-sells-to-qualcomm-for-1-4-billion/">(at least most of the time</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know</strong>, per Silicon Valley editor Connie Loizos: <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/columbus-drivecapital/ ">Drive Capital</a>, a venture capital firm based in Columbus, Ohio, and started by two ex-Sequoia investors now has over $1.2 billion in assets. But before it had breakout companies like Root and Olive AI, Drive had to play the unusual role of investing in a region without key investing infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Etc</strong>: Founding partner Chris Olsen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/columbus-drivecapital/ ">explained how they set up their roots</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;We’ve had to spend a lot of time going into the universities and putting new seed managers in business and helping them fundraise and sort of building all of this infrastructure from scratch so that the next entrepreneur is out here [versus moves away], and it works. In our first year, we had inbound interest from 1,800 [startups], then it went to about 3,000 and now it’s up to about 7,000, which is more than I’ve heard any other venture firms say that they see in California. And I don’t think it’s because we’re great. I think that’s more [a reflection of the] scale of the opportunity that’s here now. One of the things that we would love to see more of is more venture capitalists coming here, because there’s certainly more opportunity than we can invest in.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>

<h2>The CFO Tech Stack</h2>
<p>If you want to start a company, go to a startup and look where employees are still using an Excel sheet. The best products are the ones fueled by frustrations, right?</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know</strong> per managing editor Danny Crichton: For a trio of Palantir alums, 15 collective years at the now-public government tech company showed a huge gap in technology for CFOs. So, they started Mosaic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/mosaic-raises-18-5m-series-a-from-gc-to-rebuild-the-cfo-software-stack/">a techstack to help financial officers</a> better communicate and perform their jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Etc:</strong> Co-founder Bijan Moallemi describes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/mosaic-raises-18-5m-series-a-from-gc-to-rebuild-the-cfo-software-stack/">the mistake</a> other platforms are making:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Everyone wants to be strategic, but it’s so tough to do because 80% of your time is pulling data from these disparate systems, cleaning it, mapping it, updating your Excel files, and maybe 20% of [your time] is actually taking a step back and understanding what the data is telling you.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h2><strong>The future of consumer hardware startups beyond Peloton</strong></h2>
<p>Are wearables still exciting? Is consumer hardware ever going to get easier to pull off? What was the strategy that made Peloton so successful?</p>
<p>These questions and more are answered in the latest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/5-consumer-hardware-vcs-share-their-2021-investment-strategies/">consumer hardware-focused Extra Crunch Survey</a>, which brings together VCs from SOSV, Lux Capital, Shasta Ventures, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> Everyone is studying the Peloton success recipe. But the big question for consumer hardware startups is if the at-home fitness market’s boom is translating to other use cases.</p>
<p><strong>Etc:</strong> Cyril Ebersweiler of SOSV noted that supply chain distribution disruption during COVID-19 has been difficult for category startups, but the need for innovative solutions has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/5-consumer-hardware-vcs-share-their-2021-investment-strategies/">never been more clear</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Everybody is waiting for new and mind-blowing experiences, and I guess we’ve all experienced the shortcomings or the magic of some IoT products over the shelter-in-place [orders]. Spatial and ambient technologies that work well will be in demand (audio or visual), while “holographic Skype” will invade households thanks to Looking Glass.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Also:</strong> In another investor survey, five VCs weighed in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/these-5-vcs-have-high-hopes-for-cannabis-in-2021/ ">on the future of cannabis in 2021</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Pop goes the public market</strong></h2>
<p>We had yet another noisy week of privately-held startups going public to a Very Warm Wall Street reception.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last CES was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/as-autonomy-stalls-lidar-companies-learn-to-adapt/">a time of reckoning for lidar companies</a>, many of which were cratering due to a lack of demand from a (still) non-existent autonomous vehicle industry. The few that excelled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/barajas-unique-and-ingenious-take-on-lidar-shines-in-a-crowded-industry/">did so by specializing</a>, and this year the trend has pushed beyond lidar, with new sensing and imaging methods pushing to both compete with and complement the laser-based tech.</p>
<p>Lidar pushed ahead of traditional cameras because it could do things they couldn&#8217;t — and now some companies are pushing to do the same with tech that&#8217;s a little less exotic.</p>

<p>A good example of addressing the problem or perception by different means is <a href="https://eyenet-mobile.com/">Eye Net&#8217;s vehicle-to-x tracking platform</a>. This is one of those techs that&#8217;s been talked about in the context of 5G (admittedly still somewhat exotic), which for all the hype really does enable short-distance, low-latency applications that could be life-savers.</p>
<p>Eye Net provides collision warnings between vehicles equipped with its tech, whether they have cameras or other sensing tech equipped or not. The example they provide is a car driving through a parking lot, unaware that a person on one of those horribly unsafe electric scooters is moving perpendicular to it ahead, about to zoom into its path but totally obscured by parked cars. Eye Net&#8217;s sensors detect the position of the devices on both vehicles and send warnings in time for either or both to brake.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2096690" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/warning-eye-net.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2096690" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2096690" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/warning-eye-net.jpg" alt="CG illustration of a bicyclist and car being warned of an imminent collision." width="1024" height="700" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/warning-eye-net.jpg 1306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/warning-eye-net.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/warning-eye-net.jpg?resize=300,205 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/warning-eye-net.jpg?resize=768,525 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/warning-eye-net.jpg?resize=680,465 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/warning-eye-net.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2096690" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Eye Net</p></div></p>
<p>They&#8217;re not the only ones attempting something like this, but they hope that by providing a sort of white-label solution, a good size network can be built relatively easily, instead of having none, and then all VWs equipped, and then some Fords and some e-bikes, and so on.</p>
<p>But vision is still going to be a major part of how vehicles navigate, and advances are being made on multiple fronts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.brightwayvision.com/technology">Brightway Vision</a>, for instance, addresses the issue of normal RGB cameras having limited visibility in many real-world conditions by going multispectral. In addition to ordinary visible-light imagery, the company&#8217;s camera is mated to a near-infrared beamer that scans the road ahead at set distance intervals many times a second.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2097138" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/brightway.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2097138" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2097138" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/brightway.png" alt="CG illustration of a camera using infrared to see further ahead at night." width="1024" height="605" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/brightway.png 1328w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/brightway.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/brightway.png?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/brightway.png?resize=768,454 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/brightway.png?resize=680,402 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/brightway.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2097138" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brightway Vision</p></div></p>
<p>The idea is that if the main camera can&#8217;t see 100 feet out because of fog, the NIR imagery will still catch any obstacles or road features when it scans that &#8220;slice&#8221; in its regular sweep of the incoming area. It combines the benefits of traditional cameras with those of IR ones, but manages to avoid the shortcomings of both. The pitch is that there&#8217;s no reason to use a normal camera when you can use one of these, which does the same job better and may even allow another sensor to be cut out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foresightauto.com/">Foresight Automotive</a> also uses multispectral imagery in its cameras (chances are hardly any vehicle camera will be limited to visible spectrum in a few years), dipping into thermal via a partnership with FLIR, but what it&#8217;s really selling is something else.</p>
<p>To provide 360-degree (or close) coverage, generally multiple cameras are required. But where those cameras go differs on a compact sedan versus an SUV from the same manufacturer — let alone on an autonomous freight vehicle. Because those cameras have to work together, they need to be perfectly calibrated, aware of the exact position of the others, so they know, for example, that they&#8217;re both looking at the same tree or bicyclist and not two identical ones.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2097244" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/foresight-place.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2097244" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2097244 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/foresight-place.gif" alt="Image showing Foresight cameras being attached magnetically to a car's body." width="800" height="448" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2097244" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Foresight Automotive</p></div></p>
<p>Foresight&#8217;s advance is to simplify the calibration stage, so a manufacturer or designer or test platform doesn&#8217;t need to be laboriously re-tested and certified every time the cameras need to be moved half an inch in one direction or the other. The Foresight demo shows them sticking the cameras on the roof of the car seconds before driving it.</p>
<p>It has parallels to <a href="https://www.nodarsensor.com/product">another startup called Nodar</a> that also relies on stereoscopic cameras, but takes a different approach. The technique of deriving depth from binocular triangulation, as the company points out, goes back decades, or millions of years if you count our own vision system, which works in a similar ways. The limitation that has held this approach back isn&#8217;t that optical cameras fundamentally can&#8217;t provide the depth information needed by an autonomous vehicle, but that they can&#8217;t be trusted to remain calibrated.</p>
<p>Nodar shows that its paired stereo cameras don&#8217;t even need to be mounted to the main mass of the car, which would reduce jitter and fractional mismatches between the cameras&#8217; views. Attached to the rear view mirrors, their &#8220;Hammerhead&#8221; camera setup has a wide stance (like the shark&#8217;s), which provides improved accuracy because of the larger disparity between the cameras. Since distance is determined by the differences between the two images, there&#8217;s no need for object recognition or complex machine learning to say &#8220;this is a shape, probably a car, probably about this big, which means it&#8217;s probably about this far away&#8221; as you might with a single camera solution.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2097231" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hammerhead_03.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2097231" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2097231" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hammerhead_03.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="563" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hammerhead_03.jpg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hammerhead_03.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hammerhead_03.jpg?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hammerhead_03.jpg?resize=768,422 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hammerhead_03.jpg?resize=680,374 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hammerhead_03.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2097231" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nodar</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;<span id="m_-6560671669699923875gmail-docs-internal-guid-9e3d4e7e-7fff-e68e-2639-f789c329de70"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The industry has already shown that camera arrays do well in harsh weather conditions, just as human eyes do,&#8221; said Nodar COO and co-founder Brad Rosen. &#8220;For example, engineers at Daimler have published results showing that current stereoscopic approaches provide significantly more stable depth estimates than monocular methods and LiDAR completion in adverse weather. The beauty of our approach is that the hardware we use is available today, in automotive-grade, and with many choices for manufacturers and distributors.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p>Indeed, a major strike against lidar has been the cost of the unit — even &#8220;inexpensive&#8221; ones tend to be orders of magnitude more expensive than ordinary cameras, something that adds up very quickly. But team lidar hasn&#8217;t been standing still either.</p>
<p>Sense Photonics came onto the scene with a new approach that seemed to combine the best of both worlds: a relatively cheap and simple flash lidar (as opposed to spinning or scanning, which tend to add complexity) mated to a traditional camera so that the two see versions of the same image, allowing them to work together in identifying objects and establishing distances.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/sense-photonics-flashes-onto-the-lidar-scene-with-a-new-approach-and-26m/">Since its debut in 2019</a> Sense has refined its tech for production and beyond. The latest advance is custom hardware that has enabled it to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sense-photonics-demonstrates-the-worlds-first-940nm-global-shutter-flash-lidar-with-200-meter-range-for-mass-market-automotive-applications-301202111.html">image objects out to 200 meters</a> — generally considered on the far end both for lidar and traditional cameras.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the past, we have sourced an off-the-shelf detector to pair with our laser source (Sense Illuminator). However, our 2 years of in-house detector development has now completed and is a huge success, which allows us to build short-range and long-range automotive products,&#8221; said CEO Shauna McIntyre.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sense has created &#8216;building blocks&#8217; for a camera-like LiDAR design that can be paired with different sets of optics to achieve different FOV, range, resolution, etc,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;And we&#8217;ve done so in a very simple design that can actually be manufactured in large volumes. You can think of our architecture like a DSLR camera where you have the &#8216;base camera&#8217; and can pair it with a macro lens, zoom lens, fisheye lens, etc. to achieve different functions.&#8221;</p>
<p>One thing all the companies seemed to agree on is that no single sensing modality will dominate the industry from top to bottom. Leaving aside that the needs of a fully autonomous (i.e. level 4-5) vehicle has very different needs from a driver assist system, the field moves too quickly for any one approach to remain on top for long.</p>
<p>&#8220;AV companies cannot succeed if the public is not convinced that their platform is safe and the safety margins only increase with redundant sensor modalities operating at different wavelengths,&#8221; said McIntyre.</p>
<p>Whether that means visible light, near-infrared, thermal imaging, radar, lidar, or as we&#8217;ve seen here, some combination of two or three of these, it&#8217;s clear the market will continue to favor differentiation — though as with the boom-bust cycle seen in the lidar industry a few years back, it&#8217;s also a warning that consolidation won&#8217;t be far behind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020.</p>
<p>Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>

<h3>The right-wing gets deplatformed</h3>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/this-week-in-apps-social-apps-react-to-riots-us-bans-chinese-payment-apps-ftc-threatens-app-store-regulation/">Last weekend</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/">Google</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/apple-suspend-parler-from-app-store/">Apple</a> removed Parler from their respective app stores, the latter after first giving the app 24 hours to come up with a new moderation strategy to address the threats of violence and illegal activity taking place on the app in the wake of the Capitol riot. When Parler failed to take adequate measures, the app was pulled down.</p>
<p>What happened afterwards was unprecedented. All of Parler&#8217;s technology backend services providers pulled support for Parler, too, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-is-officially-offline-after-aws-suspension/">Amazon AWS</a> (which has led to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-sues-amazon-leveling-far-fetched-antitrust-allegations/">lawsuit</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/stripe-reportedly-joins-the-tech-platforms-booting-president-trump-from-their-services/">Stripe</a> and even <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/okta-ceo-todd-mckinnon-parler-not-even-trying-to-suppress-threats.html">Okta</a>, which Parler was only using as a free trial. <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/01/parler-ceo-says-service-dropped-by-every-vendor-and-could-end-the-company-1234670607/">Other vendors also refused</a> to do business with the app, <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22227131/parler-return-amazon-apple-google">potentially ending its ability</a> to operate for good.</p>

<p>But although Parler is down, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/every-deleted-parler-post-many-with-users-location-dat-1846032466?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">its data lives on</a>. Several efforts have been made to archive Parler data for posterity &#8212; and for tipping off the FBI. Gizmodo <a href="https://gizmodo.com/parler-users-breached-deep-inside-u-s-capitol-building-1846042905?rev=1610480731991">made a map</a> using the GPS data of 70,000 Parler posts. Another effort, <a href="https://thepatr10t.github.io/yall-Qaeda/">Y&#8217;all Qaeda</a>, is also using location data to map videos from Parler to locations around the Capitol building.</p>
<p>These visualizations are possible because the data itself was quickly archived by internet archivist <a href="https://twitter.com/donk_enby">@donk_enby</a> before Parler was taken down, and because Parler stored rich metadata with each user&#8217;s post. That means each user&#8217;s precise location was recorded when they uploaded their photos and videos to the app.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/scraped-parler-data-is-a-metadata-goldmine/">It&#8217;s a gold mine for investigators</a> and a further indication of the privilege these rioters believed they had to avoid prosecution or the extent to which they were willing to throw their life away for their cause &#8212; the false reality painted for them by Trump, his allies and other outlets that repeated the &#8220;big lie&#8221; until they truly believed only a revolution could save our democracy.</p>

<p>The move to kick Parler offline followed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">the broader deplatforming of Trump</a>, who&#8217;s accused of inciting the violence, in part by his refusal to concede and his continued lies about a &#8220;rigged election.&#8221; As a result, Trump has been deplatformed across social platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitch, YouTube, Reddit, Discord and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/snapchat-permanently-bans-president-trumps-account/">Snapchat</a>, while e-commerce platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/shopify-pulls-donald-trump-stores-off-its-website/">Shopify</a> kicked out Trump merch shops and PayPal <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/paypal-and-shopify-remove-trump-related-accounts-citing-policies-against-supporting-violence/">refused</a> to process transactions for some groups of Trump supporters.</p>

<p>Parler was the most high-profile app used by the Capitol rioters, but others found themselves compromised by the same crowd. Walkie-talkie app Zello, for instance, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/13/zello-app-us-capitol-attack-far-right">was used by some insurrectionists</a> during the January 6 riot to communicate. Telegram, meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/telegram-channels-banned-violent-threats-capitol/">recently had to block dozens of hardcore hate channels</a> that were threatening violence, including those led by Nazis (which were reported for years with no action by the company, some claim).</p>
<p>Now, many in the radical right are moving to new platforms outside of the mainstream. Immediately following the Capitol riot, MeWe, CloutHub and other privacy-focused rivals to big tech <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/following-riots-alternative-social-apps-and-private-messengers-top-the-app-stores/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">began topping the app stores</a>, alongside the privacy-focused messengers Signal and Telegram. YouTube alternative Rumble also gained ground due to recent events. Right-wingers even mistakenly downloaded the wrong &#8220;Parlor&#8221; app and a local newspaper app they thought was the uncensored social network Gab. (They&#8217;re not always the brightest bulbs.)</p>

<p>This could soon prove to be another difficult situation for the platforms to address, as we already came across highly concerning posts distributed on MeWe, which had used extreme hate speech or threatened violence. MeWe claims it moderates its content, but its recent growth to now 15 million users may be making that difficult &#8212; <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/mewe-sold-itself-on-privacy-then-the-radical-right-arrived-e527b38e4718">especially since it&#8217;s inheriting the former Parler users, including the radical far-right.</a> The company has not been able to properly moderate the content, which may make it the next to be gone.</p>
<h3>2020 annual review</h3>
<p>App Annie this week released its annual review of the mobile app industry finding (as noted above) that mobile app downloads grew by 7% year-over-year to a record 218 billion in 2020. Consumer spending also grew by 20% to also hit a new milestone of $143 billion, led by markets that included China, the United States, Japan, South Korea and the United Kingdom. Consumers spent 3.5 trillion minutes on Android devices in 2020. Meanwhile, U.S. users now spend more time in apps (four hours) than watching live TV (3.7 hours).</p>
<p>The full report examines other key trends across social, gaming, finance, e-commerce, video and streaming, mobile food ordering, business apps, edtech and much more. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">We pulled out some highlights here</a>, such as TikTok&#8217;s chart-topping year by downloads, the rise in livestreamed and social shopping, consumers spending 40% more time streaming on mobile YoY and other key trends.</p>

<p>Though not &#8220;apps&#8221; news per se, it&#8217;s worth making note of what&#8217;s next in the Android ecosystem of high-end devices. This week was Samsung&#8217;s Unpacked press event, where the company revealed its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/samsungs-galaxy-s21-line-arrives-with-camera-bumps-price-drops-and-s-pen-compatibility/">latest flagship devices</a> and other products. The big news was Samsung&#8217;s three new phones and their now lower prices: the glass-backed Galaxy S21 ($799) and S21 Plus ($999), and the S21 Ultra ($1,199), which is S Pen compatible.</p>
<p>The now more streamlined camera systems are the key feature of the new phones, and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>S21 and S21 Plus: A 12-megapixel ultrawide, 12-megapixel wide and 64-megapixel telephoto with 30x space zoom.</li>
<li>S21 Ultra: A 12-megapixel ultra-wide, 108-megapixel wide and, for the first time, a dual-telephoto lens system with 3x and 10x optical zoom. The Ultra also improves low-light shooting with its Bright Night sensor.</li>
</ul>
<p>The devices support UWB and there&#8217;s a wild <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230902/samsung-s21-one-ui-3-object-eraser-photos-remove-people-background">AI-powered photo feature</a> that lets you tap to remove people from the background of your photos. (How well it works is TBD). Other software imaging updates allow you to pull stills from 8K shooting, better image stabilization and a new &#8220;Vlogger view&#8221; for shooting from front and back cameras as the same time.</p>
<p>Also launched were Samsung&#8217;s AirPods rival, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/samsungs-galaxy-buds-pro-are-a-solid-airpods-alternative/">Galaxy Buds Pro,</a> and its Tile rival, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/samsung-unveils-its-newest-tile-competitor-the-galaxy-smarttag/">Galaxy SmartTag</a>.</p>

<p>COVID has cancelled concerts, which required Bandsintown to pivot from helping people find shows to attend to a new subscription service for live music. The company this week <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bandsintown-plus-live-music-streaming-concerts-subscription-service-115553507.html">launched</a> Bandsintown Plus, a $9.99 per month pass that gives users access to more than 25 concerts per month.

<p>This new blockchain camera app, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/numbers-protocols-blockchain-camera-capture-app-safeguards-the-integrity-of-photos/">reviewed here</a> on TechCrunch, uses tech commercialized by the Taiwan-based startup, Numbers Protocol. The app secures the metadata associated with photos you take on the blockchain, also allowing users to adjust privacy settings if they don&#8217;t want to share a precise location. Any subsequent changes to the photo are then traced and recorded. Use cases for the technology include journalism (plus combating fake news), as well as a way for photographers to assure their photos are attributed correctly. The app is available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/capture/id1536388009">App Store </a>and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.numbersprotocol.capturelite">Google Play</a>.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture-capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. We’re back on this lovely Saturday with a bonus episode!</p>
<p>Again!</p>
<p>There is enough going on that to avoid failing to bring you stuff that we think matters, we are back yet again for more. This time around we are not talking Roblox, we&#8217;re talking about ecommerce, and a number of rounds &#8212; big <em>and</em> small &#8212; that have been raised in the space. Honest question: do y&#8217;all plan to release news on the same week? Are trends a social construct?</p>
<p>From Natasha, Grace, Danny, and your humble servant, here&#8217;s your run-down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webflow <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/webflow-raises-140m-pushing-its-valuation-to-2-1-billion/">raised $140 million</a> in a round that it says it did not need. This is not a new thing. Some startups are doing well, and don&#8217;t burn much. So investors offer them more at a nice price. In this case $2.1 billion. (Webflow does no-code</li>
<li>Checkout.com <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/checkout-com-raises-450-million-and-reaches-15-billion-valuation/">raised $450 million</a>. The rich really do get richer. In this case the founders of Checkout.com, whose company is now worth around $15 billion Checkout.com does, you guessed, online checkout work. Which as Danny explains is complicated and critical.</li>
<li>We also talked about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/bolt-adds-75m-to-its-series-c-as-the-battle-to-rule-online-checkout-continues/">this Bolt round</a>, for context.</li>
<li>And sticking to the ecommerce theme, Rapyd <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/rapyd-raises-300m-on-a-2-5b-valuation-to-boost-its-fintech-as-a-service-api/">raised $300 million</a> at around a $2.5 billion valuation. There is infinte money available for late-stage fintech.</li>
<li>Early stage as well, it turns out, with<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tradeswell-series-a/"> Tradeswell raising $15.5 million</a> to help businesses improve their net margins.</li>
<li>Finally, ending with a chat on infrastructure, Nacelle closed an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/e-commerce-infrastructure-startup-nacelle-closes-18m-series-a/">$18 million Series A. </a></li>
</ul>
<p>And now we&#8217;re going back to bed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some time ago, I gave up on the idea of finding a thread that connects each story in the weekly Extra Crunch roundup; there are no unified theories of technology news.</p>
<p>The stories that left the deepest impression were related to two news pegs that dominated the week — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">Visa and Plaid calling off their $5.3 billion acquisition agreement</a>, and sizzling-hot IPOs for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/affirm-boosts-its-ipo-price-target-more-than-doubling-its-latest-private-valuation/">Affirm</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/poshmark-prices-ipo-above-range-as-public-markets-continue-to-yolo-startups/">Poshmark</a>.</p>
<p>Watching Plaid and Visa sing &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOILZ_D3aRg">Let&#8217;s Call The Whole Thing Off&#8221;</a> in harmony after the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit to block their deal wasn&#8217;t shocking. But I was surprised to find myself editing an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/plaid-ceo-touts-new-clarity-after-failed-visa-acquisition/">interview Alex Wilhelm conducted with Plaid CEO Zach Perret</a> the next day in which the executive said growing the company on its own is &#8220;once again&#8221; the correct strategy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<hr />
<p>In an analysis for Extra Crunch, Managing Editor Danny Crichton suggested that federal regulators&#8217; new interest in antitrust enforcement will affect valuations going forward. For example, Procter &amp; Gamble and women&#8217;s beauty D2C brand Billie also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/pg-terminates-plan-to-acquire-razor-startup-billie-following-ftc-lawsuit/">called off <i>their</i> planned merger last week</a> after the Federal Trade Commission raised objections in December.</p>
<p>Given the FTC&#8217;s moves last year to prevent Billie and Harry&#8217;s from being acquired, &#8220;it seems clear that U.S. antitrust authorities want broad competition for consumers in household goods,&#8221; Danny concluded, and I suspect that applies to Plaid as well.</p>
<p>In December, C3.ai, Doordash and Airbnb burst into the public markets to much acclaim. This week, used clothing marketplace Poshmark saw a 140% pop in its first day of trading and consumer-financing company Affirm &#8220;priced its IPO above its raised range <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210112006165/en/Affirm-Announces-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering">at $49 per share</a>,&#8221; reported Alex.</p>
<p>In a post titled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/a-theory-about-the-current-ipo-market/">&#8220;A theory about the current IPO market&#8221;</a>, he identified eight key ingredients for brewing a debut with a big first-day pop, which includes &#8220;exist in a climate of near-zero interest rates&#8221; and &#8220;keep companies private longer.&#8221; Truly, words to live by!</p>
<p>Come back next week for more coverage of the public markets in The Exchange, an interview with Bustle CEO Bryan Goldberg where he shares his plans for taking the company public, a comprehensive post that will unpack the regulatory hurdles facing D2C consumer brands, and much more.</p>
<p>If you live in the U.S., enjoy your MLK Day holiday weekend, and wherever you are: Thanks very much for reading Extra Crunch.</p>

<p>After spending much of the week covering 2021&#8217;s frothy IPO market, Alex Wilhelm devoted this morning&#8217;s column to studying the OKR-focused software sector.</p>
<p>Measuring objectives and key results are core to every enterprise, perhaps more so these days since knowledge workers began working remotely in greater numbers last year.</p>
<p>A sign of the times: This week, enterprise orchestration SaaS platform Gtmhub announced that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/okr-focused-gtmhub-raises-30m-series-b-after-growing-3x-in-2020/">raised a $30 million Series B</a>.</p>
<p>To get a sense of how large the TAM is for OKR, Alex reached out to several companies and asked them to share new and historical growth metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gthmhub</li>
<li>Perdoo</li>
<li>WorkBoard</li>
<li>Ally.io</li>
<li>Koan</li>
<li>WeekDone</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Some OKR-focused startups didn’t get back to us, and some leaders wanted to share the best stuff off the record, which we grant at times for candor amongst startup executives,&#8221; he wrote.</p>

<p>For our latest investor survey, Matt Burns interviewed five VCs who actively fund consumer electronics startups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hans Tung, managing partner, GGV Capital</li>
<li>Dayna Grayson, co-founder and general partner, Construct Capital</li>
<li>Cyril Ebersweiler, general partner, SOSV</li>
<li>Bilal Zuberi, partner, Lux Capital</li>
<li>Rob Coneybeer, managing director, Shasta Ventures</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Consumer hardware has always been a tough market to crack, but the COVID-19 crisis made it even harder,&#8221; says Matt, noting that the pandemic fueled wide interest in fitness startups like Mirror, Peloton and Tonal.</p>
<p>Bonus: Many VCs listed the founders, investors and companies that are taking the lead in consumer hardware innovation.</p>

<p>Clothing resale marketplace Poshmark closed up more than 140% on its first trading day yesterday.</p>
<p>In Thursday&#8217;s edition of The Exchange, Alex noted that Poshmark boosted its valuation by selling 6.6 million shares at its IPO price, scooping up $277.2 million in the process.</p>
<p>Poshmark&#8217;s surge in trading is good news for its employees and stockholders, but it reflects poorly on &#8220;the venture-focused money people who we suppose know what they are talking about when it comes to equity in private companies,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>This week, Visa announced it would drop its planned acquisition of Plaid after the U.S. Department of Justice filed suit to block it last fall.</p>
<p>Last week, Procter &amp; Gamble called off its purchase of Billie, a women&#8217;s beauty products startup — in December, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued to block that deal, too.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, the U.S. government took an arm&#8217;s-length approach to enforcing antitrust laws, but the tide has turned, says Managing Editor Danny Crichton.</p>
<p>Going forward, &#8220;antitrust won’t kill acquisitions in general, but it could prevent the buyers with the highest reserve prices from entering the fray.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm interviewed Plaid CEO Zach Perret after the Visa acquisition was called off to learn more about his mindset and the company&#8217;s short-term plans.</p>
<p>Perret, who noted that the last few years have been a &#8220;roller coaster,&#8221; said the Visa deal was the right decision at the time, but going it alone is &#8220;once again&#8221; Plaid&#8217;s best way forward.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/2021-a-spac-odyssey/">Tuesday&#8217;s edition of The Exchange</a>, Alex Wilhelm took a closer look at blank-check offerings for digital asset marketplace Bakkt and personal finance platform SoFi.</p>
<p>To create a detailed analysis of the investor presentations for both offerings, he tried to answer two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are special purpose acquisition companies a path to public markets for &#8220;potentially promising companies that lacked obvious, near-term growth stories?&#8221;</li>
<li>Given the number of unicorns and the limited number of companies that can IPO at any given time, &#8220;maybe SPACS would help close the liquidity gap?&#8221;</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As a precaution against coordinated violence as the U.S. approaches President-elect Joe Biden&#8217;s inauguration, Facebook announced a few new measures it&#8217;s putting in place.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/preparing-for-inauguration-day/">blog post</a> and tweets from Facebook Policy Communications Director Andy Stone, the company explained that it would block any events slated to happen near the White House, the U.S. Capitol or any state capitol building through Wednesday.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Update: Through Inauguration Day, we&#39;re blocking the creation of new Facebook events happening in close proximity to DC and state capitols. And we&#39;re doing a secondary review of inauguration-related events and removing policy-violating ones. <a href="https://t.co/AV6z0gSTiu">https://t.co/AV6z0gSTiu</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Andy Stone (@andymstone) <a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1350210024065392644?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The company says it will also do &#8220;secondary&#8221; sweeps through any inauguration-related events to look for violations of its policies. At this point, that includes any content connected to the &#8220;Stop the Steal&#8221; movement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/facebook-blocks-sharpiegate-hashtag-election-conspiracies/">perpetuating the rampant lie that Biden&#8217;s victory is illegitimate</a>. Those groups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/facebook-says-it-will-remove-references-to-stop-the-steal-across-its-platform/">continued to thrive on Facebook</a> until measures the company took at the beginning of this week.</p>
<p>Facebook will apparently also be putting new restrictions in place for U.S. users who repeatedly break the company&#8217;s rules, including barring those accounts from livestreaming videos, events and group pages.</p>
<p>Those precautions fall short of what some of Facebook&#8217;s critics have called for, but they&#8217;re still notable measures for a company that only began taking dangerous conspiracies and armed groups seriously in the last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> has confirmed with TechCrunch that it oversaw a $195 million secondary sale that values the company at $6 billion. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/gitlab-ceo-eyes-public-market-after-secondary-valued-it-at-6-billion-.html">CNBC broke the story</a> earlier today.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s impressive valuation comes after its most recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/gitlab-hauls-in-268m-series-e-on-2-768b-valuation/">2019 Series E in which it raised $268 million</a> on a 2.75 billion valuation, an increase of $3.25 billion in under 18 months. Company co-founder and CEO Sid Sijbrandij believes the increase is due to his company&#8217;s progress adding functionality to the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe the increase in valuation over the past year reflects the progress of our complete DevOps platform towards realizing a greater share of the growing, multi-billion dollar software development market,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the startup has raised over $434 million, this round involved buying employee stock options, a move that allows the company&#8217;s workers to cash in some of their equity prior to going public. CNBC reported that the firms buying the stock included Alta Park, HMI Capital, OMERS Growth Equity, TCV and Verition.</p>

<p>The next logical step would appear to be IPO, something the company has never shied away from. In fact, it actually at one point included the proposed date of November 18, 2020 as a target IPO date on <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/strategy/">the company wiki</a>. While they didn&#8217;t quite make that goal, Sijbrandij still sees the company going public at some point. He&#8217;s just not being so specific as in the past, suggesting that the company has plenty of runway left from the last funding round and can go public when the timing is right.</p>
<p>&#8220;We continue to believe that being a public company is an integral part of realizing our mission. As a public company, GitLab would benefit from enhanced brand awareness, access to capital, shareholder liquidity, autonomy and transparency,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;That said, we want to maximize the outcome by selecting an opportune time. Our most recent capital raise was in 2019 and contributed to an already healthy balance sheet. A strong balance sheet and business model enables us to select a period that works best for realizing our long-term goals.&#8221;</p>
<p>GitLab has not only published IPO goals on its Wiki, but its entire company philosophy, goals and OKRs for everyone to see. Sijbrandij told TechCrunch&#8217;s Alex Wilhelm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/getting-to-100m-arr/">at a TechCrunch Disrupt panel</a> in September that he believes that transparency helps attract and keep employees. It doesn&#8217;t hurt that the company was and remains a fully remote organization, even pre-COVID.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started [this level of] transparency to connect with the wider community around GitLab, but it turned out to be super beneficial for attracting great talent as well,&#8221; Sijbrandij told Wilhelm in September.</p>
<p>The company, which launched in 2014, offers a DevOps platform to help move applications through the programming lifecycle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Of course COVID-19 was bound to be an unavoidable topic during the first-ever all-virtual CES. After all, the topic is at front of mind regardless of the topic these days. Close to a year into the pandemic, presenters still understandably feel obligated to address the always-present elephant in the room. Sometimes it was as simple as acknowledging the strangeness of moving from the Las Vegas Convention Center to a Microsoft-powered virtual venue. Other times it felt far more forced.</p>
<p>When it comes to the technology itself, there’s no doubt that the pandemic is going to have a profound effect on the industry for years to come, from health measures to remote work setups. Sometimes it’s a genuinely organic evolution aimed at adapting technology to an ever-changing world. In other cases, it can feel far more exploitative &#8212; like the consumer electronics equivalent to a beer commercial discussing “these uncertain times.”</p>

<p>I’ve written a lot about how the pandemic will impact robotics and AI going forward. The short version is that companies will no doubt be more enthusiastic about embracing these technologies, after bumping up against the limitations of a human workforce with a deadly and highly contagious virus spreading across the world.</p>
<p>We saw some glimpses of robotics’ response. Though there tends to be a far longer lead time than in the consumer category. The clearest and most immediate example had to be the prevalence of UV outfitted robotics. LG, Ubtech and Ava Robotics all bombarded my inbox with their take on the category. The desire for disinfecting technology should be clear during a pandemic, and robotics offer both a way to automate a dull and repetitious process like this, while removing a potential human viral vector from the equation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2097344" style="width: 950px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2097344" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2097344" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/razer-project-hazel-chromamask-stills-bnw-compchroma-v004.png" alt="" width="940" height="528" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/razer-project-hazel-chromamask-stills-bnw-compchroma-v004.png 940w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/razer-project-hazel-chromamask-stills-bnw-compchroma-v004.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/razer-project-hazel-chromamask-stills-bnw-compchroma-v004.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/razer-project-hazel-chromamask-stills-bnw-compchroma-v004.png?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/razer-project-hazel-chromamask-stills-bnw-compchroma-v004.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/razer-project-hazel-chromamask-stills-bnw-compchroma-v004.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2097344" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Razer</p></div></p>
<p>UV disinfecting made appearances in a number of other form factors. Phones have been a target for the tech for a few years now. After all, it didn’t take COVID-19 to teach us that smartphones are mobile petri dishes we watch TikToks on. Products like CleanPhone from Canadian startup Glissner are looking to enter a space that’s been thus far dominated by PhoneSoap, which was genuinely ahead of the curve on the phenomenon.</p>
<p>Targus’s keyboard may well have been the most widely reported-on UV solution of the show, because, well, it’s a bit wacky, with an ultraviolet lamp that sits above it.</p>
<p>Masks are another piece of the puzzle that have slowly been infiltrating the show, but really hit a fever pitch this year. Obviously wearing a face mask in public is only a new phenomenon in some countries &#8212; in other parts of the world like East Asia it’s long been a normal part of life. Last year, Portland-based Ao Air grabbed some headlines with its own take on the category.</p>

<p>Razer’s Project Hazel was undoubtedly the most prominent mask to debut at the show. It’s big and flashy and a bit of a diversion for a company that primarily trades in gaming peripherals. The N95 mask sports LEDs to indicate charging status and make the wearer’s face visible in dark surroundings. There’s also technology built in to make the wearer’s voice clearer. For the moment, however, it’s hard to see them as much beyond a headline grabber.</p>
<p>One piece I genuinely expected to see more of was remote work. We caught glimpses, like the Dell monitor with Microsoft Teams conferencing built in. Microsoft pitched its new Surface as a remote work machine, but frankly, it didn’t feel any more targeted at that vertical than any other portable Surface.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp delays enforcement of a controversial privacy change, Apple may get rid of the Touch Bar in future MacBooks and Bumble files to go public. This is your Daily Crunch for January 15, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: WhatsApp responds to privacy backlash</strong></p>
<p>Earlier this month, WhatsApp sent users a notification asking them to consent to sharing some of their personal data — such as phone number and location — with Facebook (which owns WhatsApp). The alert also said users would have to agree to the terms by February 8 if they wanted to continue using the app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This change prompted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/whatsapp-faces-legal-challenge-over-privacy-in-its-biggest-market/">legal threats</a> and an investigation from <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2021/01/11/turkey-investigates-whatsapp-and-facebook-over-data-privacy-update">the Turkish government</a>. Now the company is pushing the enforcement date back three months.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one will have their account suspended or deleted on February 8. We’re also going to do a lot more to clear up the misinformation around how privacy and security works on WhatsApp,&#8221; the company said in a post. &#8220;We’ll then go to people gradually to review the policy at their own pace before new business options are available on May 15.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">This week, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey finally <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510769268850690">responded publicly</a> to the company’s decision to ban President Trump from its platform, writing that Twitter had &#8220;faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance&#8221; and that he did not &#8220;feel pride&#8221; about the decision. In the same thread, he took time to call out a nascent Twitter-sponsored initiative called &#8220;bluesky,&#8221; which is aiming to build up an &#8220;open decentralized standard for social media&#8221; that Twitter is just one part of.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Researchers involved with bluesky reveal to TechCrunch an initiative still in its earliest stages that could fundamentally shift the power dynamics of the social web.</p>
<p>Bluesky is aiming to build a “durable” web standard that will ultimately ensure that platforms like Twitter have less centralized responsibility in deciding which users and communities have a voice on the internet. While this could protect speech from marginalized groups, it may also upend modern moderation techniques and efforts to prevent online radicalization.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h2>What is bluesky?</h2>
<p>Just as Bitcoin lacks a central bank to control it, a decentralized social network protocol operates without central governance, meaning Twitter would only control its own app built on bluesky, not other applications on the protocol. The open and independent system would allow applications to see, search and interact with content across the entire standard. Twitter hopes that the project can go far beyond what the existing Twitter API offers, enabling developers to create applications with different interfaces or methods of algorithmic curation, potentially paying entities across the protocol like Twitter for plug-and-play access to different moderation tools or identity networks.</p>
<p>A widely adopted, decentralized protocol is an opportunity for social networks to &#8220;pass the buck&#8221; on moderation responsibilities to a broader network, one person involved with the early stages of bluesky suggests, allowing individual applications on the protocol to decide which accounts and networks its users are blocked from accessing.</p>
<p>Social platforms like Parler or Gab could theoretically rebuild their networks on bluesky, benefitting from its stability and the network effects of an open protocol. Researchers involved are also clear that such a system would also provide a meaningful measure against government censorship and protect the speech of marginalized groups across the globe.</p>
<p>Bluesky&#8217;s current scope is firmly in the research phase, people involved tell TechCrunch, with about 40-50 active members from different factions of the decentralized tech community surveying the software landscape and putting together proposals for what the protocol should ultimately look like. Twitter has told early members that it hopes to hire a project manager in the coming weeks to build out an independent team that will start crafting the protocol itself.</p>
<p>A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment on the initiative.</p>
<p>Bluesky&#8217;s initial members were invited by Twitter CTO Parag Agrawal early last year. It was later determined that the group should open the conversation up to folks representing some of the more recognizable decentralized network projects, including <a href="https://mastodon.social/about">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>, which joined the working group hosted on the secure chat platform <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a>.</p>
<p>Jay Graber, founder of decentralized social platform <a href="https://happening.net/">Happening</a>, was paid by Twitter to write up a technical review of the decentralized social ecosystem, an effort to &#8220;help Twitter evaluate the existing options in the space,&#8221; she tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;If [Twitter] wanted to design this thing, they could have just assigned a group of guys to do it, but there&#8217;s only one thing that this little tiny group of people could do better than Twitter, and that&#8217;s not be Twitter,&#8221; said Golda Velez, another member of the group who works as a senior software engineer at Postmates and co-founded <a href="https://civ.works/">civ.works</a>, <span class="lt-line-clamp__line">a privacy-centric social</span> <span class="lt-line-clamp__line lt-line-clamp__line--last">network for civic engagement.</span></p>
<p>The group has had some back and forth with Twitter executives on the scope of the project, eventually forming a Twitter-approved list of goals for the initiative. They define the challenges that the bluesky protocol should seek to address while also laying out what responsibilities are best left to the application creators building on the standard.</p>

<h2>Who is involved</h2>
<p>The pain points enumerated in the document, viewed by TechCrunch, encapsulate some of Twitter&#8217;s biggest shortcomings. They include &#8220;how to keep controversy and outrage from hijacking virality mechanisms,&#8221; as well as a desire to develop &#8220;customizable mechanisms&#8221; for moderation, though the document notes that the applications, not the overall protocol, are &#8220;ultimately liable for compliance, censorship, takedowns etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the solution to the problem of algorithms isn&#8217;t getting rid of algorithms &#8212; because sorting posts chronologically is an algorithm &#8212; the solution is to make it an open pluggable system by which you can go in and try different algorithms and see which one suits you or use the one that your friends like,&#8221; says Evan Henshaw-Plath, another member of the working group. He was one of Twitter&#8217;s earliest employees and has been building out his own decentralized social platform called <a href="https://planetary.social/">Planetary</a>.</p>
<p>His platform is based on the secure scuttlebutt protocol, which allows users to browse networks offline in an encrypted fashion. Early on, Planetary had been in talks with Twitter for a corporate investment as well as a personal investment from CEO Jack Dorsey, Henshaw-Plath says, but the competitive nature of the platform prompted some concern among Twitter&#8217;s lawyers and Planetary ended up receiving an investment from <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Twitter co-founder Biz Stone&#8217;s venture fund Future Positive. Stone did not respond to interview requests.</span></p>
<p>After agreeing on goals, Twitter had initially hoped for the broader team to arrive at some shared consensus, but starkly different viewpoints within the group prompted Twitter to accept individual proposals from members. Some pushed Twitter to outright adopt or evolve an existing standard while others pushed for bluesky to pursue interoperability of standards early on and see what users naturally flock to.</p>
<p>One of the developers in the group hoping to bring bluesky onto their standard was Mastodon creator Eugen Rochko, who tells TechCrunch he sees the need for a major shift in how social media platforms operate globally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Banning Trump was the right decision though it came a little bit too late. But at the same time, the nuance of the situation is that maybe it shouldn&#8217;t be a single American company that decides these things,&#8221; Rochko tells us.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DKCvXCDwaA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">The deplatforming of President Trump</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The deplatforming of President Trump&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/embed/#?secret=DKCvXCDwaA" data-secret="DKCvXCDwaA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Like several of the other members in the group, Rochko has been skeptical at times about Twitter&#8217;s motivation with the bluesky protocol. Shortly after Dorsey&#8217;s initial announcement in 2019, Mastodon&#8217;s official Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/joinmastodon/status/1204791506143457281?s=20">tweeted out a biting critique</a>, writing, &#8220;This is not an announcement of reinventing the wheel. This is announcing the building of a protocol that Twitter gets to control, like Google controls Android.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, Mastodon is arguably one of the most mature decentralized social platforms. Rochko claims that the network of decentralized nodes has more than 2.3 million users spread across thousands of servers. In early 2017, the platform had its viral moment on Twitter, prompting an influx of &#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of new users alongside some inquisitive potential investors whom Rochko has rebuffed in favor of a donation-based model.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1809256" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1809256" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1809256" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/toxic-twitter-alt.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/toxic-twitter-alt.png 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/toxic-twitter-alt.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/toxic-twitter-alt.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/toxic-twitter-alt.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/toxic-twitter-alt.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/toxic-twitter-alt.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1809256" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<h2>Inherent risks</h2>
<p>Not all of the attention Rochko has garnered has been welcome. In 2019, Gab, a social network favored by right-wing extremists, brought its entire platform onto the Mastodon network after integrating the platform&#8217;s open-source code, bringing Mastodon its single biggest web of users and its most undesirable liability all at once.</p>
<p>Rochko quickly disavowed the network and aimed to sever its ties to other nodes on the Mastodon platform and convince application creators to do the same. But a central fear of decentralization advocates was quickly realized, as the platform type&#8217;s first &#8220;success story&#8221; was a home for right-wing extremists.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ziyPJNEdaU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-is-officially-offline-after-aws-suspension/">Parler is officially offline after AWS suspension</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Parler is officially offline after AWS suspension&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-is-officially-offline-after-aws-suspension/embed/#?secret=ziyPJNEdaU" data-secret="ziyPJNEdaU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This fear has been echoed in decentralized communities this week as app store owners and networks have taken another right-wing social network, Parler, off the web after violent content surfaced on the site in the lead-up to and aftermath of riots at the U.S. Capitol, leaving some developers fearful that the social network may set up home on their decentralized standard.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Fascists are 100% going to use peer-to-peer technologies, they already are and they&#8217;re going to start using it more&#8230; If they get pushed off of mainstream infrastructure or people are surveilling them really closely, they&#8217;re going to have added motivation,&#8221; said Emmi Bevensee, a researcher <a href="https://emmibevensee.com/">studying</a> extremist presences on decentralized networks. &#8220;Maybe the far-right gets stronger footholds on peer-to-peer before the people who think the far-right is bad do because they were effectively pushed off.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>A central concern is that commoditizing decentralized platforms through efforts like bluesky will provide a more accessible route for extremists kicked off current platforms to maintain an audience and provide casual internet users a less janky path towards radicalization.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peer-to-peer technology is generally not that seamless right now. Some of it is; you can buy Bitcoin in Cash App now, which, if anything, is proof that this technology is going to become much more mainstream and adoption is going to become much more seamless,&#8221;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Bevensee told TechCrunch. </span>&#8220;In the current era of this mass exodus from Parler, they&#8217;re obviously going to lose a huge amount of audience that isn&#8217;t dedicated enough to get on IPFS. Scuttlebutt is a really cool technology but it&#8217;s not as seamless as Twitter.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="m55kWv4kq2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/telegram-channels-banned-violent-threats-capitol/">Telegram blocks ‘dozens’ of hardcore hate channels threatening violence</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Telegram blocks ‘dozens’ of hardcore hate channels threatening violence&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/telegram-channels-banned-violent-threats-capitol/embed/#?secret=m55kWv4kq2" data-secret="m55kWv4kq2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Extremists adopting technologies that promote privacy and strong encryption is far from a new phenomenon, encrypted chat apps like Signal and Telegram have been at the center of such controversies in recent years. Bevensee notes the tendency of right-wing extremist networks to adopt decentralized network tech has been &#8220;extremely demoralizing&#8221; to those early developer communities &#8212; though she notes that the same technologies can and do benefit &#8220;marginalized people all around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though people connected to bluesky&#8217;s early moves see a long road ahead for the protocol&#8217;s development and adoption, they also see an evolving landscape with Parler and President Trump&#8217;s recent deplatforming that they hope will drive other stakeholders to eventually commit to integrating with the standard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right at this moment I think that there&#8217;s going to be a lot of incentive to adopt, and I don&#8217;t just mean by end users, I mean by platforms, because Twitter is not the only one having these really thorny moderation problems,&#8221; Velez says. &#8220;I think people understand that this is a critical moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lore&#8217;s tenure at the company was a mixed bag. Walmart instituted several new technology initiatives under Lore&#8217;s tenure, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/walmart-says-it-will-discontinue-jet-com-which-it-acquired-for-3b-in-2016/">the Jet.com service was shuttered last May</a> and other initiatives from Lore, like an option to have customers order items via text, was also a money-loser for the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company.</p>

<p>&#8220;After Mr. Lore retires on January 31, 2021, the U.S. business, including all the aspects of US retail eCommerce, will continue to report to John Furner, Executive Vice President, President and Chief Executive Officer, Walmart U.S., beginning on February 1, 2021,&#8221; Walmart said in a filing.</p>
<p>Walmart has continued to push ahead with a number of tech-related initiatives, including the launch of a new business that will focus on developing financial services.</p>
<p>That initiative is being undertaken through a strategic partnership with the fintech investment firm, Ribbit Capital and adds to a startup tech portfolio that also includes the incubator Store N⁰8, <a href="https://www.storeno8.com/the-l8est/how-to-better-serve-the-consumer-of-the-future-starting-today">which launched in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reflecting on the past few years with so much pride – Walmart changed my life and the work we did together will keep changing the lives of customers for years to come. It has been an honor to be a part of the Walmart family and I look forward to providing advice and ideas in the future,&#8221; Lore said in a statement posted to Linkedin. &#8220;Looking forward, I’ll be taking some time off and plan to continue working with several startups. Excited to keep you all up to date on what’s next.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coinbase has a problem. As interest in Bitcoin has soared along with its price, the popular cryptocurrency exchange has found itself the target of a growing spate of angry customers who haven&#8217;t been able to access customer service.</p>
<p>A quick look at Twitter tells the story. As one upset user of the service ranted earlier today: &#8220;Multiple issues over the last month which cost me $$$ several open cases and 0% response?? When are you going to help me or is it easier to just forget. This wont be so easy when your publicly traded. Will be following up with [SEC] soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are many (many) similar complaints to be found.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the interest of full disclosure, this editor asked the company this week for more insight into its customer service operations after emailing its support staff more than a half dozen times and tweeting once over 10 days, and receiving no response. (I bought one unit of Ether in 2018 on the platform and wanted to access my account, which I&#8217;d been locked out of nearly two years ago.)</p>
<p>To its credit, Coinbase today<a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/committing-to-better-customer-service-during-this-time-of-heightened-interest-in-the-cryptoeconomy-5dc2637c4fa7"> issued a statement</a>, promising to do better. Its VP of customer success, Casper Sorenson, wrote on the company&#8217;s blog that Coinbase is &#8220;committing to a better customer experience during this time of heightened interest in the cryptoeconomy.&#8221;  The company says it is adding more people to its team; adding more self-service options (there are startling few); expanding its &#8220;help center&#8221;; and launching a new educational site, Coinbase Learn, &#8220;as a one-stop-shop for first timers, experienced investors, and everyone in between.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most meaningful perhaps, Coinbase says that in the coming months, it will begin offering live messaging with Coinbase representatives, which is not currently an option. Indeed, Coinbase does not offer live support of any kind. A help support phone line is only available to users wanting to freeze their accounts, and it is automated. (The flip side of its slow customer response times may tie to the apparent seriousness with which Coinbase, which works closely with regulated banks, <a href="https://blockonomi.com/is-coinbase-safe/">takes security issues</a>.)</p>

<p>Either way, the company will have to do far more for its increasingly mainstream users as a publicly traded outfit, both because regulators will undoubtedly take a greater interest in its unhappy customers and because it will otherwise lose existing and potential clients to rivals, of which there are a growing array, from the international payment giant PayPal, which is now seeing <a href="https://beincrypto.com/paypals-cryptocurrency-trading-volume-soars-past-242m-in-24-hours/">record daily cryptocurrency trading</a>, to investment brokers like Robinhood. (Another increasingly popular option: digital asset <a href="https://craft.co/grayscale/competitors">managers</a> like Grayscale, whose trusts are publicly traded over the counter.)</p>
<p>More attention to the issue appears overdue. While Coinbase has presumably been dealing with a surge in complaints that corresponds with the volatility of Bitcoin&#8217;s ups and downs, customer service has been an ongoing issue for the nearly nine-year-old, San Francisco outfit, which filed its <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-files-confidentially-for-ipo-aiming-for-major-crypto-industry-milestone-195758729.html">confidential form</a> with the SEC in December to go public and says it has 35 million users in more than 100 countries.</p>
<p>In 2018, Mashable obtained <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sec-coinbase-complaints-fraud/">134 pages of complaints</a> filed to the SEC and the California Department of Business Oversight following a five-month FOIA process, and the picture that emerged was &#8220;not of a responsible actor in the cryptocurrency space opening the market to new investors, but rather a company overwhelmed by and underprepared for its own success,&#8221; the outlet reported at the time.</p>
<p>Asked today, among other things, how Coinbase&#8217;s processes have since changed, how many of its more than 1,200 employees are focused on customer support, and whether the outfit could share its latest customer numbers, Coinbase, currently in its SEC-mandated quiet period, declined to comment.</p>

<p>Coinbase has raised $547.3 million in venture backing over the years, according to Crunchbase. Tiger Global Management, which is currently raising up to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/tiger-global-is-raising-a-new-3-75-billion-venture-fund-one-year-after-closing-its-last/">$3.75 billion for its newest fund</a>, led Coinbase&#8217;s company&#8217;s most recent private round, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/coinbase-is-now-valued-at-8b-after-closing-new-300m-round/">$300 million Series E financing</a> that closed in 2018 and assigned Coinbase a post-money valuation of $8 billion.</p>
<p>Last September, the company parted ways with more than 5% of its employees, after cofounder and CEO Brian Armstrong publicly discouraged employee activism and political discussions at work, then offered severance to staffers who were uncomfortable with the policy.</p>
<p>Roughly <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/a-follow-up-to-coinbase-as-a-mission-focused-company-6e7545e9aea2">60 people</a> took the company up on the offer, Coinbase itself later revealed.</p>
<p>Coinbase&#8217;s IPO has been eagerly anticipated by many, though changes in Washington could potentially have a dampening effect on the company and other exchanges.</p>
<p>Coinbase&#8217;s own former chief legal officer, Brian Brooks, was last summer appointed as the acting head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and among his other crypto-friendly efforts, he published interpretive letters and announcements declaring that banks can partner with crypto custodians and conduct payments using stablecoins.</p>
<p>It was never entirely clear how much weight those letters and announcements carried. Asked last week about Brooks&#8217;s most recent interpretive letter, in which he stated that financial institutions can participate as nodes on a blockchain and store or validate payments, the FDIC said in an emailed response that it had no comment.</p>
<p>Asked last week if Brooks&#8217;s letter signaled changing U.S. monetary policy, the U.S. Treasury Department did not respond to our press request.</p>
<p>Brooks&#8217;s reign has ended, in any case. With a new incoming administration, he resigned from his position this week, replaced by a career OCC employee, Blake Paulson, who may himself be replaced in coming weeks. The change leaves question about how and whether the agency&#8217;s tone toward cryptocurrency will change.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gary Gensler, a former financial regulator and Goldman Sachs banker who has most recently been teaching at M.I.T. is expected to be nominated to lead the SEC. He is also expected to welcome greater oversight of the <a href="https://qz.com/1954555/all-the-worlds-crypto-is-now-worth-more-than-1-trillion">$1 trillion</a> cryptocurrency market than Jay Clayton, the Wall Street attorney who stepped down from the role last month after three years.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Launching is easy; fundraising is harder.</p>
<p>I’ve been fortunate to be a partner at two different VC firms over the past nine years, and we’ve grown AUM 10x both times.</p>
<p>Based on my experience, taking the 15 steps below will help build the core of a high-performing fundraising and investor relations function.</p>
<h2>1. Build the firm as much as possible before soliciting LPs</h2>
<p>The more baked you are, the more investable you are. The best possible move is to invest in and warehouse some special purpose vehicles that fit your strategy. However, that may distract you from the larger goal of raising a fund, not just a special purpose vehicle.</p>
<p>The next best move is to build your core team, e.g., recruit an advisory board, venture partners and EIRs. Lastly, gather feedback. Yohei Nakajima, founder of <a href="http://Untapped.vc">Untapped.vc</a>, said, “Before pitching LPs and building my firm, I talked with over 50 people I knew to get feedback.”</p>
<h2>2. Set up a basic marketing toolkit: Deck, website and social media</h2>
<p>It’s virtually mandatory to develop a detailed, data-backed deck and ideally a video pitch. Your materials should ideally meet the <a href="http://teten.com/lpdd">expectations</a> of the Institutional Limited Partners Association, even if you’re not targeting institutions. Keep these documents constantly up to date, so all team members are aligned on key numbers, e.g., total dollars raised so far. You’ll look unprofessional if you’re not coordinated.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, almost no one invests based on a deck; they want to talk with the people. However, a high-credibility deck opens the door to a meeting where you then have the chance to sell yourself.</p>
<p>Note that limited partners view formatting as a proxy for professionalism. It’s worth investing a little money in a graphic designer who can design a consistent website, business card, logo and presentation templates.</p>
<p>Richard Dukas, CEO, <a href="https://www.dlpr.com/">Dukas Linden Public Relations</a>, said, “If you don&#8217;t have a website and have no material online presence, you likely won&#8217;t get past the first hurdle with potential investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>When you’re fundraising, you’re selling a luxury good. The less widely marketed your fund, the more valuable it is perceived to be. For example, one LP told me she prefers to receive customized emails from fund principals, as opposed to a bulk-mailed quarterly update. An extreme example of this are venture capitalists who don’t even bother with a website, e.g., <a href="http://www.benchmark.com/">Benchmark</a> and <a href="https://www.thrivecap.com/">Thrive Capital</a>. They are the equivalent of a nightclub with an unmarked door, but other investors will need to <a href="https://teten.com/PE-social">shape up their social media tech stack</a>.</p>
<h2>3. Make your online profile data-driven and internally consistent</h2>
<p>All team members should have internally consistent and professional profiles on Linkedin at a minimum and typically also on Twitter, Facebook and/or other platforms you use. In particular, highlight the metrics by which you measured <a href="http://teten.com/resume">your past activities</a>: size of exit, number of people you managed, budget you were responsible for, etc.</p>
<h2>4. Set up a data room with a completed due diligence questionnaire</h2>
<p>Among the most important information to include: details on return history, legal documents, fund organization chart, <a href="https://medium.com/@eniacvc/seed-fund-portfolio-construction-for-dummies-9ec5b4d152dc">portfolio construction model</a>, portfolio company one-pagers, key personnel resumes and case studies of past investments. We are using <a href="http://digify.com">Digify</a> to manage this.</p>
<h2>5. Prepare FAQs for prospective LPs</h2>
<p>You will inevitably receive a wide range of one-off questions from potential LPs. Make sure to compile all your answers in a single document so that you can recycle and refine these answers.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://tophat.com/">Top Hat</a>, a startup that digitizes textbooks and turns them into an interactive experience for college students, announced on Wednesday that it has acquired yet another business: Fountainhead Press. The acquisition marks Top Hat’s third scoop of a publishing company in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Consolidation is going to be huge in the next few years for edtech, as bigger players raise enough financing (and gain profits) to be able to afford other businesses.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Top Hat’s whole business proposition is a subtweet to Zoom University: It wants to make learning an active, online experience and completely digital. That focus has let them reach 3.5 million students and thousands of universities. With a new acquisition, Top Hat is bringing more content into its fold, and with it, more customers who need a better solution to a dusty textbook.</p>
<p>I caught up with Top Hat CEO and founder <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSilagadze?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Mike Silagadze</a> to understand what has triggered this string of content acquisitions. While the M&amp;A isn’t tech-focused, we can learn about how a well-funded edtech startup is navigating the early innings of 2021.</p>
<p>We’ll talk about the shift from offline to online, edtech’s consolidation environment and why the “sell to Pearson or bust” mindset might officially be out the door for the sector.</p>
<h2><strong>Offline to online</strong></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Group Nine Media <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/group-nine-spac/">revealed last month</a> that it was forming a SPAC (short for special purpose acquisition corporation) in order to raise money for acquisitions.</p>
<p>The company has now moved forward with those plans, announcing last night that it had priced the SPAC&#8217;s IPO at $10 per unit, to raise a total of $200 million. It&#8217;s now trading on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol GNACU; as of 2:53 p.m. Eastern shares were up 6.55%. (Eventually, the Class A common stock will be listed as GNAC and warrants will be listed separately as GNACW.) The offering is expected to close on January 20.</p>
<p>The acquisition corporation, like Group Nine itself, is led by CEO Ben Lerer (pictured above). Imagination Capital Partner Richard D. Parsons and Reddit Chief Operating Officer Jen Wong are also on the board of directors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Group Nine was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/13/group-nine-media/">formed in 2016</a> with backing from Discovery, merging Thrillist, NowThis, The Dodo and Seeker. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/group-nine-acquires-popsugar/">subsequently acquired PopSugar</a>, with co-founder Brian Sugar becoming president of both Group Nine and now Group Nine Acquisition Corp.</p>
<p>SPACs, also known as blank-check corporations, have become an increasingly popular way for companies to raise money from the public markets. In its initial filing, Group Nine said it would use the funding &#8220;for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve got an Apple TV+ trial that&#8217;s set to expire sometime between now and June, good news: you&#8217;re getting some free bonus time.</p>
<p>Apple TV+ first launched in November of 2019, alongside a one-year free trial for anyone buying a new iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple TV or Mac. As those initial trials approached their end, Apple voluntarily <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/apple-is-extending-some-appletv-subs-through-february-2021-for-free/">extended them out to February of 2021</a>. Now they&#8217;re extending them once again.</p>
<p>As first reported <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/15/apple-again-extends-apple-tv-free-trials-subscribers-now-get-free-access-until-july-2021/">by 9to5Mac</a>, any trial that previously would&#8217;ve expired from February to June of 2021 will now expire in July instead. We have confirmed these plans with Apple.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Users should expect to get an email about the extension in the coming weeks. If you&#8217;re already paying for AppleTV+ or have it as part of an Apple One bundle, meanwhile, you&#8217;ll be getting a $4.99 per month credit until the end of June.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t already, take this as an opportunity to blast through Ted Lasso, which is probably the most charming thing anyone has made for TV in a decade. Central Park is also great, though it has yet to hook me in quite the same way as Loren Bouchard&#8217;s other series (Bob&#8217;s Burgers, Home Movies).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Desktop Metal this morning announced its intention to purchase fellow 3D printing company EnvisionTEC. Founded in Germany in 2002, EnvisionTEC specializes in photopolymer additive manufacturing, putting its technology in more direct competition with the likes of 3D printing darling Carbon than Desktop Metal’s own existing portfolio.</p>
<p>The deal follows Desktop Metal’s push to go public last August as part of a growing trend of SPAC mergers. Prior to this, the company had raised no shortage of its own funds, with a rapid ascent into unicorn status on the wake of $430 million in investments. It’s spending $300 million to acquire EnvisionTEC through a combination of cash and stock.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of potential for Desktop Metal to grow here. EnvisionTEC has the underlying technology with the ability to print in more than 190 materials, and Desktop Metal has the resources to help scale that tech beyond what the German company has been able to build thus far.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s clear that dental is a pretty huge piece of this puzzle. It’s among the clearest and most immediate use cases for this sort of mass volume 3D printing &#8212; and, indeed, the company already sports around 1,000 customers in dental, including companies like Smile Direct Club. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the company effectively tripled its Envision One dental shipments over the previous year.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s used for everything from restorations to same-day, full arch implants,” Desktop Metal CEO Ric Fulop tells TechCrunch. “Usually when you get a denture, you’ve got to wait three weeks for denture implants. This is the first time you&#8217;ve got a solution that can do it in the same day. And it’s affordable.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210115005221/en/Desktop-Metal-to-Acquire-EnvisionTEC-Entering-Market-for-Volume-Production-Polymer-Additive-Manufacturinghttps:/www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210115005221/en/Desktop-Metal-to-Acquire-EnvisionTEC-Entering-Market-for-Volume-Production-Polymer-Additive-Manufacturing">Per a press release</a> issued in the wake of the news, other existing customers include Ford and Hasbro. Fulop says the company will continue to operate as its own division after the acquisition, which is expected to close this quarter.</p>
<p>“We’ll be able to leverage their channel,” the executive says. “We look forward to expanding on that capability and using our channel to give them more tools to have a full solution that spans from metal to composites to biomaterials and now photopolymer printing.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp said on Friday that it won&#8217;t enforce the planned update to its data-sharing policy until May 15, weeks after news about the new terms created confusion among its users, exposed the Facebook app to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/whatsapp-faces-legal-challenge-over-privacy-in-its-biggest-market/">a potential lawsuit</a>, <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2021/01/11/turkey-investigates-whatsapp-and-facebook-over-data-privacy-update">triggered a nationwide investigation</a> and drove tens of millions of its loyal fans to explore alternative messaging apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re now moving back the date on which people will be asked to review and accept the terms. No one will have their account suspended or deleted on February 8. We&#8217;re also going to do a lot more to clear up the misinformation around how privacy and security works on WhatsApp. We’ll then go to people gradually to review the policy at their own pace before new business options are available on May 15,&#8221; the firm said in a blog post.</p>
<p>The messaging app, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/whatsapp-hits-2-billion-users-up-from-1-5-billion-2-years-ago/">serves more than two billion users</a>, said it was delaying the enforcement of the new terms, which it first unveiled last year, over confusion it has created worldwide. The delay of the planned privacy update is aimed at providing users with more time to review the terms, the company said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&#8220;We’ve heard from so many people how much confusion there is around our recent update. There&#8217;s been a lot of misinformation causing concern and we want to help everyone understand our principles and the facts,&#8221; said the company, which earlier this week ran full-page ads on several newspapers in India, where it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/youtube-and-whatsapp-inch-closer-to-half-a-billion-users-in-india/">amassed over 450 million monthly active users</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2097220" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2097220" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2097220 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-app-update.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-app-update.jpg 1199w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-app-update.jpg?resize=150,59 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-app-update.jpg?resize=300,117 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-app-update.jpg?resize=768,300 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-app-update.jpg?resize=680,265 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-app-update.jpg?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2097220" class="wp-caption-text">For years, WhatsApp has been attempting to curb the spread of misinformation on its app. Now, it&#8217;s attempting to debunk falsehoods about WhatsApp itself. Image Credits: WhatsApp</p></div></p>
<p>Through an in-app alert, WhatsApp had asked users earlier this month to agree to new terms of conditions that grants the app the consent to share with Facebook some personal data about them, such as their phone number and location. Users will have to agree to these terms by February 8 if they wish to continue using the app, the alert said.</p>
<p>The change has been mischaracterized by many as their personal communication being compromised, which WhatsApp also <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/answering-your-questions-about-whatsapps-privacy-policy">clarified</a> this week was not the case. WhatsApp, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/19/facebook-buying-whatsapp-for-16b-in-cash-and-stock-plus-3b-in-rsus/">Facebook bought for $19 billion in 2014</a>, has been sharing some limited information about its users <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/25/whatsapp-to-share-user-data-with-facebook-for-ad-targeting-heres-how-to-opt-out/">with the social giant since 2016</a> &#8212; and for a period allowed users to opt-out of this.</p>
<p>&#8220;With these updates, none of that is changing. Instead, the update includes new options people will have to message a business on WhatsApp, and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data. While not everyone shops with a business on WhatsApp today, we think that more people will choose to do so in the future and it’s important people are aware of these services. This update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook,&#8221; WhatsApp wrote today.</p>
<p>Following the backlash, tens of millions of confused and angered users have flocked to Signal and Telegram. As of earlier this week, Signal was the top app on the App Store in 40 nations and Google Play Store in 18.</p>
<p>In an<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/"> interview with TechCrunch earlier this week</a>, Signal co-founder and executive chairman Brian Acton (who also co-founded WhatsApp) said “the smallest of events helped trigger the largest of outcomes. We’re also excited that we are having conversations about online privacy and digital safety and people are turning to Signal as the answer to those questions.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://twilio.com">Twilio</a> CEO Jeff Lawson knows a thing or two about unleashing developers. His company has garnered a market cap of almost $60 billion by creating a set of tools to make it easy for programmers to insert a whole host of communications functionality into an application with a couple of lines of code. Given that background, perhaps it shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise that Lawson has written a book called <a href="https://www.askyourdeveloper.com/">&#8220;Ask Your Developer,&#8221;</a> which hit the stores this week.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Lawson&#8217;s basic philosophy is that if you can build it, you should.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Lawson&#8217;s basic philosophy in the book is that if you can build it, you should. In every company, there is build versus buy calculus that goes into every software decision. Lawson believes deeply that there is incredible power in building yourself instead of purchasing something off the shelf. By using components like the ones from his company, and many others delivering specialized types functionality via API, you can build what your customers need instead of just buying what the vendors are giving you.</p>
<p>While Lawson recognizes this isn&#8217;t always possible, he says that by asking your developers, you can begin to learn when it makes sense to build and when it doesn&#8217;t. These discussions should stem from customer problems and companies should seek digital solutions with the input of the developer group.</p>
<h2>Building great customer experiences</h2>
<p>Lawson posits that you can build a better customer experience because you understand your customers so much more  acutely than a generic vendor ever could. &#8220;Basically, what you see happening across nearly every industry is that the companies that are able to listen to their customers and hear what the customers need and then build really great digital products and experiences &#8212; well, they tend to win the hearts, minds and wallets of their customers,&#8221; Lawson told me in an interview about the book this week.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095469" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095469" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2095469" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TWILLIO_101_BILLBOARD1-edit.jpg?w=680" alt="Billboard for book Ask your Developer by Jeff Lawson, CEO of Twilio" width="680" height="321" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TWILLIO_101_BILLBOARD1-edit.jpg 3283w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TWILLIO_101_BILLBOARD1-edit.jpg?resize=150,71 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TWILLIO_101_BILLBOARD1-edit.jpg?resize=300,142 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TWILLIO_101_BILLBOARD1-edit.jpg?resize=768,363 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TWILLIO_101_BILLBOARD1-edit.jpg?resize=680,321 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TWILLIO_101_BILLBOARD1-edit.jpg?resize=1536,725 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TWILLIO_101_BILLBOARD1-edit.jpg?resize=2048,967 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TWILLIO_101_BILLBOARD1-edit.jpg?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095469" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twilio (image has been cropped)</p></div></p>
<p>He says that this has caused a shift in how companies perceive IT departments. They have gone from cost centers that provision laptops and buy HR software to something more valuable, helping produce digital products that have a direct impact on the business&#8217;s bottom line.</p>
<p>He uses banking as an example in the book. It used to be you judged a bank by a set of criteria like how nice the lobby was, if the tellers were friendly and if they gave your kid a free lollipop. Today, that&#8217;s all changed and it&#8217;s all about the quality of the mobile app.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nowadays your bank is a mobile app and you like your bank if the software is fast, if it is bug free and if they regularly update it with new features and functionality that makes your life better [ … ]. And that same transformation has been happening in nearly every industry and so when you think about it, you can&#8217;t buy differentiation if every bank just bought the same mobile app from some vendor and just off the shelf deployed it,&#8221; he said.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.blockpartyapp.com/">Block Party</a>, an anti-harassment startup that aims to help folks feel safer on social media founded by Tracy Chou, launched today. Currently only available for Twitter, Block Party helps people filter out the content they don&#8217;t want to see and into what Block Party calls the Lockout Folder. That&#8217;s where all of the filtered-out content lives in the event you want to review it later.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think it&#8217;s important to still acknowledge that these people exist,&#8221; Chou told me.</p>
<p>If you pretend like it doesn&#8217;t exist, you might miss out on useful information or genuine connections.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There’s a lot of good stuff that would get lost there,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There is a reason we use public platforms like Twitter.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>On the more negative side, she said, you still may need to check periodically to see if there&#8217;s someone threatening your physical safety.</p>
<p>Helpers play a big part of the Block Party experience. You can grant a trusted helper access to your Lockout Folder to let you know if there&#8217;s anything useful in there, or to simply block the trolls.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a lot easier for someone else to help you process it and flag something that is a concern,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s nice to be able to share that burden. The current design of most of these platforms is to put the burden of dealing with it solely on the person who’s being abused.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The Lockout Folder also serves as a record-keeping tool in the event you need to present evidence of your harassment to a company, a lawyer or someone else.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2097150" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2097150" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2097150" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="294" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png 985w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png?resize=300,130 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png?resize=768,332 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png?resize=680,294 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2097150" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screenshot/Block Party</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really about trying to make people&#8217;s lives easier,&#8221; Chou said. &#8220;It&#8217;s just so painful to have to see the abuse again when you&#8217;re filing the report.&#8221;</p>
<p>Block Party emerged from Chou&#8217;s own experiences working at platform companies like Facebook and Quora, as well as her experience as an outspoken advocate for diversity and inclusion in tech. At Quora, the block button was one of the first things she built after being harassed on the platform, Chou told me.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s that perspective of having been on the inside and seeing how product and engineering teams work,&#8221; Chou said. &#8220;But also being a DEI activist and seeing how lack of representation on teams has impacted product decisions for the worst.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Block Party is only available for Twitter users, the goal is to add other platforms and help folks address harassers that target them across multiple platforms. Block Party is currently free but plans to introduce subscription tiers. Still, Chou said she envisions the free version always existing.</p>
<p>To date, Block Party has raised a little less than $1.5 million in funding. Its lead pre-seed round was led by Charles Hudson of Precursor Ventures. Other investors include Alexia Bonatsos, Ellen Pao, Alex Stamos and others.</p>
