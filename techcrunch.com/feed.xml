										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security researchers have uncovered a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/spyware/">spyware</a> campaign that’s targeting South Korean residents with Android devices in order to steal confidential data.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Unlike other spyware campaigns that typically take advantage of on-device vulnerabilities, this <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">campaign, known as PhoneSpy, hides in plain sight on victims’ devices, masquerading as legitimate </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/android/">Android</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> lifestyle apps</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> from TV streaming to yoga instruction. In reality, however, the spyware is stealthily exfoliating data from the victim’s device, including login credentials, messages, precise granular location and images. PhoneSpy is also capable of uninstalling any apps, including </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/mobile-security/">mobile security</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> apps.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Researchers at mobile security firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/zimperium/">Zimperium</a>, which discovered PhoneSpy inside 23 apps, say the spyware can also access a victims’ camera to take pictures and record video in real-time, and warned that this could be used for personal and corporate blackmail and espionage. It does this without a victim knowing, and Zimperium notes that unless someone is watching their web traffic, it would be difficult to detect.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231172" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The legitimate-looking apps request excessive on-device permissions — a common red flag.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Once the permissions are granted, the attackers can take control and hide the app from the user&#8217;s menu, staying behind the scenes to continue to track and steal with little to no interruption,” Zimperium’s Richard Melick told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>PhoneSpy is not known to be listed in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/google-play/">Google Play</a>, nor were samples found in any Android storefront. Rather, Zimperium says that attackers are using distribution methods based on web traffic redirection or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/social-engineering/">social engineering</a>, an attack method whereby users are manipulated into performing certain actions or handing over confidential data.</p>
<p>“PhoneSpy is distributed through malicious and fake apps that are downloaded and sideloaded onto the victim&#8217;s devices,&#8221; Melick said. &#8220;There is evidence pointing to distribution through web traffic redirection or social engineering, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/phishing/">phishing</a>, tricking the end-user into downloading what they think is a legitimate app from a compromised website or direct link.”</p>
<p>PhoneSpy, which has so far claimed more than 1,000 victims in South Korea, according to Zimperium, shares many similarities with other known and previously used spyware and stalkerware apps. “This leads us to believe that someone compiled the features and capabilities they wanted into a new spyware setup,” Melick added. Using off-the-shelf code also produces fewer fingerprints, making it easier for attackers to obscure their identity.</p>
<p>Zimperium says it has notified U.S. and South Korean authorities of this hyper-targeted spyware campaign and has reported the host of the command and control server multiple times. However, at the time of writing, the PhoneSpy spyware campaign is still active.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/stalkerware-security-phone-data-thousands/">TechCrunch revealed a significant stalkerware campaign</a> that’s putting the private phone data of hundreds of thousands of people at risk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remote and hybrid work have become the norm in business, and today a startup that&#8217;s building tools to improve how desktop computers behave in those scenarios is announcing a round of growth funding to expand its business. ControlUp, which has built technology for IT teams to monitor and improve performance across their networks, has picked up $100 million in a round of funding that it will be using to continue investing in its tools and to pick up more business.</p>
<p>ControlUp is already a substantial business: it says that its customers include four of the top five U.S. health insurance companies, five of the top eight U.S. healthcare companies, and four of the top six global telecoms carriers. ControlUp&#8217;s revenues grew 50% in the last year, with enterprise accounts growing 67%. Its technology is now monitoring desktops covering some 1 million &#8220;seats&#8221; globally. To give you an idea of how big its customers are, those 1 million seats are connected to some 1,500 customers in all.</p>
<p>K1 Investment Management and JVP, both previous backers, co-led this round. ControlUp was founded in Israel, where it continues to have a strong R&amp;D presence, alongside wider operations out of San Jose. The company&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Asaf Ganot said the startup would not be disclosing its valuation, but from what we understand it&#8217;s significantly higher than the $330 million valuation it had a year ago (per <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/159260-14/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a>), when it announced its Series C, although it is still under $1 billion.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232019" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ganot tells me that ControlUp was originally founded to address the performance shortcomings that you get when running virtual machines on a network: issues like broadband speed, running too many applications on too little compute power, and high latency with app performance all potentially result in degraded computing experiences, and worker frustration. That challenge has become more complex in recent times, with the rise of people working from home, using WiFi and broadband networks of varying quality, and sometimes working on their own computers, which again might not be optimized for business needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;User experience was always a big thing,&#8221; he said of the company&#8217;s earlier days. &#8220;Good means high productivity, that people are happier and will probably work better. What is happening in the last year or two is that the issues have become more predominant. It&#8217;s not just a niche.&#8221; Addressing remote and hybrid working is essentially targeting, he said, &#8220;the same things we’ve been doing forever, just now with more workloads.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s solution is based around deploying &#8220;agents&#8221; that exist in the background on a person&#8217;s computer that are continually monitoring how applications and the general device is working. These agents are powered by AI, and they can not only identify when, say, a broadband network is too slow, but also provide remediation in the form of automated or non-automated technical suggestions for what a person, or IT person remotely, can do to fix the particular issue.</p>
<p>The company covers both remote users as well as physical endpoints including Citrix Virtual Apps, VMWare Horizon and Microsoft RDS and WVD, but for now at least it doesn&#8217;t extend to mobile devices, which have their own specialized set of device management issues, Ganot said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These days people might be wary of &#8212; if not downright resistant to &#8212; the idea of &#8220;agents&#8221; quietly sitting in the background monitoring your every computer move. Asked about this and the issues that it poses, Ganot said that ControlUp is built with more privacy in mind, looking and monitoring only in cases where a &#8220;work asset&#8221; is used: that work asset could be a work-issued computer, or it could be an employee accessing their work email via a browser: the system only &#8220;reads&#8221; data related to that usage.</p>
<p>&#8220;The IT team can monitor the home networking and WiFi signature. However, we do that only when you are connected to a work asset,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This fits even if it’s not a corporate device. We don’t do anything in fact unless you are connected to a work asset such as an application for work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ganot said that to date the system is light enough that it doesn&#8217;t impact on user experience itself. &#8220;Monitoring apps are notorious for slowing things down,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but our agents are super non-intrusive. This is one of our core values: we don&#8217;t want to become one of the causes of user experience being a problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>With remote and hybrid working looking like they are here to stay for the foreseeable future, it&#8217;s likely investors will continue to look for opportunities to back startups that are helping to make that a manageable, and perhaps even improved, experience for end users and their organizations.</p>
<p>“In the post-COVID-19 era, IT managers of large organizations have the unique challenge of monitoring the performance of the network for each of their employees in the office, at home or in any other remote location,” said Erel Margalit, founder and chairman of JVP, in a statement. “ControlUp provides a deep analysis of mission critical applications—for every employee—highlighting problems and finding remedies to solve them. The company’s dashboard enables IT managers to monitor, assess and improve the productivity for all the employees in the company.”</p>
<p>“We continue to see a significant shift toward work-from-anywhere across all industries,” added Roy Liao, SVP at K1. “K1 is proud to partner with ControlUp as it continues to innovate and change the landscape of the digital employee experience market. By focusing on making the employee experience simpler, faster, and more cost-effective, ControlUp provides a unique value proposition that no other vendor fills.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The race to automate the world of business is on, and today one of the bigger players in the market has picked up another major round of funding to meet that demand to speed up work, reduce some of the costs around repetitive procedures, and perhaps gain some new insights in the process.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.workato.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workato</a>, which has built a platform that lets organizations set up and run automated solutions to speed up repetitive processes in their workflows, has closed a Series E of $200 million at a $5.7 billion valuation. Workato said that it plans to use to continue investing in its platform, and to make acquisitions, ahead of eyeing up an IPO down the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s our plan to eventually go public, but there is no official timeline set,&#8221; Vijay Tella, Workato CEO and co-founder, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Right now we’re focused on making Workato the company you think of when you think of Integration and Automation. We believe customers can benefit so much from wall-to-wall integration, and for that reason our goal is for our customer usage to continue to grow over time and to stay on the revenue path we are already on.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231943" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In line with that, along with the funding news, Workato is also disclosing an acquisition that it made with some of its funds: <a href="https://www.railsdata." target="_blank" rel="noopener">RailsData</a>, a startup that has built API-based technology to integrate apps, data and devices. Workato had been a <a href="https://www.railsdata.com/client.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer</a> of Chennai, India-based RailsData prior to the acquisition, so it was already using the smaller startup&#8217;s technology to power some of its own automation solutions, specifically for deploying services at scale, via APIs, for larger customers of Workato&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Battery Ventures led this latest round, with Insight Partners, Altimeter Capital and Tiger Global also participating in equal amounts, the company said. Workato, which has now raised $421 million to date, has been more generally on a funding and growth tear this year: it was only in <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210112005023/en/Workato-Announces-110M-at-1.7B-Valuation-to-Transform-How-Enterprises-Work-with-Integration-Led-Automation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January</a> of this year that the Mountain View-based startup had raised $110 million at a $1.7 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for the big valuation hike has been the company&#8217;s growth. There are now a number of companies, including Salesforce&#8217;s Mulesoft, UiPath, Boomi, ServiceNow, Tray.io, SnapLogic, Blue Prism, IBM and so many others offering different approaches to providing automation of one kind or another to organizations, and as the space matures we&#8217;re even starting to see an increasing number of approaches <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/notable-which-makes-rpa-based-tools-to-speed-up-healthcare-admin-raises-100m-at-a-600m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeting specific use cases and verticals</a>.</p>
<p>Workato&#8217;s pitch is that it has managed to bridge the gap between automation and the non-technical users who are most likely to want to use (and build robotic process automation and other workflow automation experiences using) tools like these.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It has some 500,000 &#8220;recipes&#8221; available for companies to use, covering operational areas like HR, marketing, sales, finance, IT, revenue operations and product (where its automations can be embedded into other services), and popular enterprise apps like Salesforce, Slack, ServiceNow, Snowflake, and Workday. Even though a number of RPA and other automation vendors tout &#8220;low code&#8221; or even &#8220;no code&#8221; solutions aimed at non-technical people, the reality is that this is often not really the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="il">Workato</span> has looked at the integration and automation problems differently, that they are two sides of the same coin,&#8221; said Tella. &#8220;Today integration tools like iPaaS, ETL/ELT, and API management are focused at data level and don’t do end to end process automation or workflows. Tools like RPA and BPM approach the problem from a business process perspective but lack a strong foundation of connectivity or integration leading to brittle, hard to implement and change workflows</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We see business processes as inseparable from underlying data,&#8221; Tella continued. &#8220;<span class="il">Workato</span>’s automation is built on a foundation of industry leading iPaaS or integration. Integration or data is where the rubber meets the road and automation is how the <span class="il">work</span> gets done. We uniquely do both in one platform. A <span class="il">Workato</span> recipe is a single concept that handles both data and process level integrations. It is not a swiss army knife of integration and automation technologies under the cover.&#8221; The idea is that this approach works both for non-technical business teams as well as IT teams.</p>
<p>The company says it has some 7,000 businesses as customers, with the list featuring a heavy dose of tech companies as well as non-tech ones. It includes Atlassian, AT&amp;T, Adobe, Autodesk, Box, Stitch Fix, Gitlab, NYU, Nokia, Lucid Motors, Broadcom and Toast.</p>
<p>I should note that 7,000 customers was the same number Workato quoted in January, although the company&#8217;s annual recurring revenues have more than doubled in the last year, and it seems to have gotten deeper engagement with its customers, with users growing to 100,000 from 70,000 in January. Its biggest verticals currently are Technology, Financial services, Retail, Logistics &amp; Transportation, and Healthcare, said Tella.</p>
<p>One of the big trends, of course, in enterprise IT in the last two years has been &#8220;digital transformation&#8221; and specifically modernizing systems to cope with the fact that we are working differently now because of Covid-19, and consumers are demanding different things from the organizations they engage with. That&#8217;s been a big reason that investors are interested in the company.</p>
<p>“The events of the past 10 months have made operational excellence more critical than ever, and businesses understand that enterprise automation is a cornerstone to achieving the heightened agility, innovation and performance they need to succeed in any environment,” said Pauline Yang, partner, Altimeter Capital, in a statement. &#8220;The market for automation products will only continue to expand, and we believe that Workato has the best technology, partnerships and leadership team in place to capitalize on this exciting opportunity.”</p>
<p>Tella notes that Workato&#8217;s approach has been one of the more uniquely scalable, due to how it has been built.</p>
<p>&#8220;The scale and scope of sales, marketing, finance, HR, customer and other operations today mean 10,000 salespeople in 10,000 companies are not reinventing the same wheel,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is untenable, unproductive and results won’t be great.&#8221; He notes that <span class="il">Workato</span>’s recipe builder is AI-powered &#8220;so it recommends next steps and helps you build the right recipes by default.&#8221;</p>
<p>He describes the 500,000 community-created recipes as &#8220;a Github for automation and operations&#8221; for users to find, one automation and adapt it to their own companies and use cases. &#8220;This is built on <span class="il">Workato-</span>patented cloning technology that makes it possible to reuse recipes created in a different company with apps like Salesforce that are customized very differently than your own. A template model does not <span class="il">work</span> for reuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s big opportunity in the coming years will be to tap into a global demand for more automation tools. Workato plans to add a new data center in the Asia Pacific region to complement the business its already in there; and it will be bringing on more firepower also in the EMEA region, alongside more growth in the U.S.</p>
<p>Battery is a repeat backer of the company, giving it perspective and an insider&#8217;s view of how Workato has grown.</p>
<p>“Since leading Workato’s Series B in 2018, we’ve been excited to see the steady growth of usage among Workato’s customers—many of them leaders in their respective industries—and Workato’s solidifying position as a leader in the automation market, one of the fastest-growing sectors in technology,” said Neeraj Agrawal, a general partner at Battery Ventures, in a statement. “We’ve had a front-row seat to watch Workato truly transform many of its customers’ businesses, which is one reason why we and other existing investors in the company are excited to lead this new funding round.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company saw an 18-month time period of rapid growth, which included seeing from 10 times to 30 times growth across all the metrics Daily tracks.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’ve all embraced video calls, whether it is with our work colleague or our physician, but for developers, it remains a challenge to build both real-time audio and video features into products.</p>
<p>That’s where <a href="http://www.daily.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daily</a> comes in. The company provides APIs so developers can add those features into products or websites using just two lines of code. Use cases include video calls, audio-only apps, webinars, live classes, interactive collaboration, e-commerce, customer support, IoT and robotics.</p>
<p>Since being founded in 2015, the company has amassed a customer list that includes AppFolio, HotDoc, Pitch, Kumospace and Teamflow, and its customers report seeing up to 80% fewer video call errors after using Daily, Kwindla Hultman Kramer, co-founder and CEO of Daily, told TechCrunch via email.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231380" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Following an 18-month time period of rapid growth, which included seeing from 10 times to 30 times increase in all the metrics the company tracks &#8212; overall traffic volume, freemium sign-ups, paid usage and the number of customers scaling applications on top of the platform &#8212; Daily today announced $40 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>“The most interesting trend we’re seeing is that new use cases for video and audio are showing up every week,” Hultman Kramer said. “We’ve seen the growth of events platforms, new social/spatial video environments, live commerce, live classes, fitness and workout applications, and a huge amount of experimentation in education and tutoring, just to name a few.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Daily.co raises $4.6M video chat API service&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/daily-co-raises-4-6m-video-chat-api-service/embed/#?secret=EQBych0uIe" data-secret="EQBych0uIe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Renegade Partners led the round, which included new investors Heritage Group, Cendana Capital and Sean Rose, and participation from existing investors including Lachy Groom, Tiger Global, Freestyle Ventures, Slack Fund, Root VC, Moxxie, Haystack Ventures, Todd &amp; Rahul’s Angel Fund, David Eckstein and Aston Motes.</p>
<p>The latest round brings total funding to over $60 million, which includes a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/daily-co-raises-4-6m-video-chat-api-service/">$4.6 million round raised</a> in May 2020. The company is not sharing its valuation, but Hultman Kramer revealed that valuation stepped up three times with each of the three funding rounds the company raised in the last 18 months.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/video-conferencing-market-100293" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global video conferencing market</a> was valued at $5.8 billion in 2020 and is expected to be $6.28 billion by the end of this year, then double in seven years. Healthcare is one of the areas Daily, which is HIPAA-compliant, is seeing accelerated growth in as startups introduce new apps and tools so that patients can more easily access things like primary care, mental health services and standard prescriptions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Equally, we’re seeing really interesting things happening with large, traditional healthcare organizations and with government leadership,” Hultman Kramer added. “HIPAA legislation in the U.S. pushed providers to get better at both patient privacy and data interoperability, and that’s bearing fruit. Medicare and other federal programs now reimburse for telehealth services on a par with reimbursement for in-person visits, while many rural health networks are investing heavily in telehealth tools to extend high-quality care to more people than ever before.”</p>
<p>Gearing up to meet future demand, Hultman Kramer intends to use the new funding to build Daily’s team and expand its global infrastructure. The company recently hired Varun Singh as chief product technology officer and Sarah Milstein as vice president of engineering.</p>
<p>“Real-time video is a specialized area,” he said. We think we have an unfairly good engineering team from a competitive perspective. Raising another round of funding helps us extend that lead and be able to push our infrastructure out closer to the edge of the network, everywhere that our customers see traffic.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231384" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231384" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2231384 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Hero-Image.png" alt="Daily, video calls" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Hero-Image.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Hero-Image.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Hero-Image.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Hero-Image.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Hero-Image.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Hero-Image.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Hero-Image.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2231384" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Daily</p></div></p>
<p>As part of the investment, Roseanne Wincek, co-founder and managing director of Renegade Partners, and Lee Edwards, partner at Root Ventures, joined Daily’s board.</p>
<p>Hultman Kramer says the company did not intend to raise a round in 2021 — it had “plenty of runway and no immediate need for new capital.” However, when investor Jenny Lefcourt introduced the company to Wincek, Hultman Kramer said the company didn’t want to miss the opportunity to bring her onto Daily’s board. Same with Edwards, who introduced Daily to Lachy Groom, which led to Lachy leading Daily’s Series A.</p>
<p>Wincek said via email that Renegade invests in companies that have found product market fit and are ready to scale. She feels the pandemic showed that lowest-latency, high-performance video “is an incredible way to interact,” but that experience is locked in standalone apps that offer video communication and little else.</p>
<p>Daily is bringing innovation, creativity and rich experiences through its API tools that were created with developers in mind and are easy to use and build on, while also being secure.</p>
<p>“In the future, video calls will not look like Zoom, and they will be powered by Daily,” she added. “Daily has real platform potential — it&#8217;s a great product with stellar engineering culture, coupled with Kwin&#8217;s experience building video for the enterprise. Video has become ubiquitous in the way we work, live and interact online, and Daily is going to create a sea-change in the way we use video on the internet.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Moov, a data-fueled <a href="https://www.moov.co/">marketplace for used manufacturing equipment</a>, has closed a $41 million Series A funding round led by Tiger Global. Investors joining the round include public semiconductor investor Gavin Baker of Atreides Management, Valor Equity Partners, Avenir Growth Fund, and existing investors.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based company’s co-founders, Steven Zhou and Maxam Yeung, came up with the idea for Moov around a decade ago. The two say that they recognized that companies in the industry, such as Qualcomm and Samsung, spend billions of dollars a year purchasing manufacturing equipment only for it to get scrapped or forgotten in an offsite warehouse in a few years despite being usable for decades.</p>
<p>“We identified an opportunity that existed based on how long the equipment is being used versus how long it’s usable for,” Moov CEO Steven Zhou told TechCrunch in an interview. “There was a billion-dollar opportunity to repurpose this equipment. That’s where the idea of Moov came about. It’s essentially leveraging data and technology automation algorithms to more effectively match unused equipment and find new homes for it all over the world.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231333" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>One of Moov&#8217;s use cases is to help manufacturing companies recoup capital that would have otherwise been lost. On the buyer side, Moov aims to help small businesses and universities around the world that don&#8217;t have the budget or network to acquire equipment to further their innovation.</p>
<p>The platform’s software matches equipment listed by sellers to companies that can use it by automatically serving them those listings. Buyers can also manually search through a mass list of equipment. Along with a real-time marketplace, Moov also features additional services such as logistics, refurbishment, insurance, and asset management software.</p>
<p>As for the new funding, Moov plans to use it to expand its domestic presence into other semiconductor hubs such as Austin and New York. It also plans to expand its global presence in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and Europe. The company will also hire executives, invest in research and development, and also continue to strategically purchase more inventory. Moov also plans to examine acquisition strategies with other industry players that could be plugged into its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Moov’s Series A funding round comes in the midst of the ongoing global chip shortage, as many industries have slowed production because manufacturers are unable to obtain the required equipment. Zhou says that Moov is working to help alleviate local shortages and that the company is able to reduce the lead time for companies to purchase equipment from months, down to days or hours.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s data suggests that the value of used equipment has more than doubled over the past year, and these numbers are expected to continue to grow, doubling to around $200 billion per year within the next six to eight years. With close to $1.5 billion in active and available listings on its platform, Moov plans to play a role in shifting the global equipment purchasing mindset.</p>
<p>Zhou says the company is also proud to have built a marketplace that helps to reduce electronic waste globally. “As we grow, we’re really excited to play an increasing role in helping the reduction of the carbon footprint of global manufacturing and also to help alleviate the global chip shortage,” he said.</p>

Siniscalco&#8217;s new job title [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Emergence, a storied venture capital firm known for its enterprise bets in Salesforce and Zoom, announced today that it has promoted Carlotta “Lotti” Siniscalco from principal to partner. The appointment marks Emergence’s first female partner in its 18-year history, and comes months <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/emergence-known-for-its-enterprise-bets-just-rounded-up-nearly-1-billion-across-two-new-funds/">after the firm closed two funds totaling $1 billion.</a></p>
<p>Siniscalco&#8217;s new job title comes without precedent. Emergence has historically struggled on the diversity of its partnership: all five partners within Emergence&#8217;s new funds are male. Emergence doesn&#8217;t hire a partner level and prefers to build up investors over time, a policy that appears to have delayed some of its diversity efforts. Kevin Spain, Emergence Capital GP, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/05/05/vc-firm-emergence-raises-950-million-across-two-new-funds-to-find-the-next-zoom/?sh=74e92a6838fe">hinted to Forbes in May</a> that Lotti will join the partner ranks &#8220;in the next few years.&#8221; Months later, it looks like that timeline has been accelerated. Along with Siniscalco&#8217;s move, the firm promoted Yaz, a Palestinian-American, to senior associate.</p>
<p>The change is showing up in data, too. Recent Pitchbook data says that female-founded companies raised $40.4 billion across 2,661 deals through the first three quarters of 2021, almost doubling 2019’s total of $23.7 billion and over 10 times 2011’s total of $3.6 billion. The growth is partially due to a rise of diversity within partnerships. Last year, Terri Burns became GV’s youngest partner <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/new-gv-partner-terri-burns-has-a-simple-investment-thesis-gen-z/">and the first Black woman to hold the role.</a> This year, Female Founders Fund <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/female-founder-fund-closes-third-fund-with-57m-for-female-bipoc-founders/">closed its third fund with $57 million</a>; Forerunner, led by Kirsten Green, <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/why-kirsten-green-might-not-invest">closed a growth-stage fund</a>; and Variant, with Li Jin joining as a general partner, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/variant-debuts-a-new-110m-fund-for-crypto-startups-announces-li-jin-has-joined-as-a-general-partner/">closed a $110 million fund</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231769" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Siniscalco, who was born and raised in Milan, moved to the United States when she was seventeen. She plunged into the competitive undergraduate life at University of Pennsylvania and soon realized what she had been missing in Italy, as “a country that thrives on tradition more than innovation.”</p>
<p>“I was always driven by what the future looks like more than what our history looks like,” Siniscalco said. Early on in college, she was introduced to the world of venture and cold emailed between 50 and 60 people on an Italians in VC list. Only two firms responded, and at the age of 19, she joined a small, local venture fund that let her cut her teeth in early-stage support and founder services.</p>

<p>After a stint in venture, she spent time in investment banking, private equity, and business operations within a fast-growth startup before turning to venture with Ribbit Capital and Kauffman Fellows. In 2018, when she joined Emergence as a senior associate, she soon rose to principal, and now, a year later, is a partner.</p>
<p>Alongside enterprise SaaS, Siniscalco is focused on fintech, a sector that hybridizes her interest in the future and her respect for tradition. “Something that is very true to my core is the idea of improving and changing something that feels old in order to create a better experience for everyone involved,” she said. The investor explained how at 23, when she was a financial analyst at Goldman Sachs, she consistently kept getting rejected for credit cards (even though she had a very stable income). The difficulty of securing a card as a non-US citizen planted a seed in her mind on the importance of rebuilding systems for people like her.</p>
<p>“And that was before the initial wave of companies that were really disrupting the traditional banks,” she said.</p>
<p>One of Siniscalco’s first investments was Talent Hack, which announced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/talent-hack-raises-17-million-led-by-emergence-to-power-the-fitness-creator-economy/">$17 million Series A this week</a>. While this was the first female partner-led deal that Emergence has made public, the raise was game changing for another reason: led by Alexandra Bonetti, Talent Hack is the first Latina female-led startup in the Emergence Portfolio.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When we think of exiting via acquisition, it&#8217;s easy to think that if it&#8217;s a reasonable deal that it&#8217;s going to be an easy decision to say yes, but for three founders we spoke to at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/">TC Sessions: SaaS</a> recently, It was anything but. Founders have to balance many different decision points and deciding whether to sign on the dotted line is going to come with some anxiety and doubt before reaching a conclusion.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			It wasn&#8217;t an easy decision. Even though, at $3.7 billion, everyone thought it should probably be a no-brainer; it wasn&#8217;t.							<cite>Jyoti Bansal</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The panel, which looked at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/learn-what-happens-after-you-sell-your-startup-at-tc-sessions-saas-on-wednesday/">what happens after you get acquired</a>, included: Jyoti Bansal, current founder and CEO at Harness, who sold his previous startup AppDynamics<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/cisco-snaps-up-appdynamics-for-3-7b-right-before-its-ipo/"> to Cisco for $3.7 billion</a> in 2017, the week he was going to IPO; Monica Sarbu, who is currently founder and CEO at Xata, who sold her startup<a href="https://www.elastic.co/about/press/elastic-acquires-packetbeat"> Packetbeat to Elastic</a> in 2015 just two years after launching the company, and finally Nick Mehta, who is currently co-founder and CEO at Gainsight, who sold his email archiving startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/16/symantec-buys-cloud-based-email-archiving-company-liveoffice-for-115m/">LiveOffice to Symantec</a> in 2011 for $115 million.</p>
<p>As you can see there was life with new startups after the sale for each of these founders, all of whom founded new companies after they left, but first they had to go through the sale process and decide to sell or not. Each founder took a slightly different path.</p>
<h2>The sales process</h2>
<p>Bansal was ready to take his company public in 2017 and was content to do just that when Cisco came knocking while the company was doing its roadshow. He rejected two initial offers, but when the company sweetened the pot enough, he simply couldn&#8217;t say no.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When hundreds of thousands of people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) fled their homes after the <a href="https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eruption</a> of the <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/briefing/2021/5/60acb0434/unhcr-rushing-help-displaced-volcano-eruption-dr-congo.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mount Nyiragongo volcano</a> on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/23/999586355/congos-mount-nyiragongo-volcano-erupts-sending-lava-for-miles-but-sparing-a-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 22</a>, a blogger and a fledgling restaurant worker teamed up in the city of Goma and used bitcoin to help displaced families.</p>
<p><a href="https://chainglob.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chainglob</a> crypto news founder Gloire Wanzavalere went to the makeshift refugee camp that sprang up nearly overnight, offering to give away bitcoin to displaced families.</p>
<p>He recruited by word-of-mouth, asking people if they knew someone who lost their home. But he quickly found that most of the families had already traded their phones for food. They also left most of their belongings behind, so didn’t have the paperwork needed to open new bank accounts or acquire new devices.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231735" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“These people lost everything. I understood it was rational for them to sell what they had left in order to buy food,” Wanzavalere said. “So we bought phones for eight people&#8230;12 people benefited from our initiative, four among them already had their own smartphones.”</p>
<p>Wanzavalere was inspired by online news of the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bitcoin-beach-tourists-residents-hail-el-salvadors-adoption-cryptocurrency-2021-09-07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bitcoin Beach project</a> in El Salvador, which he said proved poor people can still use bitcoin despite the technical challenges and volatility.</p>
<p>“Coming to their aid with bitcoin was a more powerful act than any marketing campaign could be. That’s when we told ourselves, OK, we’re going to do this in Congo,” the crypto-focused blogger said.</p>
<p>They started with a small, circular workflow. Wanzavalere’s mother owns a small shop in town that sells basic hygiene supplies and nonperishable goods. She agreed to accept bitcoin using her mobile phone, relying on apps like <a href="https://www.walletofsatoshi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wallet of Satoshi</a> and <a href="https://phoenix.acinq.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phoenix Wallet</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Because she is very excited about the idea of helping people with bitcoin, she is considering the option of bringing a few essential goods closer to the refugees, so they can buy what they need without going too far into town. But it’s a complex question in part because of security concerns,” Wanzavalere said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Juvin Kombi, who works at <a href="https://twitter.com/jikofoodr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jikofood Restaurant</a>, was busy this past summer setting up his company’s first <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/gentle-introduction-to-lightning-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lightning Network</a> node. This allowed the restaurant to accept bitcoin payments without high transaction fees or long confirmation times. By September they were up and running, using the restaurant’s PC and sometimes their own personal smartphones when needed. Their preferred mobile wallet apps are <a href="https://muun.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muun Wallet</a> and <a href="http://bluewallet.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Wallet</a>.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2231750,2231749,2231748,2231747,2231746"]</p>
<p>“The learning process was very long, but the minimum research we have done has helped us understand bitcoin without any support,” Kombi said. “We realized that it was easy to set up. A simple wallet and an internet connection are sufficient. In addition, we are studying the possibility of setting up <a href="https://btcpayserver.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTCPay Server</a> in the near future.”</p>
<p>So far just a few of the restaurant’s clients use bitcoin, Kombi added, including the displaced people Wanzavalere hired. However, they hope that as more people in the community learn about bitcoin that this payment option will set the small restaurant apart from local competition. The restaurant often hosts educational workshops for customers who want to learn more about using bitcoin.</p>
<p>Wanzavalere said he can relate to Kombi’s statement that bitcoin education takes a long time. Wanzavalere first discovered bitcoin after falling prey to an online scam in 2017. That inspired him to do more research into digital assets, and eventually start his own local crypto news blog. Hiring locally and paying in bitcoin makes sense as an altruistic marketing strategy.</p>
<p>“The Congolese population is suffering greatly; it never had any stable currency except the U.S. dollar,” Wanzavalere said. “I am not a journalist. However, I started to write about bitcoin issues in Africa because there was a lack of information on the subject in French.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, he fundraised for this grassroots program by inviting international bitcoin fans to participate in a “<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/20/im-freaking-out-how-it-feels-to-hold-the-bitcoin-lightning-torch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lightning Torch</a>.” First, he tweeted that anyone could join the torch, a chain of Lightning Network transactions created by strangers sharing an invoice and sending small amounts of bitcoin to pay it forward to the next invoice holder, like passing a baton in a relay race. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/02/05/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-becomes-latest-to-take-bitcoins-lightning-torch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among the participants</a>.</p>
<p>“In total, 18 people contributed. Then the entirety of the funds were sent to me to be distributed to the beneficiaries,” Wanzavalere said. “In less than three hours, all the beneficiaries mastered it, learning how to receive and send money using a bitcoin wallet, which shows that in practice the Lightning Network isn’t that complicated to use.”</p>
<p>Next, Wanzavalere added, he plans to teach beneficiaries how to run a node, like Jikofood Restaurant does, in case they want to help expand the local bitcoin economy to include more small businesses that fully control their own funds. He may also hire some of the beneficiaries to work for his crypto blog.</p>
<p>“We plan to raise more money to help an even larger part of the suffering population,” Wanzavalere concluded. “The money collected by the torch event was meant to be distributed without anything in return. However, this is a long-term idea. Paying the refugees in bitcoin for freelance work could be a source of more community engagement.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google&#8217;s challenge to a 2017 EU antitrust finding against its shopping comparison service (Google Shopping) has been largely dismissed by the General Court of the European Union.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an important win for the Commission&#8217;s antitrust division, which &#8212; in recent years &#8212; has brought a string of enforcements against big tech, including multiple decisions against Google. But <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/apple-and-ireland-win-appeal-against-the-european-commissions-15-billion-tax-ruling/">this summer lost a major case against Apple back taxes</a>.</p>
<p>Today the General Court of the EU has upheld the €2.42BN penalty imposed on Google and its parent company Alphabet over four years ago for competition abuses related to Google Shopping, a product comparison search service.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231979" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether Google will seek to pursue further appeals vis-a-vis Google Shopping. A spokesperson declined to comment when asked.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/google-fined-e2-42bn-for-eu-antitrust-violations-over-shopping-searches/">Back in 2017</a> the Commission found that Google had abused its dominance in search by giving prominent placement to its eponymous shopping comparison service &#8212; while simultaneously demoting rivals in organic search results.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hzKtQuz4AC"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/google-fined-e2-42bn-for-eu-antitrust-violations-over-shopping-searches/">Google fined $2.7BN for EU antitrust violations over shopping searches</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google fined $2.7BN for EU antitrust violations over shopping searches&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/google-fined-e2-42bn-for-eu-antitrust-violations-over-shopping-searches/embed/#?secret=hzKtQuz4AC" data-secret="hzKtQuz4AC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Google and its parent entity Alphabet appealed the decision but the General Court has dismissed most of their claims &#8212; agreeing that the sanctioned actions were anti-competitive and that Google had favored its own comparison shopping service over competing services rather than serving a better result.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a press release on the judgement, the Court also calls out another problematic tactic, writing: &#8220;While Google did subsequently enable competing comparison shopping services to enhance the quality of the display of their results by appearing in its ‘boxes’ in return for payment, the General Court notes that that service depended on the comparison shopping services changing their business model and ceasing to be Google’s direct competitors, becoming its customers instead.&#8221;</p>
<p>In additional findings, the Court agreed there were harmful effects for Google&#8217;s competitors of its anti-competitive behavior. And it rejected an argument by Google &#8212; which had sought to claim that competition for comparison shopping services remains strong on account of the presence of merchant platforms on that market &#8212; agreeing with the Commission’s assessment that those platforms are not on the same market.</p>
<p>In one bright spot for Google, the Court found that the Commission did not establish that the tech giant&#8217;s conduct had had (even potential) anticompetitive effects on the market for general search services. So it annulled the finding of an infringement in respect of that market alone.</p>
<p>But, again, it upheld the Commission&#8217;s analysis of the market for specialised search services for comparison shopping (and Google&#8217;s anti-competitive activity within it).</p>
<p>The Court also rejected Google&#8217;s claim that its conduct was objectively justified because it &#8216;improved the quality of its search service&#8217;.</p>
<p>And it dismissed another claim by Google of technical constraints preventing it from providing equal treatment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google has not demonstrated efficiency gains linked to that practice that would counteract its negative effects on competition,&#8221; it added in the press release.</p>
<p>In upholding the level of financial penalty imposed by the Commission, the Court noted that the portion of the decision it annulled had no impact on the amount of the fine (&#8220;since the Commission did not take the value of sales on that market into consideration in order to determine the basic amount of the fine&#8221;); and emphasized what is described as the &#8220;particularly serious nature of the infringement&#8221; &#8212; also taking into account the fact the conduct was intentional, rather than negligent.</p>
<p>The Commission said the judgement &#8220;delivers the clear message that Google&#8217;s conduct was unlawful and it provides the necessary legal clarity for the market&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Comparison shopping delivers an important service to consumers, at a time when ecommerce has become more and more important for retailers and consumers. As digital services have become omnipresent in our society nowadays, consumers should be able to rely on them in order to make informed and unbiased choices,&#8221; the Commission said in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/mex_21_5902">statement</a>.</p>
<p>It added that it will continue to use &#8220;all tools at its disposal to address the role of big digital platforms on which businesses and users depend to, respectively, access end users and access digital services&#8221; &#8212; pointing to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">Digital Markets Act regulatory proposal</a>, that&#8217;s currently being debated by the European Parliament and Council, and which it said aims to ensure &#8220;fairness and contestability&#8221;.</p>
<p>Responding to the ruling in its own statement, a Google spokesperson sought to downplay any significance, writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Shopping ads have always helped people find the products they are looking for quickly and easily, and helped merchants to reach potential customers. This judgement relates to a very specific set of facts and while we will review it closely, we <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/ads/changes-to-google-shopping-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.blog.google/products/ads/changes-to-google-shopping-in-europe/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1636632364807000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEt1sjW0d1OsX_oFaAxhD6MW4CUjw">made changes</a> back in 2017 to comply with the European Commission&#8217;s decision. Our approach has worked <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/supporting-retail-through-comparison-shopping-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/supporting-retail-through-comparison-shopping-services/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1636632364807000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHg2_OWQEXOse_RW--AzBHApAX4wA">successfully</a> for more than three years, generating billions of clicks for more than 700 comparison shopping services.”</p></blockquote>
<p>However one rival to Google in the local search space &#8212; Yelp &#8212; seized on the judgement, saying it establishes a framework for &#8220;the swift assessment of the illegality of this type of conduct in other verticals&#8221;, and calling on the Commission to take action against Google over local search.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="il">Yelp</span> welcomes today’s ruling of the European General Court, which has found Google guilty of abusing its dominance in general search to extinguish competitors in vertical search services without any efficiency justification,&#8221; said Luther Lowe, SVP, public policy, in a statement. &#8220;While the decision focuses on comparison shopping, it establishes a framework for the swift assessment of the illegality of this type of conduct in other verticals, namely local search. The local search market has not yet tipped, and European consumers conduct local searches on Google billions of times per week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather than accept a Pyrrhic victory, the European Commission must now take this favorable precedent and prosecute Google for its parallel abuses in the local search market and allow services like <span class="il">Yelp</span> to compete on the merits,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;It may be hard to remember now, but Google and its Big Tech ilk were not always this unpopular. In 2015, Vice-President Vestager exhibited incredible courage by showing the world that Google&#8217;s abuses were not acceptable. She should be commended for this courage.</p>
<p>&#8220;But history&#8217;s verdict on this period will be based on whether this odyssey ultimately produced a tangible impact for European consumers, which is why it is vital that these tools be utilized in markets where competition remains salvageable.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, Google has a pipeline of appeals against others EU antitrust findings (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/">Android</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/20/google-fined-1-49bn-in-europe-for-antitrust-violations-in-search-ad-brokering/">AdSense</a>), as well as an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-is-now-investigating-googles-adtech-over-antitrust-concerns/">open EU investigation of its adtech</a> &#8212; not to mention a raft of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/google-justice-department-antitrust-trial-date/">antitrust cases</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/google-state-lawsuit-android-attorneys-general/">on home soil</a>.</p>
<p>So its lawyers will be kept very busy regardless of the ramifications of today&#8217;s loss.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[General Partner Claire Chang’s plan is to deploy capital into 30 new investments and keep some back for follow-on investments.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">IgniteXL Ventures, a fund founded by general partner Claire Chang, closed on its first fund of $10 million aimed at backing diverse early-stage founders in the beauty and wellness industry.</p>
<p>Chang is an angel investor who moved to the U.S. from Seoul when she was a child and started a global accelerator in 2015. Since then, she has formed a connection to the K-beauty industry and worked with more than 200 early-stage startups.</p>
<p>It was while working with the accelerator that she noticed a gap in funding between angel and seed, observing the frustration female founders felt with the lack of female VCs and with male investors who were not experienced in investing in the beauty and wellness industry. Chang formed igniteXL in 2018 and started fundraising over a year ago.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231412" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2231417" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231417" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2231417" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Claire-Chang-Headshot.jpeg" alt="Claire Chang, ignitexl Ventures" width="500" height="500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Claire-Chang-Headshot.jpeg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Claire-Chang-Headshot.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Claire-Chang-Headshot.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Claire-Chang-Headshot.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Claire-Chang-Headshot.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Claire-Chang-Headshot.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Claire-Chang-Headshot.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Claire-Chang-Headshot.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2231417" class="wp-caption-text">Claire Chang, general partner at igniteXL Ventures. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> igniteXL Ventures</p></div></p>
<p>“This is a $5 trillion market opportunity that is hugely overlooked,” she told TechCrunch. “Beauty and wellness is seen as a women&#8217;s segment, but what is happening with the cultural transformation being applied to every industry, this segment is ripe for that.”</p>
<p>The fund’s first close was in February 2020, but she had to stop when the global pandemic hit, and start deploying the capital into the portfolio.</p>
<p>She picked up fundraising again earlier this year and now has 21 companies in the portfolio, including livestream platform BuyWith, sexual wellness brand Dame and skincare brand Good Light. Chang’s plan is to deploy capital into 30 new investments and keep some back for follow-on investments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“When I set out to raise funds, I had no idea what to do — it was my personality to figure it out along the way,” she said. “I figured out LPs have set a criteria, and I didn’t fit into that: I don’t come from an investment banking background and don’t look like a typical VC. If anything, I am coming from a far different spectrum and it was a challenge, but it forced me to differentiate and bring something different.”</p>
<p>Chang aims to target funding dollars into more diverse founders, where investments historically go to men over 95% of the time and into just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/female-founders-are-making-a-buzzing-venture-backed-comeback/">2% of female-founded companies</a>, though she says that number is increasing a bit.</p>
<p>She says she is bringing a unique lens, viewpoint and network to finding companies, especially those that are like she described herself — not a typical VC-backed company.</p>
<p>“Women care for themselves and also buy for all of their family members, so we see many more VC-backed founders coming into this space and more deal flow,”  Chang added. “The fact is that an opportunity lies in this overlooked market. Statistics show that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-05/diverse-startups-raise-more-cash-and-return-more-to-investors#:~:text=Companies%20with%20diverse%20founders%20ultimately,the%20Kauffman%20Fellows%20Research%20Center." target="_blank" rel="noopener">diverse teams outperform by 30%</a>, and for me to raise my second fund, this first fund has to be successful, and more diverse teams are going to help me do that.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, igniteXL’s fund attracted a global profile of prominent VCs and strategic LPs, including Han Kim of Altos Ventures Management, Perry Ha of Draper Athena, Allen Miner of SunBridge Group and the world’s leading cosmetics ODM, Cosmax.</p>
<p>Kim, whose fund invested in Roblox, Coupang, Delivery Hero and Krafton, said via email that “the VC world needs more people like Claire. She empathizes with entrepreneurs and takes on their problems as if they were her own. She really cares.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a world where we count every step and measure every heartbeat, hopping on the scale once per week to keep half an eye on what your body is doing just won&#8217;t do. Even if you stand around on the glass oracle of mass a few times per day, the truth is that your body weight is a trailing indicator &#8212; it shows what has already happened, rather than what&#8217;s about to. One leading indicator is your blood sugar level &#8212; and weight-loss startup <a href="https://www.signos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Signos</a> is betting that you&#8217;re curious enough about the difference between our respective metabolisms to sign up for real-time glucose monitoring and alerts to keep you in shape. It turns out that GV believes that, too, to the tune of leading the company&#8217;s $13 million Series A round.</p>
<p>The basic science is this: If I eat a bowl of oatmeal, my blood sugar is going to spike. If I go for a walk or a run when it does, the glucose level in my blood will go down, which nips weight gain in the bud. My body might react differently to different kinds of foods on different days, at different times, and depending on a whole raft of unpredictable features about my body, what I eat, and how I&#8217;m doing that day. Crucially, it&#8217;s no good to use my body as an example; yours is going to be different. Signos believes that by continuously measuring, you can get the data you need to make healthier &#8212; or at least better informed &#8212; choices about what you&#8217;re putting in your body, and how often you shift your carcass around to shake off some of that weight again.</p>
<p>The company today revealed that it has raised a total of $17 million in funding, including a $4 million seed funding led by Courtside Ventures, 1984 Ventures and Tau Ventures back in January. In the current round, Signos raised a $13 million Series A led by GV.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228167" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s founder told me he has a pretty close personal connection with the challenge of weight loss, and outlines how he got started.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a fairly overweight/obese kid growing up, and I was like that up into my early teen years. I got into sports, lost weight, and actually became decently athletic. I eventually went to college to play hockey and ended up having a couple offers to play in the NHL,&#8221; said Sharam Fouladgar-Mercer, CEO of Signos. After his brush with top-tier sports, his body changed again, and he gained a lot of weight. &#8220;A<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> few years ago, I was pretty overweight again. I started looking for some guidance. The standard advice is 2,500 calories per day for an adult male, but we all have friends that eat 4,000 or 5,000 calories and they never put on a pound. And then there&#8217;s those who eat 1,500 calories and they never lose weight. A</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> member of my family was diagnosed as diabetic and I saw his continuous glucose monitor (CGM). He was explaining how it worked, and I found myself wishing we could take the CGM and figure out how the metabolism actually interjects itself with weight loss.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Long story short, Fouladgar-Mercer founded a company and started building.</p>
<p>&#8220;We provide visibility into every body&#8217;s unique metabolic needs. Before, we were stuck with calorie reduction or counting macros or removing carbs altogether; now, we can work with people to turn diets that don’t work into plans that do,” said Fouladgar-Mercer, &#8220;We help them discover this in a matter of days or weeks and refine it over time for best weight management and overall health. Elite athletes or conscientious dieters often take an extraordinary amount of trial and error to come to the same conclusion we are able to deliver in a fraction of the time.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Signos platform will help develop personalized answers to basic questions like what to eat, when to eat and what exercises help encourage weight loss. At the heart of the system is <a href="https://www.dexcom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dexcom</a>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.dexcom.com/g6/features-and-benefits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G6 continuous glucose monitoring</a> devices, which are typically used for diabetes patients. Dexcom became an investor in Signos&#8217; most recent investment round as well, as a strategic investor.</p>
<p>On top of the hardware component, which measures the glucose levels in the user&#8217;s blood every few minutes, Signos created an AI-enhanced app to offer real-time data and recommendations designed to drive sustained weight loss. At the beginning of their Signos experience, users log what they eat, enabling the Signos platform to learn their body&#8217;s reaction to specific foods. Once calibrated, Signos uses that data to provide personalized nutrition suggestions, including which foods are best for each user, when to eat and when to exercise to bring glucose levels back within their optimal weight loss range.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wear the device for 10 days, full-time. You shower, go for a run, you sleep and the device keeps measuring. At the end of the period, it beeps to let you know that it&#8217;s time to peel it off and replace it with a new one,&#8221; explains Fouladgar-Mercer, and admits that, due to the nature of the device, it isn&#8217;t exactly the greenest tech we&#8217;ve seen in a while &#8212; it isn&#8217;t recyclable or reusable. &#8220;It&#8217;s a medical device, so it needs to be disposed of.&#8221;</p>
<p>To wear a continuous blood measuring device, you can&#8217;t just pop to your local pharmacy to let the tiny electronic vampires loose on your innards; a doctor needs to prescribe one of the devices for you.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the United States, you need a doctor&#8217;s prescription to get a CGM, and then you need a pharmacy to fulfill that order, as well. We put all those operations behind the scenes; you come to the site, and we walk you through the whole process,&#8221; says Fouladgar-Mercer. &#8220;And then when that&#8217;s done, it goes to the pharmacy licensed in the appropriate state and they send you the box that has everything in it. In addition, you&#8217;ll need our software, which is available to download.&#8221;</p>
<p>The magic in the system is in the near-real-time monitoring and alert system; it doesn&#8217;t help to know that your blood sugar spiked at 1:35 PM when you check your phone before bed at night. The right time to take action, the company claims, is as the glucose level is on the upswing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having this immediate continuous feedback loop over a longer period of time yields better results for our members to achieve the sort of health outcomes that they&#8217;re trying to achieve,&#8221; claims Fouladgar-Mercer.</p>
<p>The company says it has more than 100,000 potential customers waiting for the product to become available, and it says that the new funding round means that the product will be available across the U.S. at some point in 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israeli startup <a href="https://trieye.tech/">TriEye</a> has raised $74 million to commercialize a type of sensing technology that can be used to help autonomous and driver-assistance systems to see better in adverse conditions.</p>
<p>The technology uses short-wave infrared (SWIR), which refers to a wavelength range that is outside the visible spectrum. While SWIR sensing is not new, it has mostly been restricted to the aerospace and defense industries due to its high cost. TriEye says it has made engineering breakthroughs that have driven down the cost enough to compete with regular cameras that can be found in a mobile phone or vehicle today, and to outperform other types of sensors on the market.</p>
<p>With these innovations, built on over a decade of research pioneered by CTO Uriel Levy during his tenure at Hebrew University, TriEye is ready to bring SWIR tech to the mass market.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231346" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to CEO Avi Bakal, SWIR brings an additional layer of information to existing vision systems by letting people see “beyond the visible.”</p>
<p>“Sensing is everywhere,” Bakal said. “In any industry, it&#8217;s a vital part of the gathering and analysis process. As of today, the vision system market lacks necessary and vital data that can impact performance and decision-making all over.”</p>

<p>Using SWIR and a proprietary illumination source also developed by TriEye, the company has built a sensor it calls sedar (spectrum enhanced detection and ranging). According to the company, sedar provides all imaging and depth information required for advanced driver assistance and autonomous systems &#8212; that means it could replace the conventional sensing stack that’s being used in advanced driver assistance and autonomous systems today, which is generally a combination of cameras, radar, and light detection and ranging radar (lidar).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One of the biggest advantages to TriEye’s tech is the cost savings relative to cameras and lidar, which Bakal said is key to “truly enable mass market adoption.”</p>
<p>“This is the goal,” he said. “We want to be all over, in the most simple car to the premium vehicle.”</p>
<p>TriEye’s SWIR sensor use a type of semiconductor called a CMOS, Bakal explained. The company is already working with major CMOS foundries to produce the sensor, in order to eventually scale up to millions of units per year. Bakal also said that TriEye is working with major OEMs on commercializing the sedar with specific model vehicles, but he did not provide further details.</p>
<p>The company doesn’t just have its eyes on the automotive industry, though that is its primary target market. TriEye also sees a role for SWIR sensing in industrial applications – such as food sorting or materials identification – as well as biometrics and surveillance.</p>
<p>TriEye’s big bet on SWIR has caught the attention of some major investors, including the investment arms of Intel and Porsche. Both companies also participated in TriEye’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/21/porsche-invests-in-low-visibility-sensor-startup-trieye/">Series A in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>This latest round of funding was led by M&amp;G Investments and Varana Capital, with the participation of Samsung Ventures, Tawazun SDF, Deep Insight, Allied Group, and Discount Capital as well as existing investors Intel Capital, Porsche Ventures, Marius Nacht and Grove Ventures. The round brings TriEye’s total funding to $96 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Seems there’s a fair bit of M&amp;A news on the smart home front these days. Following Ecobee’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/generator-maker-generac-set-to-buy-smart-thermostat-startup-ecobee/">acquisition by generator company Generac</a>, Level Home today announced that it’s acquiring Dwelo, news that arrives as the former also announces a Series C north of $100 million, led by Cox Communications and featuring Walmart. The round brings Dwelo’s funding up to $171 million to date. The acquisition is the company&#8217;s first.</p>
<p>Walmart was one of two key investors (along with Lennar) in the $71 million raise Level Home announced when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/smart-home-startup-level-home-emerges-from-stealth-with-71m-and-a-new-take-on-the-smart-lock/">it came out of stealth in 2019</a>. The company’s primary product at the time was Level Lock, a smart lock designed to look like a dumb lock with simple installation that works with HomeKit. The “first invisible smart lock” could then be unlocked with an iPhone or Apple Watch.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/smart-apartment-platform-dwelo-grabs-4-9m-in-funding/">wrote up Dwelo</a> two years earlier when the renter-focused smart home solution raised $4.9 million. Its offering is focused at apartment dwellers &#8212; or rather managers/owners of those apartments. Effectively, it lets them control a wide range of devices across different apartments in their building.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230210" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“By welcoming Dwelo to Level, we now can offer a seamless experience of thoughtfully designed hardware with a powerful SaaS platform, giving residents incredible command, convenience and new abilities to personalize their home,” Level CEO John Martin said in a release. “We founded Level with the vision of reimagining the smart home, and with Dwelo, we are introducing the next generation experience for property owners and residents.”</p>
<p>The brand merger looks likely to play out as a kind of vertical integration, likely bundling Level Locks as part of Dwelo&#8217;s landlord-focused product offering. Apartment buildings are a local step for a growing smart lock company in a crowded space. These sorts of devices have more traditionally been focused on home owners, who have to deal with less red tape upon installation.</p>
<p>In addition to offering up the amenities of the latest connected home products, building owners no doubt have their own reasons for wanting remote control over door locks.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[As food operators themselves, ZAK founders saw first-hand last year the toll it was taking on restaurants that needed to quickly reinvent themselves during the pandemic.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Restaurant operators typically focus on good food and customer service, but when customers stopped coming in during the pandemic, many had to learn how to reach them in new ways.</p>
<p>Childhood friends David Grandes and Andres Andrade, both originally from Ecuador, started Mimic in 2018 in Brazil as a dark kitchen-as-a-service, specializing in producing food at scale with online channel sales.</p>
<p>As food operators themselves, they saw firsthand last year the toll it was taking on restaurants that needed to quickly reinvent themselves during the pandemic, but weren’t sure how to start integrating digitalization into their businesses.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231392" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That’s when Grandes and Andrade decided to pivot their company to <a href="https://www.zak.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zak</a>, an all-in-one management tool that offers digital and financial capabilities to the food service market at zero fixed-cost. Its technology provides a 360-degree view of the restaurant and includes point-of-sale, back office tools and payment processing, both offline and online. The tools also integrate with aggregators like iFood, Uber Eats and Rappi.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231401" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231401" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2231401" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/David-Grandes-and-Andres-Andrade-ZAKs-co-founders-and-co-CEOs-1.jpg" alt="David Grandes and Andres Andrade, ZAK’s co-founders and co-CEOs, ZAK" width="1024" height="709" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/David-Grandes-and-Andres-Andrade-ZAKs-co-founders-and-co-CEOs-1.jpg 1741w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/David-Grandes-and-Andres-Andrade-ZAKs-co-founders-and-co-CEOs-1.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/David-Grandes-and-Andres-Andrade-ZAKs-co-founders-and-co-CEOs-1.jpg?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/David-Grandes-and-Andres-Andrade-ZAKs-co-founders-and-co-CEOs-1.jpg?resize=768,532 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/David-Grandes-and-Andres-Andrade-ZAKs-co-founders-and-co-CEOs-1.jpg?resize=680,471 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/David-Grandes-and-Andres-Andrade-ZAKs-co-founders-and-co-CEOs-1.jpg?resize=1536,1064 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/David-Grandes-and-Andres-Andrade-ZAKs-co-founders-and-co-CEOs-1.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2231401" class="wp-caption-text">David Grandes and Andres Andrade, Zak’s co-founders and co-CEOs. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zak</p></div></p>
<p>The company now works with more than 300 restaurants across São Paulo and received a cash infusion of $15 million in Series A funding, led by Tiger Global Management, to take its technology mainstream across Brazil into Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Campinas, Brasília and Salvador.</p>
<p>Joining Tiger in the round is Valor Capital Group, Monashees, Base 10 and Canary, representing the total funding Zak has raised to date.</p>
<p>“We feel ready to go into the mass market,” Grandes, co-founder and co-CEO, told TechCrunch. “The funding enables us to round out our product and our teams. For now the focus is on Brazil, but we see a huge opportunity to move into Latin America and will start with Mexico, which is 50% of the restaurant market. We are also moving to be an embedded finance company.”</p>
<p>In addition, Zak plans to double its current team of 162 employees by the end of 2022 and to add new services like customer relationship management and marketing automation so that restaurants can increase their omni-channel presence.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pivoting has made the company’s total addressable market “100 times bigger,” and given <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/nubanks-ipo-filing-gives-us-a-peek-into-neobank-economics/">Nubank’s recent IPO</a>, provides Zak with a “front-row seat into the financial flows of restaurants,” co-CEO Andrade said.</p>
<p>It also puts the company in position to launch its financial services piece to have an upper hand on digital wallets, invoicing and offering capital to restaurants that often get turned down for loans. Ultimately, the company wants to be the “Toast of LatAm,” Grandes said.</p>
<p>The company seems well on its way: Zak grew its revenue base four times in the past year and is running some $100 million payments through the platform each month, Marina Lima, the company’s chief revenue officer, said. She sees a similar trajectory in the next 12 months and expects over $350 million in payments to go through Zak by the end of that time period.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Grandes says there are 1 million restaurants in Brazil, which presents a big opportunity to go downstream.</p>
<p>“It is about dominating Brazil and rounding out the team, product and platform,” he added. “We are already quite differentiated and ahead for us is consolidating across Brazil and then going into Mexico.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kodiak Robotics, one of the last privately held autonomous truck outfits in Silicon Valley, has raised $125 million in new capital, funding that will be used to double its workforce as it pursues a path to commercialization.</p>
<p>The oversubscribed Series B stands out for its lengthy list of backers and notably that the lead investor is not listed and not being disclosed. TechCrunch has been told that a freight and logistics company set up a special interest financial vehicle as the strategic lead investor spot in the round.</p>
<p>Other investors include newcomers SIP Global Partners, Muirwoods Ventures, Harpoon Ventures, StepStone Group, Gopher Asset Management, Walleye Capital, Aliya Capital Partners, and others. Existing investors Battery Ventures, CRV and Lightspeed Venture Partners also participated. Bridgestone Americas and BMW i Ventures, which had announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/self-driving-trucks-startup-kodiak-robotics-snags-investment-partnership-from-bridgestone/">strategic investments in Kodiak</a> earlier this year, converted its funds to this round.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231571" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Kodiak has raised a total of $165 million since its founding in 2018. The company did not disclose the valuation. </span></p>
<p>Like so many startups, the funding will be used to hire more people. Kodiak is aiming to grow from the 90 people it employs today to about 170 by the end of next year.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO Don Burnette said the hiring is across every department in the company. The new funding will be used to expand operations, pay for the expansion of its fleet. Kodiak plans to add a a minimum of 15 new trucks for a total of at least 25 autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to scale and with scale comes growth across the entire company — more drivers, more operations folks, more engineers,&#8221; Burnette said in an interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;R&amp;D is definitely the primary utilization of the funds. Scaling the fleet is also a really big one, obviously, as you watch the space you see that there&#8217;s an ever growing interest in commercial traction and customers and partners and miles driven and the size of the autonomous freight network. So we&#8217;re going to be expanding all of those efforts and that all costs money.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series B comes at a critical time for Kodiak. The company is a fraction of the size of other autonomous vehicle companies pursuing trucking, notably Aurora and Waymo. Burnette has argued that Kodiak is more capitally efficient than its much larger and better funded rivals.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean Kodiak is forever done with seeking funding. As Kodiak scales, the company will pursue more funding and will continue to evaluate options in the public markets and the private markets. Burnette said he is not considering any mergers and is not looking to be acquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll really be interesting to see how things unfold,&#8221; Burnette said of funding within the AV industry. &#8220;I think from an investor-appetite perspective, I mean, the fact that this round was so heavily oversubscribed goes to show that there is significant investor interest out there still. Within the private markets, now that many of our competitors have gone public, Kodiak&#8217;s really positioned as one of the last remaining private AV trucking companies with any significant progress.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month, Kodiak revealed details about its fourth-generation autonomous truck system and announced it was expanding its own fleet by 15 PACCAR Class 8 trucks. (They have 10 trucks in the field today.) The fourth-generation truck has a modular sensor suite that includes a center pod on the front roofline of the truck as well as pods integrated into both of the side mirrors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://vimeo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vimeo</a>, the B2B video platform that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/what-vimeos-growth-profits-and-value-tell-us-about-the-online-video-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spun out from IAC earlier this year</a>, has made a pair of acquisitions aimed at building out the suite of features and tools it offers to businesses to create and run their own video strategies. The company has picked up short-form AI-based video creation platform <a href="https://www.wibbitz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wibbitz</a>; and <a href="https://www.wirewax.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wirewax</a>, which has built technology for marketers and other non-technical creatives to make objects in videos &#8220;shoppable&#8221; or linkable to other outside content.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the deals were not disclosed, but for some context, New York-based Wibbitz <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/05/wibbitz-raises-2-3m-series-a-for-technology-that-turns-text-into-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originally made its name</a> as an Israeli startup that had built AI-based technology that automatically turned text into videos, a service that helped it raise around $30 million from investors that included a number of strategic backers (that is, customers) like the Associated Press, Bertelsmann, France&#8217;s TF1, and the Weather Channel, as well as traditional VCs like Horizons Ventures and Kima Ventures. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/24/video-taggging-startup-wirewax-makes-cougar-town-episode-shoppable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">London-based Wirewax</a>, meanwhile, also had a strategic backer in the form of the BBC, and other investors included Passion Capital and the Plug and Play incubator. It had raised around $7 million. Both have large customers on their books.</p>
<p>Vimeo plans to keep both platforms operational and continue serving existing customers, which include the likes of Walmart, Disney, Google, and Nike for Wirewax and HubSpot, Bloomberg, Condé Nast, and Harvard University for Wibbitz. It is also planning to integrate its features into its wider video creation dashboard to over time sell a wider set of tools both to those customers and those already with Vimeo.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231959" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The idea behind the deals is to bring in more tools specifically targeting Vimeo&#8217;s larger enterprise customers, CEO Anjali Sud said in an interview, to provide more creative tools that are less technical to help them feed the video beast: video consumption has <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1215173/impact-of-covid-19-on-type-of-video-consumption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skyrocketed</a> in the last couple of years, fueled in no small part by Covid-19 and people spending more time at home and on their screens rather than in public places.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s accelerated a lot of organizations&#8217; video strategies, whether that involves providing tools for internal teams to get work done, or creating marketing campaigns, or building new products themselves.</p>
<p class="p17">&#8220;Companies are going from reactive to proactive, and employees are demanding it,&#8221; Sud said of the video push and how its customers are looking for more functionality in their video software. The knock-on effect for Vimeo, she added, has been to become a consolidator of many of the smaller video companies that have emerged over the years to address different aspects of the creation process, to make a bigger product that is easier to address that demand, with &#8220;several acquisitions helpful in expanding our product suite to create an all-in-one professional video solution. Our belief is that every startup has an interesting video feature to provide. We want to get every company using video every day, to get 1 billion knowledge workers using video. To do that you have to materially lower the barriers.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p17">It&#8217;s been a years-long strategy for the company, with other acquisitions including the purchase of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/vimeo-acquires-livestream-launches-its-own-live-video-product/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Livestream</a>, which it says now powers town halls and other live events (a platform that was <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vimeo-launches-vimeo-events-a-new-platform-designed-to-turn-every-marketer-into-a-virtual-events-pro-301413693.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded</a> earlier this month by way of a new virtual events product); and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/15/vimeo-has-acquired-short-form-video-creation-platform-magisto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magisto</a>, another short-form video creator tool.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Wirewax will be bringing more interactive video functionality to Vimeo, specifically with a drag-and-drop interface. One of the most obvious applications will be in the realm of e-commerce where users will be able to use the tech to build &#8220;shoppable&#8221; videos with links within the videos themselves to buying featured items; but other applications can be technical (eg to product demonstrations) or education (for further information about something in a video), or internal training for employees (for example links through to quizzes).</p>
<p>Wibbitz, meanwhile, is more focused on video creation, and specifically tools for marketing, internal communications and media teams to manage large amounts of video while keeping the content consistent with company branding and style. It also still offers a product for using AI to transform text to video automatically, although this is no longer the core service. Sud said that AI IP will be integrated into its existing products that also provide the same functionality (which it acquired via Magisto).</p>
<p class="p6">&#8220;Wirewax was built for the video-first future, evolving video to be a lean-in, fully engaging experience,” said Steve Callanan, CEO, Wirewax, in a statement. “Marrying Wirewax with Vimeo’s video leadership and global scale will put the power of next-generation interactive video into the hands of millions of users. It’s an exciting step to be joining Vimeo and contributing to helping organizations unleash their creativity and produce engaging experiences that drive better business outcomes, from shoppable videos to boost sales, to entirely new ways to improve training, education, and customer service.”</p>
<p class="p6">“Wibbitz and Vimeo have a shared goal of making video creation so simple that any employee can easily and quickly make beautiful, professional-quality videos at scale,” added Zohar Dayan, CEO, Wibbitz. “We have spent over 10 years honing our product to serve marketing, HR, and communications teams at some of the largest companies in the world, and are thrilled to join Vimeo’s world-class platform to accelerate the video transformation taking place across the enterprise.”</p>
<p>The pair of acquisitions nevertheless come on the heels of a mixed year for Vimeo. The company spun out as a public company from IAC in May, debuting at $57/share. However, it saw its stock dip on its first day of trading ending up with a market cap of $8.4 billion on its closing day. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VMEO?p=VMEO&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Today</a>, its share price and valuation are more than halved, with a market cap of $4 billion. Some of the skepticism in the market appears to hinge on the fact that it&#8217;s spinning out into what has become a highly competitive space, with many a company with deep pockets also looking to address the same gap in the market for providing video services to businesses that want to do more in video.</p>
<p>Despite this, the fact remains that we have seen record-breaking levels for all kinds of video providers, from on-demand premium content companies like Netflix through to those focused as well on user-generated content like TikTok and YouTube, and those with more business focus, such as Zoom for conferencing.</p>
<p>That rising tide has also lifted 10-year-old Vimeo&#8217;s boat. The company posted quarterly revenues of $100 million in Q3 (it debuted in May with quarter revenues of $89.4 million). Sud tells us that the company now has &#8220;hundreds of millions&#8221; of free users and 1.6 million paying users (that latter figure is flat compared to May, when Vimeo disclosed 200 million free users).</p>
<p>Since its pivot to B2B four years ago, Vimeo&#8217;s customer base has settled on a pretty wide mix, ranging from SMBs through to startups and some 6,000 large enterprises including Starbucks, Amazon and Spotify. Enterprise revenues grew 60% in the last quarter compared to a year ago, figures that the company is holding in place as it looks to the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think in the long term of decades, not years,&#8221; Sud said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Canary’s first two funds each invested in approximately 50 companies and the firm's expectation is to do around the same number of first checks with the third fund.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.canary.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canary</a>, the Brazilian venture capital firm backing some of Latin America’s successful startups like Buser, Sallve, Hashdex, Facily and Trybe, closed on its third fund that was oversubscribed with $100 million in commitments.</p>
<p>Since its formation in 2017, the firm invested in more than 100 companies in Latin America through its first two funds, on which it raised $45 million and $75 million, respectively. Those startups have in turn raised over $2.3 billion in new investments.</p>
<p>Marcos Toledo, Canary’s co-founder and managing partner, started the firm with Florian Hagenbuch, Mate Pencz, Patrick de Picciotto and Julio Vasconcellos. It is agnostic in terms of sector and aims to be a local partner for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/why-global-investors-are-flocking-to-back-latin-american-startups/">U.S. firms seeking investments in the area</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231591" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Toledo expects to invest in about 50 companies, and first checks from the fund were signed starting in the summer.</p>
<p>We emailed with Toledo recently to learn more about the fund.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How long do you usually wait between new raises?</strong></p>
<p>MT: We normally raise a new vintage after two or two-and-a-half years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Why was now a good time to launch a new fund?</strong></p>
<p>Launching a new fund right now is a reinforcement of the potential of the region for innovation and our vision of the future: still lots of problems to be solved, paired with a growing pool of talented people starting or joining new companies.</p>
<p>When Canary was founded, in 2017, it was founded under the hypothesis that there are plenty of talented people that, with the right support and incentives, could create businesses with huge impact, capable of changing Latin America. We thought the tech market in the region was in its early stages and had many opportunities.</p>
<p>A few years later, we are not only happy to see that our belief was right, but also that this trend is accelerating, with more and more people making a shift in their careers, becoming founders or joining a startup team, instead of going to work in traditional jobs (for instance, our second vintage had 50% more second time founders than the first one, and this number seems to be higher for the new vintage).</p>
<p>In addition to that, we are very excited about our positioning in the market, having access to more than 90% of all funding rounds that have happened in Brazil since 2017. Moreover, the VC market is still in its early days in Latin America and there are plenty of structural problems and industries waiting to be disrupted in the region, something that excites us about the transformation to come in the next few years. There is a true opportunity to consolidate ourselves as one of the main VC firms in the region.</p>

<p><strong>What was it like raising a fund in this environment?</strong></p>
<p>More than just raising capital, in Canary we seek to have, as investors, long-term oriented partners that can add real value to our invested companies. In this third fund, we are excited to say that not only we were heavily oversubscribed, but also fortunate to renew the partnerships with some leading Brazilian and global families, several partners of renowned global funds, as well as a large proportion of the best tech founders in the region.</p>
<p>We also had the chance to expand our investor base across geographies, such as Asia, LatAm and the U.S., and to different pools of capital, such as U.S. endowments and foundations. Cases of success in the region are helping more and more investors to understand the market and see the potential of really big companies to be created around here. Moreover, the push for digital transformation and disruption in Latin America is each and every day making our hypothesis stronger.</p>

<p><strong>Where will the new fund be targeted?</strong></p>
<p>As in Canary’s two first funds, this third fund is focused on writing the first institutional check for the best founders in Latin America. We always saw the opportunity for the whole region, but decided to start with Brazil. Now, we are increasingly investing in companies all over the continent, from countries like Mexico, Colombia and Argentina.</p>
<p>Considering sectors, we maintain our agnostic approach: we believe that excellent founders will always find a way to look at the best opportunities and build amazing companies. As we often say, we are not experts in sectors, but we are specialists in finding talented people with ambition to transform the lives of millions of Latin Americans. More than that, we are also focused on helping these founders in areas that can unlock disproportionate value, like fundraising, building their founding teams, commercial connections, public relations and data insights. Our focus is basically on people, first checks and LatAm.</p>
<p>Canary’s first two funds each invested in approximately 50 companies and our expectation is to do around the same number of first checks. We also have a share of the capital reserved to participate in subsequent rounds.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a particular sector where you are seeing a lot of startups coming into or raising funds</strong>?</p>
<p>We have the opportunity to get a first look in the market, and since 2017, we have had access to 93% of the deals that were invested by top-tier VC funds in Brazil. Of course, fintech has been a major sector for LatAm startups in recent years and we see that there are a lot of opportunities still available to be explored by bold and ambitious founders.</p>
<p>In Brazil, specifically, we are also seeing a very interesting moment regarding insurtechs, with local regulators not only approving, but also pushing for more innovation in the market. Healthtech is also rising up in the region — the COVID-19 pandemic was a wake-up call about how the health industry is structured and how it can be transformed for better.</p>
<p>Also, as an effect of the pandemic, we are seeing plenty of startups transforming e-commerce and working to make its infrastructure better, from payments to logistics, not without mentioning social commerce companies.</p>
<p>Another enthusiastic opportunity we are seeing are B2B marketplaces that can transform whole industries from the inside. It is a major global trend that is increasingly growing in the region.</p>
<p><strong>What is the investment landscape like in Brazil/Latin America right now? How has it changed in the past 12 months? What do you predict for the next 12 months?</strong></p>
<p>The investment landscape in LatAm is very accelerated right now, a surprise if you consider our perspective about 18 months ago, when COVID hit the region. 2020 and 2021 are record years for VC investments in Latin America, with new but not surprising factors. We are seeing more and more global VC firms writing their first checks in the region (and we are proud to be local partners in the early stage for firms like Dragoneer, a16z, SoftBank, QED and Ribbit).</p>
<p>We are also seeing a first wave of companies doing their IPOs and completing the investment cycle: exits and distributions of stock options do not only bring more money to the table, but also work as success cases and can influence the future of the market and bring more talented people to the ecosystem.</p>
<p>There will also be a lot of experienced executives and operators thinking about their next steps, and this is a positive cycle that can be repeated with different companies going to the public market. Moreover, we are also seeing other countries in LatAm maturing their ecosystems at a faster pace, with plenty of talented people starting new businesses and looking to solve significant problems for the whole continent.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[General Atlantic saw a record 21 IPOs and direct listings of portfolio companies in 2021 thus far.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.generalatlantic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Atlantic</a> announced Wednesday that its sixth growth equity fund, GA 2021, closed with $7.8 billion in commitments, up from the $5 billion the firm was originally seeking earlier this year.</p>
<p>Backers in the new fund included new and existing capital partners, including family offices, endowments, foundations and institutional investors.</p>
<p>GA, which was started in 1980, now has $23.8 billion in committed capital and had over $78 billion in assets under management as of June 30. The firm will continue to invest across five sectors: consumer, financial services, healthcare, life sciences and technology. It has invested $49 billion in more than 430 global growth companies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231677" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The firm created a unique capital structure that enables the firm to scale its capital base on an ongoing basis that includes closed-end-funds, five-year managed accounts, evergreen accounts and a GP commitment, representing the largest single investor in GA’s core investing program, according to the firm.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So far this year, GA has made 65 investments, up from 42 in 2020, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/general-atlantic/recent_investments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Crunchbase data</a>. It made seven investments in October; one of the latest was in insurance policy provider Acko, based in India, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/amazon-backed-insurtech-acko-joins-unicorn-club-with-255-million-funding/">raised $225 million</a> in October. Overall, the firm had 130 exits of portfolio companies.</p>
<p>GA also saw 21 IPOs and direct listings of portfolio companies in 2021 thus far, which includes companies like payment software company EngageSmart, which <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/general-atlantic-backed-payments-company-engagesmart-files-for-ipo-2021-08-27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced its IPO in August</a>, and employee screening company HireRight, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/general-atlantic-backed-hireright-files-us-ipo-2021-10-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced in October</a>. That is compared to a prior record of six in both 2020 and 2019, according to a General Atlantic spokesperson.</p>
<p>“Our global growth equity strategy positions us to capitalize on the profound acceleration of digital innovation and global entrepreneurship as we seek to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our capital partners,” Bill Ford, chairman and CEO of General Atlantic, said in a written statement. “Our ability to partner with management teams, help build rapidly growing, technology-enabled companies on a global scale, and generate strong and consistent investment performance distinguishes General Atlantic from both entrepreneurs and investors.”</p>

<p>For many sales and marketing teams, finding leads is a time-consuming and tedious process. <a href="https://www.lusha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lusha</a>, a sales intelligence platform for B2B sales, is helping with a crowdsourced database that helps companies narrow down their lists of potential customers to the most likely candidates. Founded in 2016, the company was bootstrapped until it raised its Series A just nine months ago. Today, it announced it has hit unicorn status, with a $205 million Series B that puts the Tel Aviv-based startup’s valuation at $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>The round was led by growth equity firm PSG, with participation from ION Crossover Partners and brings Lusha’s total raised to $245 million, including <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/10/lusha-raises-40-million-to-surface-sales-lead-contact-info-in-your-browser/">its $40 million Series A announced in Februar</a>y. Co-founder and chief executive officer Yoni Tserruya said that since raising its first round of outside funding, Lusha’s growth rate has tripled and it wants to put more resources into its go-to-market strategy. The Series B will be used on Lusha’s data infrastructure, new features, privacy compliance and expanding its market share in the United States.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231935" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Lusha says its user community, which contributes data like company information and business contact details, now includes more than 800,000 sales professionals and 273,000 sales organizations, including large tech firms like Facebook, Google, Dropbox and Uber. Most of Lusha’s clients are B2B SaaS companies, but it’s also used by venture capital firms, investors and recruiting agencies.</p>
<p>The company’s tools include a browser extension that displays information about a company’s industry, size, revenue and sales contacts. A “prospecting tool” lets users filter leads into specific customer segments. Lusha also offers API and integrations so its database can be integrated into a company’s existing sales and marketing software systems. The company is GDPR-aligned and CCPA-compliant. When people are added to its database, Lusha notifies them so they can edit or remove their contact information.</p>
<p>Lusha was launched five years ago by Assaf Eisenstein and Tserruya because they realized social networks weren’t an effective way to generate quality sales leads.</p>
<p>“When we started in 2016, we realized that you can reach out to anyone because you have social networks like LinkedIn, Facebook and so on. So if you want to reach out to someone, you can do it, but the way it works with social networks is not efficient. There’s a lot of noise,” Tserruya told TechCrunch. “People were starting to ignore a lot of those reach-out requests, but the need for salespeople and marketing teams remained the same.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lusha was created to cut through the noise and help sales and marketing teams identify the people who are most likely to want to hear from them.</p>
<p>At the beginning, Lusha was like “Waze for salespeople,” as the company’s website puts it. Once it started crowdsourcing data from salespeople, that generated a network effect. In the early stages, a lot of the data wasn’t particularly accurate. But &#8220;as the company evolved, we realized what would make us the best in the industry and the differentiator would be the accuracy of the data and how deep the data is that we provide to customers,” said Tserruya. As a result, Lusha focused on growing its community of users, who contribute and validate data.</p>
<p>Current tailwinds for Lusha’s services include remote work as the pandemic continues. “Sales team can’t reach out to potential buyers face to face like before,” said Tserruya. “Companies that used conferences to generate leads now need to do it remotely, often while working from home.”</p>
<p>Lusha operates on a freemium model. Free users get limited access to data, while those who pay for subscription packages unlock more features. Lusha’s database lets sales teams search for the contact information of decision makers at companies, but Tserruya stresses it only includes business info, not personal data, for its more than 100 million contacts. Then users give feedback about database entries, improving Lusha’s algorithms and datasets.</p>
<p>The company’s database, search feature and recommendation algorithms are meant to be an improvement over the “spray and pray” approach, where sales and marketing teams call or email as many leads as possible.</p>

<p>“The main challenge for salespeople is that they are actually selling a third or two-thirds of their time on admin or aggregating data, trying to understand who this customer is, how to reach out to them, who the right person to contact is and so on,” Tserruya said. “The lack of data and intelligence wastes time for sales team, so more companies are taking a ‘super-targeted’ sales process, where they know exactly who they need to reach out to and why.” For example, users can filter companies by whether they use Salesforce, where they are located and how many people they employ.</p>
<p>He added this is similar to the marketing shift that happened about a decade ago, when companies switched their focus from billboards and TV commercials to targeted ads on Facebook and Google. For example, if a company is selling CRM software, that means they need to specifically target early-stage companies, because once one chooses a system, it will probably stick with it for years.</p>

<p>“So what kind of triggers or signals can help you reach out to sell the CRM? For example, if the company just hired a VP of sales, or their first salespeople. If they just started to sell something, this is probably the right time to reach out to them,” Tserruya said. “The timing and understanding of a company’s lifecycle is really a game-changer for a lot of B2B SaaS companies today and that’s how we try to help.”</p>
<p>Lusha’s competitors include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zoominfo-drops-575m-on-chorus-ai-as-ai-shakes-up-the-sales-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZoomInfo</a>, one of the biggest data providers to sales and marketing teams. “I think our main differentiation is that they’re very enterprise-oriented,” said Tserruya. “Another differentiation is the quality of our data, because it constantly gets feedback from users, and also our ease of use, because businesses can start using it without talking to one of Lusha’s sales reps, and expand their membership plans as they grow.”</p>
<p>In a statement about the investment, ION Crossover Partners general partner Gili Iohan said, “We have been following Lusha’s progress over the last two years and found the team’s vision and execution highly impressive. As sales teams continue to leverage to drive their go-to-market strategies, Lusha is becoming an integral product for teams to optimize their outreach to improve overall win rates.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has won an appeal against a class action-style privacy litigation at the UK Supreme Court &#8212; avoiding what could have been up to £3BN in damages had it lost the case.</p>
<p>The long-running <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/08/uk-high-court-blocks-compensation-suit-against-googles-safari-workaround/">litigation</a> was brought by veteran consumer rights campaigner, Richard Lloyd, who, since 2017, has been pursing a collective lawsuit, alleging Google applied a Safari workaround to override iPhone users’ privacy settings in Apple’s Safari browser between 2011 and 2012 &#8212; and seeking compensation for the breach for the estimated 4 million+ UK iPhone users affected.</p>
<p>Lloyd&#8217;s litigation had sought damages for privacy harms. More broadly, the suit sought to establish that a representative action could be brought in the UK seeking compensation for data protection violations &#8212; despite the lack of generic class action regime in UK law.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231942" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/08/uk-high-court-blocks-compensation-suit-against-googles-safari-workaround/">2018</a> the High Court blocked the suit from proceeding &#8212; but the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/uk-privacy-class-action-complaint-against-google-gets-unblocked/">following year</a> the Court of Appeal overturned the judgment, allowing the lawsuit to be heard.</p>
<p>However today&#8217;s unanimous Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0213-judgment.pdf">judgment</a> essentially reverts to the High Court&#8217;s view: Blocking the representative action.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Supreme Court justices took the view that damage/loss must be suffered to claim compensation and that the need to prove damage/loss on an individual basis cannot be skipped &#8212; meaning </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">compensation cannot simply be applied uniformly for &#8220;loss of control&#8221; of personal data for each member of the claimed representative class, as the Lloyd litigators had sought. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Without proof of these matters, a claim for damages cannot succeed,&#8221; the Supreme Court writes, summarizing its judgement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The ruling is major blow to UK campaigners&#8217; hopes of being able to bring class action-style suits against the tracking industry.</p>
<p>Had Google lost the judgement it would have opened the gate to more representative actions being brought for privacy violations. But with the adtech giant winning the appeal it is likely to put a major chill on UK class action-style suits targeting data-mining tech giants &#8212; which had, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/oracle-and-salesforce-hit-with-gdpr-class-action-lawsuits-over-cookie-tracking-consent/">in recent years</a>, been attracting commercial litigation funders.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Oracle and Salesforce hit with GDPR class action lawsuits over cookie tracking consent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/oracle-and-salesforce-hit-with-gdpr-class-action-lawsuits-over-cookie-tracking-consent/embed/#?secret=FjsF0zCcd6" data-secret="FjsF0zCcd6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Responding to the judgement today, one law firm, <a href="https://www.blmlaw.com/news/lloyd-v-google-court-finds-in-favour-of-google">BLM</a>, wrote that the outcome of the case &#8220;will be cause for celebration for Google and any organisation that handles significant amounts of data or bases its business model on the use of personal data (as well as their shareholders and/or insurers)&#8221;.</p>
<p>Another law firm, Linklaters LLP, described the judgement as &#8220;a big blow to claimant law firms and funders who had hoped to create a new opt out regime for damages in the data breach sphere&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would expect a lot of similar claims issued in its wake now to fall away,&#8221; added Linklaters&#8217; Harriet Ellis, dispute resolution partner in a statement. “Claimant firms will be studying the decision carefully to see if there any viable opt-out class actions that can still be brought. But it looks really tough.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Mishcon de Reya, the law firm representing Lloyd, for comment.</p>
<p>In its own response to the Supreme Court judgement, Google avoided any discussion of the case detail &#8212; writing only:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This claim was related to events that took place a decade ago and that we addressed at the time. People want to know that they are safe and secure online, which is why for years we&#8217;ve focused on building products and infrastructure that respect and protect people&#8217;s privacy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But a spokesperson for the tech giant also pointed to a statement put out by the <a href="https://www.techuk.org/resource/techuk-responds-to-the-judgement-of-the-supreme-court-in-the-appeal-of-richard-lloyd-v-google-llc.html">techUK</a> trade association &#8212; which <span lang="EN-US">had intervened in the case in support of Google; and which writes today that &#8220;had the appeal been rejected, this would have opened the door</span> for speculative and vexatious claims to be made against data controllers, with far-reaching consequences for both public and private organisations&#8221;.</p>
<p>The UK trade association goes on to claim that it &#8220;does not oppose representative legal action, however, we believe it is right that any action must first seek to establish whether damage has been caused to the individual as a result of a data breach before seeking compensation&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, as the Supreme Court justices note &#8212; in discussion of the costs of &#8216;opt in&#8217; (rather than &#8216;opt out&#8217;) litigation regimes &#8212; the bar to accessing justice can simply be pushed out of reach in cases where individual claims are only worth a few hundred pounds apiece (in the Lloyd litigation the suggestion was a sum of £750 per person) because the associated case administration costs of processing individual claimants &#8220;may easily exceed the potential value of the claim&#8221;.</p>
<p>So &#8212; to be clear &#8212; techUK is opposing representative legal actions being brought over almost any data violation.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s data protection watchdog, meanwhile, has shown a complete lack of willingness to enforce the law against the data-mining adtech industry &#8212; despite the ICO warning,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/"> since 2019</a>, of rampantly unlawful tracking.</p>
<p>While the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">UK government is also now consulting on weakening</a> the domestic data protection regime.</p>
<p>So the question of how exactly the average UK citizen can obtain the privacy rights UK law claims wraps their information on paper looks, well, pretty murky right now&#8230;</p>

<p>In the US, Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/09/google-settles-with-ftc-agrees-to-pay-22-5m-penalty-for-bypassing-safari-privacy-settings/">entered into a consent order with the FTC</a> over the Safari cookie tracking issuing a decade ago — agreeing back in 2012 to pay $22.5M to settle the charge that it bypassed Safari’s privacy settings to serve targeted ads to consumers (but without accepting any wrongdoing).</p>
<p>Rights groups have responded to the Supreme Court judgement by calling for the government to legislate for collective redress.</p>
<p>In a statement the <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/press-releases/lloyd-vs-google-government-must-provide-mechanism-for-collective-redress/">Open Rights Group</a>&#8216;s executive director, Jim Killock, said: “There must be a way for people to seek redress against massive data breaches, without having to risk their homes, and without relying on the Information Commissioner alone.</p>
<p>“The ICO cannot act in every case, and is sometimes unwilling to do so. We have waited over two years for action against the Adtech industry, which the ICO says is operating unlawfully. There is no sign of action.</p>
<p>“Yet it would be completely unreasonable for someone to risk their home over court fees in cases like this. Without a collective mechanism, that is where we are left: in many cases data protection is very hard to enforce against tech giants.</p>
<p>“The Government should keep its word, and consider implementing collective action under GDPR, which i[t] specifically rejected in February on the grounds that Lloyd vs Google showed that existing rules could provide a path for redress.”</p>
