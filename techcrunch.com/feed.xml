										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp delays enforcement of a controversial privacy change, Apple may get rid of the Touch Bar in future MacBooks and Bumble files to go public. This is your Daily Crunch for January 15, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: WhatsApp responds to privacy backlash</strong></p>
<p>Earlier this month, WhatsApp sent users a notification asking them to consent to sharing some of their personal data — such as phone number and location — with Facebook (which owns WhatsApp). The alert also said users would have to agree to the terms by February 8 if they wanted to continue using the app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This change prompted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/whatsapp-faces-legal-challenge-over-privacy-in-its-biggest-market/">legal threats</a> and an investigation from <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2021/01/11/turkey-investigates-whatsapp-and-facebook-over-data-privacy-update">the Turkish government</a>. Now the company is pushing the enforcement date back three months.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one will have their account suspended or deleted on February 8. We’re also going to do a lot more to clear up the misinformation around how privacy and security works on WhatsApp,&#8221; the company said in a post. &#8220;We’ll then go to people gradually to review the policy at their own pace before new business options are available on May 15.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">This week, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey finally <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510769268850690">responded publicly</a> to the company’s decision to ban President Trump from its platform, writing that Twitter had &#8220;faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance&#8221; and that he did not &#8220;feel pride&#8221; about the decision. In the same thread, he took time to call out a nascent Twitter-sponsored initiative called &#8220;bluesky,&#8221; which is aiming to build up an &#8220;open decentralized standard for social media&#8221; that Twitter is just one part of.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Researchers involved with bluesky reveal to TechCrunch an initiative still in its earliest stages that could fundamentally shift the power dynamics of the social web.</p>
<p>Bluesky is aiming to build a “durable” web standard that will ultimately ensure that platforms like Twitter have less centralized responsibility in deciding which users and communities have a voice on the internet. While this could protect speech from marginalized groups, it may also upend modern moderation techniques and efforts to prevent online radicalization.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_1768336" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1768336" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1768336" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1027291750.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1027291750.jpg 3800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1027291750.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1027291750.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1027291750.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1027291750.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1027291750.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1027291750.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1027291750.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1768336" class="wp-caption-text">Jack Dorsey, co-founder and chief executive officer of Twitter Inc., arrives after a break during a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Wednesday, Sept. 5, 2018.

<h2>What is bluesky?</h2>
<p>Just as Bitcoin lacks a central bank to control it, a decentralized social network protocol operates without central governance, meaning Twitter would only control its own app built on bluesky, not other applications on the protocol. The open and independent system would allow applications to see, search and interact with content across the entire standard. Twitter hopes that the project can go far beyond what the existing Twitter API offers, enabling developers to create applications with different interfaces or methods of algorithmic curation, potentially paying entities across the protocol like Twitter for plug-and-play access to different moderation tools or identity networks.</p>
<p>A widely adopted, decentralized protocol is an opportunity for social networks to &#8220;pass the buck&#8221; on moderation responsibilities to a broader network, one person involved with the early stages of bluesky suggests, allowing individual applications on the protocol to decide which accounts and networks its users are blocked from accessing.</p>
<p>Social platforms like Parler or Gab could theoretically rebuild their networks on bluesky, benefitting from its stability and the network effects of an open protocol. Researchers involved are also clear that such a system would also provide a meaningful measure against government censorship and protect the speech of marginalized groups across the globe.</p>
<p>Bluesky&#8217;s current scope is firmly in the research phase, people involved tell TechCrunch, with about 40-50 active members from different factions of the decentralized tech community surveying the software landscape and putting together proposals for what the protocol should ultimately look like. Twitter has told early members that it hopes to hire a project manager in the coming weeks to build out an independent team that will start crafting the protocol itself.</p>
<p>Bluesky&#8217;s initial members were invited by Twitter CTO Parag Agrawal early last year. It was later determined that the group should open the conversation up to folks representing some of the more recognizable decentralized network projects, including <a href="https://mastodon.social/about">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a> who joined the working group hosted on the secure chat platform <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a>.</p>
<p>Jay Graber, founder of decentralized social platform <a href="https://happening.net/">Happening</a>, was paid by Twitter to write up a technical review of the decentralized social ecosystem, an effort to &#8220;help Twitter evaluate the existing options in the space,&#8221; she tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;If [Twitter] wanted to design this thing, they could have just assigned a group of guys to do it, but there&#8217;s only one thing that this little tiny group of people could do better than Twitter, and that&#8217;s not be Twitter,&#8221; said Golda Velez, another member of the group who works as a senior software engineer at Postmates and co-founded <a href="https://civ.works/">civ.works</a>, <span class="lt-line-clamp__line">a privacy-centric social</span> <span class="lt-line-clamp__line lt-line-clamp__line--last">network for civic engagement.</span></p>
<p>The group has had some back and forth with Twitter executives on the scope of the project, eventually forming a Twitter-approved list of goals for the initiative. They define the challenges that the bluesky protocol should seek to address while also laying out what responsibilities are best left to the application creators building on the standard.</p>
<p>A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment.</p>

<h2>Who is involved</h2>
<p>The pain points enumerated in the document, viewed by TechCrunch, encapsulate some of Twitter&#8217;s biggest shortcomings. They include &#8220;how to keep controversy and outrage from hijacking virality mechanisms,&#8221; as well as a desire to develop &#8220;customizable mechanisms&#8221; for moderation, though the document notes that the applications, not the overall protocol, are &#8220;ultimately liable for compliance, censorship, takedowns etc..&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the solution to the problem of algorithms isn&#8217;t getting rid of algorithms &#8212; because sorting posts chronologically is an algorithm &#8212; the solution is to make it an open pluggable system by which you can go in and try different algorithms and see which one suits you or use the one that your friends like,&#8221; says Evan Henshaw-Plath, another member of the working group. He was one of Twitter&#8217;s earliest employees and has been building out his own decentralized social platform called <a href="https://planetary.social/">Planetary</a>.</p>
<p>His platform is based on the secure scuttlebutt protocol, which allows user to browse networks offline in an encrypted fashion. Early on, Planetary had been in talks with Twitter for a corporate investment as well as a personal investment from CEO Jack Dorsey, Henshaw-Plath says, but the competitive nature of the platform prompted some concern among Twitter&#8217;s lawyers and Planetary ended up receiving an investment from <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Twitter co-founder Biz Stone&#8217;s venture fund Future Positive. Stone did not respond to interview requests.</span></p>
<p>After agreeing on goals, Twitter had initially hoped for the broader team to arrive at some shared consensus but starkly different viewpoints within the group prompted Twitter to accept individual proposals from members. Some pushed Twitter to outright adopt or evolve an existing standard while others pushed for bluesky to pursue interoperability of standards early on and see what users naturally flock to.</p>
<p>One of the developers in the group hoping to bring bluesky onto their standard was Mastodon creator Eugen Rochko who tells TechCrunch he sees the need for a major shift in how social media platforms operate globally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Banning Trump was the right decision though it came a little bit too late. But at the same time, the nuance of the situation is that maybe it shouldn&#8217;t be a single American company that decides these things,&#8221; Rochko tells us.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DKCvXCDwaA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">The deplatforming of President Trump</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The deplatforming of President Trump&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/embed/#?secret=DKCvXCDwaA" data-secret="DKCvXCDwaA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Like several of the other members in the group, Rochko has been skeptical at times about Twitter&#8217;s motivation with the bluesky protocol. Shortly after Dorsey&#8217;s initial announcement in 2019, Mastodon&#8217;s official Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/joinmastodon/status/1204791506143457281?s=20">tweeted out a biting critique</a>, writing, &#8220;This is not an announcement of reinventing the wheel. This is announcing the building of a protocol that Twitter gets to control, like Google controls Android.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, Mastodon is arguably one of the most mature decentralized social platforms. Rochko claims that the network of decentralized nodes has more than 2.3 million users spread across thousands of servers. In early 2017, the platform had its viral moment on Twitter, prompting an influx of &#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of new users alongside some inquisitive potential investors whom Rochko has rebuffed in favor of a donation-based model.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1809256" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1809256" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1809256" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/toxic-twitter-alt.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/toxic-twitter-alt.png 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/toxic-twitter-alt.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/toxic-twitter-alt.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/toxic-twitter-alt.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/toxic-twitter-alt.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/toxic-twitter-alt.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1809256" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<h2>Inherent risks</h2>
<p>Not all of the attention Rochko has garnered has been welcome. In 2019, Gab, a social network favored by right-wing extremists, brought its entire platform onto the Mastodon network after integrating the platform&#8217;s open source code, bringing Mastodon its single biggest web of users and its most undesirable liability all at once.</p>
<p>Rochko quickly disavowed the network and aimed to sever its ties to other nodes on the Mastodon platform and convince application creators to do the same. But a central fear of decentralization advocates was quickly realized, as the platform type&#8217;s first &#8220;success story&#8221; was a home for right-wing extremists.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ziyPJNEdaU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-is-officially-offline-after-aws-suspension/">Parler is officially offline after AWS suspension</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Parler is officially offline after AWS suspension&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-is-officially-offline-after-aws-suspension/embed/#?secret=ziyPJNEdaU" data-secret="ziyPJNEdaU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This fear has been echoed in decentralized communities this week as app store owners and networks have taken another right-wing social network, Parler, off the web after violent content surfaced on the site in the lead-up and aftermath of riots at the U.S. Capitol, leaving some developers fearful that the social network may set up home on their decentralized standard.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Fascists are 100% going to use peer-to-peer technologies, they already are and they&#8217;re going to start using it more&#8230; If they get pushed off of mainstream infrastructure or people are surveilling them really closely, they&#8217;re going to have added motivation,&#8221; said Emmi Bevensee, a researcher <a href="https://emmibevensee.com/">studying</a> extremist presences on decentralized networks. &#8220;Maybe the far-right gets stronger footholds on peer-to-peer before the people who think the far-right is bad do because they were effectively pushed off.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>A central concern is that commoditizing decentralized platforms through efforts like bluesky will provide a more accessible route for extremists kicked off current platforms to maintain an audience and provide casual internet users a less janky path towards radicalization.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peer-to-peer technology is generally not that seamless right now. Some of it is; you can buy Bitcoin in Cash App now, which, if anything, is proof that this technology is going to become much more mainstream and adoption is going to become much more seamless,&#8221;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Bevensee told TechCrunch. </span>&#8220;In the current era of this mass exodus from Parler, they&#8217;re obviously going to lose a huge amount of audience that isn&#8217;t dedicated enough to get on IPFS. Scuttlebutt is a really cool technology but it&#8217;s not as seamless as Twitter.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Telegram blocks ‘dozens’ of hardcore hate channels threatening violence&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/telegram-channels-banned-violent-threats-capitol/embed/#?secret=m55kWv4kq2" data-secret="m55kWv4kq2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Extremists adopting technologies that promote privacy and strong encryption is far from a new phenomenon, encrypted chat apps like Signal and Telegram have been at the center of such controversies in recent years. Bevensee notes the tendency of right-wing extremist networks to adopt decentralized network tech has been &#8220;extremely demoralizing&#8221; to those early developer communities &#8212; though she notes that the same technologies can and do benefit &#8220;marginalized people all around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though people connected to bluesky&#8217;s early moves see a long road ahead for the protocol&#8217;s development and adoption, they also see an evolving landscape with Parler and President Trump&#8217;s recent deplatforming that they hope will drive other stakeholders to eventually commit to integrating with the standard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right at this moment I think that there&#8217;s going to be a lot of incentive to adopt, and I don&#8217;t just mean by end users, I mean by platforms, because Twitter is not the only one having these really thorny moderation problems,&#8221; Velez says. &#8220;I think people understand that this is a critical moment.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Marc Lore, the executive vice president, president and CEO of U.S. e-commerce for Walmart,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/104169/000010416921000005/wmt-20210114.htm"> is stepping down</a> a little over four years after selling his e-commerce company Jet.com to the country&#8217;s largest retailer for $3 billion.</p>
<p>Lore&#8217;s tenure at the company was a mixed bag. Walmart instituted several new technology initiatives under Lore&#8217;s tenure, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/walmart-says-it-will-discontinue-jet-com-which-it-acquired-for-3b-in-2016/">the Jet.com service was shuttered last May</a> and other initiatives from Lore, like an option to have customers order items via text, was also a money-loser for the Bentonville, AK-based company.</p>

<p>&#8220;After Mr. Lore retires on January 31, 2021, the U.S. business, including all the aspects of US retail eCommerce, will continue to report to John Furner, Executive Vice President, President and Chief Executive Officer, Walmart U.S., beginning on February 1, 2021,&#8221; Walmart said in a filing.</p>
<p>Walmart has continued to push ahead with a number of tech-related initiatives, including the launch of a new business that will focus on developing financial services.</p>
<p>That initiative is being undertaken through a strategic partnership with the fintech investment firm, Ribbit Capital and adds to a startup tech portfolio that also includes the incubator Store N⁰8, <a href="https://www.storeno8.com/the-l8est/how-to-better-serve-the-consumer-of-the-future-starting-today">which launched in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reflecting on the past few years with so much pride – Walmart changed my life and the work we did together will keep changing the lives of customers for years to come. It has been an honor to be a part of the Walmart family and I look forward to providing advice and ideas in the future,&#8221; Lore said in a statement posted to Linkedin. &#8220;Looking forward, I’ll be taking some time off and plan to continue working with several startups. Excited to keep you all up to date on what’s next.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coinbase has a problem. As interest in bitcoin has soared along with its price, the popular cryptocurrency exchange has found itself the target of a growing spate of angry customers who haven&#8217;t been able to access customer service.</p>
<p>A quick look at Twitter tells the story. As one upset user of the service ranted earlier today: &#8220;Multiple issues over the last month which cost me $$$ several open cases and 0% response?? When are you going to help me or is it easier to just forget. This wont be so easy when your publicly traded. Will be following up with [SEC] soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are many (many) similar complaints to be found.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the interest of full disclosure, this editor asked the company this week for more insight into its customer service operations after emailing its support staff more than a half dozen times and tweeting once over 10 days, and receiving no response. (I bought one unit of Ether in 2018 on the platform and wanted to access my account, which I&#8217;d been locked out of nearly two years ago.)</p>
<p>To its credit, Coinbase today<a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/committing-to-better-customer-service-during-this-time-of-heightened-interest-in-the-cryptoeconomy-5dc2637c4fa7"> issued a statement</a>, promising to do better. Its VP of customer success, Casper Sorenson, wrote on the company&#8217;s blog that Coinbase is &#8220;committing to a better customer experience during this time of heightened interest in the cryptoeconomy.&#8221;  The company says it is adding more people to its team; adding more self-service options (there are startling few); expanding its &#8220;help center&#8221;; and launching a new educational site, Coinbase Learn, &#8220;as a one-stop-shop for first timers, experienced investors, and everyone in between.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most meaningful perhaps, Coinbase says that in the coming months, it will begin offering live messaging with Coinbase representatives, which is not currently an option. Indeed, Coinbase does not offer live support of any kind. A help support phone line is only available to users wanting to freeze their accounts, and it is automated. (The flip side of its slow customer response times may tie to the apparent seriousness with which Coinbase, which works closely with regulated banks, <a href="https://blockonomi.com/is-coinbase-safe/">takes security issues</a>.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wV1Pw9vsBy"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/coinbase-files-to-go-public-confidentially-and-were-hyped/">Coinbase files to go public confidentially and we&#8217;re hyped</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Coinbase files to go public confidentially and we&#8217;re hyped&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/coinbase-files-to-go-public-confidentially-and-were-hyped/embed/#?secret=wV1Pw9vsBy" data-secret="wV1Pw9vsBy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Still, the company will have to do far more for its increasingly mainstream users as a publicly traded outfit, both because regulators will undoubtedly take a greater interest in its unhappy customers and because it will otherwise lose existing and potential clients to rivals, of which there are a growing array, from the international payment giant PayPal, which is now seeing <a href="https://beincrypto.com/paypals-cryptocurrency-trading-volume-soars-past-242m-in-24-hours/">record daily cryptocurrency trading</a>, to investment brokers like Robinhood. (Another increasingly popular option: digital asset <a href="https://craft.co/grayscale/competitors">managers</a> like Grayscale, whose trusts are publicly traded over the counter.)</p>
<p>More attention to the issue appears overdue. While Coinbase has presumably been dealing with a surge in complaints that corresponds with the volatility of Bitcoin&#8217;s ups and downs, customer service has been an ongoing issue for the nearly nine-year-old, San Francisco outfit, which filed its <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-files-confidentially-for-ipo-aiming-for-major-crypto-industry-milestone-195758729.html">confidential form</a> with the SEC in December to go public and says it has 35 million users in more than 100 countries.</p>
<p>In 2018, Mashable obtained <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sec-coinbase-complaints-fraud/">134 pages of complaints</a> filed to the SEC and the California Department of Business Oversight following a five-month FOIA process, and the picture that emerged was &#8220;not of a responsible actor in the cryptocurrency space opening the market to new investors, but rather a company overwhelmed by and underprepared for its own success,&#8221; the outlet reported at the time.</p>
<p>Asked today, among other things, how Coinbase&#8217;s processes have since changed, how many of its more than 1,200 employees are focused on customer support, and whether the outfit could share its latest customer numbers, Coinbase, currently in its SEC-mandated quiet period, declined to comment.</p>

<p>Coinbase has raised $547.3 million in venture backing over the years, according to Crunchbase. Tiger Global Management, which is currently raising up to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/tiger-global-is-raising-a-new-3-75-billion-venture-fund-one-year-after-closing-its-last/">$3.75 billion for its newest fund</a>, led Coinbase&#8217;s company&#8217;s most recent private round, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/coinbase-is-now-valued-at-8b-after-closing-new-300m-round/">$300 million Series E financing</a> that closed in 2018 and assigned Coinbase a post-money valuation of $8 billion.</p>
<p>Last September, the company parted ways with more than 5% of its employees, after cofounder and CEO Brian Armstrong publicly discouraged employee activism and political discussions at work, then offered severance to staffers who were uncomfortable with the policy. At least 60 people took the company up on the offer, Coinbase later revealed.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Launching is easy; fundraising is harder.</p>
<p>I’ve been fortunate to be a partner at two different VC firms over the past nine years, and we’ve grown AUM 10x both times.</p>
<p>Based on my experience, taking the 15 steps below will help build the core of a high-performing fundraising and investor relations function.</p>
<h2>1. Build the firm as much as possible before soliciting LPs</h2>
<p>The more baked you are, the more investable you are. The best possible move is to invest in and warehouse some special purpose vehicles that fit your strategy. However, that may distract you from the larger goal of raising a fund, not just a special purpose vehicle.</p>
<p>The next best move is to build your core team, e.g., recruit an advisory board, venture partners and EIRs. Lastly, gather feedback. Yohei Nakajima, founder of <a href="http://Untapped.vc">Untapped.vc</a>, said, “Before pitching LPs and building my firm, I talked with over 50 people I knew to get feedback.”</p>
<h2>2. Set up a basic marketing toolkit: Deck, website and social media</h2>
<p>It’s virtually mandatory to develop a detailed, data-backed deck and ideally a video pitch. Your materials should ideally meet the <a href="http://teten.com/lpdd">expectations</a> of the Institutional Limited Partners Association, even if you’re not targeting institutions. Keep these documents constantly up to date, so all team members are aligned on key numbers, e.g., total dollars raised so far. You’ll look unprofessional if you’re not coordinated.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, almost no one invests based on a deck; they want to talk with the people. However, a high-credibility deck opens the door to a meeting where you then have the chance to sell yourself.</p>
<p>Note that limited partners view formatting as a proxy for professionalism. It’s worth investing a little money in a graphic designer who can design a consistent website, business card, logo and presentation templates.</p>
<p>Richard Dukas, CEO, <a href="https://www.dlpr.com/">Dukas Linden Public Relations</a>, said, “If you don&#8217;t have a website and have no material online presence, you likely won&#8217;t get past the first hurdle with potential investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>When you’re fundraising, you’re selling a luxury good. The less widely marketed your fund, the more valuable it is perceived to be. For example, one LP told me she prefers to receive customized emails from fund principals, as opposed to a bulk-mailed quarterly update. An extreme example of this are venture capitalists who don’t even bother with a website, e.g., <a href="http://www.benchmark.com/">Benchmark</a> and <a href="https://www.thrivecap.com/">Thrive Capital</a>. They are the equivalent of a nightclub with an unmarked door, but other investors will need to <a href="https://teten.com/PE-social">shape up their social media tech stack</a>.</p>
<h2>3. Make your online profile data-driven and internally consistent</h2>
<p>All team members should have internally consistent and professional profiles on Linkedin at a minimum and typically also on Twitter, Facebook and/or other platforms you use. In particular, highlight the metrics by which you measured <a href="http://teten.com/resume">your past activities</a>: size of exit, number of people you managed, budget you were responsible for, etc.</p>
<h2>4. Set up a data room with a completed due diligence questionnaire</h2>
<p>Among the most important information to include: details on return history, legal documents, fund organization chart, <a href="https://medium.com/@eniacvc/seed-fund-portfolio-construction-for-dummies-9ec5b4d152dc">portfolio construction model</a>, portfolio company one-pagers, key personnel resumes and case studies of past investments. We are using <a href="http://digify.com">Digify</a> to manage this.</p>
<h2>5. Prepare FAQs for prospective LPs</h2>
<p>You will inevitably receive a wide range of one-off questions from potential LPs. Make sure to compile all your answers in a single document so that you can recycle and refine these answers.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://tophat.com/">Top Hat</a>, a startup that digitizes textbooks and turns them into an interactive experience for college students, announced on Wednesday that it has acquired yet another business: Fountainhead Press. The acquisition marks Top Hat’s third scoop of a publishing company in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Consolidation is going to be huge in the next few years for edtech, as bigger players raise enough financing (and gain profits) to be able to afford other businesses.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Top Hat’s whole business proposition is a subtweet to Zoom University: It wants to make learning an active, online experience and completely digital. That focus has let them reach 3.5 million students and thousands of universities. With a new acquisition, Top Hat is bringing more content into its fold, and with it, more customers who need a better solution to a dusty textbook.</p>
<p>I caught up with Top Hat CEO and founder <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSilagadze?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Mike Silagadze</a> to understand what has triggered this string of content acquisitions. While the M&amp;A isn’t tech-focused, we can learn about how a well-funded edtech startup is navigating the early innings of 2021.</p>
<p>We’ll talk about the shift from offline to online, edtech’s consolidation environment and why the “sell to Pearson or bust” mindset might officially be out the door for the sector.</p>
<h2><strong>Offline to online</strong></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Group Nine Media <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/group-nine-spac/">revealed last month</a> that it was forming a SPAC (short for special purpose acquisition corporation) in order to raise money for acquisitions.</p>
<p>The company has now moved forward with those plans, announcing last night that it had priced the SPAC&#8217;s IPO at $10 per unit, to raise a total of $200 million. It&#8217;s now trading on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol GNACU; as of 2:53 p.m. Eastern shares were up 6.55%. (Eventually, the Class A common stock will be listed as GNAC and warrants will be listed separately as GNACW.) The offering is expected to close on January 20.</p>
<p>The acquisition corporation, like Group Nine itself, is led by CEO Ben Lerer (pictured above). Imagination Capital Partner Richard D. Parsons and Reddit Chief Operating Officer Jen Wong are also on the board of directors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Group Nine was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/13/group-nine-media/">formed in 2016</a> with backing from Discovery, merging Thrillist, NowThis, The Dodo and Seeker. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/group-nine-acquires-popsugar/">subsequently acquired PopSugar</a>, with co-founder Brian Sugar becoming president of both Group Nine and now Group Nine Acquisition Corp.</p>
<p>SPACs, also known as blank-check corporations, have become an increasingly popular way for companies to raise money from the public markets. In its initial filing, Group Nine said it would use the funding &#8220;for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve got an Apple TV+ trial that&#8217;s set to expire sometime between now and June, good news: you&#8217;re getting some free bonus time.</p>
<p>Apple TV+ first launched in November of 2019, alongside a one-year free trial for anyone buying a new iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple TV or Mac. As those initial trials approached their end, Apple voluntarily <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/apple-is-extending-some-appletv-subs-through-february-2021-for-free/">extended them out to February of 2021</a>. Now they&#8217;re extending them once again.</p>
<p>As first reported <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/15/apple-again-extends-apple-tv-free-trials-subscribers-now-get-free-access-until-july-2021/">by 9to5Mac</a>, any trial that previously would&#8217;ve expired from February to June of 2021 will now expire in July instead. We have confirmed these plans with Apple.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Users should expect to get an email about the extension in the coming weeks. If you&#8217;re already paying for AppleTV+ or have it as part of an Apple One bundle, meanwhile, you&#8217;ll be getting a $4.99 per month credit until the end of June.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t already, take this as an opportunity to blast through Ted Lasso, which is probably the most charming thing anyone has made for TV in a decade. Central Park is also great, though it has yet to hook me in quite the same way as Loren Bouchard&#8217;s other series (Bob&#8217;s Burgers, Home Movies).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Desktop Metal this morning announced its intention to purchase fellow 3D printing company EnvisionTEC. Founded in Germany in 2002, EnvisionTEC specializes in photopolymer additive manufacturing, putting its technology in more direct competition with the likes of 3D printing darling Carbon than Desktop Metal’s own existing portfolio.</p>
<p>The deal follows Desktop Metal’s push to go public last August as part of a growing trend of SPAC mergers. Prior to this, the company had raised no shortage of its own funds, with a rapid ascent into unicorn status on the wake of $430 million in investments. It’s spending $300 million to acquire EnvisionTEC through a combination of cash and stock.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of potential for Desktop Metal to grow here. EnvisionTEC has the underlying technology with the ability to print in more than 190 materials, and Desktop Metal has the resources to help scale that tech beyond what the German company has been able to build thus far.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s clear that dental is a pretty huge piece of this puzzle. It’s among the clearest and most immediate use cases for this sort of mass volume 3D printing &#8212; and, indeed, the company already sports around 1,000 customers in dental, including companies like Smile Direct Club. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the company effectively tripled its Envision One dental shipments over the previous year.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s used for everything from restorations to same-day, full arch implants,” Desktop Metal CEO Ric Fulop tells TechCrunch. “Usually when you get a denture, you’ve got to wait three weeks for denture implants. This is the first time you&#8217;ve got a solution that can do it in the same day. And it’s affordable.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210115005221/en/Desktop-Metal-to-Acquire-EnvisionTEC-Entering-Market-for-Volume-Production-Polymer-Additive-Manufacturinghttps:/www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210115005221/en/Desktop-Metal-to-Acquire-EnvisionTEC-Entering-Market-for-Volume-Production-Polymer-Additive-Manufacturing">Per a press release</a> issued in the wake of the news, other existing customers include Ford and Hasbro. Fulop says the company will continue to operate as its own division after the acquisition, which is expected to close this quarter.</p>
<p>“We’ll be able to leverage their channel,” the executive says. “We look forward to expanding on that capability and using our channel to give them more tools to have a full solution that spans from metal to composites to biomaterials and now photopolymer printing.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp said on Friday that it won&#8217;t enforce the planned update to its data-sharing policy until May 15, weeks after news about the new terms created confusion among its users, exposed the Facebook app to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/whatsapp-faces-legal-challenge-over-privacy-in-its-biggest-market/">a potential lawsuit</a>, <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2021/01/11/turkey-investigates-whatsapp-and-facebook-over-data-privacy-update">triggered a nationwide investigation</a> and drove tens of millions of its loyal fans to explore alternative messaging apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re now moving back the date on which people will be asked to review and accept the terms. No one will have their account suspended or deleted on February 8. We&#8217;re also going to do a lot more to clear up the misinformation around how privacy and security works on WhatsApp. We’ll then go to people gradually to review the policy at their own pace before new business options are available on May 15,&#8221; the firm said in a blog post.</p>
<p>The messaging app, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/whatsapp-hits-2-billion-users-up-from-1-5-billion-2-years-ago/">serves more than two billion users</a>, said it was delaying the enforcement of the new terms, which it first unveiled last year, over confusion it has created worldwide. The delay of the planned privacy update is aimed at providing users with more time to review the terms, the company said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>&#8220;We’ve heard from so many people how much confusion there is around our recent update. There&#8217;s been a lot of misinformation causing concern and we want to help everyone understand our principles and the facts,&#8221; said the company, which earlier this week ran full-page ads on several newspapers in India, where it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/youtube-and-whatsapp-inch-closer-to-half-a-billion-users-in-india/">amassed over 450 million monthly active users</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2097220" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2097220" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2097220 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-app-update.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-app-update.jpg 1199w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-app-update.jpg?resize=150,59 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-app-update.jpg?resize=300,117 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-app-update.jpg?resize=768,300 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-app-update.jpg?resize=680,265 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-app-update.jpg?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2097220" class="wp-caption-text">For years, WhatsApp has been attempting to curb the spread of misinformation on its app. Now, it&#8217;s attempting to debunk falsehoods about WhatsApp itself. Image Credits: WhatsApp </p></div></p>
<p>Through an in-app alert, WhatsApp had asked users earlier this month to agree to new terms of conditions that grants the app the consent to share with Facebook some personal data about them, such as their phone number and location. Users will have to agree to these terms by February 8 if they wish to continue using the app, the alert said.</p>
<p>The change has been mischaracterized by many as their personal communication being compromised, which WhatsApp also <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/answering-your-questions-about-whatsapps-privacy-policy">clarified</a> this week was not the case. WhatsApp, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/19/facebook-buying-whatsapp-for-16b-in-cash-and-stock-plus-3b-in-rsus/">Facebook bought for $19 billion in 2014</a>, has been sharing some limited information about its users <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/25/whatsapp-to-share-user-data-with-facebook-for-ad-targeting-heres-how-to-opt-out/">with the social giant since 2016</a> &#8212; and for a period allowed users to opt-out of this.</p>
<p>&#8220;With these updates, none of that is changing. Instead, the update includes new options people will have to message a business on WhatsApp, and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data. While not everyone shops with a business on WhatsApp today, we think that more people will choose to do so in the future and it’s important people are aware of these services. This update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook,&#8221; WhatsApp wrote today.</p>
<p>Following the backlash, tens of millions of confused and angered users have flocked to Signal and Telegram. As of earlier this week, Signal was the top app on the App Store in 40 nations and Google Play Store in 18.</p>
<p>In an<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/"> interview with TechCrunch earlier this week</a>, Signal co-founder and executive chairman Brian Acton (who also co-founded WhatsApp) said “the smallest of events helped trigger the largest of outcomes. We’re also excited that we are having conversations about online privacy and digital safety and people are turning to Signal as the answer to those questions.”</p>

			Lawson&#8217;s basic philosophy is that if you can build it, you should.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Lawson&#8217;s basic philosophy in the book is that if you can build it, you should. In every company, there is build versus buy calculus that goes into every software decision. Lawson believes deeply that there is incredible power in building yourself instead of purchasing something off the shelf. By using components like the ones from his company, and many others delivering specialized types functionality via API, you can build what your customers need instead of just buying what the vendors are giving you.</p>
<p>While Lawson recognizes this isn&#8217;t always possible, he says that by asking your developers, you can begin to learn when it makes sense to build and when it doesn&#8217;t. These discussions should stem from customer problems and companies should seek digital solutions with the input of the developer group.</p>
<h2>Building great customer experiences</h2>
<p>Lawson posits that you can build a better customer experience because you understand your customers so much more  acutely than a generic vendor ever could. &#8220;Basically, what you see happening across nearly every industry is that the companies that are able to listen to their customers and hear what the customers need and then build really great digital products and experiences &#8212; well, they tend to win the hearts, minds and wallets of their customers,&#8221; Lawson told me in an interview about the book this week.</p>

<p>He says that this has caused a shift in how companies perceive IT departments. They have gone from cost centers that provision laptops and buy HR software to something more valuable, helping produce digital products that have a direct impact on the business&#8217;s bottom line.</p>
<p>He uses banking as an example in the book. It used to be you judged a bank by a set of criteria like how nice the lobby was, if the tellers were friendly and if they gave your kid a free lollipop. Today, that&#8217;s all changed and it&#8217;s all about the quality of the mobile app.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nowadays your bank is a mobile app and you like your bank if the software is fast, if it is bug free and if they regularly update it with new features and functionality that makes your life better [ … ]. And that same transformation has been happening in nearly every industry and so when you think about it, you can&#8217;t buy differentiation if every bank just bought the same mobile app from some vendor and just off the shelf deployed it,&#8221; he said.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.blockpartyapp.com/">Block Party</a>, an anti-harassment startup that aims to help folks feel safer on social media founded by Tracy Chou, launched today. Currently only available for Twitter, Block Party helps people filter out the content they don&#8217;t want to see and into what Block Party calls the Lockout Folder. That&#8217;s where all of the filtered-out content lives in the event you want to review it later.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think it&#8217;s important to still acknowledge that these people exist,&#8221; Chou told me.</p>
<p>If you pretend like it doesn&#8217;t exist, you might miss out on useful information or genuine connections.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There’s a lot of good stuff that would get lost there,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There is a reason we use public platforms like Twitter.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>On the more negative side, she said, you still may need to check periodically to see if there&#8217;s someone threatening your physical safety.</p>
<p>Helpers play a big part of the Block Party experience. You can grant a trusted helper access to your Lockout Folder to let you know if there&#8217;s anything useful in there, or to simply block the trolls.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a lot easier for someone else to help you process it and flag something that is a concern,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s nice to be able to share that burden. The current design of most of these platforms is to put the burden of dealing with it solely on the person who’s being abused.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The Lockout Folder also serves as a record-keeping tool in the event you need to present evidence of your harassment to a company, a lawyer or someone else.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2097150" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2097150" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2097150" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="294" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png 985w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png?resize=300,130 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png?resize=768,332 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png?resize=680,294 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2097150" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screenshot/Block Party</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really about trying to make people&#8217;s lives easier,&#8221; Chou said. &#8220;It&#8217;s just so painful to have to see the abuse again when you&#8217;re filing the report.&#8221;</p>
<p>Block Party emerged from Chou&#8217;s own experiences working at platform companies like Facebook and Quora, as well as her experience as an outspoken advocate for diversity and inclusion in tech. At Quora, the block button was one of the first things she built after being harassed on the platform, Chou told me.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s that perspective of having been on the inside and seeing how product and engineering teams work,&#8221; Chou said. &#8220;But also being a DEI activist and seeing how lack of representation on teams has impacted product decisions for the worst.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Block Party is only available for Twitter users, the goal is to add other platforms and help folks address harassers that target them across multiple platforms. Block Party is currently free but plans to introduce subscription tiers. Still, Chou said she envisions the free version always existing.</p>
<p>To date, Block Party has raised a little less than $1.5 million in funding. Its lead pre-seed round was led by Charles Hudson of Precursor Ventures. Other investors include Alexia Bonatsos, Ellen Pao, Alex Stamos and others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the day a violent mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, a worried GitHub employee warned his co-workers in the D.C. area to be safe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After making a comment in Slack saying, “stay safe homies, Nazis are about,” a fellow employee took offense, saying that type of rhetoric wasn’t good for work, the former employee told me. Two days later, he was fired, with a human relations representative citing a “pattern of behavior that is not conducive to company policy” as the rationale for his termination, he told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with TechCrunch, the now-former employee said he was genuinely concerned about his co-workers in the area, in addition to his Jewish family members. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch agreed to keep the identity of the terminated employee confidential due to fears of his and his family’s safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-github-backlash-jewish-employee-termination-2021-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Insider first reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, his firing led to employees circulating an internal letter asking GitHub to denounce white supremacy and Nazis. The employees also wanted answers about his firing. That led to GitHub CEO Nat Friedman telling employees the company would investigate the termination of the employee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the terminated employee says he is currently seeking counsel to ensure his family is protected, as well as figure out if he can receive damages or some other form of reconciliation. The fired employee said GitHub has reached out to him for help in the internal investigation, but is waiting to engage with the company until he has legal representation in place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, he said he is not optimistic about the investigation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am 90% sure it’s not genuine,” the terminated employee said of Friedman’s response. “This type of stuff had been said before. It happened with the ICE stuff where the company said let’s have discussions but then if you mention ICE, you get fired. I used to believe in this company, but now I don’t.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to what some employees are asking, the terminated employee sees this as an opportunity for GitHub to take a stance on white supremacy.</span></p>
<p>He said, &#8220;I feel like this could be an opportunity for GitHub to really do a purge and say ‘Do we want white supremacists at this company and how do we get Black leaders into executive management?’ &#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latter is something he said he’s been asking for since he joined GitHub. But as he kept talking about the lack of diversity at the leadership level, he said he found his job at risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I kept talking about it, I got threatened being fired in October,” he said. “Both my managers had to come completely to my defense and beg them not to fire me when I pointed out how the sales team maybe has just two people of color.”</span></p>
<p>In a blanket statement to TechCrunch about the contents of this article, a GitHub spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We take all complaints of this nature very seriously. We are actively investigating the situation.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon his termination, the former employee said the company gave him two paychecks and sent him on his way. He said he would be open to some form of reconciliation, whether in the form of damages, healthcare coverage or something else. While he’s not looking for his job back, he says he would like to see more worker power at GitHub. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I had a magic wand, I’d love for the employees at GitHub to be able to have a union and represent people from marginalized communities,” he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The United States’ GPS system, which is operated by the Defense Department, offers every one of us critical infrastructure around what is known as positioning, navigation and timing (PNT). Positioning and navigation is obvious every time we open up a maps app, but timing is also a critical function of GPS — offering our smartphones and devices precision timing to ensure that compute processes are accurately synced.</p>
<p>As more of the economy relies on these systems, they have increasingly <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/11/15/131940/ghost-ships-crop-circles-and-soft-gold-a-gps-mystery-in-shanghai/">become a target of hackers through GPS spoofing</a>. The government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/trump-administration-aims-to-protect-gps-with-new-exec-order/">wants to create additional redundancy and resiliency in the sector</a>, and has explored using commercial alternatives to augment or backup parts of the GPS system.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TBo0kr4pSJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/trump-administration-aims-to-protect-gps-with-new-exec-order/">Trump administration aims to protect GPS with new exec order</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The Department of Transportation, under a congressional mandate added to the defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2018, ran a comprehensive evaluation of commercial alternatives to government-owned and operated GPS that could serve as a backup to our existing infrastructure.</p>
<p>Among the 11 companies considered in the study were a number of prominent positioning startups, including Satelles, which raised a $26 million round of capital in 2019; NextNav, which has raised a total of nearly $300 million, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/nextnav-raises-120m-to-deploy-its-indoor-positioning-tech-to-find-people-in-skyscrapers/">including $120 million from Fortress a year ago</a>; and Hellen Systems, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hellen-systems/company_financials">which according to Crunchbase</a> raised a small seed round last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2021-01/NTRSA%20Report%20to%20Congress_Final_January%202021.pdf">You can read the full report from the DOT</a>, which runs to 457 pages and covers all 14 measures the researchers explored in evaluating these different PNT platforms.</p>
<p>The summary, though, is that there are a number of companies that offer decent backup capabilities for GPS, although the performance and cost vary widely. NextNav came out furthest ahead according to the researchers, who stated that “All [Technology Readiness Level]-qualified vendors demonstrated at least some PNT performance of value, but only one vendor, NextNav, demonstrated in all applicable use case scenarios.”</p>
<p>Beyond that, the DOT researchers said that “… none of the systems can universally backup the positioning and navigation capabilities provided by GPS and its augmentations.” Given the range of needs that GPS fulfills, they recommended that “a diverse universe of positioning and navigation technologies” be used to add resiliency in this infrastructure.</p>
<p>Finally, costs remain quite complicated to determine. Given the way that different positioning systems operate, the fixed and variable costs for each system are highly dependent on desired coverage area and necessary transmitter density. The researchers weren’t able to devise a clear opinion on the cost effectiveness of different systems, although they do offer some initial data that can provide early insight.</p>
<p>Given the importance of GPS and the desire for companies and the government to have reliable alternatives, VCs have dumped money on the PNT sector in recent years. Now, we have some hard data on which vendors are potentially picking up steam in terms of functionality and utility.</p>

<p>Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd was on the founding team at Tinder before starting Bumble. She <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/08/tinder-and-iac-settle-sexual-harassment-suit-with-early-employee-whitney-wolfe/">filed suit against Tinder</a> for sexual harassment and discrimination, which was at least somewhat inspirational in her quest to build a dating app that put women in the driver’s seat.</p>
<p>In 2019, Wolfe Herd took the helm of MagicLab, renamed to Bumble Group, in a $3 billion deal with Blackstone, replacing Badoo founder and CEO Andrey Andreev following a harassment scandal at the firm.</p>
<p>The company is targeting the public markets at a particularly heady time for new offerings, with <a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; border-bottom-color: #00a562;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/a-theory-about-the-current-ipo-market/">investors embracing </a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">venture-backed IPOs throughout late 2020 and the start of 2021</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. Previously privately held companies like Airbnb, Affirm and others have seen their fortunes soar on the back of prices that public investors are willing to pay, perhaps inducing more IPO filings than the market might have otherwise seen.</span></p>
<p>You can read its IPO filing <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1830043/000119312521009745/d20761ds1.htm">here</a>. TechCrunch will have its usual tear-down of the document later today, but we have pulled some top-line numbers for you to kick off your own research.</p>
<p>But before we do, the company&#8217;s board makeup, namely that it is over 70% women, is <a href="https://twitter.com/lesliepicker/status/1350119329606606849?s=21">already drawing plaudits</a>. Now, into its numbers.</p>
<h2>Inside Bumble&#8217;s IPO filing</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider Bumble from three perspectives: Usage, financial results and ownership.</p>
<p>On the usage front, Bumble is popular, as you would imagine a dating service would have to be to reach the scale required to go public. The company claims 42 million monthly active users (MAUs) as of Q3 2020 &#8212; many companies will try to get public on the strength of their third-quarter results from 2020, as it takes time to close Q4 and the full calendar year.</p>
<p>Those 42 million MAUs translated into 2.4 million total paying users through the first nine months of 2020; the percent, then, of paying users to MAUs is not 2.4 million divided by 42, but a smaller fraction.</p>
<p>Turning to the numbers, recall that Bumble sold a majority of itself a few years back. We bring that up as Bumble&#8217;s financial results are complicated thanks to its ownership structure.</p>
<p>After the IPO, Bumble Inc. will &#8220;be a holding company, and its sole material asset will be a controlling equity interest in Bumble Holdings,&#8221; per the S-1 filing. So, how is Bumble Holdings doing?</p>
<p>Medium? Doing the sums ourselves as the company&#8217;s S- 1 is fraught with accounting nuances, in the first nine months of 2019, Bumble managed the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenues of $362.6 million</li>
<li>Net income of $68.6 million</li>
</ul>
<p>And then, combining two columns to provide a similar set of results for the same period of 2020, Bumble recorded:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenues of $416.6 million</li>
<li>Net income of -$116.7 million</li>
</ul>
<p>For those following along, we&#8217;re using the &#8220;Net (loss) earnings&#8221; line, for profitability, and not the &#8220;Net (loss) earnings attributable to owners / shareholders&#8221; as that would require even more explanation and we&#8217;re keeping it simple in this first look.</p>
<p>While Bumble saw modest growth in 2020 through Q3 and a sharp swing to losses on a GAAP basis, the company&#8217;s adjusted profitability grew over the same time period. The company&#8217;s adjusted EBITDA, a very non-GAAP metric, expanded from $80.0 million in the first three quarters of 2019 to $108.3 million in the same period of 2020.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GOclutbA2n"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/a-theory-about-the-current-ipo-market/">A theory about the current IPO market</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A theory about the current IPO market&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/a-theory-about-the-current-ipo-market/embed/#?secret=GOclutbA2n" data-secret="GOclutbA2n" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While we are generally willing to allow quickly growing companies some leniency when it comes to adjusted metrics, the gap between Bumble&#8217;s GAAP losses and its EBITDA results is a stress-test of our compassion. Bumble also swung from free cash flow positivity during the first nine months of 2019 to the first quarters of 2020.</p>
<p>If you extrapolate Bumble&#8217;s Q1, Q2 and Q3 revenue to a full-year number, the company could manage $555.5 million in 2020 revenues. Even at a modest software-ish multiple, the company would be worth more than the $3 billion figure that we discussed before.</p>
<p>However, its sharp unprofitability in 2020 could damper its eventual valuation. More as we dig more deeply into the filing.</p>
<p>Finally, on the ownership question, the company&#8217;s filing is surprisingly denuded of data. Its principal shareholder section looks like this:</p>

<p>When we know more, we&#8217;ll share more. Until then, happy S-1 reading.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German startup <a href="https://www.getmoss.com/en">Moss</a> has raised a $25.5 million (€21 million) funding round led by Valar Ventures. Existing investors Cherry Ventures and Global Founders Capital are also participating. Moss provides credit cards and a spending platform to small and medium businesses in Germany.</p>
<p>The company has developed its own risk engine to come up with a credit card limit for your company. Like <a href="https://www.brex.com">Brex</a> in the U.S., Moss promises higher credit card limits compared to credit cards offered by traditional financial institutions.</p>
<p>Again, Moss doesn’t offer prepaid or debit cards — it focuses on credit cards. You can spend within your limit and pay at the end of the month. You don’t need to top up your Moss account to start using it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Credit cards work on the Mastercard network. Admins can issue a physical card for each employee or each team. You can also issue virtual cards for online payments and subscriptions. You can set different limits for each card.</p>
<p>From the administration panel, you can track expenses, search for specific expenses and see your ongoing subscriptions — it helps you identify duplicates. Users can attach receipts and information to each transaction for accounting purposes.</p>
<p>The company has issued 1,000 credit cards and has processes 10,000 transactions so far. Right now, its clients include startups and tech companies. But Moss expects to expand to other industries soon thanks to today’s funding round.</p>
<p>Moss competes with <a href="https://www.spendesk.com/en-eu/">Spendesk</a>, <a href="https://www.revolut.com/business/">Revolut Business</a> and others. These corporate card products focus on debit cards. Let’s see if offering credit cards turns out to be an important differentiating feature.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Medical Agency (EMA) has warned that information on COVID-19-related medicines and vaccines, which was stolen in a cyberattack last December and leaked online <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/cyberattack-ema-update-4">earlier this week</a>, includes correspondence that&#8217;s been manipulated prior to publication &#8220;in a way which could undermine trust in vaccines&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear exactly how the information &#8212; which includes schematics of drug structures and correspondence relating to evaluation processes for COVID-19 vaccines &#8212; has been doctored.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the agency with questions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One security researcher, Lukasz Olejnik, who has raised concerns about the leak <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik/status/1350091322988888065">via Twitter</a>, suggested the doctored data will be &#8220;perfect for sowing distrust&#8221; because the biotechnical language involved in the leaked correspondence will not be widely accessible.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now I understand why this data is perfect for sowing distrust. (disinformation). The documents are extremely hermetic, using niche biotech-technical language. No layperson is able to understand this. Perfect for conspiracy thinking, because it does have the numbers-percents. <a href="https://t.co/e0qfYoV3R0">https://t.co/e0qfYoV3R0</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Lukasz Olejnik (@lukOlejnik) <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik/status/1350091322988888065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Equally, it also seems possible that the high bar of expertise required to properly parse the data could limit how much damage the manipulated versions can do by limiting their viral appeal.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s notable the EMA has raised concerns over the risk to trust in coronavirus vaccines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two EU <a id="glossary-term-43236" class="ecl-link glossary-term" title="The approval to market a medicine in one, several or all European Union Member States." href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/glossary/marketing-authorisation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marketing authorisations</a> for COVID-19 vaccines have been granted at the end of December/beginning of January following an independent scientific assessment,&#8221; the EMA writes in the <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/cyberattack-ema-update-5">latest update</a> on the hack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amid the high infection rate in the EU, there is an urgent public health need to make vaccines available to EU citizens as soon as possible. Despite this urgency, there has always been consensus across the EU not to compromise the high-quality standards and to base any recommendation on the strength of the scientific evidence on a vaccine’s safety, quality and <a id="glossary-term-43193" class="ecl-link glossary-term" title="The measurement of a medicine's desired effect under ideal conditions, such as in a clinical trial." href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/glossary/efficacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">efficacy</a>, and nothing else.</p>
<p>&#8220;EMA is in constant dialogue with the EC, and other regulators across the network and internationally. Authorisations are granted when the evidence shows convincingly that the benefits of vaccination are greater than any risks of the vaccine. Full details of the scientific assessments are publicly available in the European Public Assessment Reports on EMA’s website,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, a criminal investigation into the cyberattack remains ongoing.</p>
<p>The attack has not been attributed to a specific hacking group or state actor and there&#8217;s no confirmation of who is responsible for trying to sew coronavirus-related disinformation by seeding doctored medical documents online.</p>
<p>However, last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/microsoft-russia-north-korea-hackers-coronavirus-vaccine/">November</a> Microsoft warned that hackers backed by Russia and North Korea had targeted pharmaceutical companies involved in the COVID-19 vaccine development efforts.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/tech-giants-must-open-up-about-the-coronavirus-infodemic-say-eu-lawmakers/">June</a>, the European Commission also raised concerns about the risks of coronavirus vaccine disinformation spreading in the coming months &#8212; simultaneously name-checking China and Russia as foreign entities it said it had confirmed as being behind state-backed disinformation campaigns targeting the region.</p>
<p>So suspicion seems likely to fall on the usual &#8220;hostile suspect&#8221; states.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve seen similar &#8220;doctored leak&#8221; tactics attributed to Russia before &#8212; typically related to attempts to interfere with elections by smearing candidates for high political office.</p>
<p>Researchers have <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/05/26/russian-dnc-hackers-planted-leaks-with-fake-data/">suggested</a> that the hackers responsible for the 2015-16 breaches of the Democratic National Committee&#8217;s network snuck doctored data into the leaked emails &#8212; an attack that was subsequently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/26/russia-dnc-hack/">attributed to Russia</a>.</p>
<p>While, more recently, there was the infamous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/suspect-provenance-of-hunter-biden-data-cache-prompts-skepticism-and-social-media-bans/">&#8220;Hunter Biden&#8221; laptop incident</a> &#8212; which supporters of president Trump sought to leverage against his challenger for the White House (now president-elect) in last year&#8217;s presidential race.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="79W6DMFXJn"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/suspect-provenance-of-hunter-biden-data-cache-prompts-skepticism-and-social-media-bans/">Suspect provenance of Hunter Biden data cache prompts skepticism and social media bans</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In that case, any disinformation punch <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/10/31/the-story-of-hunter-biden-and-the-diminishing-returns-to-disinformation">fizzled out</a> amid a raft of dubious claims around the finding and timing of the claimed data cache (along with much greater general awareness about the risk of digital fake smear tactics in political campaigns in the wake of revelations about the scale of Russia&#8217;s social media influence disops in the 2016 U.S. presidential election).</p>
<p>In an earlier incident, from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/05/french-presidential-frontrunner-macrons-emails-leaked-after-alleged-hack/">2017</a>, emails linked to the French president Emmanuel Macron&#8217;s election campaign also leaked online shortly before the vote &#8212; coinciding with <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-39845105">a document dump on an internet forum</a> that suggested the presidential frontrunner had a secret bank account in the Cayman Islands. A claim Macron&#8217;s political movement said was fake.</p>
<p>While in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/07/reddit-links-uk-us-trade-talk-leak-to-russian-influence-campaign/">2019</a> Reddit also linked to a suspected Russian political influence operation account activity involving the leak and amplification of sensitive U.K.-U.S. trade talks on its platform during the U.K. election campaign.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether that leaked trade dossier had been doctored or not (it was heavily redacted). And it certainly did not deliver a landslide election win to Jeremy Corbyn&#8217;s Labour Party &#8212; which used the leaked data in its campaign. But a similar, earlier operation which was also attributed to Russia had involved the leak of fake documents on multiple online platforms. (That disinformation operation was identified and taken down by Facebook in <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/05/more-cib-from-russia/">May 2019</a>.)</p>
<p>The emergence of leaks of doctored medical data linked to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments looks like a troubling evolution of hostile cyber disops which seek to weaponize false data to generate unhelpful outcomes for others &#8212; as there&#8217;s a direct risk to public health if trust in vaccine programs are undermined.</p>
<p>There have been state-level hacks targeting medical data before too &#8212; albeit without the pandemic-related backdrop of an ongoing public health emergency.</p>
<p>Back in 2016, for example, the <a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2016-09/wada-statement-regarding-additional-data-leak-via-russian-cyber-hacker-fancy-bear">World Anti-Doping Agency</a> confirmed that confidential medical data related to the Olympic drug tests of a number of athletes had been leaked by the Russia-linked cyber hacking group, &#8216;Fancy Bear&#8221;. In that case there were no reports of the data being doctored.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another Uber spinout is in the works.</p>
<p>Postmates X, the robotics division of the on-demand delivery startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/uber-officially-completes-postmates-acquisition/">Uber acquired last year for $2.65 billion</a>, is seeking investors in its bid to become a separate company, according to several people familiar with the plans.</p>
<p>The startup is being referred to as Serve Robotics, a nod to the yellow and black-emblazoned autonomous sidewalk delivery bot that was developed and piloted by Postmates X. The Serve robot, which recently partnered with Pink Dot Stores for deliveries in West Hollywood, will likely be the centerpiece of the new startup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Uber declined to comment.</p>
<p>Under the deal, which is being shopped to investors, the company would be run by Ali Kashani, who heads up Postmates X and leads the Serve program. Anthony Armenta would lead the startup&#8217;s software efforts and Aaron Leiba would be in charge of hardware &#8212; keeping the same positions they hold at Postmates X.</p>
<p>Uber would retain an ownership stake in Serve Robotics and maintain a commercial agreement with the startup. Serve would get the IP and assets in exchange. Uber is in discussions to retain about a 25% stake in the new startup, according to one source familiar with the deal.</p>
<p>There is not a legal entity — as of yet — named Serve Robotics. However, a website domain serverobotics.com was registered January 6.</p>
<h2>Uber&#8217;s path to profits</h2>
<p>The spinoff would be in line with Uber&#8217;s streamlined business strategy that began to take shape after its public market debut in May 2019 and accelerated last year as the COVID-19 pandemic put pressure on the ride-hailing company. Two years ago, Uber had enterprises across the transportation landscape, from ride-hailing and micromobility to logistics, public transit, food delivery and futuristic bets like autonomous vehicles and air taxis. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has dismantled the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach as he pushes the company toward profitability.</p>
<p>In 2020, Uber offloaded shared scooter and bike unit Jump in a complex deal with Lime, sold a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/uber-sells-500m-stake-in-its-freight-business-as-the-ride-hailing-giant-works-to-conserve-cash/">stake worth $500 million</a> in its logistics spinoff Uber Freight and rid itself of its autonomous vehicle unit Uber ATG and its air taxi play Uber Elevate.</p>
<p>Aurora <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/">acquired Uber ATG</a> in a deal that had a similar structure to the Jump-Lime transaction. Aurora didn&#8217;t pay cash for Uber ATG. Instead, Uber handed over its equity in ATG and invested $400 million into Aurora, which gave it a 26% stake in the combined company.</p>
<p>In a similarly crafted deal, Uber Elevate was sold to Joby Aviation in December.</p>

<p>Delivery remained the one area in which Uber has invested. The company, seeing an opportunity as demand skyrocketed for its Uber Eats delivery service, started looking for an acquisition to strengthen its position. Uber tried and failed to buy Grubhub, losing out to European heavyweight Just Eat Takeaway.</p>
<p>Uber landed on Postmates and in July 2020 agreed to buy the delivery startup in an all-stock deal valued at $2.65 billion. The deal closed in December.</p>
<h2>Serve, the friendly robot</h2>
<p>Postmates&#8217; exploration into sidewalk delivery bots began in earnest in 2017 after the company quietly acquired Kashani&#8217;s startup Lox Inc. As head of Postmates X, the company&#8217;s R&amp;D arm, Kashani set out to answer the question: why move two-pound burritos with two-ton cars?</p>
<p>Postmates revealed its first Serve autonomous delivery bot in December 2018. A second generation &#8212; with an identical design but different lidar sensors and few other upgrades &#8212; emerged in summer 2019 ahead of its planned commercial launch in Los Angeles.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/merchant-loading-serve.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1866098 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/merchant-loading-serve.jpeg" alt="merchant loading serve" width="4032" height="3024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/merchant-loading-serve.jpeg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/merchant-loading-serve.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/merchant-loading-serve.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/merchant-loading-serve.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/merchant-loading-serve.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/merchant-loading-serve.jpeg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/merchant-loading-serve.jpeg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/merchant-loading-serve.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /></a></p>
<p>Instead of working with a partner, Postmates used its own delivery data to form the foundation of how it would design and deploy a sidewalk bot, according to comments Kashani made during a TC Sessions: Mobility 2020 event in October.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you look at the data and see that over half of deliveries are within a short distance it becomes a no brainer &#8212; these robots can actually complete them,&#8221; Kashani said at the time, in reference to the application of autonomous delivery bots for delivery.</p>
<p>The Postmates X used historical delivery data from the company to develop a simulation, which was then used in the design of the Serve bot. It helped the team determine what battery life would be needed and the size of the cargo hold, among other features.</p>
<p>The bot only represented a sliver of Postmates&#8217; delivery business. However, the company has seen an increased interest in the bot in Los Angeles and San Francisco &#8212; the two cities where it commercially operates &#8212; as COVID-19 fueled demand for contactless delivery.</p>
<p>Kashani noted back in October that the bots had completed thousands of deliveries in Los Angeles and was preparing to expand into the city&#8217;s West Hollywood enclave. That expansion launched late last year with a twist. The Serve robots were changed to a bright pink to match the signature color of the Pink Dot stores.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I suspect it will be a while before I get excited over wireless earbuds. It’s not for a lack of trying on the part of manufacturers. In fact, quite the contrary. The category actually matured quite quickly, compared to various other verticals in the consumer electronics space. The truth is, most major hardware makers have gotten pretty decent at making a pair of wireless buds &#8212; many for pretty cheap.</p>
<p>Samsung’s been in that category for a while now. I’ve liked the last several models I’ve tried from the company. The sound quality has been good, they’re generally pretty comfortable &#8212; a good experience, all around. In fact, one of the issues I’ve raised the last couple of times is the fact that Samsung didn’t offer its own equivalent to products like the AirPods Pro and Sony WF-1000XM3 (though that latter reference is starting to become a bit dated).</p>
<p>It’s a hole in the lineup now filled by the Galaxy Buds Pro, which slot in the high end, above the Galaxy Buds Live and Galaxy Buds+. The naming conventions could be streamlined a bit, but it’s a small complaint in the grand scheme. At $199, the Pros are $30 more than the Live and $50 more than the Pluses. More importantly, it puts them at $50 less than the AirPods Pro – their clearest analogue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>And like Apple’s Pro buds, the Galaxy Buds are very specifically designed to operate with Samsung’s devices. You can still pair them with other Android handsets, but you’re going to lose key parts of the software integration. This honestly seems to be the way things are headed, with practically every smartphone company also manufacturing their own headphones. And certainly Samsung’s got enough market share that such a play makes sense.</p>
<p>If you do want to use them on another Android device, you can pair them by downloading the Galaxy Wearables app. You can pair them manually without the app, but you&#8217;ll lose a bunch more features in the process. Like past Galaxy Buds models, there’s no physical button on the case for pairing.</p>
<p>After several generations of devices, Samsung’s certainly got the foundation in place. And its purchase of Harman/AKG in 2017 has clearly played a key role in its ability to create some quality audio accessories. All of that comes into play here. Samsung’s made some solid choices on the design front. The charging case is remarkably compact. I was actually a bit surprised when I opened the package. It’s not nearly as long as the AirPods case, though it is a bit thicker. In any case, it’s certainly compact enough to carry around, unlike, say the Powerbeats Pro.</p>
<p>The battery claims are pretty impressive, given the size. The company rates the buds at five hours each and 28 hours with the case. Turn off active noise canceling and Bixby (I&#8217;ll let you guess which of those two I won’t miss) and the numbers bump up to eight and 20 hours, respectively. I will say that I was able to confidently bring the headphones with me on one of my lengthy morning sabbaticals without worrying about packing the case. That’s not something I can say about every wireless earbud.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2096816" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2096816" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2096816" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095441515.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095441515.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095441515.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095441515.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095441515.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095441515.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095441515.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095441515.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095441515.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2096816" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The headphones sport an 11-millimeter woofer and 6.5-millimeter tweeter. I found the sound to be an overall good mix, whether listening to music or a podcast. If you’re so included, you can also fiddle with the equalizer in the wearable app. It features six presets, rather than sliders, so it’s an imperfect science. But I didn’t really feel the need to mess around in there much.</p>
<p>The active noise canceling is solid, as well (okay, I admit it, Bixby is the one I’d drop in a heartbeat). I wasn’t really aware at how good a job it was doing drowning out street noise until I switched it off &#8212; this can be accomplished with a long press on the side touch panel or through the app. By default the former switches between ANC and transparent mode, skipping the off mode in the middle. Like the equalizer, you an adjust the level of ANC here &#8212; either high or low.</p>
<p>If you’re a Samsung true believer, Seamless Switch can be enabled, allowing you to, say, switch between a tablet and a phone when a call comes in. Other neat Samsung-specific features include the ability to use the buds as a kind of makeshift lavalier mic while recording video on the Galaxy S21. The SmartThings app can also be used to find misplaced buds. All in all, Samsung is clearly building up its ecosystem here.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2096821" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2096821" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2096821" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095538162.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095538162.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095538162.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095538162.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095538162.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095538162.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095538162.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095538162.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-13-095538162.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2096821" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The design of the buds themselves has been streamlined since the extremely bean-like Buds Live. The company says they were designed to minimize contact with the ear, to help relieve pressure. It’s a shame that everyone isn’t able to try every earbud on before buying &#8212; how they fit in your own ears is obviously an extremely personal thing.</p>
<p>I found, however, that one of my ears tends to ache when wearing them for a prolonged period &#8212; not an issue I’ve had with either the AirPods Pro or Pixel Buds (the Powerbeats Pro are also great in this respect). I found myself fiddling with them semi-regularly and triggering the touch mechanism in the process (this can be turned off by default in the app).</p>
<p>Most of my issues with the Buds Pro are pretty minor. They’re a worthy update to the line and a great pair of headphones if you’re a Samsung user.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you’ve been following the gaming space &#8212; or just the state of the world, generally &#8212; over the past 12 months, this shouldn’t come as a major surprise. Spending saw big increases pretty much across the board in 2020 as a homebound populace sought comfort and distraction in gaming. This comes in stark contrast to much of the rest of the consumer electronics space, in which economic uncertainty curtailed purchasing on non-essentials.</p>
<p>According to the latest figures from NPD, spending on gaming hardware, software and accessories was up 25% in December and 27% for the full year. Hardware specifically increased 38% year-over-year for December to $1.35 billion, with the arrival of next-gen consoles from Sony and Microsoft.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dec 2020 US NPD THREAD &#8211; December 2020 consumer spending across video game hardware, content and accessories reached a December record $7.7B, 25% higher when compared to a year ago. Full year spending also set a new record, totaling $56.9B, 27% higher than 2019. <a href="https://t.co/JFTL7eOEat">pic.twitter.com/JFTL7eOEat</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>That’s the highest figure since the $1.37 billion hit in December 2013, the year the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 arrived. In spite of this year&#8217;s new arrivals (which were hampered by limited availability), Nintendo’s Switch once again dominated sales for the month, with the PS5 grabbing the No. 2 spot. The Switch’s 2020 was the second-highest annual performance for a console, after the Wii in 2008.</p>
<p>The Switch &#8212; which turns three this March &#8212; got off to a slow start, courtesy of its own limited availability. But the arrival of a new Animal Crossing title helped rocket it to the top, as isolated consumers looked for new venues for social gaming. That title took the number three spot for the year, finishing behind Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (the former also topping the list for December).</p>
