										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.allocations.com/">Allocations</a>, a fintech startup building software to help smaller private equity funds form and operate, announced that it has raised a $4 million round at a $100 million valuation.</p>
<p>The startup also shared a host of performance metrics, including that it reached a $4.6 million revenue run rate in June, and a $6 million bookings run rate in the same month.</p>
<p>Allocations also told TechCrunch that it has posted 28% monthly revenue growth over the last 12 months. With metrics like that, our curiosity was piqued. What is Allocations building that is attracting so much early demand? And how does the company&#8217;s thesis regarding the future of private equity funds intersect with micro-venture funds themselves?</p>
<h2>What Allocations does</h2>
<p>Born from CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kadvani/">Kingsley Advani&#8217;s</a> efforts in building a community of angel investors, and the issues that he ran into spinning up special purpose vehicles (SPVs), Allocations started off as software built to scratch its founder&#8217;s itch. SPVs are an increasingly common way to raise capital for a single investment from pooled sources, and in today&#8217;s rapid-fire venture capital market, Advani had to race to get capital into deals before they closed.</p>
<p>As with many technology startups, Allocations is software designed to solve a known pain point. The old way of putting together SPVs just didn&#8217;t match the expected pace at which private investors are expected to commit to investing.</p>
<p>Today the startup&#8217;s software helps its users to create new SPVs and funds more quickly, also helping investors manage capital calls and the like after their fund is formed. The startup <a href="https://www.allocations.com/pricing">charges</a> either one-time (in the case of an SPV, by definition a single-shot investment), or recurring fees (multi-asset SPVs and funds). A 30-investment fund will cost its managers $15,000 per year through Allocations.</p>
<p>But how many funds are there for the startup to support? Is there enough market to allow Allocations to become a large enterprise itself? So far, the company has attracted some 300 funds to its roster. And Advani thinks that there will be plenty of demand. In an interview with TechCrunch, the founder noted that present-day denizens of major funds locked out of material carry &#8212; venture economic upside, more simply &#8212; can peel off and start their own fund, allowing them much better economics. That dynamic could spur demand for his startup&#8217;s services.</p>
<p>And Advani said that family offices and other major capital pools that once fought for allocation into brand-name venture capital funds and other private equity vehicles &#8212; venture capital is a subset of private equity &#8212; are increasingly chasing smaller funds that may post better returns than larger investing partnerships can manage. This is the law of large numbers in reverse; it&#8217;s easier to 10x a $10 million fund than a $10 billion vehicle.</p>
<p>And Advani expects his customers will put together multiple funds. Per the CEO, the goal of new fund managers is to get to their second fund. So, new managers often invest their first fund quickly in hope of reaching their second more quickly &#8212; more funds means more fees for Allocations.</p>
<p>In the startup&#8217;s view, the market will see many more small-scale private equity funds in time, perhaps smaller than $10 million in capital. This perspective mirrors what TechCrunch has seen in the market lately, with rolling funds rising to prominence in the early-stage startup investing, and solo GPs putting together what feels like more micro-funds than ever.</p>
<p>Allocations fits into the larger trend of fintech startups taking antiquated models in the world of money and making them faster, more modern, and often lower cost. Sure, there&#8217;s miles of distance between Allocations and Robinhood, but as both are about smaller investors, democratization of investing access, and using tech to tear down old walls, they are more brethren than different species.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> It&#8217;s a $4 million round, not $5 million. Post has been corrected.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">President Joe Biden is expected to set an ambitious new target for half of all new auto sales in the U.S. to be low- or zero-emission by 2030, a plan that has received tentative support from the Big Three automakers pending what they say will require hefty government support.</p>
<p>General Motors, Ford and Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler) issued a joint statement Thursday that they had “shared aspiration[s]” to achieve a 40% to 50% share of electric in new vehicle sales by the end of the decade, with the caveat that such a target “can be achieved only with the timely deployment of the full suite of electrification policies committed to by the Administration in the Build Back Better Plan.”</p>
<p>Some of the investments they list include consumer incentives, a national EV charging network “of sufficient density,” funding for R&amp;D and manufacturing and supply chain incentives.</p>
<p>Biden’s target, which will come in the form of an executive order on Thursday, will be nonbinding and entirely voluntary. The target includes vehicles powered by batteries, hydrogen fuel cells or plug-in hybrids.</p>
<p>Executives from the three OEMs, as well as representatives from the United Automobile Workers union, are expected to attend an event on the new target at the White House Thursday. Tesla, it seems, was not invited, according to a tweet from CEO Elon Musk.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Yeah, seems odd that Tesla wasn’t invited</p>
<p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1423156475799683075?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Biden will also be calling for new fuel economy standards for passenger and medium- and heavy-duty vehicles through model year 2026, which were rolled back under President Trump’s tenure, according to a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/05/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-steps-to-drive-american-leadership-forward-on-clean-cars-and-trucks/">White House factsheet</a> released Thursday. The new standards, which will be crafted under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency, should come as no surprise to automakers: They were included in Biden’s so-called “Day One Agenda” and mark a cornerstone of his strategy to combat climate change.</p>
<p>The new standards will likely borrow from those passed by California last year, which were finalized in concert with a coalition of five automakers: BMW AG, Ford, Honda Motor Co., Volkswagen AG, and Volvo AB. Those automakers, in a separate statement Thursday, said they supported the White House’s plan to reduce emissions. However, like the Big Three, they said that “bold action” from the federal government will be needed to achieve emission reductions targets.</p>
<h2>The road to 2030</h2>
<p>While Biden’s nonbinding order is more of a symbolic one, the targets are likely achievable, Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds&#8217; executive director of insights said in a statement. She added that automotive industry leaders “have seen the writing on the wall for some time now” regarding electrification, regardless of who has been in the White House.</p>
<p>Thanks to the relatively long product development lead time, many of the major automakers have already announced multibillion-dollar investments in EVs and AVs at least through the middle of the decade. That includes a $35 billion investment through 2025 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/gm-increases-ev-and-av-investments-to-35b-through-2025/">from GM</a> and $30 billion through the same year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/fords-30b-investment-in-electric-revs-up-in-house-battery-rd/">from Ford</a> &#8212; not to mention similar announcements <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/auto-giant-stellantis-to-invest-e30b-in-electrification-through-2025/">from Stellantis</a> and many billions earmarked for battery R&amp;D <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/volkswagens-new-business-strategy-puts-software-and-autonomous-driving-front-and-center/">from Volkswagen</a>, and even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/volvo-to-sell-only-all-electric-vehicles-by-2030/">Volvo Cars’ shift</a> to all-electric by 2030.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="F4NafdPaoI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/auto-giant-stellantis-to-invest-e30b-in-electrification-through-2025/">Auto giant Stellantis to invest €30B in electrification through 2025</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Auto giant Stellantis to invest €30B in electrification through 2025&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/auto-giant-stellantis-to-invest-e30b-in-electrification-through-2025/embed/#?secret=F4NafdPaoI" data-secret="F4NafdPaoI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>These massive numbers follow the automakers’ own sales targets, which are for the most part in line with Biden’s goal.</p>
<p>Fuel economy rules, however, have historically garnered slightly more mixed reactions from automakers. GM, Fiat Chrysler (now Stellantis) and Toyota had previously supported a Trump-era lawsuit that sought to strip California’s authority to set its own emissions standards &#8212; but each company eventually made an about-face, leaving the road open for Biden to introduce his own standards this year.</p>
<p>In a very real sense, Biden’s announcement is as much about geopolitics as it is about climate change. He, too, has seen the writing on the wall regarding EVs. His administration notes in the factsheet that “China is increasingly cornering the global supply chain” for EVs and EV battery materials. “By setting clear targets for electric vehicle sale trajectories, these countries are becoming magnets for private investment into their manufacturing sectors &#8212; from parts and materials to final assembly.”</p>
<p>While three times as many EVs were registered in the U.S. in 2020 versus 2016, America still lags behind both Europe and China in terms of EV market share, according to the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2021">International Energy Agency</a>.</p>
<p>The news has garnered a slew of mixed reactions, with some environmental groups urging more decisive action on the part of the administration. Carol Lee Rawn, senior director of transportation at Ceres, said in a statement that future standards should target a 60% reduction in emissions and a “clear trajectory” to 100% vehicle sales by 2035.</p>
<p>Although the UAW will be joining Biden at the White House on Thursday, President Ray Curry said in a statement that the group is “not focused on hard deadlines or percentages, but on preserving the wages and benefits that have been the heart and soul of the American middle class.”</p>

<p>When I learned that Windows and Mac were based in the United States, I was 10. Since then, I’ve wanted to come here to launch my own tech business.</p>
<p>What I didn’t realize back then was that the first half of that dream — coming to the U.S. — would provide me with essential training for realizing the second half — launching a business.</p>

			The behaviors, attitude and mindset required to traverse the U.S. immigration system are many of the same ones required to navigate the uncertain waters of entrepreneurship.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In 2019, I launched <a href="https://preflight.com/">Preflight</a>, which makes smart and fast no-code test automation software for web applications. One big reason the business currently exists is that, in my journey to getting asylee status in the United States, I became really good at three things: accepting uncertainty, building resilience and maintaining a positive mental attitude.</p>
<p>I needed them all to get Preflight off the ground.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The many paths to the U.S. (and launching a startup)</h2>
<p>I had my first shot at making my longtime dream a reality when I was applying to college as an undergraduate. I figured if I could go to school in the United States, I could find a way to stay and start a business.</p>
<p>After doing some research, though, I realized that U.S. colleges were too expensive.</p>
<p>But I figured getting out of Turkey, my home country, would be a start. I looked around for affordable schools and saw that France had good options. So I went to France.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even after three attempts, I wasn’t able to get a student visa. So I headed back to Turkey and went to college there. After graduation, I knew I had a second shot at the U.S.: a master’s degree. I applied to computer science programs and got accepted &#8212; a huge win!</p>
<p>I first arrived in Georgia, where I got my TOEFL certification, then enrolled at Tennessee State University, where I got a teaching assistantship.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, to do all this, I had to have the right visas. I needed a student visa for my master’s degree, but if I wanted to work after graduation, I’d need a work visa.</p>
<p>The thing is, though, I didn’t want to work at a “job.” I wanted to start my own business, which requires a different type of visa altogether.</p>
<p>Oh, and there was another factor at play: I was enrolled at Tennessee State from 2014 to 2016, during the lead-up to the election of Donald Trump. So in addition to trying to figure out which visa I could reasonably get, I had to deal with the fact that the rules for visas could all change in the coming months.</p>
<p>These experiences are similar to what many founders deal with every day in the process of launching and running a business.</p>
<p>We don’t know if our products will work or if they’ll find a market. We don’t know how changing regulations might affect what we’re doing. We have no idea when something like a pandemic will pull the rug out from everything we’ve built.</p>
<p>But we keep going anyway. In my experience, the most successful founders are the ones who don’t wait for all the pieces to fall into place — they know that will never happen. They’re the ones who do the best they can with what they have. They trust that they’ll be able to adapt and adjust when things inevitably change.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my next lesson.</p>
<h2>Resilience: Hearing &#8220;no&#8221; as &#8220;not yet&#8221;</h2>
<p>Hearing “no” isn’t fun, especially when that “no” is about something you’ve wanted for more than a decade.</p>
<p>I experienced a lot of “no”s in my immigration journey, as one visa attempt after another failed. If I’d let any one of those failures stop me, I wouldn&#8217;t be where I am today — working at my own startup in the U.S.</p>
<p>The lesson I learned was to hear “no” as “not yet.” It’s been invaluable to me in my journey to becoming a founder.</p>
<p>For example: In 2014, while I was in graduate school, I learned about Y Combinator and decided that I wanted to be a part of it. Throughout grad school, I applied and got rejected three times.</p>
<p>The clock was ticking on my student visa, so I decided to shift my tactics. I applied to jobs at companies that were Y Combinator graduates to see what I could learn.</p>
<p>In 2016, I got hired at ShipBob, a Chicago-based company that was in <a href="https://www.ycdb.co/batch/s14">Y Combinator’s Summer 2014 batch</a>. I joined the team as its first full-time developer and the first one based in the States. From there, things changed dramatically.</p>
<p>For starters, I learned a lot. In my time with ShipBob — just two and a half years — we grew from 10 people to more than 400. I built two apps and applied to Y Combinator twice more and got rejected both times.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9kaAXYJ8Wr"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/4-lessons-i-learned-about-getting-into-y-combinator-after-13-applications/">4 lessons I learned about getting into Y Combinator (after 13 applications)</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;4 lessons I learned about getting into Y Combinator (after 13 applications)&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/4-lessons-i-learned-about-getting-into-y-combinator-after-13-applications/embed/#?secret=9kaAXYJ8Wr" data-secret="9kaAXYJ8Wr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But in my work growing and leading a team of developers, I saw a need for a product that didn’t yet exist: a smart, fast, no-code test automation tool.</p>
<p>My team was spending way too much time building tests for ShipBob’s latest updates to make sure existing functionalities worked when we deployed. But when the code changed too quickly, our tests were outdated. It was incredibly frustrating.</p>
<p>Then we hired two quality assurance engineers and it took them four months to get 10% automated test coverage.</p>
<p>These problems led me to an aha moment: I could build a company to address this. A tool that is fast in test creation and can adapt to the UI changes.</p>
<p>That company is Preflight, and it’s the one that finally got me admitted to Y Combinator in the Winter 2019 batch. I was ecstatic when I heard that we’d been accepted. But then I realized that I couldn’t actually work on Preflight full time with my current visa status — at least, if I wanted to one day make a salary, I couldn’t.</p>
<p>And that brings me to my next point.</p>
<h2>Maintaining a positive mental attitude as you face (many) challenges</h2>
<p>My professional life wasn’t the only thing that changed dramatically while I was at ShipBob. My immigration status also evolved.</p>
<p>ShipBob applied for and got me an H-1B visa, which made me eligible to work in the U.S.</p>
<p>But when I got accepted to Y Combinator on my sixth application, I knew I needed an alternative: If I left ShipBob to run Preflight, I would lose my H-1B and my ability to work in the U.S.</p>
<p>This kind of conundrum is all too familiar to most startup founders: There’s no new opportunity without a new challenge to accompany it.</p>
<p>So I did what any founder would do: I focused on the positive (I’d gotten into YC!) and dedicated myself to figuring out a different way to stay in the country.</p>
<p>First, I tried to apply for the EB-1 visa, but the required documentation was too burdensome. I don’t think any founder could prepare for that application without several months of preparation.</p>
<p>Then I tried the O-1. No luck.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="IdtsDs5eGy"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/dear-sophie-can-i-transfer-my-h-1b-to-a-startup-i-founded/">Dear Sophie: Can I transfer my H-1B to a startup I founded?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Dear Sophie: Can I transfer my H-1B to a startup I founded?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/dear-sophie-can-i-transfer-my-h-1b-to-a-startup-i-founded/embed/#?secret=IdtsDs5eGy" data-secret="IdtsDs5eGy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So I asked ShipBob if I could take an unpaid sabbatical, which would let me keep my H-1B status while I attended Y Combinator and worked on Preflight. They agreed. My brothers, who had both moved to Chicago and started working at ShipBob (you’re welcome, guys!) agreed to support me (thanks, guys!).</p>
<p>Finally, I had a solution that worked — but only for the time being. If Preflight was successful, I’d have to find a different way to stay in the country.</p>
<p>Transferring my H-1B to Preflight wouldn’t work, in part because it would require me to yield 70% to 80% ownership to my co-founder and agree that he could fire me at any time.</p>
<p>But there was another option I’d been reluctant to lean on: asylee status. In 2016, there was an attempted coup in Turkey (that’s the official story, anyway). I won’t get into the political details, but my family and I were supporters of the movement blamed for the attempt. As a result, we were at risk of imprisonment if we stayed in Turkey — and eligible for asylum status in the U.S.</p>
<p>I applied, but hoped that I’d land a work visa in the meantime, partly because asylum status can take years to get approved and partly because there was no telling whether the current administration would change the rules to make me ineligible before my status came through.</p>
<p>When I got accepted to Y Combinator, my asylum status was pending. When my initial sabbatical from ShipBob ran out, it was still pending. I asked for an extension and got it (thanks, ShipBob!). A few months later, I figured I could not get the visa sorted. I wanted to focus on my business and use asylum-pending status, which would give me work authorization for two years. I was therefore able to work on and take a salary from Preflight.</p>
<h2>Putting it all together</h2>
<p>My asylum was granted early this year, four years after applying. Getting asylee status was a big win because it meant I could realize my dream of running a business in the U.S. So I was, in some ways, at the resolution of my immigration journey — but I was just at the beginning of my journey as a founder.</p>
<p>Right away, I had my first experience applying all the lessons I’d learned in the last six years: We wanted to raise our first funding round. That funding would let me start taking a salary.</p>
<p>All told, we approached more than 100 VCs before we got a yes. But we did get that yes, and we raised a seed round of $1.2 million in September 2019.</p>
<p>It was a big win for Preflight, but it didn’t have the transformational power for the company I’d hoped for. That’s because, after closing our round, we didn’t focus on sales and marketing to the extent that we should have.</p>
<p>After several months of frustrating results, I consulted with my advisers about how to proceed. They offered me insight that seemed obvious once I had it — but that I may not have gotten on my own &#8212; which was discussing everything that’s happening internally with the investors. And the outcome was me being the CEO.</p>
<p>In the month and a half after I adjusted course based on my vision, I grew Preflight’s revenue 600% in just about two months.</p>
<h2>The only constant is change</h2>
<p>The whole startup ethos of disrupting what’s not working to improve people’s lives is based on the premise that the world is constantly changing. The global disruption caused by COVID-19 underscored that in a major way.</p>
<p>Founders who accept that change is inevitable and who embrace uncertainty, develop resilience for when things go wrong, and maintain a positive mental attitude about the ups and (especially) the downs of running a startup will be the ones who succeed for the long haul.</p>
<p>I’ve known since I was 10 that I wanted to run a company in the United States. Given the choice, I would have opted for a much smoother road to entrepreneurship. But what I’ve discovered is that the difficult immigration path I had to follow provided exactly the training I needed to succeed in the challenging role of a founder.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Drones are neat and fun and all that good stuff (I should probably add the caveat here that I’m obviously not referring to the big, terrible military variety), but when it comes to quadcopters, there’s always been the looming question of general usefulness. The consumer-facing variety are pretty much the exclusive realm of hobbyists and imaging.</p>
<p>We’ve seen a number of interesting applications for things like agricultural surveillance, real estate and the like, all of which are effectively extensions of that imaging capability. But a lot can be done with a camera and the right processing. One of the more interesting applications I’ve seen cropping up here and there is the warehouse drone — something perhaps a bit counterintuitive, as you likely (and understandably) associate drones with the outdoors.</p>
<p>Looking back, it seems we’ve actually had two separate warehouse drone companies compete in Disrupt Battlefield. There was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/12/intelligent-flying-machines/">IFM (Intelligent Flying Machines)</a> in 2016 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/vtrus-launches-drones-to-inspect-and-protect-your-warehouses-and-factories/">Vtrus two years later</a>. That’s really the tip of the iceberg for a big list of startups effectively pushing to bring drones to warehouses and factory floors.</p>
<p>The list now also includes <a href="https://www.corvus-robotics.com/">Corvus Robotics</a>, a YC-backed startup presumably named for the genus of birds that includes surprisingly intelligent species like crows and ravens (though, presumably, these ones don’t also travel together in murders). The company calls its offering &#8220;the world&#8217;s first unmanned warehouse inventory drones,” which is potentially disputable.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9SzI27FyhQY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=1&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>But the offering is interesting, nonetheless, effectively flying around to scan pallets for inventory purposes. According to a piece from <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/drone-warehouse-corvus-robotics">IEEE Spectrum</a>, the level-four autonomous drone network is capable of scanning 200 to 400 pallets an hour, including the downtime spent recharging (flying is hard work).</p>

<p>Speaking of that industry holy grail of full warehouse automation, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/third-wave-automation-raises-40m-to-bring-its-autonomous-forklifts-to-warehouses/">Third Wave Automation just announced</a> a $40 million Series B, led by Norwest Venture Partners and featuring Innovation Endeavors, Eclipse and Toyota Ventures.

<p>Fellow warehouse automator inVia Robotics, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210728005353/en/Microsoft%E2%80%99s-M12-and-Qualcomm-Ventures-%E2%80%93-Joined-by-Hitachi-Ventures-%E2%80%93-Co-Lead-Series-C-Round-for-Award-Winning-Robotics-Company-inVia-Robotics">announced a $30 million Series C</a> at the tail end of last month. Tech giants Microsoft (M12) and Qualcomm (Qualcomm Ventures LLC) led the round, which brings the California firm’s total funding up to $59 million to date. Hitachi Ventures also joined for the round. The company says it was able to grow pandemic-fueled growth to a 600% revenue increase in 2020.</p>

<p>And just because we couldn’t do all warehouse news this week (as tempting and easy as that might be), here’s a robot <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37OpI8dHTGU">from General Electric named ATVer</a>. The sundry tech conglomerate has been field testing the autonomous &#8216;bot with the U.S. Army. Military funding, mind, continues to be a pretty massive driver in robotics, for better and worse.</p>
<p>“Our project and partnership with the US Army has really enabled us to make some important advances in autonomous systems,” GE’s senior robotics Shiraj Sen says in a release. “We believe the advances made on this project will not only help accelerate the deployment of future driver-less vehicle technologies; they will help encourage more autonomous solutions in other industry sectors like energy, aviation and healthcare that people depend on every day.”</p>

<p>In just under the wire, Sarcos this morning announced a partnership with T-Mobile that will bring 5G teleoperation to the company&#8217;s  Guardian XT robot. Robotics are, of course, one of those things that frequently get tossed around when discussing the potential benefits of 5G&#8217;s low-latency connection. Honestly, it&#8217;s the sort of thing that gets rolled out on stage during press events (<em>cough</em> Verizon), because robots are surefire crowd pleasers. So, it&#8217;s nice seeing it applied to some actual systems here.</p>
<p>From the release,</p>
<blockquote><p>The T-Mobile and <span class="il">Sarcos</span> collaboration begins with the integration of 5G to develop a remote viewing system powered by T-Mobile’s high bandwidth, low latency 5G network. This enables workers, supervisors, outside experts, and others, whether they are based locally or remote, to watch tasks being performed by the robot as it is controlled by an operator in the field. The second phase of development is expected to include full T-Mobile 5G wireless network integration, allowing teleoperation of the Guardian XT robot over 5G, giving operators greater flexibility and increasing their safety by enabling them to perform tasks from a distance.</p></blockquote>

<p>No matter where you and your business fall on the startup spectrum, you’ll find plenty of information, inspiration and opportunity at Disrupt 2021. Here’s why three of your contemporaries think going to Disrupt is an essential part of the startup experience:</p>
<blockquote><p>I love Disrupt because it features incredible companies. My work exposes me to lots of companies all over the world but, inevitably, I run across startups at Disrupt I haven&#8217;t heard of yet. It&#8217;s always fascinating to explore opportunities and find ways to work together. — Rachael Wilcox, creative producer, Volvo Cars.</p>
<p>When you’re building a startup, you’re in the weeds. It&#8217;s hard to get a 30,000-foot view, see where your company is and where it can go. Going to Disrupt and seeing what other startups are doing gives you that important perspective. It’s a huge benefit. — Jessica McLean, director of Marketing and Communications, Infinite-Compute.</p>
<p>As a cross-border VC fund manager, I’m always looking to identify new tech trends and how we can bring them to Latin America. Disrupt provides terrific insight on trends in different industries like e-grocery, AI and big data. — Daniel Lloreda, general partner at H20 Capital Innovation.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Disrupt experience also includes watching the world-renowned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/">Startup Battlefield</a> pitch competition. A field of 20 off-the-hook startups will take the stage and vie for $100,000 in equity-free prize money.

		Swapnil Shinde is the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.zeni.ai/">Zeni</a>, the first AI-powered finance concierge for startups. 	</div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The startup world can be a rollercoaster. While investment continues to pour in — with both founders and investors looking for the next unicorn — the reality is that <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040915/how-many-startups-fail-and-why.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040915/how-many-startups-fail-and-why.asp&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1628200999412000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFGYa_67fqHf9_gyI50MwlGdDlDXg">90% of startups fail</a>, with over half of those going under in the first three years.</p>
<p>I’ve founded two companies that I grew and sold (Mezi and Dhingana). I encountered many of the issues that new founders face, learned on the job, and thankfully persevered. Using the knowledge that I acquired in my previous companies, I’ve founded a third — Zeni — to try and help founders make more informed, sustainable financial decisions.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			For many founders, a transformative idea and initial outside investment doesn’t translate into understanding the underlying financial complexities of running a business.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re just wrapping your seed round, or on to Series B, avoiding these common issues is the best way to ensure that you&#8217;re set on solid ground and free to focus on your vision.</p>
<h2>Why most startups fail</h2>
<p>Startups go under for a variety of reasons. Some fail to achieve product-market fit in a scalable way. Many others simply run out of money. While the above two reasons are often cited as the two primary reasons for startup failure, they’re also related. If you don’t solve a market problem and don’t generate customers, you’re eventually going to run out of money.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of the startups that fail shouldn’t. They’re led by bright entrepreneurs with a great idea. But for many founders, a transformative idea and initial outside investment doesn’t translate into understanding the underlying financial complexities of running a business.</p>
<p>When you break down the various complexities founders face in understanding business finances, there are three primary hurdles they face:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fragmentation of financial systems.</li>
<li>Time-consuming manual tasks.</li>
<li>Lack of real-time financial insights.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of the above issues put increased workload and strain on founders, which can lead to burnout. Owners, on average,<a href="https://www.embroker.com/blog/startup-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.embroker.com/blog/startup-statistics/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1628200999412000&amp;usg=AFQjCNESUXqQJ_XngrRe-KD8Qkd9u2VBiA"> spend around 40% of their working hours</a> on tasks like hiring, HR and payroll. While hiring is integral to a founders’ day-to-day role, other administrative tasks related to finance, HR and payroll distract founders from focusing on their overall vision and goals.</p>
<p>The good news is that by being aware of the above issues, you can solve them and eliminate the consequences of burnout, distraction and, ultimately, failure. Let’s talk about how.</p>
<h2>Consolidate fragmentation</h2>
<p>The financial decision-making and tasks of most startups start and stop with the founder. This means that bookkeeping, bill paying, invoicing, financial projections, employee payments and taxes all run into a bottleneck. Even worse, each of these functions requires another employee, vendor or third-party expert — finance firms, admins, CFOs, CPA firms — each using its own software and applications to accomplish their goals.</p>
<p>Each of these parties is reporting back up to the founder, who is then in charge of making sense of it all and disseminating the information to the entities that need it. This means that not only is everything slower, but often things fall through the cracks, as communication can become a serious issue.</p>
<p>Worse still, this creates cash flow problems, as bills go unpaid, invoices go unsent, and important financial documents are delayed. I’ve seen revenue go unreported and invoices unsent and uncollectable due to the fragmentation-bottleneck system most founders experience.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-selectable-paragraph="">During the thick of the pandemic last year, online food delivery company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/doordash-now-delivers-from-over-1800-convenience-stores-nationwide/">DoorDash expanded its offerings to include convenience store delivery</a>. Now, DoorDash customers in the U.S. and Canada can shop across multiple stores and categories in a single order.</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">With DoubleDash, as the program is called, customers can now tack onto your order of a pad Thai dinner, some tampons and ice cream from the local 7-Eleven. In most cases, it&#8217;ll all be brought to them by the same delivery person in one bundle, allowing customers to forgo any additional delivery fees.</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">The goal for customers is to increase convenience while preserving price expectations. For local businesses, there&#8217;s a possibility that some light prodding of the customer while they&#8217;re hungry and uninterested in leaving their homes will lead to more business. And for DoorDash, this move is another step towards making the app the ever-coveted &#8220;one-stop-shop&#8221; for all things delivery.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><div id="attachment_2185998" style="width: 364px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185998" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2185998" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DoubleDash-flow-2.png?w=152" alt="" width="354" height="700" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DoubleDash-flow-2.png 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DoubleDash-flow-2.png?resize=76,150 76w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DoubleDash-flow-2.png?resize=152,300 152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DoubleDash-flow-2.png?resize=768,1519 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DoubleDash-flow-2.png?resize=344,680 344w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DoubleDash-flow-2.png?resize=777,1536 777w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DoubleDash-flow-2.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185998" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> DoorDash</p></div></p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Ever since we began offering convenience as a category on DoorDash over a year ago, we’ve observed that many customers organically order their restaurant meal and then place another order for convenience items within a 30 minute window,&#8221; Fuad Hannon, DoorDash&#8217;s head of new verticals, told TechCrunch. &#8220;We are always thinking about ways to improve our platform to serve our customers’ needs and after observing this consumer behavior, we wanted to make this process easier and more affordable for consumers.&#8221;</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">With DoubleDash, after a customer place their original order, a pop up on the app will entice them with additional items from nearby stores. Customers can also look for the DoubleDash option on the in-app map to search for nearby stores. Depending on the customer&#8217;s location and proximity to the merchant, anywhere from one to five merchants will show up on the map. Customers can add on as much or as little as they want for the second order, as there&#8217;s no minimum order size.</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">Delivery workers, or &#8220;Dashers,&#8221; will be able to collect tip on both the first restaurant order and the second merchant order, according to the company. Dashers can use DoorDash&#8217;s logistics platform to accept both orders at once and deliver them together without deviating from the primary route, thus potentially increasing earnings without going too far out of their way.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">This new feature is available with 7-Eleven, Walgreens, Wawa, QuickChek, the Ice Cream Shop and DashMart, a DoorDash-owned convenience and grocery store. DoorDash is also piloting the ability to partner local restaurants with DoubleDash in several markets like Los Angeles, Denver and Portland, so if you want to start with sushi and end with a chocolate torte, it&#8217;ll be just a little bit cheaper and easier to do so.</p>
<p id="c25d" class="ic id gr ie b if jk ig ih ii jl ij ik il jm im in io jn ip iq ir jo is it iv cx ew" data-selectable-paragraph="">“We are excited to be a part of DoorDash’s newest endeavor, DoubleDash, and for the opportunity to reach new customers and drive additional sales for our business,&#8221; said Benjamin D. Arreola, owner of Señor G’s Fresh &amp; Healthy Mexican Food in Playa Del Rey, California, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.refurbed.co.uk/">Refurbed</a>, a European marketplace for refurbished electronics which raised a $17 million Series A round of funding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/refurbished-electronics-startup-refurbed-raises-17m-round-led-by-evli-growth-partners/">last year</a>, has now raised a $54 million Series B funding led by Evli Growth Partners and Almaz Capital.</p>
<p>They are joined by existing investors such as Speedinvest, Bonsai Partners and All Iron Ventures, as well as a group of new backers — Hermes GPE, C4 Ventures, SevenVentures, Alpha Associates, Monkfish Equity (Trivago Founders), Kreos, Expon Capital, Isomer Capital and Creas Impact Fund.</p>
<p>Refurbed is an online marketplace for refurbished electronics that are tested and renewed. These then tend to be 40% cheaper than new, and come with a 12-month warranty. The company claims that in 2020, it grew by 3x and reached more than €100 million in GMV.</p>
<p>Operating in Germany, Austria, Ireland, France, Italy and Poland, the startup plans to expand to three other countries by the end of 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Astra&#8217;s last test launch went better than expected, nearly achieving orbit — kind of a stretch goal for that specific mission. The company at the time said that it would only need to tweak software to reach an orbital destination, and now we know when it&#8217;s going to get the chance to prove it: Astra revealed a launch window today of August 27 for its first-ever commercial orbital launch, a demonstration mission for the U.S. Space Force.</p>
<p>The contract Astra has with the Space Force also includes a second launch, set for sometime later this year, with the exact schedule for that launch yet to be finalized.</p>
<p>The payload that Astra&#8217;s rocket will carry for the Space Force will be a test spacecraft flown for the agency&#8217;s Space Test Program. The launch will take place from Astra&#8217;s spaceport in Kodiak, Alaska, which is where it has flown its test missions previously.</p>
<p>While the launch window officially opens at 1 PM PT on August 27, it will remain open all the way through Saturday, September 11, and Astra could easily shift the launch within that window based on weather conditions and other factors.</p>
<p>Astra, which became a publicly traded company at the start of July through a SPAC merger, builds it own launch vehicles at its factory in Alameda, California. The launch provider is targeting cheap, high-volume, low-mass launches as its milieu, offering more flexible services relative to SpaceX, and a cost advantage when compared to Rocket Lab.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cent.co/">Cent</a> was founded in 2017 as an ad-free creator network that allows users to offer each other crypto rewards for good posts and comments &#8212; it&#8217;s like gifting awards on Reddit, but with Ethereum. But in late 2020, Cent&#8217;s small, San Francisco-based team created <a href="https://v.cent.co/">Valuables</a>, an NFT market for tweets, and by March, the small blockchain startup was thrown a serendipitous curveball.</p>
<p>&#8220;We just wrapped up for the day, and I was about to go eat dinner, and all these people started texting me,&#8221; remembers CEO Cameron Hejazi. Then, he realized that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey had minted Twitter&#8217;s first-ever Tweet through Cent&#8217;s Valuables application. &#8220;I was basically like, mildly shivering for the rest of the night. The whole team, we were like, &#8216;Okay, battle stations, prepare to get hacked!&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>Dorsey ended up <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/22/twitter-ceo-jack-dorseys-first-tweet-nft-sells-for-2point9-million.html">selling his NFT</a> for $2.9 million, and he <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1374071729467707394">donated</a> the proceeds to Give Directly&#8217;s Africa Response fund for COVID-19 relief. But for Cent, it was as if the small company had just been handed a free marketing campaign. Now, about five months later, Cent is announcing a $3 million round of seed funding with investors like Galaxy Interactive, former Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, will.i.am and Zynga founder Mark Pincus.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">On <a href="https://v.cent.co/">Valuables</a>, anyone on the internet can place an offer on any tweet, which then makes it possible for someone else to make a counter-offer. If the author of the tweet accepts an offer (logging into Valuables requires you to validate your Twitter account), then Cent will mint the tweet on the blockchain and create a 1-of-1 NFT. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The NFT itself contains the text of the tweet, the username of the creator, the time it was minted and the creator&#8217;s digital signature. The NFT also includes a link to the tweet, though the linked content lives outside the blockchain.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185667" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185667" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2185667" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/centdorseytweet.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/centdorseytweet.jpeg 1290w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/centdorseytweet.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/centdorseytweet.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/centdorseytweet.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/centdorseytweet.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/centdorseytweet.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185667" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.cent.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cent <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing proprietary about minting tweets as NFTs &#8212; another company could do the same thing that Cent is doing. Even Twitter itself has recently dabbled in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/twitter-is-making-nfts-now-apparently/">giving away free NFT art</a>, though it hasn&#8217;t tried to sell actual tweets as NFTs like Cent. Still, Hejazi sees Dorsey&#8217;s use of Cent like an endorsement &#8212; he thinks it would be difficult for Twitter to shut them down, since Dorsey made $2.9 million on the platform himself. After all, Dorsey chose Cent instead of taking a screenshot of his first tweet, minting the .JPG as an NFT and posting it on a larger NFT platform, like OpenSea.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve spoken with people at Twitter. I&#8217;m positive that we have a healthy relationship going,&#8221; Hejazi said (Twitter declined to comment on or confirm whether that&#8217;s true). &#8220;We thought about applying this approach to other social platforms, like Instagram and TikTok, but we hypothesized that this is particularly suited for Twitter, because it&#8217;s a conversation platform, and it&#8217;s where all of the crypto people are actually living.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter is making NFTs now, apparently&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/twitter-is-making-nfts-now-apparently/embed/#?secret=Hgygouua7h" data-secret="Hgygouua7h" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With Cent&#8217;s seed funding Hejazi hopes to continue building the platform. The company&#8217;s goal is to enable anyone creative to make an income through the use of NFTs &#8212; that means developing tools to make it simpler for its users to mint NFTs, but also, building out its existing creator-focused social network. The content people post on Cent is usually creative work, like art and writing, rather than short posts &#8212; it&#8217;s closer to DeviantArt than it is to Reddit. These are lofty goals for a $3 million seed funding round, but there are aspects of Cent&#8217;s <a href="https://beta.cent.co/~discover/">Beta</a> platform that make it promising.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s already value in what we post on social media. It&#8217;s just being proxied through ad dollars, and it doesn&#8217;t have to be the case that there&#8217;s so much wealth concentration in a single entity. We can work toward a system that decentralizes that wealth,&#8221; said Hejazi. &#8220;These networks as they exist have monopolies on distribution &#8212; you can&#8217;t take your Twitter audience, download it as a .CSV and send them all an email.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185671" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185671" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2185671" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-1.14.35-PM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="334" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-1.14.35-PM.png 2868w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-1.14.35-PM.png?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-1.14.35-PM.png?resize=300,147 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-1.14.35-PM.png?resize=768,377 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-1.14.35-PM.png?resize=680,334 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-1.14.35-PM.png?resize=1536,754 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-1.14.35-PM.png?resize=2048,1005 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-1.14.35-PM.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185671" class="wp-caption-text">A screenshot of Cent&#8217;s social platform.</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to independent distribution lists, Hejazi wants to move away from the ad-supported internet. He references <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/is-substack-really-worth-650m/">Substack</a> as an example of a company where the creator has control of their list, and at the same time, the platform can remain ad-free, since the money that propels it comes from the users who pay to subscribe to newsletters (and also, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/substack-confirms-65m-raise-promises-to-rapidly-expand-its-financial-backing-of-newly-independent-writers/">venture capital</a> helps).</p>
<p>But Cent does something different by allowing users to essentially invest in creators who they think have the potential to take off on their platform.</p>
<p>Users can &#8220;seed&#8221; a post, which is how you subscribe to a creator participating <a href="https://www.cent.co/#Beta">on the creatives side of Cent&#8217;s platform</a>. As the seeder, you pay a set fee of at least one dollar per month. There&#8217;s an incentive to support up-and-coming creators on the platform, because seeders get a portion of the creators&#8217; future profit &#8212; it&#8217;s like making a bet on them that they will continue to make great content in the future. Five percent of profits go toward Cent, but the remaining 95% is split 50/50 between the creator and all of their past seeders. Participating on this platform would allow creators to network and show support for one another, but doesn&#8217;t prevent them from more directly monetizing their work on other creator platforms, like Patreon.</p>

<p>In addition to seeding posts, users can also &#8220;spot&#8221; other people&#8217;s posts &#8212; Cent&#8217;s version of a &#8220;like&#8221; button. Each &#8220;spot&#8221; is the equivalent of one cent from the user&#8217;s crypto wallet. Cent&#8217;s argument is that getting 1,000 likes on a post on other platforms yields nothing but a vague sensation of social clout. But on Cent, if a user gets 1,000 &#8220;spots,&#8221; that&#8217;s $10. Still, a project like this can only work if enough people use the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we started Cent, we chose cryptocurrencies because we loved the idea of someone being able to earn money with nothing more than their creativity and a crypto address,&#8221; Hejazi said. &#8220;Over time, we&#8217;ve found it to be limiting as a payment type &#8212; very few people actually own it and have it ready to spend. We&#8217;re working on ways to make payments to creators using Cent easier, and are exploring both crypto-native and non-crypto options.&#8221;</p>
<p>This mindset echoes other NFT startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/yat-thinks-emoji-identities-can-be-a-thing-and-it-has-20m-in-sales-to-back-it-up/">Yat</a>, which allows payments via credit card as part of its &#8220;progressive decentralization&#8221; model. So much of these companies&#8217; success depends on public buy-in toward an eventual decentralized, blockchain-based internet. But until then, companies like Cent will continue to experiment in reimagining how creatives can get paid online.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During the pandemic, especially when we were in lock down, just about every retailer had to build its online presence and do it quickly. As people move to shop online in larger numbers, being able to personalize that experience has become more crucial. That made the pandemic a pivotal moment for <a href="https://www.bluecore.com/">Bluecore</a>, an e-commerce personalization platform, and today the company announced a $125 million Series E on a $1 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Existing investor Georgian led the round with participation from other existing investors FirstMark and Norwest along with new investor Silver Lake Waterman. Today&#8217;s investment brings the total raised to $225 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>Up until fairly recently, Bluecore CEO and co-founder Fayez Mohamood says that retail outreach was mostly about driving traffic to brick and mortar stores or to the company website, but as more business gets conducted online, it has changed how brands have to interact with their customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe in that shift, and Bluecore is a retail-specific, multi-channel personalization platform, and we combine basically three types of data. First is customer identity. Second is shopper behavior. And then thirdly and most importantly, the product catalog of a retailer, and using that we drive personalized experiences on various channels,&#8221; Mohamood explained.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2013, and has been able to evolve the notion of personalization since then in a significant way. Mohamood says the pandemic really pushed things into the digital realm where his company&#8217;s strength lies and that&#8217;s one of the primary reasons they are taking on this funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Personalization has always been important, but I think the value retailers can derive from it has dramatically accelerated as digital became a bigger and bigger portion of everybody&#8217;s revenue stream. And over the last year, that became even more critical,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Boost ROI with intent data and personalized multichannel marketing campaigns&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/boost-roi-with-intent-data-and-personalized-multichannel-marketing-campaigns/embed/#?secret=hz5vTELACZ" data-secret="hz5vTELACZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As the company&#8217;s growth has accelerated so has the hiring. In May 2020 Bluecore had 236 employees, today it has over 300 and it&#8217;s shooting to be over 400 by the end of the year. He says that as he grows the company, diversity and inclusion is a crucial component to have the employee base reflect the diversity of the customers they serve.</p>
<p>&#8220;It starts with the executive team, so I&#8217;m extremely proud of the fact that on our executive team close to half our team is female. We have a committee that is represented by the core employees that is a diversity, equity and inclusion committee where we have thoughts and ideas and most most importantly actions on how we can build a better diverse, inclusive workplace. And that translates it into OKRs,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As a Series E company with a billion dollar valuation, Mohamood can see becoming a public company at some point, but it is not an immediate goal as he pursues growth over profitability. &#8220;The way we think about it is we have this brand that&#8217;s going to help us invest in our product capabilities, our leadership capabilities, and our go-to-market capabilities to build something that has the ability to [be a public company some day]. Having said that, we&#8217;re pursuing growth and if that&#8217;s the goal, we find that staying private helps us do that,&#8221; he said. And with $125 million of runway, the company plenty of freedom to take its time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more people dust off their luggage and passports after stowing them away during the global pandemic, <a href="https://elude.co/">Elude</a> aims to show travelers a new way to take spontaneous trips.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles-based startup launched its travel discovery mobile app Thursday, a budget-first search engine that shows people how far their money will take them. The platform’s personalized onboarding experience customizes trip packages and offers future travel suggestions based on those preferences.</p>
<p>The idea for the company came three years ago from Alex Simon, CEO, and Frankie Scerbo, CMO, who met in college and bonded over their love of traveling and would do so together any time they had a long weekend. One New Year’s they tried planning a trip, but everything was too expensive. Not being able to find something on their budget, they came up with the idea for Elude.</p>
<p>Rather than searching by destination, Elude gathers information like budget, time frame and trip preferences (think beach versus mountains), then presents users with flight and hotel results for destinations they may never have thought existed or could be traveled to on their budgets.</p>
<p>The company taps into the same flight and hotel databases that all online travel companies use that store hundreds of thousands of flights and hotels and only suggests hotels with 3.5 stars and above.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185849" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185849" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2185849" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Elude_PressKit_12.gif" alt="" width="600" height="338" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185849" class="wp-caption-text">Elude app</p></div></p>
<p>The co-founders have now raised $2.1 million in seed funding led by a group of investors including Mucker Capital, Unicorn Ventures, Upfront Scout Fund, StartupO, Grayson Capital and Flight VC.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When Erik Rannala, co-founder and managing partner at Mucker Capital, initially invested in Elude, it was before the global pandemic. However, he sees travel getting back to normal, though with flights now more expensive than before, more people are looking for travel deals, something that wasn’t being addressed until Elude came along.</p>
<p>Travel is “a massive category,” with most people in either “look mode” or “book mode,” with the money only being made in book mode, Rannala said. By taking a budget-first approach, Elude is bridging people from look mode to book mode more quickly.</p>
<p>“The way they have done it is to help people discover something new based on their budget that is available to book right now,” he added. “It’s a unique way to solve the problem and to give people a good deal.”</p>
<p>With millenials spending over<a href="https://www.thewanderingrv.com/millennials-travel-statistics/"> $200 billion annually</a> on travel, Elude’s goal is to reduce the hours of scrolling in search of a trip and more time actively booking vacations. Whereas competitors may show flights only or hotels only, Elude produces flight and hotel packages.</p>
<p>“In just a few clicks, we can show you, for example, that you could go to Barcelona for the same price as Miami,” Scerbo told TechCrunch. “If you knew that kind of information, you would take a better trip. This opens doors to taking a trip every few months instead of the one or two trips a year most people take.”</p>
<p>Prior to today, Elude was in private beta mode where the company had amassed some 40,000 people on the waitlist. Simon said.</p>
<p>Elude plans to use the funding to advance technology, marketing function, operations and customer support.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yesterday’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608507/google-leaks-unannounced-nest-camera-doorbell-online-store">leak</a> didn’t leave much to the imagination. And today’s big Nest reveal confirms pretty much everything we saw — which is precisely what happens when Google’s the one doing the leaking. Still, this morning’s announcement marks one of the biggest refreshes to Google’s home security line in recent memory, with updates to various configurations of Nest’s security cam and doorbell.</p>
<p>Depending on how you count, Google’s announcing up to four devices today. The list includes: the Google Nest Cam battery, Google Nest Doorbell ($180, each), the $280 Google Nest Cam with floodlight and the $100 Google Nest Cam.</p>

<p>The Nest Cams feature a design that looks a bit like they stepped out of some Pixar movie. The $100 basic Nest Cam is a second-gen wired device, designed for indoor-use only. The $180 model, meanwhile, adds battery power and waterproofing, making it suitable for either indoor or outdoor use.</p>
<p>The company says it should get around three months of battery life on a charge, assuming your home has an average of nine to 12 recorded “events” a day. The numbers obviously fluctuate a fair bit, depending on how much action your house sees on a typical day. The AI/ML is trained to record specific activities, triggered by things like people, animals or package deliveries, depending on the setting.</p>

<p>“Building a camera that uses ML to recognize objects requires showing the ML model millions of images first,” Google writes in<a href="http://blog.google/new-google-nest-latest-cams-and-doorbells-are-here"> a blog post</a>. &#8220;Our new Nest Cameras and Doorbells have been trained on 40 million images to accommodate lots of different environments and lighting conditions. Thanks to a cutting edge TPU chip, our new cameras run an ML model up to 7.5 times per second, so reliability and accuracy are even better. 3. Works in any home: Nest Cam and Doorbell’s wire-free design.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2185882" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185882" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2185882" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nest-Doorbell-battery-Snow-lifestyle-A-5x4-1.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nest-Doorbell-battery-Snow-lifestyle-A-5x4-1.jpeg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nest-Doorbell-battery-Snow-lifestyle-A-5x4-1.jpeg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nest-Doorbell-battery-Snow-lifestyle-A-5x4-1.jpeg?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nest-Doorbell-battery-Snow-lifestyle-A-5x4-1.jpeg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185882" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>I quite like the new streamlined design for the doorbell. Being battery powered means you can install it without having to futz with wiring. Without direct access to a hardwired chime, you can configure to ring through connected Google devices like Nest speakers and smart displays. Unlike the wired Nest Hello (which Google is keeping on the market), the new doorbell doesn’t offer continuous recording, owing to battery constraints. It should give you around three months of use, on average.</p>
<p>The new nest devices are up for preorder today in 18 countries and will go on sale August 24.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://statsig.com">Statsig</a> is taking the A/B testing applications that drive Facebook’s growth and putting similar functionalities into the hands of any product team so that they, too, can make faster, data-informed decisions on building products customers want.</p>
<p>The Seattle-based company on Thursday announced $10.4 million in Series A funding, led by Sequoia Capital, with participation from Madrona Venture Group and a group of individual investors, including Robinhood CPO Aparna Chennapragada, Segment co-founder Calvin French-Owen, Figma CEO Dylan Field, Instacart CEO Fidji Simo, DoorDash exec Gokul Rajaram, Code.org CEO Hadi Partovi and a16z general partner Sriram Krishnan.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Vijaye Raji started the company with seven other former Facebook colleagues in February, but the idea for the company started more than a year ago.</p>
<p>He told TechCrunch that while working at Facebook, A/B testing applications, like Gatekeeper, Quick Experiments and Deltoid, were successfully built internally. The Statsig team saw an opportunity to rebuild these features from scratch outside of Facebook so that other companies that have products to build — but no time to build their own quick testing capabilities — can be just as successful.</p>
<p>Statsig’s platform enables product developers to run quick product experiments and analyze how users respond to new features and functionalities. Tools like Pulse, Experiments+ and AutoTune allow for hundreds of experiments every week, while business metrics guide product teams to build and ship the right products to their customers.</p>
<p>Raji intends to use the new funding to hire folks in the area of design, product, data science, sales and marketing. The team is already up to 14 since February.</p>
<p>“We already have a set of customers asking for features, and that is a good problem, but now we want to scale and build them out,” he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Statsig has no subscription or upfront fees and is already serving millions of end-users every month for customers like Clutter, Common Room and Take App. The company will always offer a free tier so customers can try out features, but also offers a Pro tier for 5 cents per event so that when the customer grows, so does Statsig.</p>
<p>Raji sees adoption of Statsig coming from a few different places: developers and engineers that are downloading it and using it to serve a few million people a month, and then through referrals. In fact, the adoption the company is getting is “bottom up,” which is what Statsig wants, he said. Now the company is talking to bigger customers.</p>
<p>There are plenty of competitors for this product, including incumbents in the market, according to Raji, but they mostly focus on features, while Statsig provides insights and ties metrics back to features. In addition, the company has automated analysis where other products require manual set up and analysis.</p>
<p>Sequoia partner Mike Vernal worked at Facebook prior to joining the venture capital firm and had worked with Raji, calling him “a top 1% engineer” that he was happy to work with.</p>
<p>Having sat on many company boards, he has found that many companies spend a long time talking about sales and marketing, but very little on product because there is not an easy way to get precise numbers for planning purposes, just a discussion about what they did and plan to do.</p>
<p>What Vernal said he likes about Statsig is that the company is bringing that measurement aspect to the table so that companies don’t have to hack together a poorer version.</p>
<p>“What Statsig can do, uniquely, is not only set up an experiment and tell if someone likes green or blue buttons, but to answer questions like what the impact this is of the experiment on new user growth, retention and monitorization,” he added. “That they can also answer holistic questions and understand the impact on any single feature on every metric is really novel and not possible before the maturation of the data stack.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For Emily Elyse Miller, founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.eatofflimits.com/">OffLimits</a>, launching during a global pandemic was “interesting to navigate,” but in the end, worked out.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, ‘fun cereal’ is associated with being unhealthy, and I wanted people to have fun with their food again, but in a healthy way,” Miller told TechCrunch. “There are a few startups in the space tackling the healthy side of cereal, but I wanted to take on the culture of breakfast.”</p>
<p>She split her time between fashion and food, attending the Fashion Institute of Technology before getting into the trends and forecasting space. It was there that she started writing about food and design, traveling all over the world. She said she “became obsessed with morning rituals” and worked with chefs to open their doors for breakfast. She even <a href="https://emilyelysemiller.com/">wrote a book on breakfast</a>.</p>
<p>Miller launched OffLimits in 2020 out of <a href="http://science-inc.com/">Science Inc.</a>’s startup studio. OffLimits uses whole ingredients, and its flavors are organic, vegan, gluten-free and lightly-sweetened with organic cane sugar. Since its launch, OffLimits’ two cereals Dash (turns your milk into cold brew coffee) and Zombie (Pandan-flavored, similar to vanilla) were picked up in stores like Intelligentsia and are available online. The cereals retail for $8.50 per box.</p>
<p>She is now announcing a $2.3 million round of funding that encompasses friends and family, pre-seed and seed financing. The backing comes from Science Inc., Crosslink, Canaan, DBC Creative CEO Dana Cowin, Surface Magazine CEO Marc Lotenberg, TikTok executive Nick Tran and NTWRK president Moksha Fitzgibbons.</p>
<p>Miller said the breakfast market was valued at $16 billion in the U.S. and $30 billion globally. Building a cereal brand is capital-intensive and difficult to produce, so the new funding will go toward scaling into retail, hiring new talent and building up inventory.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, new brands like OffLimits have popped up, offering legacy brands a chance to pivot to new audiences, but largely they have not, she added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“There is definitely room to grow and with the Gen Z mindset of questioning legacy brands, we want to support what is new,” Miller said. “We are one of the few that are all plant-based, which was both a disturbing and surprising fact to find out. It was really important that OffLimits had an extremely clean panel. We want something all chefs can be excited about.”</p>
<p>In addition to the funding, the company released new flavors, including Spark (strawberry flavor with antioxidants) and Flex, which has a cinnamon flavor and is targeted toward a health and workout-oriented audience. To commemorate the company’s first year in business, it is offering a “birthday pack” so that customers can try all four flavors. Miller heard from customers that they like mixing cereal flavors, so the pack will encourage personalization. There is also an edible glitter product launching in September that Miller said “turns the cereal bowl into a disco party.”</p>
<p>Products sold out twice already and the company is now on its third production, with plans to offer mini boxes, where the milk can be poured directly in, and optimizing the supply chain for future growth.</p>
<p>Aside from the flavors, Miller wanted a focus on the boxes themselves and the mascots for each one. The cereal mascots all have profiles on the website and include a female pink bunny for Dash and a zombie that eats cereal all day.</p>
<p>“We don’t want to impart anything on the characters, and want to keep them open to be molded into different things,” Miller added. “We want to appeal to counter-cultures in whatever sense that is.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The indoor growing industry is starting to scale. Farms that utilize hydroponics (grow produce without soil, usually in large warehouses) and traditional greenhouses have started to become integral parts of our food supply chain, mainly for leafy greens like lettuce, spinach and arugula.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vertical hydroponic farming is often seen as a sustainable alternative to traditional growing. It uses 95% less water, has less impact on soil and the urban farms can be placed in food deserts or close to grocers to cut down on transportation costs. But the </span><a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/publications/indoor-soilless-farming-phase-i-examining-the-industry-and-impacts-of-controlled-environment-agriculture"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high-energy usage </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for lighting the indoor farms has often thwarted cutting down on carbon emissions from agriculture.  </span></p>

Overall, the global vertical farming market is expected to reach </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-vertical-farming-market-to-reach-5-8-billion-by-2026--301323466.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5.8 billion by 2026</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a compound annual growth rate of 14%. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Canadian-based startup </span><a href="https://us.justvertical.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just Vertical</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is working to add home gardeners to the indoor growing movement. Its two products, the Aeva and the Eve, are marketed as elegant pieces of furniture that can grow between eight and 10 pounds of food a month using hydroponic technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The products use a wooden cabinet as the base, and the growing mechanism extends upward about five feet. The Aeva and the Eve can grow leafy greens, zucchini, strawberries, herbs, peppers and cucumbers. The company is currently expanding into flowers and it even grew hops for microbreweries. Beyond selling the hardware, Just Vertical offers a subscription model for its seeds and peat moss pods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s meant for anyone that can’t grow either all year round or doesn’t have the capability without a backyard or a balcony,” co-founder Kevin Jakiela said. “We didn&#8217;t want to be just another countertop version.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those countertop competitors include </span><a href="https://www.clickandgrow.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click and Grow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.aerogarden.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aerogardens</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> which are mainly used for herbs. But larger competitors do exist, like </span><a href="https://www.towergarden.com/shop"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tower Garden </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://zipgrow.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ZipGrow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But Just Vertical is trying to be both décor and garden in a way these other versions are not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Jakiela, the company’s biggest markets are condos and homes, followed by restaurants, schools, cafes and bars. The company is also picking up interest in office space as décor rather than just truly food-focused.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to be an amenity in condominiums or houses &#8212; part of the pre-builds. Kind of like where you could choose your type of dishwasher and washing machine &#8212; we want to be the next microwave equivalent,” Jakiela said. “Also get into large retailers like IKEA.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has sold 1,500 units and has seed investment from District Ventures, the fund from Arlene Dickinson (a “shark” on Canada’s version of Shark Tank called Dragon’s Den). The company is currently aiming for a Series A this September. </span></p>
<p>[gallery ids="2185754,2185753,2185752"]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just Vertical’s high price point, between $600 and $1,000, makes it unlikely it will really make a difference for families that struggle with food security or even a huge impact on environmental concerns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakiela acknowledged that right now the target consumer is “a Whole Foods shopper.” But the website still touts data citing the environmental benefits of the products, including more than 112,000,000 miles of food transport saved and over 2,000,000 liters of water saved due to people growing their own food. But Jakiela hopes that, as the company scales, it can really start to make a social and business impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to be able to go away from the hobbyist and go for more impact,” he said. “Like a restaurant where they can truly offset some of their costs by using an Aeva, we want to be more front-facing in grocery stores. Build out our retail and distributed network, targeting the social piece of things.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just Vertical decided that starting on the high-end consumer side would help them prove market fit and be able to go to grocery stores with proven success to really make an impact. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s very difficult, especially as a startup, to go knocking on any grocery store’s door and say ‘hey, we have an idea for you,” he said. “They say ‘get out of here, come back with sales, come back with validation’ or you’re in a loop of an eight to 12-month process with no guarantees. There’s a lot of hoops to go through. [Grocers] don’t want to be first. But they don’t want to be last at the same time.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/checkmarx/">Checkmarx</a>, an Israeli provider of static application security testing (AST), has acquired open-source supply chain security startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dustico">Dustico</a> for an undisclosed sum.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Founded in 2020, Dustico provides a dynamic source-code analysis platform that employs machine learning to detect malicious attacks and backdoors in software supply chains.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The acquisition will see Checkmarx combine its AST capabilities with Dustico’s behavioral analysis technology to give customers a consolidated view into the risk and reputation of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/12/how-open-source-software-took-over-the-world/">open-source</a> packages, and as a result, a more comprehensive approach to preventing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/supply-chain-attack/">supply chain attacks</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The deal comes amid a sharp rise in supply chain attacks, in which threat actors slip malicious code into a trusted piece of software or hardware. Last December, it was revealed that Russian hackers had breached software firm SolarWinds to plant malicious code in its IT management tool Orion. This allowed the hackers — later identified as Russia&#8217;s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) — to access as many as 18,000 networks that used the Orion software.</p>
<p>Dustico’s technology, which is similar to that offered by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/sonatype/">Sonatype</a>, analyses open source packages using a three-pronged approach. First, it factors in trust, providing visibility into the credibility of package providers and individual contributors in the open-source community, and then it examines the health of packages to determine their level of maintenance. Finally, Dustico’s advanced behavioral analysis engine inspects the package and looks for malicious attacks hiding within including backdoors, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a>, multi-stage attacks, and trojans.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This insight, coupled with vulnerability results from Checkmarx’s AST solutions, aims to give organizations and developers greater insights for managing the risks associated with open-source and the supply chains dependent on them, according to the two companies.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to welcome Dustico and its team to Checkmarx as the Israeli tech ecosystem continues to push the boundaries of cybersecurity innovation and talent,” said Emmanuel Benzaquen, CEO of Checkmarx.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Blending Dustico’s differentiated approach to open-source analysis with Checkmarx’s security testing capabilities will bring disruptive value to our customers as they manage the challenges with securing software supply chains.”</p>
<p>The acquisition of Dustico comes after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/insight-partners-sells-security-firm-checkmarx-to-hellman-friedman-for-1-15b/">Checkmarx was bought by private equity firm Hellman &amp; Friedman</a> at a valuation of $1.15 billion in March 2020. Prior to this, in 2015, the company was sold to Insight Partners with an $84 million investment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company's platform enables real-time intervention for people with medication dependence and substance-use disorders.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Telehealth company Lucid Lane raised $16 million in Series A funding to continue developing its platform that enables real-time intervention for people with medication dependence and substance-use disorders.</p>
<p>Adnan Asar, co-founder and CEO of Lucid Lane, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/lucid-lane-has-developed-a-service-to-get-patients-off-of-pain-meds-and-avoid-addiction/">started the company five years ago</a> after watching his wife struggle to stop taking medication she was prescribed following an illness.</p>
<p>There are 40 million people prescribed opioids and benzodiazepines each year, many like Asar’s wife, after surgery or in conjunction with cancer treatment to address acute and chronic pain as well as co-occurring mental health challenges, he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>However, though the medications work well, out of the number of people prescribed, about 15 million people will continue to use the medication after the prescription runs out. This leads to ballooning healthcare costs with the healthcare system spending $150 billion annually to take care of this population, Asar said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lucid Lane has developed a service to get patients off of pain meds and avoid dependence&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/lucid-lane-has-developed-a-service-to-get-patients-off-of-pain-meds-and-avoid-addiction/embed/#?secret=rB9s6ve1NB" data-secret="rB9s6ve1NB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lucid Lane’s latest services are aimed toward avoidance of becoming a persistent medication user or addict. They include comprehensive medication taper management for those dependent on opioids, benzodiazepines, alcohol and nicotine, and a medication assisted treatment designed for patients diagnosed with opioid and alcohol substance disorders. The evidence-based treatments are available in more than 25 states.</p>
<p>Its technology utilizes web and mobile-based applications to provide remote patient monitoring and connection to dedicated therapists on a daily basis. A newly developed analytics engine collects health signals from patients to measure symptoms like anxiety, depression, pain levels and withdrawal effects so that the platform and therapists can personalize their treatments. If needed, the engine will connect patients instantly with an on-call counselor.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over 90% of Lucid Lane patients who start medication tapering safely taper off, while members who are persistent opioid or benzodiazepine users tapered by 50% in six months after they started the process, which is better than Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, Asar said. Patients also reported improvements in pain, emotional well-being and quality of life.</p>
<p>The Series A funding comes one year after the Los Altos-based company secured $4 million in a seed round. Accel Partners led the Series A and was joined by Battery Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures, Morado Ventures and strategic angel investors. As part of the investment, Eric Wolford, venture partner at Accel, joined the Lucid Lane board of directors.</p>
<p>Asar wasn’t planning for the Series A until later this year, but as the healthcare world was changing around him, venture capital firms began knocking on his door asking when he was raising the next round.</p>
<p>“I met Eric through Battery Ventures, and we had tremendous alignment with passion and mission and it seemed a great fit,” Asar said.</p>
<p>Wolford said he recognized how big of a problem opioid addiction was, that it was a worthy cause, and the size of the market opportunity. “There is something beyond the returns that is compelling, the extent of the problem and the awareness that exists already,” he added.</p>
<p>He also felt that Asar and his team knew the healthcare system and how to introduce technology into it. He mentioned that the industry is complicated to interface with due the complex nature of payers, providers, patients and regulations from state to state. He said that Lucid Lane was embracing the system and working with it.</p>
<p>Wolford was also attracted to the personalized nature of the company’s approach and that it can become the standard of care, taking the pressure off of doctors who want to do right by their patients, but want to prescribe less medication so they don’t become dependent.</p>
<p>“It’s a pressure release value so doctors are appropriately prescribing drugs, are accommodating patients and also providing an intervention to avoid the bad that may start,” he added. “Personalization is what doesn’t exist in healthcare right now, and will help get a person to a state of wholeness and encouragement while also progressing them when they are ready.”</p>
<p>Indeed, things are moving quickly for Lucid Lane. As with the healthcare industry itself, the global pandemic helped adoption of the company’s telehealth platform surge as remote care became more mandatory than a discretionary feature. In addition, Asar said it would have normally taken two years for the company to get into Medicare, but with the government’s updated regulations around telehealth, Lucid Lane is now nationwide with Medicare.</p>
<p>The company has a team of more than 40 therapists across 30 states and will be using the new funding to drive its commercial growth, including building up its sales, business development and product development teams. In addition to a leadership team with experience across the technology spectrum, Lucid Lane also announced that Beau Norgeot, former Anthem clinical AI executive, is joining the company as its chief data officer.</p>
<p>The company is also engaged in peer-reviewed, evidence-based, clinical trials at academic institutions, including Stanford University, the United States Veteran Affairs System and The University of Texas Health System.</p>
<p>“We are the only company addressing the whole spectrum of dependent patients and addicted patients,” Asar said. “Doctors don’t have the time or capability to do this, so we work with them to set a goal for patients to improve their quality of life and reduce their pain.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Latin America<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/why-latin-american-venture-capital-is-breaking-records-this-year/"> attracts record-breaking venture capital totals,</a> education technology startups in the region are given new opportunities to grow. In the past week, Coderhouse, a live cohort-based learning platform, and Crehana, an on-demand skills development service for the enterprise, both announced financing rounds.</p>
<p>The back-to-back raises are a reminder that edtech’s relevance in LatAm isn’t just growing in classrooms, but also within organizations across LatAm. It&#8217;s a sign that both consumers and employers believe in the importance of reskilling in today&#8217;s new, ever-changing future of work.</p>
<h2>Broad but better</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><a href="https://www.coderhouse.com/">Coderhouse</a>, founded in 2014 by Christian Patiño, is a platform for LatAm professionals to take live, online cohort-based courses in topics such as data, coding, design and marketing.</span></p>
<p>Patiño explained how the original online education platforms, also known as MOOCs, are “super accessible,” with low completion rates. The response to this then became boot camps, which he deems are “way more effective” but inaccessible due to low acceptance rates and high costs. With both sides of the spectrum in mind, he wants Coderhouse to sit somewhere in the middle, combining the affordability of MOOCs (massive open online course providers) and the engagement of bootcamps.</p>
<p>At $100 per course, Coderhouse offers small-group classes led by instructors and teacher assistants, with curriculum designed through partnerships with top companies.</p>
<p>The company announced this week that it has raised a $13.5 million Series A round led by Monashees, along with Reach Capital, David Velez from Nubank, Guillermo Rauch from Vercel, Hugo Barra (former head of VR at Facebook) and the founders of Loggi, Rappi, Wildlife Studios, Méliuz, MadeiraMadeira, Cornershop, Bitso, Casai, Clara, RunaHR and Belvo.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Coderhouse’s first venture capital check after bootstrapping for years. Since 2019, Coderhouse has grown revenue 10x year over year, and has reached a $12 million run-rate. Now, with formal backing, the founders are focused on growing that total by offering more services in Latin America. Patiño said that 80% of their revenue comes from Argentina, and the capital resources will help them grow their 21,000 student base to other countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The startup serves a variety of students, including people who are looking for new jobs, people who want to get promoted within their current companies and entrepreneurs and freelancers who want to master a business-imperative skill such as marketing or copywriting. The broadness in early adopters could make it hard for the company to provide outcomes at scale &#8212; someone looking to be promoted has very different needs than someone who is looking for a new job &#8212; but for now, it’s helping the early-stage company find its voice.</p>
<p>The round was the first LatAm investment for Reach Capital, a U.S.-based edtech firm. Partner Esteban Sosnik explained how Coderhouse’s strategy is a response to LatAm’s talent bottleneck, as digital momentum in the region continues and roles change. He believes the broadness of Coderhouse’s offering makes it “tough to define one definition for outcomes.”</p>
<p>Sosnik thinks that graduation rates are a good proxy for impact and student satisfaction. So far, 90% of users who pay for Coderhouse graduate from their course, and of that cohort, 80% of students claim that salaries increase post-graduation. Down the road, he could see Coderhouse offering more data on the long-term economic impact of how taking a course can impact job trajectory two to four years down the line.</p>

<p>The company has no filters that limit students from taking courses, so it maintains quality by rigorous vetting of teachers. The founder estimates that only 8% of teachers are accepted to teach on Coderhouse’s platform, resulting in nearly 2,000 active teachers with the company today.</p>
<p>A challenge for the startup will be scaling its teacher assistant [TA] to student ratio. Right now, there are 20 students to one TA, and Patiño wants to introduce more peer-to-peer work and grading to limit how labor intensive a class is for instructors.</p>
<p>As Coderhouse figures out how to be an affordable bootcamp for aspiring and current employees, Crehana is finding its stride in going straight to the companies that employ them.</p>

<h2><strong>Centralize it all</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.crehana.com/">Crehana</a> is a one-stop shop for employers to retrain their employees. Where it goes niche in clientele focus, it goes broad in services: It wants to do the “entire value chain” of learning, from assessing skill gaps to offering content to address weak spots to tracking progress. Right now, there are more than 400 instructors/mentors that teach over 700 courses across 100,000 techniques and competencies needed for jobs.</p>
<p>Crehana announced today that it has raised a $70 million Series B just months after a $13 million Series A extension round. Per CEO Diego Olcese, the round will lead to “aggressively scaling” an offering that now accounts for half of Crehana’s revenue: Crehana for Business.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="M9g8vnAwPz"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/the-2021-edtech-avalanche-has-just-begun/">The 2021 edtech avalanche has just begun</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Crehana for Business is an enterprise solution packaged for a specific company looking to up-skill a portion of their staff. Crehana will continue to offer individual seats on its learning platform, but Crehana for Business illustrates what Olcese sees as the future: the centralization of education as a focus within companies.</p>
<p>“We’re building this so companies can understand the end-to-end process of employee development in the company, from the onboarding process to when an employee gets promoted in their job,” he said. “We are centralizing that management for HR teams.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185919" style="width: 576px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185919" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2185919" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg" alt="" width="566" height="849" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185919" class="wp-caption-text">Diego Olcese, founder of Crehana. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Crehana</p></div></p>
<p>It’s a big bet, one that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/udemys-new-president-discusses-the-reskilling-companys-future/">Udemy has been working on for years. </a>The San Francisco-based platform launched an enterprise product that now has over 7,000 customers, hitting near $200 million in annual recurring revenue. Crehana didn’t disclose specifics around revenue, but did say that it had 10x year over year growth in Crehana for Business, with the overall business hitting 4x year over year growth; both metrics are between 2019 to 2020.</p>
<p>Olcese said that Crehana’s biggest difference from Udemy is in how it handles content. Crehana produces, designs and publishes all content on its site, and selects which teachers will instruct on which topics. Comparatively, Udemy has a <a href="https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003469994-Teaching-on-Udemy-FAQ">more open marketplace</a> that allows anyone to start teaching after their identity is verified.</p>
<p>Crehana’s hands-on content strategy makes sense, but is hard to scale; and content isn’t competitive forever. This tension is why the company thinks its future looks more like Crehana for Business, which uses content as part of a broader infrastructure on how employees are skilled, instead of looking like a content provider.</p>
<p>As it works toward becoming an education infrastructure layer, Crehana is experimenting with technology that would allow companies to create their own content that isn’t just localized to geography, but is tuned into personalities, management structures and more.</p>
<p>As for if it ever wants to become a company that would help Nubank, a LatAm fintech darling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/fintech-all-star-nubank-raises-a-750m-mega-round/">valued at $30 billion</a>, create its own mini-university to train and up-skill employees, the founder was clear: “It’ll be better than a university,” he said.</p>
<h2><strong>The Venn diagram in between them both </strong></h2>
<p>Generally speaking, Crehana and Coderhouse’s pair of financings show that investors see LatAm’s digital transformation having a fundamental, long-tail impact on edtech adoption within regional companies. The question then becomes, which is the best way to serve a newly hungry group of learners, and what is the easiest answer for employers&#8217; biggest stresses: unqualified candidates.</p>
<p>The two companies differ in strategy. Coderhouse, for example, believes in delivering education en masse and through affordable chunks. By using cohort-based methodology, the startup helps consumers work on specific skills that can help in a variety of different scenarios, from promotions to finding new jobs. Meanwhile, Crehana believes that going in-house with institutions could be the sweet spot needed to make true change. It is focusing on localized content as an initial moat, but long-term it thinks that employers need a simple way to track employees as they learn, retain and engage with new skills. The company may look more like a learning infrastructure than a content provider.</p>
<p>While the strategies look different in sales, both build off of current strides in edtech, not limited to but including the ability to learn online and the understanding that lifelong learning is a key competitive advantage for professionals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the time when people get loans, it’s for big life purchases such as a house or a car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But not every big purchase is a necessity. Some are more for fun, and the financing options for those types of buys &#8212; such as motorcycles and ATVs &#8212; are more limited. Today, </span><a href="http://www.octane.co."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Octane Lending</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company that embarked seven years ago on remedying that, announced it has raised $52 million in a Series D round of funding that values the company at over $900 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which offers &#8220;instant&#8221; financing for large recreational purchases, boasts impressive financials in a startup world whose inhabitants are mostly unprofitable. For one, Octane is both net income and operating cash flow positive, and expects to originate more than $1 billion in the next 12 months. It has been doubling revenue annually, and CEO and co-founder Jason Guss projects that the company will see “over $100 million in revenue” this year. Its valuation is now “more than double” what it was at the time of its July 2020 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$25 million raise, according to Guss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progressive Investment Company Inc., a member of the Progressive Insurance group, led its latest financing, which included participation from existing backers Valar Ventures, Upper90, Contour Venture Partners, Citi Ventures, Third Prime and Parkwood, as well as new investors Gaingels and ALIVE. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the latest round, New York-based Octane has now raised more than $192 million in total equity funding since its 2014 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Octane launched with the goal of “making lending better in overlooked markets,” according to Guss. Specifically, Octane initially set out to build a lender marketplace to streamline retail financing in the powersports category. Put more simply, it wanted to help people who want to buy things like motorcycles, snowmobiles, jet skis and ATVs get the financing they need to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We quickly learned that the buying journey in powersports markets was broken beyond just financing,” Guss told TechCrunch. “We elevated our goal to build an end-to-end buying solution including editorial content, consumer pre-qualification tools, instant full-spectrum financing and digital deal closing.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2185843" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185843" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2185843 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image001-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="578" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image001-1.jpg 1268w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image001-1.jpg?resize=150,127 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image001-1.jpg?resize=300,255 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image001-1.jpg?resize=768,652 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image001-1.jpg?resize=680,578 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image001-1.jpg?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185843" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Octane</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because lending is involved in about 80% of powersports purchases and about 80% of lending happens in the dealership, Octane focused first on building a lending platform for dealerships and consumers. Then in 2016, it launched Roadrunner Financial, a wholly owned-and-operated lender, so that it could offer full spectrum lending, “expand access to credit and speed up transactions through digitization and automation.” Today, the company is partnered with 3,800 dealers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an anchor in dealerships, Octane then expanded its scope. Last year, it acquired </span><a href="https://www.cycleworld.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cycle World</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.utvdriver.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UTV Driver</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, along with five other brands from Bonnier with a goal “to inspire and inform powersports enthusiasts across the nation.” Also last year, it launched Octane Pre-qual, which enables consumers to instantly prequalify for financing on OEM and dealership websites with a soft credit pull. With that offering, Octane aims to help direct consumers to a dealership, close their loan and complete their purchase in one place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are growing dramatically because we make transactions faster and simpler to close for consumers and dealerships,” Guss said. “We are the only platform to offer end-to-end purchasing benefits in the markets we play in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Octane plans to use its new capital to expand to adjacent “other passion purchase” markets and continue to launch customer engagement tools as well as buying solutions for consumers shopping for powersports vehicles online. It also wants to continue to add dealership, OEM and brand partners, which today include BRP, Suzuki and Triumph Motorcycles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We define a passion purchase as a major discretionary purchase that brings people joy,” Guss said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most innovation and investment is focused on large, marquee markets such as small business, auto and homes.” As people spent less toward travel and eating out once the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the powersports market got a boost, growing double digits last year, noted Guss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our core customer base was not significantly impacted by COVID economically so consumer demand and loan performance remained strong,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Quigg, chief strategy officer at</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Progressive Insurance, believes that technology and consumers’ needs continue to evolve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Octane’s point-of-sale loan origination platform provides benefits to consumers and dealerships in a specialty segment of the lending market,” he said. “We like to partner with innovative, forward-thinking companies and believe that our investment in Octane aligns very well with this strategy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Octane describes itself as a remote-first workplace that has offices in New York and Dallas. It has grown its team by 50% in the last year, from 213 to 336 employees.</span></p>
