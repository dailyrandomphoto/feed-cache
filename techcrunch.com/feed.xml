</div><p id="speakable-summary">Bipartisanship has long been out of fashion, but one common pursuit among Democrats and Republicans in Washington has been placing Big Tech companies under a microscope.</p>
<p>Congressional committees have held scores of hearings, lawsuits have been filed and legislation has been introduced to regulate privacy and data collection. The knock-on effect of these reforms for young companies and their venture investors is unclear. But one aspect of increased antitrust scrutiny — restrictions on acquisitions — would have a significant negative effect on our entrepreneurial ecosystem, and policymakers should approach these changes with caution.</p>
<h2>Acquisitions are an important element of the startup ecosystem</h2>
<p>For VC-backed companies, there are effectively three outcomes: standalone company (often via an IPO), merger or acquisition, or bankruptcy. Despite best efforts, company failure is the most common outcome &#8212; more than <a href="https://innovationfootprints.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/startup-genome-report-extra-on-premature-scaling.pdf">90%</a> of startups fail. Fortunately, the success stories are often companies with a big impact, like Moderna and Zoom, which helped the world in the pandemic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Acquisitions contribute to the health of the startup ecosystem, as entrepreneurs who realize liquidity through the sale of their company regularly go on to found innovative new companies and often invest in other startups as angel investors or venture capitalists.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs are optimists by nature, and so when the company journey begins, there is great hope of one day creating a standalone public company. However, in most cases, an IPO is not possible. The reality is that entrepreneurship is incredibly hard, and the journey from infancy to public company is one that relatively few companies achieve.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley Bank’s <a href="https://www.svb.com/globalassets/library/uploadedfiles/content/trends_and_insights/reports/startup_outlook_report/suo_global_report_2020-final.pdf">2020 Global Startup Outlook</a> puts it this way: “[T]he fact is most entrepreneurs never expect to reach a public market exit.” Accordingly, 58% of startups expect to be acquired<strong>.</strong> NVCA-Pitchbook <a href="https://nvca.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NVCA-2021-Yearbook.pdf">data</a> on acquisitions and IPOs back up the sentiment of founders when it comes to likely exit opportunities. In 2020, there was an approximately 10:1 ratio of acquisitions of VC-backed companies to IPOs, with 1,042 venture-backed companies acquired and 103 entering the public markets.</p>
<p>Some might argue that acquisitions are more dominant today because of the anti-competitive motivations of current tech incumbents. But as Patricia Nakache of Trinity Ventures said in <a href="https://nvca.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Testimony-of-Patricia-Nakache-SJC-as-submitted-9-23-19.pdf">testimony</a> before the Senate Judiciary Committee: “[Acquisitions have] been commonplace in the U.S. since before the dawn of the modern venture capital industry.” In fact, today we are witnessing <em>fewer </em>acquisitions relative to IPOs than in years past, as the average acquisition-to-IPO ratio since 2004 is approximately 15:1. This is happening against a backdrop of challenges in taking small-cap companies public that has reduced the number of companies in the public markets today.</p>
<p>Acquisitions contribute to the health of the startup ecosystem, as entrepreneurs who realize liquidity through the sale of their company regularly go on to found innovative new companies and often invest in other startups as angel investors or venture capitalists.</p>
<p>Furthermore, acquisitions help power the returns of VC funds, thereby allowing VCs to raise new funds and invest in the next generation of entrepreneurs. This “recycling effect” is one of the key drivers of dynamism in our economy and should not be slowed down.</p>
<h2>Acquisition changes could impact entrepreneurship</h2>
<p>Despite the importance of acquisitions, antitrust reform has included significant changes to how acquisitions are assessed by the federal government. The two most prominent examples in this space are Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s <a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/2/senator-klobuchar-introduces-sweeping-bill-to-promote-competition-and-improve-antitrust-enforcement">Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act</a> (CALERA) and Sen. Josh Hawley’s <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/senator-hawley-introduces-trust-busting-twenty-first-century-act-plan-bust-anti-competitive-big#:~:text=The%20Trust%2DBusting%20for%20the%20Twenty%2DFirst%20Century%20Act%20will%3A&amp;text=Replace%20the%20outdated%20numerically%2Dfocused,of%20competition%20in%20the%20U.S.">Trust-Busting for the Twenty-First Century Act</a>.</p>
<p>These bills are likely a reaction to <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/competition_in_digital_markets.pdf?utm_campaign=4493-519">findings</a> that incumbents have acted like Pac-Man, gobbling up would-be competitors before they become a competitive problem. But both proposals would ultimately harm startup activity and competition rather than propel it.</p>
<p>A common thread between these proposals is to restrict acquisitions by companies valued at more than $100 billion. Hawley’s bill would impose an outright ban on acquisitions by companies of that market cap that “lessen competition in any way.”</p>
<p>Klobuchar’s bill would shift the burden of proof to parties to an acquisition, a major change because the U.S. government bears the burden currently. This means if the government challenges an acquisition in federal court, the parties to the acquisition must demonstrate it does not “create an appreciable risk of materially lessening competition.” If that standard is not met, the acquisition could be blocked.</p>
<p>Both proposals have negative ramifications for venture-backed companies.</p>
<p>First, consider the scope of the proposals: A $100 billion company is indeed a large one, but setting the threshold there captures <em>far</em> more than the large tech companies that have been hauled before Congress for antitrust hearings. Globally, about 150 companies are valued at $100 billion or more, and the U.S. is home to more than 80 of those companies. That exposes acquirers as wide-ranging as Estee Lauder, John Deere, Starbucks and Thermo Fisher Scientific. If you are struggling to recall those companies being under the antitrust spotlight, then you are not alone.</p>
<p>Second, the legal standards imposed by these new bills are daunting. Klobuchar’s proposal leaves startups scratching their heads on where the line is on which acquisitions are tolerated, while Hawley’s bill throws up a misguided red light for vast amounts of acquisitions. These two standards are particularly vexing since acquirers are generally looking for acquirees that complement their existing business. In addition, many of the most acquisitive companies are multifaceted ones that presumably compete with an array of other companies in some way.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the bills from Klobuchar and Hawley would disrupt an important part of our nation’s startup ecosystem. Acquisitions act like grease to help keep the wheels moving by injecting liquidity into the system so participants can move on to create new and hopefully better companies for our country. Those wheels should not be slowed down when the country needs all the entrepreneurship it can muster.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bitcoin, Ethereum and a host of Altcoins suffered massive drops Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, erasing months of gains and hundreds of billions in market cap. The overall crypto market shrunk more than 20% over the past 24 hours according to crypto tracker <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s behind the drop? Well, some may say the market was flying too close to the sun as investors piled into speculative and technically unremarkable projects like Dogecoin. Others may pin the blame on Elon Musk, who announced that Tesla would no longer be accepting bitcoin for Tesla purchases, which investors feared could trigger a broader backlash among corporate adopters who they hoped would be encouraged to put bitcoin on their balance sheets.</p>
<p>Not all cryptocurrencies are seeing the same fortune, while Bitcoin dropped to nearly $31k, more than half its all-time-high, Ethereum fell to prices it first reached last month. Some of the steepest losses were seen by Dfinity&#8217;s Internet Computer token which has shed nearly 60% of its value in the past week. Meanwhile, multi-chain development platform Polygon has surged throughout the broader crash, up 88% this week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Public market investors got a taste for the crypto market&#8217;s volatility as Coinbase stock fell 5% Wednesday morning, down more than 47% from its briefly achieved all-time-high and 10% lower than its direct listing target price.</p>

<p>&#8220;Today, people have many ways to keep up with their favorite websites, including subscribing to mailing lists, notifications and RSS. It’s a lot for any one person to manage, so we’re exploring how to simplify the experience of getting the latest and greatest from your favorite sites directly in Chrome, building on the open RSS web standard,&#8221; Janice Wong, Product Manager, Google Chrome, writes in today&#8217;s update. &#8220;Our vision is to help people build a direct connection with their favorite publishers and creators on the web.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Google spokesperson told me that the way the company has implemented this is to have Google crawl RSS feeds &#8220;more frequently to ensure Chrome will be able to deliver the latest and greatest content to users in the Following section on the New Tab page.&#8221;</p>
<p>RSS was one of the fundamental technologies of <a href="http://jeffnolan.com/wp/2010/09/11/consumer-rss-1999-2010/">the Web 2.0 era</a>. Even today, it&#8217;s still the easiest way to get timely updates from your favorite sites (though some may not offer feeds anymore) without any recommendation algorithms getting in your way. Yet while RSS was always extremely useful, the user experience wasn&#8217;t always ideal, though services like Google Reader (RIP) and <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> did a lot to make it simple enough to subscribe to feeds and get updates. But when Google offered Google Reader at the altar of Google+ back in 2013, that era came to an end, even as diehard news junkies kept holding on to their Feedly accounts and old copies of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetNewsWire">NetNewsWire</a>.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people will be glad to see that Google is bringing it back as a core feature of its browser. If you prefer an open web, RSS, for all its occasional clumsiness, is the way to go.</p>
<p>For now, though, this is only an experiment. Google says it wants to gather feedback from &#8221; publishers, bloggers, creators, and citizens of the open web&#8221; as it aims to build &#8220;deeper engagement between users and web publishers in Chrome.&#8221; Hopefully, it won&#8217;t stay this way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://netlify.com">Netlify</a>, the startup that&#8217;s bringing a micro services approach to building websites, announced today that it has acquired YC alum <a href="http://FeaturePeek.com">FeaturePeek</a>. The two companies did not share the purchase price.</p>
<p>With FeaturePeek, the company gets a major upgrade in its design review capability. While Netlify has had a previewing capability called Deploy Previews in the platform since 2016, it lacked a good way for reviewers to discuss and comment on the design. The preview alone was useful as far as it goes, but having the ability to collaborate on the design remained a missing piece until today.</p>
<p>With FeaturePeek, the company can expand on Deploy Previews to not only preview the design, but also enable all the stakeholders in the design process to add their opinions, edits and changes as the design moves through the creation process instead of having to wait until the end or gather the comments in a separate document or communications channel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As FeaturePeek co-founder Eric Silverman told me at the time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/featurepeek-moves-beyond-y-combinator-with-1-8m-seed/">of their seed funding last year</a>, his product removed a lot of frustration when the web coders would get all their review comments at the last minute:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Right now, there’s no dedicated place to give feedback on that new work until it hits their staging environment, and so we’ll spin up ad hoc deployment previews, either on commit or on pull requests and those fully running environments can be shared with the team. On top of that, we have our overlay where you can file bugs, you can annotate screenshots, record video or leave comments.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Matt Biilmann, CEO and co-founder, Netlify says that when his company created Deploy Previews, it was in reaction to customers who were kloodging together their own solutions to the issue. They learned that even with their own preview feature, customers craved a communications capability.</p>

<p>In the classic build versus buy debate, the company began building its own, then it met the FeaturePeek team and decided to switch course. &#8220;We had a team working on a prototype when the founders of FeaturePeek, Eric and Jason, gave us a demo of their product. As the demo progressed, our jaws got increasingly closer to hitting the floor and we knew straight away that what we had just seen was miles away from both our internal prototypes and any of the other tools we had seen in the space,&#8221; Billman told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;It also quickly became apparent that fully building towards this vision as two different companies, without a deep end-to-end experience from initial Pull Request to a new feature release, would never really allow us to build what we were dreaming of, so we decided to join forces.&#8221;</p>
<p>The companies&#8217; combined effort actually comes together today in a new release of Deploy Previews that includes the new FeaturePeek collaboration/commenting capabilities.</p>
<p>FeaturePeek was founded in 2019, went through Y Combinator Summer 2019 batch, and raised around $2 million. Netlify was founded in 2014 and has raised over $97 million, according to Crunchbase. Its last raise was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/netfily-nabs-53m-series-c-as-micro-services-approach-to-web-development-grows/"> a $53 million Series C</a> in March 2020.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This morning, we're going over Squarespace's recently disclosed Q2 and full-2021 guidance. Then we'll ask how its expectations compare to its reference price-defined pre-trading valuation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s Squarespace direct listing day, and the SMB web hosting and design shop&#8217;s reference price has been set at $50 per share.</p>
<p>According to quick math from the <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/81903/Squarespaces-NYSE-reference-price-is-set-at-$50-ahead-of-Wednesdays-direct-">IPO-watching group Renaissance Capital</a>, Squarespace is worth $7.4 billion at that price, calculated using a fully diluted share count. The company&#8217;s new valuation is sharply under where Squarespace raised capital in March, when it added $300 million to its accounts at a $10.0 billion post-money valuation, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/squarespace-series-unknown--34dd8c02">according to Crunchbase data</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The company&#8217;s reference price, however, is just that: a reference. It doesn&#8217;t mean that much. As we&#8217;ve seen from other notable direct listings, a company&#8217;s opening price does not necessarily align with its formal reference price. Until Squarespace opens, whether or not it will be valued at a discount to its final private price is unclear.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spotify-ipo/spotify-shares-jump-in-record-setting-direct-listing-idUSKCN1HA12B"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1995214" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>While the benefits of a direct listing are understood, the post-listing performance for well-known direct listings is less obvious. Indeed, Coinbase is currently under its reference price after starting its life as a public company at a far-richer figure, and Spotify&#8217;s share price is middling at best compared to its 2018-era direct listing reference price.</p>
<p>This morning, we&#8217;re going over Squarespace&#8217;s recently disclosed Q2 and full-2021 guidance. Then we&#8217;ll ask how its expectations compare to its reference price-defined pre-trading valuation. Finally, we&#8217;ll set some stakes in the ground regarding historical direct-listing results and what we might expect from the company as it adds a third set of data to our quiver.</p>
<p>This will be lots of fun, so let&#8217;s get into the numbers!</p>
<h2>Squarespace&#8217;s Q2</h2>
<p>Per Squarespace&#8217;s <a href="https://newsroom.squarespace.com/blog/squarespace-releases-financial-outlook-2021">own reporting</a>, it expects revenues between $186 million and $189 million in Q2 2021, which it calculates as a growth rate of between 24% and 26%. That pace of growth at its scale is perfectly acceptable for a company going public.</p>
<p>For all of 2021, Squarespace expects revenues of $764 million to $776 million, which works out to a very similar 23% to 25% growth rate.</p>
<p>In profit terms, Squarespace only shared its &#8220;non-GAAP unlevered free cash flow,&#8221; which is a technical thing I have no time to explain. But what matters is that the company expects some non-GAAP unlevered free cash flow in Q2 2021 ($10 million to $13 million), and lots more in all of 2021 ($100 million to $115 million).<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The three co-founders of <a href="https://www.thegistsports.com">The GIST</a> are all themselves sports fans, but realized in 2018 that sports media in general left a lot to be desired when it comes to catering to audiences outside of the traditional, male-dominated stereoptyical sports audience. So they started a new kind of sports media enterprise, taking a risk on a very different kind of careers vs. their background in financial services in Toronto.</p>
<p>On the back of impressive 350% audience through 2020, c-founders Jacie DeHoop, Ellen Hyslop and Roslyn McLarty have now raises an initial $1 million round of seed funding, form investors including 3GP Capital, JDS Sports, August Group, Even Odds Investments, and Bettor Capital. The company also just got approved for a $350,000 loan from the Business Development Bank of Canada, bringing its total new funding across venture and state-backed credit incentives to $1.35 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the sports industry, as you probably are aware, less than 4% of coverage is on female athletes, and less than 14% of sports journalists are women,&#8221; explained McLarty, who is also The GIST&#8217;s head of finance, operations and growth. &#8220;It&#8217;s no wonder, as women, we don&#8217;t necessarily resonate with the the more traditional male-dominated sports media and the way that sports is represented. So we were finding it hard to be a part of that community sports can provide, and around the same time, we were seeing a trend of media companies developing these more authentic relationships with their audience, and building community and being built a little bit more ground up, and that being really effective.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>McLarty cites other media ventures including theSkimm, Morning Brew and The Hustle as examples of what her and her co-=foudners saw was working well in media. That approach, combined with what they saw as a massive potential untapped audience, led to the creation of The GIST, which because as a newsletter and has evolved into a news site, a podcast and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started with the purpose of making sports more accessible, inclusive, approachable and fun for a casual fan, or a female fan,&#8221; she said. &#8220;For anyone really, that hadn&#8217;t resonated with traditional sports media.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked McLarty why her and her co-founders wanted to get into the media business specifically, given that their experience prior to that was on Bay Street, which is effectively Toronto&#8217;s equivalent of Wall Street. She admitted that it took the trio some time to find their footing, but that now the business has opened up a new and growing audience that basically wasn&#8217;t served previously, which is helping them win over advertisers and brand partnerships.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ve discovered an audience that is really valuable, and there hasn&#8217;t really been a way for brand partners to engage with a female audience through sports,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So we&#8217;ve kind of found our niche, and have built really built things out and gotten to the point where we are today in a really lean lean way. The hard part was the initial investment in the audience to get it to the point where it is now, but once you hit that scale in the audience, the margins on the newsletter are obviously awesome for every additional person that we add on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The GIST&#8217;s partners include brands like the NBA, FanDuel, Red Bull and Adidas, to name a few, and it says its revenue is up over 1,000% this year vs. the year prior, on course to meet its goal of $1 million in total revenue for 2021. The company says it will be using the new funding to grow the team, including new hires on the content side, as well as additional headcount on the sales and operation teams, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ro, a digital elective care and telemedicine provider <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/ro-raises-500m-to-grow-its-remote-and-in-home-primary-care-platform/">last valued at $5 billion</a>, announced today that it has acquired Modern Fertility, a reproductive health company founded in 2017.<a href="https://twitter.com/danprimack/status/1395010948117712896"> Axios estimates</a> it sold for $225 million in a majority-stock deal. TechCrunch has learned that the deal was &#8220;north&#8221; of $225 milliion.</p>
<p>Ro, also founded in 2017, has spent the past few years growing its business to be far more than its launched purpose: a solution for men with erectile dysfunction. It has since expanded into women’s health, smoking cessation, and treats over 20 conditions, including sexual health but also into weight loss and allergies. The acquisition of a business that focuses on women’s health will likely fit squarely into Rory, Ro’s women’s healthcare business that focuses on online visits, contact-free delivery and “healthcare without the waiting rooms.”</p>
<p>With the acquisition, Ro said that it is adding fertility testing and reproductive health to its women’s health suite of services, a product that has grown 300% last year in revenue. Similarly, in Q1 2021, Modern Fertility grew about 300% in revenue compared to the year prior. Modern Fertility co-founders Afton Vechery and Carly Leahy will lead that vertical for Ro.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Modern Fertility is offering a comprehensive fertility test for women who hope to be moms someday&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/09/modern-fertility-is-offering-a-comprehensive-fertility-test-for-women-who-hope-to-be-moms-someday/embed/#?secret=Wgkell0QgP" data-secret="Wgkell0QgP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Beyond the fact that this is one of the biggest exits for a women’s health company with a focus on reproductive disorders, today’s acquisition is important because it’s another step in a healthcare system that is built on an entirely “cash-pay, no insurance” model. Since inception, Ro has bet that the future of healthcare can be built on out-of-pocket expenses, and that consumers are willing to pay directly to access a doctor instead of going through the hurdles of traditional insurance. That, of course, comes with missing out on the currently insured, which is still a large subset of Americans.</p>
<p>However, if the deal goes as planned, Modern Fertility entering the Ro umbrella might make the overall business have yet another pitch to consumers to use its service. Consumers are lazy, and if you can give them one place to get all their services &#8212; maybe even starting with fertility &#8212; it becomes a stickier and stickier operation. Other companies such as Everlywell and Future Family have similarly proven the market out there for comprehensive fertility solutions.</p>
<p>Plus, you can see how today’s deal jibes well with Ro’s <a href="https://medium.com/ro-co/welcome-workpath-63fa52177f11">December 2020 acquisition</a> of Workpath. Workpath is an in-home care API that allows Ro to create a vertically integrated primary care platform, so it can send professionals to a patient’s home or conduct diagnostic tests.</p>

<p>As far as acquisitions go for Ro, while last year was a broad bet on how to bring care services to others, this year is a new, niche bet on which care services will be most important to consumers going forward. Since Ro has raised nearly $900 million in venture capital raised to date, expect more in the M&amp;A front as the months roll on by.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Construction technology may not be the sexiest of industries, but it is one where tremendous opportunity lies &#8212; considering it has historically lagged in productivity. And, lags in productivity means project delays, which typically costs everyone involved more time and more money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a number of larger players in the space (think Procore, PlanGrid and Autodesk) that are tackling the problems from the perspective of the general contractor. But when it comes to the subcontractors that are hired by the general contractor to do 95% of the work, the pickings are few and far between.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter </span><a href="https://www.assignar.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assignar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a cloud-based construction tech startup that was originally born in Australia and is now based in Denver, Colorado. Co-founder and CEO Sean McCreanor was a contractor himself for many years, and grew frustrated with the lack of offerings available to him. So, as in the case of many founders, he set out to create the technology he wished existed.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today, Assignar has raised $20 million in a Series B funding round led by real estate tech-focused venture firm Fifth Wall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backer Tola Capital and new investor Ironspring Ventures also put money in the round, which brings Assignar’s total raised since its 2014 inception to $31 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I had 100 crews and workers out in the field, lots of heavy equipment and project work, and was running the entire business on spreadsheets and whiteboards,” McCreanor recalls. “With Assignar, we essentially help the office connect to the field and vice versa.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, Assignar’s operations platform is designed for use by “self-perform general and subcontractors” on public and private infrastructure projects. The company’s goal is to make the whole process smoother for large general contractors, developers and real estate owner-operators by providing a “real-time snapshot of granular field activity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, Assignar aims to streamline operations and schedules, track crews and equipment, and improve quality and safety, as well as measure and monitor productivity and progress with data on all projects. For example, it claims to be able to help match up the best crews and equipment for a specific job &#8220;more efficiently.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup says it has hundreds of international customers working on multibillion-dollar projects in infrastructure, road, rail, heavy civil, utilities and other construction disciplines. Those customers range from specialist contractors with as few as five crews to multi-national, multibillion-dollar companies. Projects include things such as bridges and roads, for example.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154435" style="width: 3061px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154435" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2154435 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg" alt="" width="3051" height="1884" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg 3051w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg?resize=768,474 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg?resize=680,420 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg?resize=1536,948 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg?resize=2048,1265 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3051px) 100vw, 3051px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2154435" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Assignar</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assignar historically has “more than doubled” its revenue every year since inception and in 2020, saw revenue increase by 75%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We could have grown faster but wanted to manage cash flow,” McCreanor told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assignar’s focus is particularly significant these days considering that the Biden administration&#8217;s Infrastructure Bill is nearing agreement, likely signaling an investment in infrastructure for communities across the U.S. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The heavy civil and horizontal construction industry has long lacked a well-designed and ubiquitous operations platform, according to Fifth Wall Partner Vik Chawla.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Assignar&#8217;s cloud-based software offers a detailed view on when and where different types of field activities are being performed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It streamlines communications between headquarters and the field, allows for a reduction in paperwork, and brings time and cost savings to an industry where much of the planning, tracking and reporting are still done by hand, in Excel or on white boards.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assignar plans to use its new capital to grow its business in North America (which currently makes up about 25% of its revenue) and double its 65-person team by hiring for roles across all departments. The company also plans to invest in R&amp;D and product development to further build out its core platform. Among the features it’s planning to develop is a contractor hub and a schedule recommendation engine that McCreanor says will leverage data, AI and machine learning “to support planning and execution processes.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://amperecomputing.com/">Ampere</a>, the server startup that is betting on bringing Arm-based chips to the data center and edge, is hosting its annual media day today. With the 80-core Altara and 128-core Altra Max, the company already offers a platform that can rival and outperform those of competitors like Intel and AMD in many common scenarios &#8212; and Altra Max is now in production and shipping. Those chips are based on the standard ARM Neoverse N1 architecture, though. But now, it is about to launch its own custom  Ampere Cores, built on a 5nm process.</p>
<p>&#8220;Altra and Altra Max are based on the N1 core from Arm. We&#8217;re an architecture licensee as well as an IP licensee, so we&#8217;re going to talk about our own core [at our media day]: what we built, how we built it, why we built it,&#8221; Ampere CEO Renee James, who spent 26 years at Intel before founding Ampere, told me. &#8220;And what does a cloud-native processor look like? We like to think about it like you think about M1 for a PC from Apple, you would think about an Ampere Core for a cloud data center server.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the 128-core Altra Max, Ampere promises a chip that uses 50% less power per core compared to an AMD Rome CPU and performance gains of 1.6x for running the NGINX web server, for example. And all of those benchmarks look even better when compared to an Intel Cascade Lake Refresh CPU. AMD&#8217;s Rome launched in August 2019 and Intel&#8217;s Cascade Lake Scalable Performance Refresh CPU have been in the market since last February.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all about developing that CPU that&#8217;s built for the cloud and making sure that we&#8217;re meeting the new &#8212; but not really not new anymore &#8212; but kind of the current and future needs of cloud-native workloads, that software development model, and that type of infrastructure deployment model,&#8221; Ampere&#8217;s CPO Jeff Wittich said. &#8220;Which for us really means developing a product that has high performance that&#8217;s very predictable across workloads across users and a very, very scalable platform for compute, memory, I/O, network, and that is very, very power efficient.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154521" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-185320.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154521" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2154521" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-185320.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="518" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-185320.jpg 1663w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-185320.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-185320.jpg?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-185320.jpg?resize=768,389 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-185320.jpg?resize=680,344 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-185320.jpg?resize=1536,778 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-185320.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2154521" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ampere</p></div></p>
<p>Wittich noted that Ampere had always planned to develop its own cores, in part because it offers a very specific product for a very specific use case. &#8220;We knew that from the start developing our own cores was going to be very, very important for us to innovate in the ways that we need to innovate,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have to say the primary thing is that because we&#8217;re focused on cloud &#8212; and we&#8217;re not focused on a bunch of other markets, especially not client, and also not other markets, even within the server space &#8212; it means developing a core that&#8217;s specific to cloud is really important to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ampere&#8217;s cloud customers want certain built-in security features and manageability features for performance and power, for example. And as Wittich stressed, those have to be built in at the micro-architecture level to work properly (and this allows the company to optimize performance, as well).</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to build our own cores to actually have a processor that does what the cloud wants,&#8221; he said. The Ampere Cores will, for example, feature high I/O memory bandwidth, for example, but optimized for cloud use cases, not high-performance computing use cases.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154524" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-191512.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154524" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2154524" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-191512.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="520" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-191512.jpg 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-191512.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-191512.jpg?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-191512.jpg?resize=768,390 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-191512.jpg?resize=680,345 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-191512.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2154524" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ampere</p></div></p>
<p>James echoed this, noting that customers want these features and Ampere&#8217;s competitors will offer them. &#8220;The cloud business is pretty specific and the customers are very demanding,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So cadence is really important and we are competing against customers who have really very good products.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems like this strategy is working out well for Ampere, which now counts the likes of Microsoft, Oracle and Tencent Cloud among its customers. Rumor has it that Microsoft is working on its own Arm-based chips as well, but interestingly, the company is also using Ampere&#8217;s media day to talk about how it is readying Azure for Altra.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The podcasting world remains one of the most vibrant formats in media (and I am not just saying that since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/techcrunchs-equity-podcast-wins-a-webby-award/">the Equity crew won a Webby yesterday for our not-that-humble podcast</a>). Its openness, diversity, freedom and ease-of-authoring has broadened the medium to all sorts of hosts on every subject imaginable.</p>
<p>We experience that dynamism and verve in our own audio listening, but then we start to tune into our company’s internal communications, and, well, you certainly don’t need sleeping pills to zone out. Top-down, formal, banal — corporate comms remains mired in a 1950s way of speaking that is completely out-of-sync with the millennials and Gen Z majority of workers who expect something actually worth watching and listening to.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getspokn.com">Spokn</a> wants to make company-wide podcasting a must-listen event, not just for leaders to talk to their employees, but for every worker to have a voice and share their expertise and stories across their workplaces. Through its app, companies can deliver personalized podcast feeds on everything from a daily standup or weekly AMA to training and development content, all of which is secure and kept for internal use.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s an idea that has quickly attracted investor attention. The startup, which was part of Y Combinator’s most recent Winter 2021 batch, closed on a $4 million seed round two weeks before Demo Day led by Ann Bordetsky, a partner at NEA <a href="https://www.nea.com/news/press-releases/nea-welcomes-ann-bordetsky-and-sheila-lirio-marcelo-to-its-technology-investing-team">who joined earlier this year</a> and previously served as COO of Rival. This is her first investment with the firm.</p>

<p>The company was founded by Fawzy Abu Seif, Mariel Davis and Mohammad Galal Eldeen. Abu Seif and Davis met each other in an Egyptian jazz club in November 2017, about a week after he had quit his job. They eventually came together not just as a couple — they got married in the fall of 2019 — but as business partners, linking up with Galal Eldeen and incorporating Spokn in April 2018.</p>

<p>Spokn’s product evolved across three iterations. First, the team tried to create audio narrations of evergreen content at major publishers like The New York Times. The idea was to help publishers reuse their best content as a new revenue source while connecting more listeners into these brands. Getting publishers to commit was tough though. “The consumer app wasn’t doing that great, and we started hunting around the data to see if something was working,” Davis said.</p>
<p>What they found was that professional development podcasts were much more popular compared to other topics, and so they had an opportunity to re-jigger the product to focus on training and specifically target enterprises. The idea was “let’s empower companies with the same tools we had as a consumer company,” Abu Seif said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;More thoughts on growing podcasts&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/more-thoughts-on-growing-podcasts/embed/#?secret=yYzQZdwzqK" data-secret="yYzQZdwzqK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Prior to Spokn, Davis had worked with an entrepreneur in the Middle East building out a social enterprise network focused on skills training, a role in which she handled internal communications. She saw just how little impact media like email made for employees, particularly in the distributed workforce she was attempting to engage. The new direction for Spokn was far more enticing.</p>
<p>The newly married couple moved to New York City from Egypt and signed an apartment lease in early March 2020 — just as the COVID-19 pandemic spread widely in the region. We “multiplied the living expenses by 8-10x while doing the same Zoom calls we could make from there,” Abu Seif joked.</p>
<p>Eventually, the company realized that it could do much more than just training, and expanded into broader internal comms. “Async audio is a lot more personal than email,” Abu Seif said. This latest product iteration launched in November 2020, and included push notifications, an app for streaming, personalization features and analytics to allow companies to track what was working and what was not for employees.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154623" style="width: 374px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154623" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2154623" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Spokn-Home-Screen.png?w=364" alt="" width="364" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Spokn-Home-Screen.png 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Spokn-Home-Screen.png?resize=80,150 80w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Spokn-Home-Screen.png?resize=161,300 161w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Spokn-Home-Screen.png?resize=768,1434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Spokn-Home-Screen.png?resize=364,680 364w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Spokn-Home-Screen.png?resize=823,1536 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Spokn-Home-Screen.png?resize=1097,2048 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Spokn-Home-Screen.png?resize=27,50 27w" sizes="(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2154623" class="wp-caption-text">Spokn&#8217;s app offers a personalized feed of company podcasts. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spokn</p></div></p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, companies can tailor the access lists for individual podcasts to particular groups of people, such as senior execs, people managers, sales employees or any other logical grouping. We “get a lot of inbound from companies that are trying to duct-tape solutions together,” Davis said. For Abu Seif, “all the tools that marketers have to engage consumers, we are empowering companies to engage with their employees.”</p>
<p>Despite the startup and product’s youth, it has attracted a quick following among companies, with customers including Podium, ShipBob, Cedar, Mixpanel, ServiceNow and Superhuman. Podium’s CEO, for example, records weekly podcasts that are shipping on Spokn, and apparently even installed a podcast studio near his office just to make it easier to produce his shows.</p>
<p>Podcasting inside companies fixes a lot of problems with traditional internal comms. First and foremost, it can create a deeper connection where email cannot. Audio can feel more personal than even video, and also can be played in the background. It’s also asynchronous, unlike live video, allowing employees in different time zones to connect with key stories at an appropriate time.</p>
<p>Plus, employees can avoid all the fatigue that comes from being onscreen. “No one wants Zoom zombies,” Bordetsky of NEA said. “We need intuitive and asynchronous communication tools like Spokn to build connection and community in the workplace.” Her thesis for the investment is that “flexible, distributed work is here to stay and employee communication is at the heart of building a modern, virtual-first employee experience.”</p>

<p>Buyers of Spokn range from heads of people to sales teams, and the company is also focused on recruiting and retention as well. “Companies are pretty freaked out about retaining their great talent,” Davis said. Some companies are now sharing “stories with prospects even before their first day at the company.”</p>
<p>While the product is mostly used by leaders today, Spokn wants to expand that remit to employees talking with their peer colleagues, helping to build community in hybrid offices where it is harder than ever to make a connection with others.</p>
<p>Of course, companies can screw up podcasting just as much as they have screwed up every other medium to communicate like humans, and Davis says it’s become her full-time job to help them think through storytelling and how to connect better with their own employees. We “work to find the right storytellers in the company,” she said.</p>
<p>Outside NEA, other investors in the seed round included Reach Capital, Funders Club, Liquid2, Share Capital, SOMA Capital, Scribble VC and Hack VC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">All batteries degrade over time. For automakers, fleet managers and other companies, the crux — and key to profitability — is knowing when they will.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s surprisingly difficult to understand the health and status of a battery without extensive and expensive testing, which isn&#8217;t always possible once a battery is in a vehicle. German battery analytics software company <a href="https://twaice.com/">Twaice</a> has been taking aim at this problem since its founding in 2018, and it announced Wednesday that it has raised $26 million in Series B funding led by Chicago-based Energize Ventures. The company, which primarily works in the mobility and energy storage industries, now has a total financing of $45 million.</p>
<p>“We started Twaice with the focus on building a battery analytics platform which really covers the whole lifecycle of battery systems,” company co-founder Stephan Rohr told TechCrunch, including the development and operational phases. The company has launched tools that are suited for the design and development phase and when the battery is actually in a vehicle or energy storage system. Audi, Daimler and Hero Motors are some of its customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company intends to use this fresh round of funding to expand its European commercial footprint and possibly into the United States. It also wants to build even more use cases on top of its analytics platform &#8212; for example, working with fleet providers, rather than only the manufacturers.</p>
<p>One of the company’s innovations is a concept of a “digital twin,” or a simulation model of the battery system that runs in Twaice&#8217;s cloud platform. The company continually updates the parameters of the &#8220;twin&#8221; so that it reflects the behavior of the actual battery, down to its thermal characteristics, electrical behavior and degradation. That means companies that operate a fleet of EV buses can monitor the state of the battery packs of each of their vehicles.</p>
<p>“It enables not just a focus on the current health of the battery system, but also it enables us to simulate and forecast the future,” Rohr said.</p>
<p>Twaice also offers solutions before the battery even enters the vehicle or energy storage system. “Battery design engineers use our simulations to reduce the testing effort [. . .] assess charging strategies, assess depth of discharge, assess different cell chemistries,” Rohr explained.</p>

<p>One major use case for Twaice&#8217;s software is for warranty tracking and safety risks. Using battery analytics OEMs can understand where exactly the battery failed, whether in the cell or the module, for example, and also gain valuable data on future warranty claims based on previous data. Warranties are huge risks for OEMs, Lennart Hinrichs, Twaice&#8217;s commercial director, explained to TechCrunch, in part because batteries are so complex and difficult to understand once they’re in a vehicle.</p>
<p>But having a grasp on the battery’s life could come in handy for consumers as well. Twaice has partnered with TÜV Rheinland, a testing and certification institute in Germany that’s working on EV resale in the private market. It could eventually lead the way to a standard assessment process for batteries on the resale market.</p>
<p>Once the battery is no longer suited for its first-life application, companies can use Twaice&#8217;s software to assess the remaining life and health of the battery system and determine whether it’s fit for a second-life purpose or if it should go straight to recycling.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.britive.com/">Britive</a>, an early-stage startup that is trying to bring privileged access control to a multi-cloud world, announced a $10 million Series A this morning. Crosslink Capital led the investment, with participation from previous investors Upfront Ventures and One Way Ventures.</p>
<p>The company helps automate permissioning across multiple cloud vendors and software services, whether that involves a human or a machine seeking permission. In a world of increasing automation, it&#8217;s often a machine seeking access, and that makes permissioning all the more critical, says Britive co-founder and CEO Art Poghosyan.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we offer is an automated approach to access, [moving from] what we call statically granted access, which constantly gets added all the time [&#8230;] to completely &#8216;just in time access&#8217;,&#8221; he said. That means that after you define a policy, it sets the ground rules for access, and grants it based on that policy for the time required, and nothing more, whether you&#8217;re a human or a machine.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>In today&#8217;s complex development, world that could take many forms, including API keys and secrets. &#8220;Yes, sometimes those things are granted to a human actor like a DevOps engineer, but a lot of times it also needs to be granted &#8212; quote, unquote &#8212; to a Terraform script or to GitHub to go and build out application infrastructure or deploy an application,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company currently has 40 employees, a number that Poghosyan expects to double in the next 12 months as he puts this capital to work. As a first-generation Armenian immigrant, Poghosyan says that he takes diversity and inclusion extremely seriously as he hires more employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always been committed &#8212; in this business and our previous startup &#8212; to providing equal opportunities to talented people, no matter what background they come from. I&#8217;m really proud that even as a small company &#8212; we&#8217;re 40 at the moment &#8212; we have more than 50% of our workforce which comes from ethnic minority groups,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Britive, which is based in Los Angeles, launched in 2018 and brought its first product to market in 2019. The company raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/pitching-access-management-on-the-fly-los-angeles-based-britive-raises-5-4-million/">$5.4 million seed round</a> last July, which it announced in September, making the total raised so far approximately $15.4 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">If you’ve lived in a few places in your life then you probably have experienced the feeling of moving into a nice new apartment or house — a blank canvas of rooms and spaces filled with possibility. Most times, unless you’ve got that money money, you then fill it up with all of your same, old, dinged-up furniture.</p>
<p class="p1">I have had this experience a bunch over the years. When I moved out of my parent’s house, every single piece of furniture I had was thrifted, rescued or gifted. A mash-mash of centuries and styles that was well-lived-in the day I got it. Even as I got married and even moved, much of that same furniture came with.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Eventually, much of it began to feel too out of place and we passed it on and carefully bought or made things that we felt represented our home and resonated with us. But there is still that odd piece, like that dinged-up Dutch-modern coffee table, that we look at and remember the sticky cocktail clutter of karaoke nights in our 20s and the — still sticky — kid’s snacks of our 30s.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">That’s where iPad is now. It’s a beautiful new monument to the engineering and hardware teams at Apple that continue to execute at an insane level year over year. But it’s filled with the still-functional-but-feeling-its-age iPadOS software. And it’s getting more out of place by the day.</p>
<p class="p1">This writeup has to be about what Apple has currently shipped, of course. That’s what consumers are getting in the mail when they order one now. But, Apple’s Worldwide Developer’s Conference is coming in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/apples-wwdc-stays-online-only-kicking-off-june-7/">just a couple of weeks</a> and I hope to basically review this iPad Pro all over again in a new light.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><div id="attachment_2154677" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1087.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154677" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2154677 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1087.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1087.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1087.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1087.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1087.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1087.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1087.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1087.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1087.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2154677" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Matthew Panzarino</p></div></p>
<p class="p1">Ironically, one of the biggest hardware upgrades for this model is going to elicit a relatively muted response in me here. The M1 chip is <i>absolutely </i>blistering. It delivers the same performance as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/apple-24-inch-m1-imac-review/">M1 MacBook Pro</a> did in benchmark tests, making Apple’s lineup more a matter of form factor and use case than raw power. But last year’s model frankly still feels just as fast in almost all of the applications that I tested, and certainly in all of my daily workflows. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Yes, it’s super powerful and you’re getting the absolute latest in silicon, but upgraders won’t see any immediate difference. In some ways this is by design. In my <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/25/interview-apple-executives-on-the-2021-ipad-pro-stunting-with-the-m1-and-creating-headroom/">interview last month with Apple’s John Ternus and Greg Joswiak</a> about the iPad Pro they noted that the new unified processor strategy and the aggressively good display are about creating overhead that they hope developers will take advantage of.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154675" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1089.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154675" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2154675 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1089.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1089.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1089.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1089.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1089.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1089.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1089.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1089.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1089.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2154675" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Matthew Panzarino</p></div></p>
<p class="p1">The new iPad Pro cameras are pretty fantastic, both front and back are now <i>very</i> usable and the new front camera especially benefits from an increase in resolution and new wide-angle optics. This wide angle makes video calling a bit more relaxed and doable on iPad Pro.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">That is coupled with Center Stage, Apple’s new ML-driven feature that automatically crops and centers your head and shoulders, following you around with a smooth and forgiving pan and zoom as you lean, stand and even move about a room within the view of the camera. The feature works by using machine learning frameworks to detect a person’s silhouette within the frame and then applies “camera moves” to that view as you shift in the frame. Unlike some other auto-zooming features, Center Stage feels like there is a virtual camera operator there helping you to frame yourself properly. It’s really clever and very nicely done — and it’s one of the biggest upgrades to iPad Pro usability this time around.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154683" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/centerstage.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154683" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2154683 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/centerstage.gif" alt="" width="800" height="775" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2154683" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Matthew Panzarino</p></div></p>
<p class="p1">And yes, if you’re wondering, this does a <i>lot</i> to mitigate the camera placement issues on iPad Pro. The camera remains in the &#8220;top center&#8221; of a vertically oriented iPad Pro, which means that it is on the &#8220;middle left&#8221; of a horizontally oriented keyboard-bound setup. This has led to an awkwardness in iPad video calling. Center Stage doesn’t completely delete these issues, hand placement is still a problem at times, but it goes a long way to making it more usable. The new APIs will make this feature available to all video calling apps by the way, and there are also some slight improvements in multi-tasking which let you use multi-pane setups without blanking out your video call in the process of a Zoom.</p>
<p class="p1">I tested the external Thunderbolt connection with Apple’s Pro Display XDR and it works fine. The displays are very close in capability so, aside from the scaling, this arrangement could prove to be very useful for pros working in a pipeline with XDR displays for color correction purposes. The software limitation of the iPad Pro only supporting mirror mode is still in effect, alas, which makes the usability of this feature a bit suspect in most situations.</p>
<p class="p1">Speaking of the screen, the mini-LED-driven Liquid Retina XDR display is probably the best display that’s ever shipped on a mobile computer. It’s just fantastic. The daily driving brightness is good, with an average of 600 nit max, but full-screen HDR content like videos or photos allow the display to boom up to 1,000 nits average with a peak of 1,600 nits. This thing is b r i g h t. Daylight viewing of HDR content is massively improved. And this comes with inclusion of all the standard stuff, like the 120hz ProMotion features.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">The 10,000 mini-LEDs in the display allow for much more precise localization of blacks (because they can turn off completely) and less bloom (though extreme tests still show it). They also provide a noticeably better edge-to-edge uniformity in brightness and improved off-axis viewing of content on the screen. It’s just better in every way. Absolute gold standard display here.</p>

<p class="p1">Apple’s new Magic Keyboard works essentially exactly the same as the previous version, but it now comes in white. I’m also happy to report that if you have an existing one it works <i>completely fine</i> on the new iPad Pro models. There was some minor uproar because Apple noted that the dimensions of the two devices were not the same so the old keyboard may not fit perfectly. Rest assured that it’s essentially the same exact fit and the functionality is identical. The only time any of it is evident is if you close it and peer very, very carefully at the open end you’ll notice that there is about 1mm less clearance between the rim of the case and the edge of the iPad Pro. Apple probably felt that it was better to over-disclose than anything here, but really, it’s not an issue.</p>
<p class="p1">The white color is fantastic-looking, especially with the silver model of iPad Pro and its white antenna window accents. It’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3949GAIokg">very 2001</a> (even though Kubrik’s iPads were black). I would fully, 100% expect this thing to get marred and dingy though. There’s a warning on the box that &#8220;color may transfer&#8221; and I would believe it. My demo unit has not sustained any noticeable markings yet but I would guess that it’s just a matter of time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">The overall feel of the keyboard is still great, a really nice typing experience and great little piece of kit that should be factored into the price of purchase of any iPad Pro because it’s just essential.</p>
<p class="p1">The other side of this coin that isn’t so shiny is the iPad’s aging software. It’s just as good as it was when I wrote my <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/review-100000-miles-and-one-week-with-an-ipad-pro/">review of the iPad Pro in 2020</a> — at which point my conclusions were &#8220;you can adapt to it but it could be better.&#8221; That was a year ago. As someone who has used it as my only portable machine for the last two and a half years I can tell you that this is a very long time to wait for a big leap forward in capability.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">I have a very simple ask for the iPad’s software. I want to feel the same energy vivacity and pure performance for the sake of peak performance that the hardware side exhibits.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Apple’s iPad Pro hardware is performing like an athlete in peak physical condition that is out three lengths ahead. The M1 chip and mini-LED display are really untouchable &#8212; it is exhilarating to see this much excellence packed into one device.</p>
<p class="p1">Unfortunately the software can not cash those checks, leaving this iPad Pro to feel like a perfect house with the same old furniture.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154672" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1092.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154672" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2154672 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1092.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1092.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1092.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1092.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1092.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1092.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1092.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1092.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_1092.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2154672" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Matthew Panzarino</p></div></p>
<p class="p1">Apple has done an incontestably incredible job with the 2021 iPad Pro’s hardware, but it needs to level up the software. As a &#8220;power&#8221; user that lives on iPad Pro much of the year, I have grown used to my kludges and tic-affordances. But there needs to be some big-time commitment to the iPad paradigm here. The pane-style interface currently has so many things to recommend it as a brutally fast, fluid way to work, but there is no follow-through. There is no willingness to say &#8220;this is a new way of working and you will learn it.&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Too much of the iPad Pro’s current software leans into &#8220;affordance valley.&#8221; A place where users are still treated as if they aren’t capable of learning a touch-first way of working. Instead, these affordances actually do the opposite and stand in the way of progress.</p>
<p class="p1">This reminds me of the &#8220;reduce animations&#8221; affordance circa the iOS 7 era. When Apple reinvented iOS it went way overboard in animations in order to make it super clear to the user what was happening when they were tapping around the new pane-based interface. Nothing was &#8220;slower&#8221; hardware-wise but the animated affordances they put in were tuned too far up and made it <i>feel</i> slower. Turning those animations off made the interface feel snappier and more useful almost instantly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Apple eventually got those animations under control by conceding that maybe people were indeed ready to be more advanced touch users.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">This is where the iPad Pro is currently and it’s the disparity that irks the most. This is one of the best computing hardware devices ever made, and you know it’s capable of so much more than it is currently being let to do. Apple has always had an editorial point of view when it comes to software and I can appreciate that. But currently, it feels like that stance is far too conservative when it comes to iPad Pro.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s why I’m waiting for WWDC with bated breath. With this much high-level execution on the hardware side, you have to imagine that the time is ripe for Apple to really take the next leap forward with iPad software. When that happens and we get a solid view of Apple’s vision for the next wave of iPad work, I’ll come back to the table with another look.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As energy prices continue to rise and more home owners look to the viability of things like solar, consumers will no doubt be searching for more ways to control their usage. Founded by ex-Tesla engineer Arch Rao, Span looks to address these questions, while asking, in a world of smart home devices, why the end-user access to grid energy has stayed stagnant for so long.</p>
<p>Span is a young company – founded roughly this time three years ago. This time last year, it raised a $10.1 million Series A, and by the end of the year, was  rolling out its products to homes across the U.S. In January, it raised<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/span-the-smart-fusebox-replacement-founded-by-an-ex-tesla-engineer-gets-an-alexa-upgrade/"> another $20 million</a>.</p>
<p>While not disclosing actual numbers, Rao tells me that Span, is “starting to capture a meaningful share of the storage market in the U.S. Especially in key markets like California.” Make of that what you will, but the company is particularly targeting solar users with a battery capture system.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Announced today, Span’s second product is a smaller and more versatile unit, simply calling the Span Smart Panel. The system is also notably cheaper than its first-gen predecessor, knocking the $5,000 MSRP down to $3,500. Your results may vary on the price, as power companies will often bundle this technology with other offerings like solar panels.</p>
<p>“This is part of the original vision that we thought about with Nest,” Nest co-founder and Span investor Matt Rogers said in an interview with TechCrunch. “There&#8217;s a lot you can do with your home. Nest and Google are heading in different directions. But the opportunity to understand the energy in your home and be the glue and the command center is still really real. Especially in this world where energy costs go up, and where solar and storage become pervasive. You can&#8217;t imagine a world in the future like that, that doesn&#8217;t have something like Span.”</p>
<p>The system plays nicely with most home electrical breakers and offers minute control for circuits, as well as support for Ethernet, Wi-Fi, cellular and Bluetooth connections. The company offers simple device control through a connected mobile app.</p>
<p>“What we’ve done is fundamentally reinvent the home electrical panel,” Rao tells TechCrunch. “We are not tied to a single use case. We are the backbone of everything in your home. Some homes have thermostats, some don’t. Some homes have solar, some don’t. But practically every home has an electrical panel that is still using technology that is 100 years old.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Origin is taking a novel approach to selling the first available private spaceflight seat on its New Shepard rocket, with an auction that will award the spot to the highest bidder. The company used a sealed bidding process for the first part of the contest, but it is now revealing the amount of the top bid and from here until June 10, all online bidding will happen in the open.</p>
<p>The current top bid for the coveted spot is at $1.4 million, after a bidding process that saw 5,200 applicants put in an offer, spanning bidders from 136 countries. Blue Origin will now be taking open bids on its website, and the current high bid (which is already up to $2 million as of this writing) will be displayed prominently for all to see.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="iXQ2KsKX64"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/you-can-bid-for-a-seat-on-blue-origins-first-human-spaceflight-on-july-20/">You can bid for a seat on Blue Origin’s first human spaceflight on July 20</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;You can bid for a seat on Blue Origin’s first human spaceflight on July 20&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/you-can-bid-for-a-seat-on-blue-origins-first-human-spaceflight-on-july-20/embed/#?secret=iXQ2KsKX64" data-secret="iXQ2KsKX64" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>On June 12, there will be one final, live online auction, among remaining participants who have registered and are willing to compete at whatever the high price is at the time. The winner then gets a seat on that first flight, which is currently set for July 20, and which will include other, yet-to-be-named passengers selected by Blue Origin.</p>
<p>The Jeff Bezos-founded space company has been working towards this moment for a long time, but this winning bid isn&#8217;t a direct payday for the private spaceflight venture: Instead, it&#8217;s donating the amount of the winning offer to its Club for the Future non-profit, which is aimed at encouraging kids to pursue a STEM education.</p>
<p>This will be Blue Origin&#8217;s first ever human spaceflight, and the fact that they&#8217;re opening up at least one seat to a member of the public means they&#8217;re extremely confident in the reliability of the suborbital, reusable New Shepard launch system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A massive raise for the 3D printing industry this morning, as Massachusetts-based Formlabs has announced a $150 million Series E. The round, led by Softbank’s Vision Fund 2, effectively doubles the value of the unicorn to $2 billion dollars.</p>
<p>The news comes during a kind of resurgence as the once-beleaguered industry is seeing a massive uptick in interest – and funding. Of note, Desktop Metal, Shapeways, Velo3D and Markforged have all announced places to go public via SPAC. The company notes <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/30/2117800/0/en/3D-Printing-Market-Worth-51-77-Billion-at-25-8-CAGR-Growing-Demand-for-Prototyping-Technology-from-Defense-Industry-to-Widen-Sales-Horizons-Fortune-Business-Insights.html">a recent study</a> that projects that the industry will hit more than $51 billion by 2026. The news arrives as technology is improving, materials are diversifying and companies are looking for ways to introduce additive manufacturing into mass production.</p>
<p>Founded in 2011 by MIT Media Lab students, Formlabs has been something of an anomaly in the world of 3D printing. The company adapted a formerly industrial method of additive manufacturing (stereolithography) to a desktop form factor. It was enough to keep the firm going amid a bubble burst for the industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Today, most 3D printing technology is still too expensive and difficult to use for widespread adoption,” CEO Max Lobovsky said in a press release tied to the round. “Our laser focus on improving the user experience and quality of these machines while bringing down the cost is central to our success and the growth of the industry. With this investment, we plan to expand our current portfolio of SLA and SLS technology and accelerate our product development to continue delivering on the expectations of the 3D printing industry.”</p>
<p>The large round will go toward increasing the company’s global headcount and helping Formlabs scale its technology toward mass production – a longstanding sticking point for most 3D printing tech.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The real estate sales market has been in an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petertaylor/2021/04/18/yes-americas-housing-market-is-officially-over-heating-everywhere-how-long-can-it-last/?sh=67f362964437" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upswing</a> this year, and today a startup that&#8217;s addressing one of homeowners&#8217; biggest needs &#8212; repair and maintenance services, and specifically the stress of sorting these out when things break down &#8212; is announcing some funding on the heels of strong growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hellosuper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super</a> &#8212; which has built a business providing repair and maintenance for electrical and mechanical systems, appliances, and plumbing by way of a monthly subscription &#8212; has closed a growth round of $50 million.</p>
<p>The startup plans to use the funding to expand into new markets, to hire more people, and to continue adding more maintenance/repair services and partnerships into its wider home-warranty-by-subscription proposition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CEO Jorey Ramer, who co-founded the company with Ryan Donnelly (VP of engineering), also said that another part of the investment will be used to enhance the AI tech that underpins Super&#8217;s service and <a href="https://www.hellosuper.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pricing plans</a>. More on that below.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based company is currently active in some of the fastest-growing housing markets in the U.S.,  Austin, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, San Antonio, and Washington, D.C. (ironically not in SF itself), and it has grown revenue 7x since April 2019, when it previously raised money, a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/super-raises-20m-to-fix-the-home-services-and-repairs-market-with-its-subscription-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $20 million Series B</a>. It&#8217;s not disclosing actual revenue numbers, nor user numbers.</p>
<p>This is latest Series C has a number of strategic backers that speaks to the bigger ecosystem of financial and insurance services that interlink with each other, and which are used by the average person in the course of home ownership. (Indeed, Super these days seems to refer to itself as an &#8220;insuretech&#8221;.)</p>
<p>Led by Wells Fargo Strategic Capital, the venture arm of the banking giant, others in the round included home construction giant Asahi Kasei, AAA &#8211; Auto Club Group (which also sells insurance), Gaingels, and REACH. The last of these is a scale-up service from Second Century Ventures, which is the investment fund of the National Association of Realtors. Aquiline Technology Growth, Liberty Mutual Strategic Ventures, Moderne Ventures and the HSB Fund of Munich Re Ventures &#8212; which all invested in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/super-raises-20m-to-fix-the-home-services-and-repairs-market-with-its-subscription-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super&#8217;s previous $20 million round</a> back in April 2019 &#8212; also participated.</p>
<p>The company has now raised $80 million in total, and it&#8217;s not disclosing its valuation.</p>
<p>As we have noted before, Ramer came up with the idea for Super when he himself moved to San Francisco after he sold his previous startup, Jumptap — an advertising network <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/13/millennial-acquires-jumptap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Millennial Media</a> (which is now part of Verizon by way of its acquisition of AOL, just like TechCrunch). He&#8217;d been an apartment renter for all of his adult life, but when he moved to the Bay Area, he found himself buying property, and it came with more than a little reluctance because of the headache of taking care of his new home.</p>
<p>“I liked being a renter,” he said in an interview. “You pay a fee, and you know what to expect.” (“Super” is a reference to the superintendents that handle maintenance and repair in an apartment building, and to what Super hopes customers will think about its service.)</p>
<p>The route that Ramer decided to take for how to approach filling that gap, interestingly, is not unlike the challenges that Jumptap faced in the world of ad tech: instead of trying to build a services business from the ground up, he opted to build an integrated network that tapped into a number of small services enterprises already working in the business of maintaining homes. (The correlation here is that, rather than building a first-party behemoth, the approach is to knit together a number of online properties so that people looking to advertise can do so across a wide range of places in a network).</p>
<p>Super has created a kind of marketplace: the services businesses and individuals that Super engages with to carry out maintenance and repairs are all licensed and use its platform for free, essentially, and Super handles remuneration based on call-outs. For users, the call-outs come as <a href="https://www.hellosuper.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part of their monthly plans</a>, and they include different options based on which level of service they pay for.</p>
<p>The funding it&#8217;s announcing today will be used in part to enhance how those monthly plans work.</p>
<p>Not only are there algorithms that Super has built to determine how to price its services based on location, size of home and other factors; but there are features in the app that subscribers can use to interact with Super to report issues, call out maintenance people, and provide more detail about problems to improve faster, and in some cases, automated adjudication on issues.</p>
<p>Better tech for more responsive home services has been an interesting area of the market, but one that&#8217;s largely been ignored up to now, but as they have matured, AR and other computer vision breakthroughs have definitely helped to advance that game. (And a number of others are also tapping into that, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/hover-secures-60m-for-a-3d-imaging-platform-used-to-assess-and-fix-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hover</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/nana-nabs-6m-for-an-online-academy-and-marketplace-dedicated-to-appliance-repair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nana</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/jobber-raises-60m-as-its-platform-for-home-service-professionals-hits-100k-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jobber</a> and more.)</p>
<p>The way that the service has been built to scale &#8212; working with contractors means adding in more kinds of coverage is easier than building from the ground up &#8212; also means that Super over time may well add more services into the mix.</p>
<p>&#8220;The things we would do are things your super would do,&#8221; Ramer said. &#8220;So that might include fixing plumbing, but might also potentially include cleaning carpets, which you could think of as maintenance. Painting is another interesting area. It seems like it might be a cosmetic thing, but if you do not paint, you risk dry rot. It&#8217;s also preventative care. So if we, say, cover 100% maintenance you could imagine that included, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>One area where it&#8217;s unlikely to move is general contract work, say rebuilding a bathroom or kitchen, or adding in a new room in your loft: the focus it seems will remain on the essentials of keeping your home working.</p>
<p>But aside of expanding the services directly on its own platform, there are also potentially opportunities for how Super might work with partners. AAA for example has a notable business not just in roadside assistance but also insurance coverage. Ramer describes Super as &#8220;roadside assistance for your home,&#8221; and he points out that it&#8217;s a natural partnership to sell those alongside each other.</p>
<p>Similarly, Wells Fargo, as a mortgage lender, is a natural complement, providing a route to its customers to help maintain the properties that they&#8217;re in the process of paying off to the bank. This in turn also becomes a kind of insurance policy to the bank itself, as it keeps the homes it is financing in better shape.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“Wells Fargo embraces innovation, and we’re excited to support a tech-forward platform like Super which brings further advancement to the home services market,” said Matthew Raubacher, managing director for WFSC’s Principal Technology Investments Group, in a statement. “The challenges of ongoing repairs and maintenance resonates with every homeowner, and Super provides an experience that is convenient for the customer, while boosting job visibility for local contractors and businesses. We look forward to seeing them continue to widen their geographic footprint and expand their product offering.”</span></p>
