										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back when I was a wee lad with a very security-compromised MySQL installation, I used to answer every web request with multiple “SELECT *” database requests — give me all the data and I’ll figure out what to do with it myself.</p>
<p>Today in a modern, data-intensive org, “SELECT *” will kill you. With petabytes of information, tens of thousands of tables (on the small side!), and millions and perhaps billions of calls flung at the database server, data science teams can no longer just ask for all the data and start working with it immediately.</p>
<p>Big data has led to the rise of data warehouses and data lakes (and apparently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/a-lake-house-architect-a-miami-vc-and-homeowner-walk-into-a-wine-bar/">data lake houses</a>), infrastructure to make accessing data more robust and easy. There is still a cataloguing and discovery problem though — just because you have all of your data in one place doesn’t mean a data scientist knows what the data represents, who owns it, or what that data might affect in the myriad of web and corporate reporting apps built on top of it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That’s where <a href="https://selectstar.com">Select Star</a> comes in. The startup, which was founded about a year ago in March 2020, is designed to automatically build out metadata within the context of a data warehouse. From there, it offers a full-text search that allows users to quickly find data as well as “heat map” signals in its search results which can quickly pinpoint which columns of a dataset are most used by applications within a company and have the most queries that reference them.</p>
<p>The product is SaaS, and it is designed to allow for quick onboarding by connecting to a customer’s data warehouse or business intelligence (BI) tool.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115657" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115657" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2115657" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Star-1-Table.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="438" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Star-1-Table.png 1344w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Star-1-Table.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Star-1-Table.png?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Star-1-Table.png?resize=768,495 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Star-1-Table.png?resize=680,438 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Star-1-Table.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2115657" class="wp-caption-text">Select Star&#8217;s interface allows data scientists to understand what data they are looking at. Photo via Select Star.</p></div></p>
<p>Shinji Kim, the sole founder and CEO, explained that the tool is a solution to a problem she has seen directly in corporate data science teams. She formerly founded Concord Systems, a real-time data processing startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/04/akamai-buys-soha-systems-to-add-more-security-to-its-cloud-networking-business/">was acquired by Akamai in 2016</a>. “The part that I noticed is that we now have all the data and we have the ability to compute, but now the next challenge is to know what the data is and how to use it,” she explained.</p>
<p>She said that “tribal knowledge is starting to become more wasteful [in] time and pain in growing companies” and pointed out that large companies like Facebook, Airbnb, Uber, Lyft, Spotify and others have built out their own homebrewed data discovery tools. Her mission for Select Star is to allow any corporation to quickly tap into an easy-to-use platform to solve this problem.</p>
<p>The company raised a $2.5 million seed round led by Bowery Capital with participation from Background Capital and a number of prominent angels including Spencer Kimball, Scott Belsky, Nick Caldwell, Michael Li, Ryan Denehy and TLC Collective.</p>
<p>Data discovery tools have been around in some form for years, with popular companies like <a href="https://www.alation.com">Alation</a> having raised tens of millions of VC dollars over the years. Kim sees an opportunity to compete by offering a better onboarding experience and also automating large parts of the workflow that remain manual for many alternative data discovery tools. With many of these tools, “they don’t do the work of connecting and building the relationship,” between data she said, adding that “documentation is still important, but being able to automatically generate [metadata] allows data teams to get value right away.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115659" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115659" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2115659" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Star-Team.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="289" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Star-Team.png 1006w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Star-Team.png?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Star-Team.png?resize=300,127 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Star-Team.png?resize=768,326 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Star-Team.png?resize=680,289 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Select-Star-Team.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2115659" class="wp-caption-text">Select Star&#8217;s team, with CEO and founder Shinji Kim in top row, middle. Photo via Select Star.</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to just understanding data, Select Star can help data engineers begin to figure out how to change their databases without leading to cascading errors. The platform can identify how columns are used and how a change to one may affect other applications or even other datasets.</p>
<p>Select Star is coming out of private beta today. The company’s team currently has seven people, and Kim says they are focused on growing the team and making it even easier to onboard users by the end of the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.aquariumlearning.com/">Aquarium</a>, a startup from two former Cruise employees, wants to help companies refine their machine learning model data more easily and move the models into production faster. Today the company announced a $2.6 million seed led by Sequoia with participation from Y Combinator and a bunch of angel investors including Cruise co-founders Kyle Vogt and Dan Kan.</p>
<p>When the two co-founders CEO Peter Gao and head of engineering Quinn Johnson, were at Cruise they learned that finding areas of weakness in the model data was often the problem that prevented it from getting into production. Aquarium aims to solve this issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aquarium is a machine learning data management system that helps people improve model performance by improving the data that it&#8217;s trained on, which is usually the most important part of making the model work in production,&#8221; Gao told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says that they are seeing a lot of different models being built across a variety of industries, but teams are getting stuck because iterating on the data set and continually finding relevant data is a hard problem to solve. That&#8217;s why Aquarium&#8217;s founders decided to focus on this.</p>
<p>&#8220;It turns out that most of the improvement to your model, and most of the work that it takes to get it into production is about deciding, &#8216;Here&#8217;s what I need to go and collect next. Here&#8217;s what I need to go label. Here&#8217;s what I need to go and retrain my model on and analyze it for errors and repeat that iteration cycle,&#8221; Gao explained.</p>
<p>The idea is to get a model into production that outperforms humans. One customer Sterblue offers a good example. They provide drone inspection services for wind turbines. Their customers used to send out humans to inspect the turbines for damage, but with a set of drone data, they were able to train a machine learning model to find issues. Using Aquarium, they refined their model and improved accuracy by 13%, while cutting the cost of human reviews in half, Gao said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2117231" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2117231" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2117231" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/60301667d6a4b05d1ccbdcde_team-copy.png?w=680" alt="The 7 person Aquarium startup team." width="680" height="385" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/60301667d6a4b05d1ccbdcde_team-copy.png 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/60301667d6a4b05d1ccbdcde_team-copy.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/60301667d6a4b05d1ccbdcde_team-copy.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/60301667d6a4b05d1ccbdcde_team-copy.png?resize=768,435 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/60301667d6a4b05d1ccbdcde_team-copy.png?resize=680,385 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/60301667d6a4b05d1ccbdcde_team-copy.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2117231" class="wp-caption-text">The Aquarium team. Image: Aquarium</p></div></p>
<p>Aquarium currently has 7 employees including the founders, of which three are women. Gao says that they are being diverse by design. He understands the issues of bias inherent in machine learning model creation, and creating a diverse team for this kind of tooling is one way to help mitigate that bias.</p>
<p>The company launched last February and spent part of the year participating in the Y Combinator Summer 2020 cohort. They worked on refining the product throughout 2020, and recently opened it up from beta to generally available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Virtual events platform <a href="https://hopin.com">Hopin</a> is hopin’ for a mega valuation.</p>
<p>According to multiple sources who spoke with TechCrunch, the company, which was founded in mid-2019, is running around the fundraise circuit and perhaps nearing the end of a fundraise in which it is looking to raise roughly $400 million at a pre-money valuation of $5 billion for its Series C. Two sources implied that the valuation could reach as high as $6 billion, but with greater dilution based on some offered terms the company has received. The deal is in flux, and both the round size and valuation are subject to change.</p>
<p>One source told TechCrunch that the company’s ARR has grown to $60 million, implying a valuation multiple of 80-100x if the valuation we’re hearing pans out. That sort of multiple wouldn’t be out of line with other major fundraises for star companies with SaaS-based business models.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hopin has been on a fundraise tear in recent months. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/hopin-raises-125m-for-its-online-events-platform-on-the-back-of-surging-growth/">raised $125 million at a $2.125 billion valuation late last year</a> for its Series B, which came just a few months after it raised a Series A of $40 million over the summer and a $6.5 million seed round last winter. All told, the roughly 20-month-old company has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hopin-8ff6/company_financials">raised a known $171.4 million in VC</a> according to Crunchbase.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/hopin-raises-125m-for-its-online-events-platform-on-the-back-of-surging-growth/">When we last reported on the company</a>, Hopin’s ARR had gone from $0 to $20 million, while its overall userbase had grown from essentially zero to 3.5 million users in November. The company reported then that it had 50,000 groups using its platform.</p>
<p>Hopin’s platform is designed to translate the in-person events experience into a virtual one, providing tools to recreate the experience of walking exhibition floors, networking one-on-one and spontaneously joining fireside chats and panels. It’s become a darling in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has seen most business and educational conferences canceled in the midst of mass restrictions on domestic and international travel worldwide.</p>

<p>It’s probably also useful to note that our business team uses Hopin to run all of TechCrunch’s editorial events, including Disrupt, Early Stage, Extra Crunch Live and next week’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/">TechCrunch Sessions: Justice 2021 event</a> (these software selections and their costs are — thankfully — outside the purview of our editorial team).</p>
<p>Hopin may be the mega-leader of the virtual events space right now, but it isn’t the only startup trying to take on this suddenly vital industry. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/virtual-events-startup-run-the-world-just-nabbed-10-8-million-from-a16z-and-founders-fund/">Run The World</a> raised capital last year, Welcome wants to be the ‘<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/welcome-raises-12-million-to-be-the-ritz-carlton-for-event-platforms/">Ritz-Carlton for event platforms</a>,’ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/spotify-is-developing-a-virtual-events-feature/">Spotify is getting into the business</a>, Clubhouse is arguably a contender here, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/inevent-seed-fundng/">InEvent raised a seed earlier this month</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/hubilo-raises-4-5-million-led-by-lightspeed-to-focus-on-virtual-events/">Hubilo is another entrant</a> which nabbed a check from Lightspeed a few months ago. Plus, quite literally dozens of other startups have either started in the space or are pivoting toward it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX&#8217;s first all-civilian human spaceflight mission, which will carry four passengers to orbit using a Crew Dragon capsule later this year if all goes to plan, will include one passenger selected by a panel of judges weighing the submissions of entrepreneurs. The panel will include Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, Fast Company Editor-in-Chief Stephanie Mehta, YouTuber Mark Rober and <em>Bar Rescue</em> TV host Jon Taffer. It may seem like an eclectic bunch, but there is some reason to the madness.</p>
<p>This seat is one of four on the ride – the first belongs to contest and mission sponsor Jared Isaacman, the founder of Shift4 Payments and a billionaire who has opted to spend a not insignificant chunk of money funding the flight. The second, Isaacman revealed earlier this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/second-crew-member-of-first-all-civilian-spacex-mission-revealed/">will go to St. Jude Children&#8217;s Research Hospital employee and cancer survivor Hayley Arceneaux</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="K0zTeZpfs1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/second-crew-member-of-first-all-civilian-spacex-mission-revealed/">Second crew member of first all-civilian SpaceX mission revealed</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Second crew member of first all-civilian SpaceX mission revealed&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/second-crew-member-of-first-all-civilian-spacex-mission-revealed/embed/#?secret=K0zTeZpfs1" data-secret="K0zTeZpfs1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That leaves two more seats, and they&#8217;re being decided by two separate contests. One is open to anyone who is a U.S. citizen and who makes a donation to St. Jude via the ongoing charitable contribution drive. The other will be decided by this panel of judges, and will be chosen from a pool of applicants who have build stores on Shift4&#8217;s Shift4Shop e-commerce platform.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right: This absurdly expensive and pioneering mission to space is also a growth marketing campaign for Isaacman&#8217;s Shopify competitor. But to be fair, the store of the winning entrant doesn&#8217;t have to be news – existing customers can also apply and are eligible.</p>
<p>The stated criteria for deciding the winner is &#8220;a business owner or entrepreneur the exhibits ingenuity, innovation and determination&#8221; so in other words it could be just about anybody. I&#8217;m extremely curious to see what Benioff, Mehta, Rober (also a former NASA JPL engineer in addition to a YouTuber) and Taffer come up with between them as a winner.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/spacex-is-aiming-to-fly-the-first-all-civilian-human-space-mission-by-the-end-of-2021/">Inspiration4 mission is currently set to fly in the fourth quarter of 2021</a>, and mission specifics including total duration and target orbit are yet to be determined.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Big morning for Massachusetts tech companies planning to go public via SPAC. Shortly after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/robotics-company-berkshire-grey-to-go-public-via-spac/">Berkshire Grey unveiled its intentions</a>, Watertown-based Markforged has <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210224005529/en/Markforged-Leader-in-Additive-Manufacturing-to-Become-Publicly-Listed-Through-Merger-With-one">announced its own plans</a>. The metal 3D printing company intends to merge with ONE, a special purpose acquisition company created by Kevin Hartz, who will join its board.</p>
<p>The deal, which could value the additive manufacturing company at around $2.1 billion, would bring in around $400 million in cash. Markforged plans to use the money on R&amp;D for new products, materials and building out new verticals for its tech. Shai Terem will stay on as CEO.</p>
<p>“We’ve been at the forefront of the additive manufacturing industry,” the executive said in a release tied to the news, “and this transaction will enable us to build on our incredible momentum and provide capital and flexibility to grow our brand, accelerate product innovation, and drive expanded adoption among customers across key verticals.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company says its technology has been used to print north of 10 million parts since its 2013 founding, with its machines deployed in some 10,000 locations across 70 countries. Last year, it pulled in around $70 million in revenue. It has raised north of $136 million thus far, including an $82 million round back in 2019.</p>

<p>3D printing seen some strong growth in recent years, and that’s expected to continue as companies look to the technology to expand beyond the rapid prototyping it’s best known for. Metal printing from the likes of Markforged and competitors including Desktop Metal are seen as an important step, offering far more durability than plastic deposits.</p>
<p>SPACs are, of course, becoming an increasingly popular route for taking companies public. Hardware makers haven’t been a huge player thus far (with a few exceptions like smart lock mater, Latch), though that looks like it may be changing. The deal is expected to close over the summer.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If Toast's recovery was anything like Olo's ascent, it isn't impossible to grok why its old $5 billion valuation might be a bit too small here in 2021]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Boston-based Toast has been on a roller coaster over the last year.</p>
<p>From raising $400 million in February 2020 <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/toast-lands-400m-bringing-valuation-to-nearly-5b/">at a nearly $5 billion valuation</a>, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/restaurant-management-platform-toast-cuts-50-of-staff/">cut staff in March</a> after COVID-19 turned its business upside down. Toast had recorded 109% revenue growth in 2019.</p>
<p>Toast&#8217;s ups and downs were hardly over. The company has since recovered greatly since those early-COVID layoffs. Evidence of that comes in the form of the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/restaurant-software-provider-toast-prepares-for-ipo-11613938981">reportedly-pending IPO</a> and reportedly possible $20 billion valuation.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>It feels like every IPO these days is blasting final private valuations out of the water, but Toast&#8217;s ascent from layoffs to an IPO in under a year is an impressive turnaround. And that&#8217;s if it prices flat at $5 billion. Anything higher is just cream for the software unicorn.</p>
<p>Until we get the S-1, we won&#8217;t know the full details. That said, anotherr company that operates in a similar part of the restaurant technology market is going public at the moment, and we<em> </em>have <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1431695/000119312521049073/d867519ds1.htm">its S-1 filing:</a> New York-based <a href="https://www.olo.com/">Olo</a>.</p>
<p>This morning, while we await the numbers from Toast that should prove as interesting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/airbnbs-first-day-pop-caps-off-a-stellar-week-for-tech-ipos/">as Airbnb&#8217;s own COVID-19 recovery</a>, let&#8217;s peek at Olo&#8217;s results to get a taste of the market that Boston&#8217;s leading startup dealt with in 2020.</p>
<h2>Olo&#8217;s IPO</h2>
<p>Olo isn&#8217;t a company that has been very loud in recent years; The New York-based software company last raised capital in 2016 when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/21/olo-raises-40-million-to-expand-delivery-business/">picked up $40 million in a Series D</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s business has three parts, per its S-1 filing. First, Olo offers white-labeled ordering software. And its service also helps restaurants handle delivery options, what it calls &#8220;dispatch.&#8221; Finally, Olo&#8217;s software, in a nearly Yext-like fashion, delivers restaurant information to online platforms.</p>
<p>Toast, as a reminder, offers point-of-sale services, along with online ordering and delivery services similar to Olo. Notably, Toast has been expanding its software lineup, adding payroll management recently among other offerings, including email marketing tools.</p>
<p>But both companies generate software (SaaS) and consumption (transaction-based services) incomes from the restaurant space, so if one had a big 2020, it&#8217;s likely that the other swam in similar waters.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.primary.vc/">Primary Venture Partners</a>, a firm focused exclusively on investing in New York-area startups, has raised $150 million in its third fund for seed investments (its largest so far), as well as $50 million for its second Select fund (used to participate in later-stage rounds).</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s portfolio includes New York success stories like Jet.com (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/08/confirmed-walmart-buys-jet-com-for-3b-in-cash/">acquired by Walmart</a> for $3.3 bill million), Mirror (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/lululemon-set-to-acquire-home-fitness-startup-mirror-for-500m/">acquired by Lululemon</a> for $500 million) and Latch (which is planning to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/smart-lock-maker-latch-teams-with-real-estate-firm-to-go-public-via-spac/">go public via SPAC</a>). And the firm has doubled down on its association with New York by publishing <a href="https://www.nycfounderguide.com">an NYC Founder Guide</a>.</p>
<p>Still, the idea of limiting your investments to a specific geography might sound old-fashioned at a time when offices largely go unused, teams are increasingly distributed and some investors are loudly trumpeting new startup hubs. But General Partner Brad Svrluga (who founded Primary with General Partner Ben Sun) told me that the New York focus remains crucial for the firm — for example, in its work to help startups hire the best employees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When you think about [our three-person talent team], their charge is to understand, track and be connected to the top 10% of all talent in New York City,&#8221; Svrluga said. &#8220;That’s a big, ambitious challenge, but it’s also one that we&#8217;ve got a really good shot at doing in a relatively confined geography. If we were trying to simultaneously recruit for companies in New York, Seattle, Boston, Austin, L.A., the Bay Area, etc., you just can’t do it — or you&#8217;d need an army.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while he said San Francisco and Silicon Valley remain &#8220;unquestionably the center of the universe that we operate in, the sun around which everything else revolves,&#8221; he suggested that New York has unique advantages: &#8220;Unlike the Bay Area, New York is powered by a whole collection of industries. That diversity makes the place radically more resilient.&#8221;</p>

<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean things won&#8217;t change as we emerge from the pandemic. For one thing, Svrluga anticipated that companies that are ostensibly New York based will be more distributed, with &#8220;a relatively lower percentage of their workforce in New York City proper,&#8221; and of that NYC workforce, &#8220;fewer of them in the office on any given day.&#8221; He&#8217;s also hopeful that startup real estate costs will &#8220;shrink materially.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would love it if you and your peers continue to trumpet the demise of New York, so other investors can stop paying attention and we can have a less competitive environment,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Another change — one that&#8217;s not limited to geography — is the growing size of seed rounds, which Svrluga said is one of the reasons for the larger fund. The seed, he suggested, has become &#8220;the first third of the A&#8221; round, but that doesn&#8217;t mean startups raising seed rounds need to be more further along.</p>
<p>&#8220;A whole bunch of what we do has always been way pre-product,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It could be just a founder or just two or three people &#8230;. some early code might be written but you&#8217;re months and months way from launch. They&#8217;re now capable raising $2.5, $3, $4 million right out of the gate.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the new funds, Primary is also announcing that it has appointed Rebecca Price as operating partner and promoted Jason Shuman to partner.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">After making pre-seed investments for seven years, I have observed <a href="https://www.startuphacks.vc/blog/8-myths-of-the-pre-seed-venture-investing">how different the pre-seed stage is from Series A and later-stage investing</a>.</p>
<p>Today, I want to highlight four ideas that are true across different stages of investing.</p>
<h2>Venture outcomes are driven by a power law</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">Power law</a> is an immutable law of the universe. Examples include the distribution of population in cities, price of artwork, and unfortunately, wealth distribution. This law is also known as the Pareto principle, and colloquially known as the 80%-20% rule.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The average manager faces a very real possibility of making no money at all because of how steep the power law curve is.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Venture capital is no exception and the outcomes of every venture portfolio will likely follow a power law distribution. There are two significant things to think about here:</p>
<p>One: Because most startups fail, the distribution is going to have a lot of zeros (or near zeros) in the long tail. The zeros are going to be followed by singles and doubles.</p>
<p>Two: The biggest winners, when they happen, tend to be huge. Unicorns were hard to come by when<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/02/welcome-to-the-unicorn-club/"> Aileen Lee</a> penned her now-famous article in 2013. Today, unicorns are no longer as rare and top-tier firms are constructing their portfolio with the goal of funding a decacorn — a company valued at $10 billion or higher.</p>
<p>There is nothing mysterious about the power law dynamic in venture. Just like the rich get richer, the biggest companies get bigger.</p>
<p>A startup that reaches $10 million in revenue is much more likely to double, double again and then cruise by $100 million in revenue versus a startup at the $1 million mark now trying to get to $10 million.</p>
<p>At scale, everything is different — the resources, the possibilities and access to capital. Of course, even companies that reach very substantial scale may run into obstacles and eventually underperform. But that is not the point.</p>
<p>The point is that the ones that do end up winning and driving all the returns keep doubling and continue getting bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>Hence, the outcomes of the venture portfolio fit a power law curve.</p>
<p>The best managers in the business are distinguished by a few more at the very top of the curve.</p>
<p>The average manager faces a very real possibility of making no money at all because of how steep the power law curve is.</p>
<h2>Your fund size is your strategy</h2>
<p>There is a piece of feedback that fund of fund managers frequently give to GPs: Your fund size is your strategy.</p>
<p>What they are essentially saying is that a fund&#8217;s portfolio construction will depend on how much capital is under management, and vice versa. Why is that?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take two extreme examples — a manager of a $10 million fund and a manager of a $1 billion fund. Let&#8217;s assume that both managers want to lead rounds. If the first one decided to be a Series A fund, it would be <em>extremely</em> concentrated. It may be able to lead 1-2 rounds, but that&#8217;s it. Given the power law nature of outcomes, it would be extremely unlikely for this manager to generate a good return.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Additive manufacturing has been a popular buzz phrase for decades now. With a smattering of notable exceptions, however, 3D printing has largely been focused on rapid prototyping and limited-run, personal products. Metal 3D printing companies like Mantle represent an intriguing use case on the road to truly scaling the tech to mass manufacturing.</p>
<p>Arriving out of stealth today, the Bay Area-based company is not focused on replacing traditional manufacturing methods, as much as augmenting and improving them. Specifically, the startup is focusing its technology in helping creating better molds and dies for manufacturers.</p>
<p>There are, of course, a number of companies currently competing in the printable metal category. Notable names include Desktop Metal, ExOne and Markforged. Armed with $13 million in funding from Foundation Capital, Hypertherm Ventures, Future Shape, 11.2 capital, Plug and Play Ventures and Corazon Capital, Mantle seeks to differentiate itself with a machine capable of removing some steps from the process.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The main difference, having interacted with 3D printing for close to three decades, is really around the focus on these use cases that are production oriented,” Foundation Capital General Partner Steve Vassallo tells TechCrunch. “The vast majority of 3D printing is to make a prototype as quickly as possible. To actually make something that can be used in production environments &#8212; real parts that you can use &#8212; has never been done before.”</p>
<p>The company’s machine (roughly &#8220;The size of two standing desks&#8221; its says) builds part finishing into the process.</p>
<p>“Ours is the first sintering-based hybrid technology that does shape refinement prior to going into the furnace,” CEO Ted Sorom tells TechCrunch. “We do it with a unique material that’s designed not only to be deposited into a very dense body but to also be cut with high-speed cutting tools. That allows us to get a totally different level of surface detail than anyone’s able to get today.”</p>
<p>The company has thus far announced L&#8217;Oréal as its first partner. The cosmetics giant will be using Mantle’s printers to create precision molds for products and packaging.</p>
<p>Tony Fadell, of Future Shape Mantle, added in a comment offered to TechCrunch, “Mantle gives you the superpowers to make Apple-quality mechanical parts in days not months and lowers your cost by orders of magnitude. That speed and affordability lets you iterate to get your parts to perfection and still lets you launch much earlier.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many companies spend a significant amount of money and resources processing data from logs, traces and metrics, forcing them to make trade-offs about how much to collect and store. <a href="https://www.hydrolix.io/">Hydrolix</a>, an early stage startup, announced a $10 million seed round today to help tackle logging at scale, while using unique technology to lower the cost of storing and querying this data.</p>
<p>Wing Venture Capital led the round with help from AV8 Ventures, Oregon Venture Fund and Silicon Valley Data Capital.</p>
<p>Company CEO and co-founder Marty Kagan noted that in his previous roles, he saw organizations with tons of data in logs, metrics and traces that could be valuable to various parts of the company, but most organizations couldn&#8217;t afford the high cost to maintain these records for very long due to the incredible volume of data involved. He started Hydrolix because he wanted to change the economics to make it easier to store and query this valuable data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The classic problem with these cluster-based databases is that they&#8217;ve got locally attached storage. So as the data set gets larger, you have no choice but to either spend a ton of money to grow your cluster or separate your hot and cold data to keep your costs under control,&#8221; Kagan told me.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, he says that when it comes to querying, the solutions out there like BigQuery and Snowflake are not well suited for this kind of data. &#8220;They rely really heavily on caching and bulk column scans, so they&#8217;re not really useful for [&#8230;] these infrastructure plays where you want to do live stream ingest, and you want to be able to do ad hoc data exploration,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Hydrolix wanted to create a more cost-effective way of storing and querying log data, while solving these issues with other tooling. &#8220;So we built a new storage layer which delivers [&#8230;] SSD-like performance using nothing but cloud storage and diskless spot instances,&#8221; Kagan explained. He says that this means that there is no caching or column scales, enabling them to do index searches. &#8220;You&#8217;re getting the low cost, unlimited retention benefits of cloud storage, but with the interactive performance of fully indexed search,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Scalyr scores $20M Series A for super-fast log reading tool&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/20/scalyr-scores-20m-series-a-for-super-fast-log-reading-tool/embed/#?secret=wqtPAYSSEJ" data-secret="wqtPAYSSEJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Peter Wagner, founding partner at investor Wing Venture Capital, says that the beauty of this tool is that it eliminates tradeoffs, while lowering customers overall data processing costs. &#8220;The Hydrolix team has built a real-time data platform optimized not only to deliver superior performance at a fraction of the cost of current analytics solutions, but one architected to offer those same advantages as data volumes grow by orders of magnitude,&#8221; Wagner said in a statement.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth pointing out that in the past couple of weeks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/sentinelone-acquires-high-speed-logging-startup-scalyr-for-155m/">SentinelOne bought high speed logging platform Scalyr</a> for $155 million, then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/logging-startups-are-suddenly-hot-as-crowdstrike-nabs-humio-for-400m/">CrowdStrike grabbed Humio</a>, another high speed logging tool for $400 million, so this category is getting attention.</p>
<p>The product is currently compatible with AWS and offered through the Amazon Marketplace, but Kagan says they are working on versions for Azure and Google Cloud and expect to have those available later this year. The company was founded at the end of 2018 and currently has 20 employees spread out over six countries with headquarters in Portland, Oregon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Enticing the enterprise world to embrace augmented reality has proven a more difficult task than many startups in the AR space anticipated, but as the hardware and software behind the tech becomes increasingly commodified, customers are starting to find use cases that align with their shifting remote workflows.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scopear.com/">Scope AR</a> has been selling the vision of using 3D models to help the manufacturing industry scale training and collaboration since they launched back in 2010. Now, the startup is looking to build a more scalable future for themselves as they revamp their central product WorkLink for the web, Scope AR CEO Scott Montgomerie tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The new platform called WorkLink Create allows customers to sidestep complexity and author 3D content on top of CAD models without using Unity, an effort to make the product more approachable to non-technical users and customers that might not have access to Unity developers to roll out an integration.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Unity is awesome but to do anything you have to code,&#8221; Montgomerie tells TechCrunch, calling WorkLink Create a &#8220;more user-friendly and scalable&#8221; option compared to software from its competitors.</p>
<p>The browser-based platform allows users to upload 3D files and edit them with comments, detailed instructions and animations via a drag-and-drop interface.

<p>Scope AR&#8217;s focus on commercial education, on-the-job training and troubleshooting have seen renewed interest as COVID era guidelines have pushed more meetings into virtual spaces.</p>
<p>While AR hasn&#8217;t seen the full embrace of the COVID-era digital transformation, the remote work boom in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has also boosted business for Scope AR&#8217;s products, Montgomerie says. With the company expanding its list of customers while also helping frontline manufacturing operations that have aimed to quickly build and repair medical equipment necessary for COVID-19 testing and treatment.</p>
<p>Montgomerie says that he had always expected AR adoption to take some time, but the the slow pace of AR headset adoption had exceeded his expectations, something that has pushed the company to fully embrace mobile-based AR integrations on phones and tablets over the years. Scope AR is an authorized reseller of the HoloLens 2, though HoloLens makes its own remote collaboration software for enterprise users as well called Remote Assist.</p>
<p>Scope AR closed a $9.7 million Series A back in 2019 &#8212; the bulk of the company&#8217;s nearly $12 million raised to date from investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Not every company&#8217;s founders find themselves on a first name basis with the local bomb squad, but then again not every company is <a href="https://noyalabs.com/">Noya Labs</a>, which wants to turn the roughly 2 million cooling towers at industrial sites and buildings across the U.S. into CO2 sucking weapons in the fight against global climate change.</p>
<p>When the company first started developing prototypes of its devices that attach to water coolers, the company&#8217;s founders, Josh Santos and Daniel Cavero, did what all good founders do, they started building in their backyard.</p>
<p>The sight of a 55 gallon oil drum, a yellow refrigeration tank in a sous vide bath attached to red and blue cables didn&#8217;t sit so well with the neighbors, so Santos and Cavero found themselves playing host to the bomb squad multiple times, according to the company&#8217;s chief executive, Santos.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We proved that it could capture CO2, and we achieved something that no startup should achieve,&#8221; Santos said of the dubious bomb squad distinction.</p>
<p>Santos and Cavero were inspired to begin their experiments with direct air capture by an article describing some research into plants&#8217; declining ability to capture carbon dioxide that Santos read on the Caltrain on his way to work back in 2019. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/climate/plants-co2-climate-change.html">That article</a> spurred the would-be entrepreneur and his roommate to get to work on experimenting with carbon chemistry.</p>
<p>Their first product was a consumer air purifier that would pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in homes and capture it. Homeowners could then sell the captured gases to Santos and Cavero who would then resell it. But the two quickly realized that the business model wasn&#8217;t economical, and went back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>They found their eventual application in industrial cooling towers, which the company&#8217;s tech can turn into CO2 capturing devices that have the capacity to take in between half a ton and a ton of carbon dioxide per day.</p>
<p>Noya&#8217;s tech works by adding a blend of CO2 absorbing chemicals to the water in the cooling towers. They then add an attachment to the cooling tower that activates what Santos called a regeneration process to convert the captured CO2 back into gas. Once they have captured the CO2 the company will look to resell it to industrial Co2 consumers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not green yet, at least not exactly, because that CO2 is being recirculated instead of sequestered, but Santos said it&#8217;s greener existing sources of the gas, which come from ammonia and ethanol plants.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2117187" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2117187" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2117187" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NoyaLabsFounders.png" alt="" width="1024" height="721" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NoyaLabsFounders.png 1878w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NoyaLabsFounders.png?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NoyaLabsFounders.png?resize=300,211 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NoyaLabsFounders.png?resize=768,541 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NoyaLabsFounders.png?resize=680,479 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NoyaLabsFounders.png?resize=1536,1081 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NoyaLabsFounders.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2117187" class="wp-caption-text">Noya Labs co-founders Josh Santos and Daniel Cavero. Image Credit: Noya Labs</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Five years from now we fully intend to have vertically integrated carbon capture and sequestration. Our first step is locally produced low cost atmospherically captured CO2,&#8221; said Santos. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we were to go all in on a carbon capture that would require a lot of time for us to develop. What this initial model allows us to do is fine tune our capture technology while building up longterm to go to market.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Santos called it the &#8220;Tesla roadster approach&#8221; so that the company can build up capital and get revenue and prove one piece of it as an MVP so they can prove other steps of it down the line.</p>
<p>Noya Labs already is developing a pilot plant with the <a href="https://alexandrefamilyfarm.com/">Alexandre Family Farm</a> that should capture between the estimated half a ton and one ton target.</p>
<p>To develop the initial pilot and build out its team, the company has managed to raise $1.2 million from the frontier tech investment firm Fifty Years, founded by Ela Madej and Seth Bannon, and Chris Sacca&#8217;s Lowercarbon Capital (whose mission statement to invest in companies that will buy time to &#8220;unf*ck the planet&#8221; might be one of the greatest). The company&#8217;s also in Y Combinator.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things that makes us excited about this technology is that in the U.S. alone there are 2 million cooling towers. Looking conservatively &#8212; if our initial pilot plant can capture 1 ton per day &#8212; we&#8217;re at right over half a gigaton of CO2 capture.&#8221;</p>
<p>And companies are already raising their hands to pick up the CO2 that Noya would sell on the market. There&#8217;s a growing collection of startups that are using CO2 to make products. These companies range from the slightly silly, like Aether Diamonds, which uses CO2 to make&#8230; diamonds; to companies like Dimensional Energy or Prometheus fuels, which make synthetic fuels with CO2, or Opus12, which uses CO2 in its replacements for petrochemicals.</p>
<p>Prices for commercial CO2 range between $125 per ton to $5,000 per ton, according to Santos. And Noya would be producing at less than $100 per ton. Current Direct Air Capture companies sell their CO2 from somewhere between $600 to $700 per ton.</p>
<p>Stoya&#8217;s first installation could cost around $250,000, Santos said. For Bannon, that means the company passes his <a href="https://twitter.com/sethbannon/status/1214215295969030148?lang=en">&#8220;Mr. Burns test.&#8221;</a></p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been digging into the DAC space but haven&#8217;t liked the techno-economics we&#8217;ve seen. Previous approaches have had too much capex and opex and not enough revenue potential,&#8221; Bannon wrote in an email. &#8220;That&#8217;s what Noya has solved. By leveraging existing industrial equipment, their model is profitable. And better yet, they make their carbon capture partners money, allowing them to scale this up fast. This creates an opportunity to profitably remove 1 gigaton plus a year.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As far as fundraising goes, Berkshire Grey is in pretty good shape. When I visited its Massachusetts headquarters last year, following a massive $263 million Series B, the company discussed some pretty aggressive growth plans. Mind you, that was before the pandemic has really touched down in the U.S. in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>If anything, Covid-19 has accelerated interest in automation, as companies look to safeguard themselves from the inevitable effects of future pandemics. Today, Berkshire Gray <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210224005491/en/Berkshire-Grey-a-Leader-in-AI-Enabled-Robotics-and-Automation-Solutions-Announces-Business-Combination-with-Revolution-Acceleration-Acquisition-Corp">announced its intention</a> to become the latest tech company to go public by way of SPAC. The deal, which finds its merging with Revolution Acceleration Acquisition, could value the company at up to $2.7 billion.</p>
<p>In a release tied to the news, BG cites a 5% current warehouse automation figure – a number I’ve heard tossed around a lot in relation to these deals. It certainly points big potential for growth among retailers looking to streamline fulfillment, logistics and the like. For many, it’s as simple as finding a way to stay competitive with the likes of Amazon, which has massively bolstered its own robotics efforts through acquisitions like Kiva Systems.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>BG offers a kind of ground-up solution for close to full automation. The technology separates it from more plug and play automation solutions like Locus and Fetch Robotics. Their offerings are more focused on automating companies faster and more cheaply. BG’s ecosystem includes a variety of different robotics, including picking, gripping and image sensing, with north of 300 patents in the space.</p>

<p>“Consumer expectations have changed, putting more pressure on supply chain operations to get the right goods to the right places at the right times, as efficiently as possible,” CEO Tom Wagner said in a release tied to the news. “Over the last 12 months the pandemic amplified the already high pressure to transform, so today it is no longer a question of if companies might transform but how quickly. We are incredibly excited about this transaction, which will enable Berkshire Grey to accelerate growth and provide new and existing customers with our leading robotics solutions.”</p>
<p>The deal would bring up up to $413 million in cash for the company. It says it plans to use the funding to address a backlog of customers and build out an international presence. It’s expected to close in Q2.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As energy grids transition away from fossil fuels and towards the use of zero emission sources of power from primarily renewable energy sources, they&#8217;re going to need an ability to store and then use the massive amounts of energy that&#8217;s only generated intermittently by the sun and wind.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why technologies coming from companies like<a href="https://www.maltainc.com/"> Malta</a>, an energy storage technology developer that just raised $50 million in new financing, are attracting attention and venture capital investment.</p>
<p>Malta spun out from the special projects group at Google&#8217;s parent company Alphabet and relies on some very old technologies combined in a novel way to provide long duration energy storage that can be discharged during times of peaking demand &#8212; like the conditions that effected Texas&#8217; power grid last week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s latest round of funding was led by the Swiss natural gas, methanol, and agricultural conglomerate Proman; with participation from previous investors Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the nearly ubiquitous backer of renewable energy and sustainable startups, and Alfa Laval, which makes industrial filters and heat exchangers. Dustin Moskovitz, a co-founder of Facebook and the chief executive and co-founder of Asana, also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Heat exchangers are central to Malta&#8217;s approach, which is based on research from the Nobel Prize winning Stanford University physics professor, Robert Laughlin. <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4994054">In a 2017 paper</a>, Laughlin proposed a system that used a thermal heat-pump tapping super-cold cryogenic storage fluids and superheated molten salt to store energy.</p>
<p>Building on that initial design, engineers at Alphabet&#8217;s moonshot factory, X, began developing a modified version of the designs Laughlin proposed.</p>
<p>That modified design is what&#8217;s now being developed by Malta, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-19/gates-bezos-among-billionaires-backing-alphabet-energy-spinoff">which spun out from X in 2018</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramya Swaminathan, Malta&#8217;s chief executive officer, who previously worked for the renewable energy project developer Rye Development, said that the current Malta system can store and dispatch energy with efficiency rates of around 60%. That&#8217;s&#8230; not great, but Swaminathan said that the declining costs of renewable power means that efficiency is less important as prices continue to come down the cost curve. &#8220;In practice we are heading towards a system where electricity is priced close to zero,&#8221; Swaminathan said. Indeed, as some grids employ negative pricing models when there&#8217;s a glut of electricity generated by wind and solar power, Malta&#8217;s tech becomes more appealing she said. </span></p>
<p>Malta is far from the only company developing long-duration storage to solve the variable power production problem caused by the build out of renewable energy. <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/02/16/clean-renewable-energy-storage-malta-bill-gates-lithiium-ion-batteries-climate-change-green/"><em>Fortune </em>had a whole dang article</a> (which is actually something I&#8217;d wanted to write) listing the multiple companies that are tackling the energy storage dilemma.</p>
<p>They include companies like Energy Vault and Advanced Rail Energy Storage North America, which are both trying to use mechanical energy for long storage. In Energy Vault&#8217;s case that means using renewable power to lift huge one ton blocks of cement that can then be dropped to unleash that stored energy as power. ARES North America uses a similar concept, but instead of big honkin bricks, the company has trains that it moves to store and discharge energy.</p>
<p>Closer to Malta&#8217;s Cambridge, Mass. base of operations, a company called Form Energy is working on&#8230; something&#8230; that would compete with Malta&#8217;s energy storage system. That business was <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/inside-form-energy-star-studded-startup-tackling-hardest-problem-in-clean">launched by some energy storage superstars</a>, who previously had stints at companies like Tesla, the failed big battery tech developer Aquion, and A123 Systems (a granddaddy of the lithium ion battery revolution).</p>
<p>Malta&#8217;s system is able to discharge 100 megawatts over ten hours, which is equivalent to one gigawatt hour of production at a price tag that&#8217;s about price competitive with lithium ion batteries, according to Swaminathan.</p>
<p>The company is currently working on its first commercial scale plant, which it expects to commission in the 2024 or 2025 timeframe.</p>
<p>Meanwhile it&#8217;s competitors are already supplying power from pretty massive storage projects. Energy Vault has had a demonstration unit connected to the Swiss national utility grid that can discharge roughly 35 megawatt hours onto the grid, <a href="https://energyvault.com/commercial-demonstration-unit/">according to the company</a>.</p>
<p>Companies like Proman like Malta because it can provide a ready customer for its chemicals and natural gas.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is an exponential global need for long-duration, low-cost energy storage solutions, and we are excited to work with the Malta team and our new partners to progress Malta’s highly scalable and technically robust solution,&#8221; said David Cassidy, Chief Executive of Proman, in a statement. &#8220;Alongside our investment, Proman will bring complementary design, engineering and construction expertise to the Malta PHES technology as we begin work with Malta on a commercial scale plant.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.patch.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the carbon offset API developer, has raised $4.5 million in financing to build out its business selling customers a way to calculate their carbon footprint and identify and finance offset projects that capture the equivalent carbon dioxide emissions associated with that footprint. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/andreessen-horowitz-could-make-the-carbon-offset-api-patch-its-latest-climate-bet/">Confirming TechCrunch reporting</a>, Andreessen Horowitz led the round, which also included previous investors <a href="https://versionone.vc/">VersionOne Ventures</a>, <a href="http://www.maplevc.com/">MapleVC</a>, and <a href="https://www.palebluedotventures.com/">Pale Blue Dot Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>Patch&#8217;s application protocol interface works for both internal and customer-facing operations. The company&#8217;s code can integrate into the user experience on a company&#8217;s internal site to track things like business flights for employees, recommending and managing the purchase of carbon credits to offset employee travel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The software allows companies to choose which projects they&#8217;d like to finance to support the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere with projects ranging from the tried and true reforestation and conservation projects to more high tech early stage technologies like direct air capture and sequestration projects, the company said. </span></p>
<p>Patch founders <a href="https://twitter.com/bspellacy_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brennan Spellacy</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-grunfeld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aaron Grunfeld, </a>two former employees at the apartment rental service Sonder, stressed in an interview that the company&#8217;s offset work should not be viewed as an alternative to the decarbonization of businesses that use its service. Rather, they see Patch&#8217;s services as a compliment to other work companies need to do to transition away from a reliance on fossil fuels in business operations.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2117071" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2117071" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2117071" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6.jpeg 1728w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2117071" class="wp-caption-text">Patch co-founders Brennon Spellacy and Aaron Grunfeld. Image Credit: <a href="https://www.patch.io">Patch</a></p></div></p>
<p>Patch currently works with 11 carbon removal suppliers and has plans to onboard another 10 before the end of the first quarter, the company said. These are companies like <a href="https://www.carboncure.com/#:~:text=CarbonCure%20manufactures%20a%20technology%20that,process%20and%20becomes%20permanently%20embedded.">CarbonCure</a>, which injects carbon dioxide into cement and fixes it so that it&#8217;s embedded in building materials for as long as a building lasts.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Carbon removal credits can help to dramatically accelerate the deployment of technologies like CarbonCure’s, which are absolutely critical to helping us reach our global climate targets. Demand for high-quality, permanent credits is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sky-rocketing, and listing credits on Patch will help us to attract a broader range of buyers,” said Jennifer Wagner, President of CarbonCure Technologies, in a statement. </span></p>
<p>It also has around 15 customers already using its service, according to earlier TechCrunch reporting. Those buyers include companies like TripAction and the private equity firm EQT, which intends to extend the integration of Patch&#8217;s API from its own operations to those of its portfolio companies down the road, according to Spellacy.</p>
<p>Grunfeld said that the company would be spending the money to hire more staff and developing new products. From its current headcount of six employees, Patch intends to bring on another 24 by the end of the year.</p>
<p>As the company expands, it&#8217;s looking to some of the startups providing carbon emissions audit and verification services as a channel that the company&#8217;s API can integrate with and sell through.  These would be businesses like  <a href="https://carbonchain.com/">CarbonChain</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/persefoni-launches-with-3-5-million-and-a-carbon-accounting-system-for-big-business/">Persefoni</a>, and another Y Combinator graduate, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/yc-grad-sinai-helps-companies-understand-their-emissions-in-a-bid-to-fight-climate-change/">SINAI Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>For project developers like CarbonCure, which makes direct air capture technology, companies like</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An increasing number of businesses are taking leadership positions in an effort to reduce emissions to try to counteract global warming,” said Jeff Jordan, Managing Partner at Andreessen Horowitz. “Patch makes it much easier for companies to add carbon removal to their core business processes, aggregating verified carbon-removal supply and offering turn-key access to it to companies through an easy-to-implement API.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The weather data and forecasting startup <a href="https://www.climacell.co/">ClimaCell</a> today announced that it plans to launch its own constellation of small weather satellites. These radar-equipped satellites will allow ClimaCell to improve its ability to get a better picture of global weather and improve its forecasting abilities. The company expects the first of these to launch in the second half of 2022.</p>
<p>As ClimaCell CEO Shimon Elkabetz points out in today&#8217;s announcement, ground-based radar coverage, which allows you to get information about precipitation and cloud structure, remains spotty, even in the U.S., which in turn often makes even basic forecasting more difficult. And while there are (expensive) space-based radar satellites available, those often only revisit the same area every three days, limiting their usefulness. ClimaCell hopes that its constellation of small, specialized satellites will offer hourly revisit times.</p>
<p>We started with proprietary sensing and modeling to predict the weather more accurately at every point in the world, and built on top of it one software platform that can be configured to every job and vertical,&#8221; Elkabetz writes. &#8220;[&#8230;] Now, we are evolving into a SaaS company powered by Space: We’re launching a constellation of satellites to improve weather forecasting for the entire world. For the first time, a constellation of active radar will surround Earth and provide real-time observations to feed weather forecasting at every point on the globe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s indeed a big step for the company, but we may just see more of this in the near future. While even 10 years ago it would have been hard for even a well-funded company to launch its own satellites, that&#8217;s quite different now. A number of factors contributed to this, ranging from easier access to launch services, breakthroughs in building these proprietary radar satellites and the availability of auxiliary services like ground stations as a service, which now even AWS and Microsoft offer, and a whole ecosystem of vendors that specialize in building these satellites. The ClimaCell team tells me that it is talking to a lot of vendors right now and will choose which one to go to later on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Engineering teams face steep challenges when it comes to staying on schedule, and keeping to those schedules can have an impact on the entire organization. <a href="https://www.acumen.io/">Acumen</a>, an Israeli engineering operations startup announced a $7 million seed investment today to help tackle this problem.</p>
<p>Hetz, 10D, Crescendo and Jibe participated in the round, designed to give the startup the funding to continue building out the product and bring it to market. The company, which has been working with beta customers for almost a year, also announced it was emerging from stealth today.</p>
<p>As an experienced startup founder, Acumen CEO and co-founder Nevo Alva has seen engineering teams struggle as they grow due to a lack of data and insight into how the teams are performing. He and his co-founders launched Acumen to give companies that missing visibility.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;As engineering teams scale, they face challenges due to a lack of visibility into what&#8217;s going on in the team. Suddenly prioritizing our tasks becomes much harder. We experience interdependencies [that have an impact on the schedule] every day,&#8221; Alva explained.</p>
<p>He says this manifests itself in a decrease in productivity and velocity and ultimately missed deadlines that have an impact across the whole company. What Acumen does is collect data from a variety of planning and communications tools that the engineering teams are using to organize their various projects. It then uses machine learning to identify potential problems that could have an impact on the schedule and presents this information in a customizable dashboard.</p>

<p>The tool is aimed at engineering team leaders, who are charged with getting their various projects completed on time with the goal of helping them understand possible bottlenecks. The software&#8217;s machine learning algorithms will learn over time what situations cause problems, and offer suggestions on how to prevent them from becoming major issues.</p>
<p>The company was founded in July 2019 and the founders spent the first 10 months working with a dozen design partners building out the first version of the product, making sure it could pass muster with various standards bodies like SOC-2. It has been in closed private beta since last year and is launching publicly this week.</p>
<p>Acumen currently has 20 employees with plans to add 10 more by the end of this year. After working remotely for most of 2020, Alva says that location is no longer really important when it comes to hiring. &#8220;It definitely becomes less and less important where they are. I think time zones still are still a consideration when speaking of remote,&#8221; he said. In fact, they have people in Israel, the US and eastern Europe at the moment among their 20 employees.</p>
<p>He recognizes that employees can feel isolated working alone, so the company has video meetings every day and spend the first part just chatting about non-work stuff as a way to stay connected. Starting today, Acumen will begin its go to market effort in earnest. While Alva recognizes there are competing products out there like Harness and Pinpoint, he thinks his company&#8217;s use of data and machine learning really helps differentiate it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since going public, most of the news out of Airbnb has been around <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/airbnb/">policy</a>. Today, the company has an announcement that&#8217;s all about the product.</p>
<p>As the pandemic evolves the way we do everything, and we collectively realize that much of that new behavior will be permanent, tech companies are looking to evolve alongside us.</p>
<p>Airbnb is today introducing Flexible Search, which will allow users to forgo putting in exact dates when they look to book lodging on the platform. Instead, users can search for a weekend getaway, week-long vacation, month-long vacation or months-long vacation without setting specific dates.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Not only does this give guests more options to browse through, but it should also increase exposure for hosts.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2117141" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2117141" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2117141" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2117141" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Airbnb</p></div>Airbnb says that its new <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/2021-travel/">travel trends report</a> shows that one quarter of Americans would consider traveling during off-peak times of the year or the week, and in 2021 so far, more than 1/3 of the people searching on Airbnb have been flexible in terms of date and location.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the company had to say about it in a blog post:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s no surprise COVID-19 continues to change the way we travel, and in addition to redesigning our platform last year to make nearby and longer-term stays easier to find and book, our new Flexible Dates feature aligns with a broader shift in how people will travel in the future. The traditional travel industry was built around fixed destinations with fixed dates in mind, but that model no longer meets the needs of today’s travelers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Travel, and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-coronavirus-ravaged-travel-in-2020-11604500952">air travel in particular</a>, have been devastated by the pandemic in 2020. Signs of a slow recovery are starting to sprout up, but the move to remote work (which has resulted in much, much less business travel) means that a good chunk of the depression in the travel industry is here to stay. That said, Airbnb&#8217;s travel trends report shows that the majority of folks (54 percent) miss traveling and are planning their next getaway.</p>
<p>Flexible Search will allow users to get back in the mindset of travel without having an exact plan around dates, which is particularly important as the positivity rates around the globe and country continue to shift.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube announced this morning it will soon introduce a new experience designed for teens and tweens who are now too old for the schoolager-focused YouTube Kids app, but who may not be ready to explore all of YouTube. The company says it&#8217;s preparing to launch a beta test of new features that will give parents the ability to grant kids more limited access to YouTube through a &#8220;supervised&#8221; Google Account. This setup will restrict what tweens and teens can watch on the platform, as well as what they can do &#8212; like create videos or leave comments, for example.</p>
<p>Many parents may have already set up <a href="https://support.google.com/families/answer/7103338?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=7336731">a supervised Google Account</a> for their child through Google&#8217;s <a href="https://families.google.com/familylink/">Family Link</a> parental control app. This app allows parents to restrict access across a range of products and services, control screen time, filter websites and more. Other parents may have created a supervised Google Account for their child when they first set up the child&#8217;s account on a new Android device or Chromebook.</p>
<p>If not, parents can take a few minutes to create the child&#8217;s supervised account when they&#8217;re ready to begin testing the new features. (Unfortunately, Google Edu accounts &#8212; like those kids now use for online school &#8212; aren&#8217;t supported at launch.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new features will allow parents to select between three different levels of YouTube access for their tween or teen. Initially, YouTube will test the features with parents with children under the age of consent for online services &#8212; age 13 in the U.S., but different in other countries &#8212; before expanding to older groups.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116948" style="width: 520px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116948" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116948" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_PSA-campaign.png?w=510" alt="" width="510" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_PSA-campaign.png 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_PSA-campaign.png?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_PSA-campaign.png?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_PSA-campaign.png?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_PSA-campaign.png?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116948" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>For tweens who have more recently graduated out of the YouTube Kids app, an &#8220;Explore&#8221; mode will allow them to view a broad range of videos generally suited for viewers age 9 and up &#8212; including vlogs, tutorials, gaming videos, music clips, news, and educational content. This would allow the kids to watch things like their favorite gaming streamer with kid-friendly content, but would prevent them (in theory) from finding their way over to more sensitive content.</p>
<p>The next step up is an &#8220;Explore More&#8221; mode, where videos are generally suitable for kids 13 and up &#8212; like a PG-13 version of YouTube. This expands the set of videos kids can access and allows them access to live streams in the same categories as &#8220;Explore.&#8221;</p>
<p>For older teens, there is the &#8220;Most of YouTube&#8221; mode, which includes almost all YouTube videos except those that include <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802167">age-restricted content</a> that isn&#8217;t appropriate for viewers under 18.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116947" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116947" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116947" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_Content-settings.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="639" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_Content-settings.png 1211w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_Content-settings.png?resize=150,141 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_Content-settings.png?resize=300,282 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_Content-settings.png?resize=768,722 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_Content-settings.png?resize=680,639 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_Content-settings.png?resize=50,47 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116947" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>YouTube says it will use a combination of user input, machine learning, and human review to curate which videos are included in each of the three different content settings.</p>
<p>Of course, much like YouTube Kids, that means this will not be a perfect system &#8212; it&#8217;s a heavily machine-automated attempt at curation where users will still have to flag videos that were improperly filtered. In other words, helicopter parents who closely supervise their child&#8217;s access to internet content will probably still want to use some other system &#8212; like a third-party parental control solution, perhaps &#8212; to lock down YouTube further.</p>
<p>The supervised access to YouTube comes with other restrictions, as well, the company says.</p>
<p>Parents will be able to manage the child&#8217;s watch and search history from within the child&#8217;s account settings. And certain features on YouTube will be disabled, depending on the level of access the child has.</p>
<p>For example, YouTube will disable in-app purchases, video creation, and commenting features at launch. The company says that, over time, it wants to work with parents to add some of these features back through some sort of parent-controlled approach.</p>
<p>Also key is that personalized ads won&#8217;t be served on supervised experiences, even if that content isn&#8217;t <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9713557?hl=en">designated as &#8220;made for kids&#8221;</a> &#8212; which would normally allow for personalized ads to run. Instead, all ads will be contextual, as they are on YouTube Kids. In addition, all ads will have to comply with <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/9683742">kids advertising policies</a>, YouTube&#8217;s <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/188570?topic=30084&amp;ctx=topic">general ad policies</a>, and will be subject to the same <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/9683742">category and ad content restrictions</a> as on <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/better-protecting-kids-privacy-on-youtube/">Made for Kids</a> content.</p>
<p>That said, when parents establish the supervised account for their child, they&#8217;ll be providing consent for <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-six-step-compliance">COPPA</a> compliance &#8212; the U.S. children&#8217;s privacy law that requires parents to be notified and agree to the collection and use personal data from the kids&#8217; account. So there&#8217;s a trade-off here.</p>
<p>However, the new experience may still make sense for families where kids have outgrown apps designed for younger children &#8212; or even in some cases, for younger kids who covet their big brother or sister&#8217;s version of &#8220;real YouTube.&#8221; Plus, at some point, forcing an older child to use the &#8220;Kids&#8221; app makes them feel like they&#8217;re behind their peers, too. And since not all parents use the YouTube Kids app or parental controls, there&#8217;s always the complaint that <em>&#8220;everyone else has it, so why can&#8217;t I?&#8221; </em>(It never ends.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116944" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116944" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116944" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/YouTube-Kids.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/YouTube-Kids.png 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/YouTube-Kids.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/YouTube-Kids.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/YouTube-Kids.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/YouTube-Kids.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/YouTube-Kids.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116944" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube Kids app</p></div></p>
<p>This slightly more locked down experience lets parents give the child access to &#8220;real YouTube&#8221; with restrictions on what that actually means, in terms of content and features.</p>
<p>YouTube, in an <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supervised-experiences-for-families-on-youtube/">announcement</a>, shared several endorsements for the new product from a few individual youth experts, including Leslie Boggs, president of National PTA; Dr. Yalda Uhls, Center for Scholars &amp; Storytellers, UCLA &#8211; Author of Media Moms &amp; Digital Dads; Thiago Tavares, Founder and President of SaferNet Brazil; and Professor Sun Sun Lim, Singapore University of Technology &amp; Design &#8211; Author of Transcendent Parenting.</p>
<p>YouTube&#8217;s news, notably, follows several product updates from fast-growing social video app and YouTube rival TikTok, which has rolled out a number of features aimed at better protecting its younger users.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/tiktok-to-launch-parental-controls-globally-disable-direct-messaging-for-users-under-16/">in April 2020 launched a &#8220;family pairing&#8221; mode</a> that lets a parent link their child&#8217;s account to their own in order to also lock down what the child can do and what content they can see. (TikTok offers a curated experience for the under-13 crowd called Restricted Mode, which can be switched on here, too.) And in January of this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/">TikTok changed the privacy setting defaults</a> for users under 18 to more proactively restrict what they do on the app.</p>
<p>YouTube says its new product will launch in beta in the &#8220;coming months&#8221; in over 80 countries worldwide. It also notes that it will continue to invest in YouTube Kids for parents with younger children.</p>
