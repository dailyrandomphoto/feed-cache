										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a>, Google&#8217;s cross-platform UI toolkit for building mobile and desktop apps, is getting a small but important update at the company&#8217;s I/O conference today. Google also announced that Flutter now powers 200,000 apps in the Play Store alone, including popular apps from companies like WeChat, ByteDance, BMW, Grab and DiDi. Indeed, Google notes that 1 in 8 new apps in the Play Store are now Flutter apps.</p>
<p>The launch of Flutter 2.2 follows Google&#8217;s rollout of Flutter 2, which first added support for desktop and web apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/version-2-of-googles-flutter-toolkit-adds-support-for-desktop-and-web-apps/">in March</a>, so it&#8217;s no surprise that this is a relatively minor release. In many ways, the update builds on top of the features the company introduced in version 2 and reliability and performance improvements.</p>
<p>Version 2.2 makes null safety the default for new projects, for example, to add protections against null reference exceptions. As for performance, web apps can now use background caching using service workers, for example, while Android apps can use deferred components and iOS apps get support for precompiled shaders to make first runs smoother.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google also worked on streamlining the overall process of bringing Flutter apps to desktop platforms (Windows, macOS and Linux).</p>
<p>But as Google notes, a lot of the work right now is happening in the ecosystem. Google itself is introducing a new payment plugin for Flutter built in partnership with the Google Pay team and Google&#8217;s ads SDK for Flutter is getting support for adaptive banner formats. Meanwhile, Samsung is now porting Flutter to Tizen and Sony is leading an effort to bring it to embedded Linux. Adobe recently announced its XD to Flutter plugin for its design tool and Microsoft today launched the alpha of Flutter support for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps for Windows 10 in alpha.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its I/O developer conference, Google today announced the first beta of the next version of its Android Studio IDE, Arctic Fox. For the most part, the idea here is to bring more of the tooling around building Android apps directly into the IDE.</p>
<p>While there is a lot that&#8217;s new in Arctic Fox, maybe the marquee feature of this update is the integration of <a href="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose">Jetpack Compose</a>, Google&#8217;s toolkit for building modern user interfaces for Android. In Android Studio, developers can now use Compose Preview to create previews of different configurations (think themes and devices) or deploy a preview directly to a device, all while the layout inspector makes it easier for developers to understand how (and why) a layout is rendered the way it is. With Live Updates enabled any change is then also directly streamed to the device.</p>
<p>The team also integrated the Android Accessibility Test Framework directly into Android Studio to help developers find accessibility issues like missing content descriptions or a low contrast in their designs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2153332" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153332" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2153332" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="487" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_1.png 1679w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_1.png?resize=150,71 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_1.png?resize=300,143 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_1.png?resize=768,365 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_1.png?resize=680,323 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_1.png?resize=1536,730 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android_studio_1.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2153332" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Just like with some of the updates to Android itself, the team is also looking at making it easier to develop for a wider range of form factors. To build Wear OS apps, developers previously had to physically connect the watch to their development machine or go through a lot of steps to pair the watch. Now, users can simply pair a watch and phone emulator (or physical phone) with the new Wear OS Pairing feature. All this takes now is a few clicks.</p>
<p>Also new on the Wear OS side is a new heart rate sensor for the Wear OS Emulators in Android Studio, while the Android Automotive emulator gains the ability to replay car sensor data to help those developers with their development and testing workflow.</p>
<p>Android Studio users who work on a Mac will be happy to hear that Google is also launching a first preview of Android Studio for the Apple Silicon (arm64) architecture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is working on a video calling booth that uses 3D imagery on a 3D display to create a lifelike image of the people on both sides. While it&#8217;s still experimental, <a href="https://blog.google/technology/research/project-starline/">&#8220;Project Starline&#8221;</a> builds on years of research and acquisitions, and could be the core of a more personal-feeling video meeting in the near future.</p>
<p>The system was only shown via video of unsuspecting participants, who were asked to enter a room with a heavily obscured screen and camera setup. Then the screen lit up with a video feed of a loved one, but in a way none of them expected:</p>
<p>&#8220;I could feel her and see her, it was like this 3D experience. It was like she was here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt like I could really touch him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It really, really felt like she and I were in the same room.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q13CishCKXY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>CEO Sundar Pichai explained that this &#8220;experience&#8221; was made possible with high-resolution cameras and custom depth sensors, almost certainly related to these Google research projects into essentially converting videos of people and locations into interactive 3D scenes:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;This room-sized LED egg captures amazing 3D models of the people inside it&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/this-room-sized-led-egg-captures-amazing-3d-models-of-the-people-inside-it/embed/#?secret=UFzOe1ibC0" data-secret="UFzOe1ibC0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The cameras and sensors — probably a dozen or more hidden around the display — capture the person from multiple angles and figure out their exact shape, creating a live 3D model of them. This model and all the color and lighting information is then (after a lot of compression and processing) sent to the other person&#8217;s setup, which shows it in convincing 3D. It even tracks their heads and bodies to adjust the image to their perspective. (There&#8217;s a bit more on an early version of the technique <a href="https://blog.siggraph.org/2020/08/how-google-is-making-streamable-light-field-video-a-reality.html/">here</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-gif.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2154181" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-gif.gif" alt="" width="800" height="455" /></a></p>
<p>But 3D TVs have more or less fallen by the wayside; turns out no one wants to wear special glasses for hours at a time, and the quality on glasses-free 3D was generally pretty bad. So what&#8217;s making this special 3D image?</p>
<p>Pichai said &#8220;we have developed a breakthrough light field display,&#8221; probably with the help of the people and IP it scooped up from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/27/lytro-is-shutting-down/">Lytro, the light field camera company</a> that didn&#8217;t manage to get its own tech off the ground and dissolved in 2018.</p>
<p>Light field cameras and displays create and show 3D imagery using a variety of techniques that are very difficult to explain or show in 2D. The startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/looking-glass-is-launching-3d-photo-software-for-its-holographic-tech/">Looking Glass</a> has made several that are extremely arresting to view in person, showing 3D models and photographic scenes that truly look like tiny holograms.</p>
<p>Whether Google&#8217;s approach is similar or different, the effect appears to be equally impressive, as the participants indicate. They&#8217;ve been testing this internally and are getting ready to send out units to partners in various industries (such as medicine) where the feeling of a person&#8217;s presence makes a big difference.</p>
<p>At this point Project Starline is still very much a prototype, and probably a ridiculously expensive one — so don&#8217;t expect to get one in your home any time soon. But it&#8217;s not wild to think that a consumer version of this light field setup may be available down the line. Google promises to share more later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When a founder has a work history that includes the name of the parent company of one of their key investors, you probably assume that was one of the first deals to come together. Not so with May Mobility and Toyota AI Ventures, which connected for the company&#8217;s second seed round, after May went out and raised its original seed purely on the strength of its own ideas and proposed solutions.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one of the many interesting things we learned from speaking to May Mobility co-founder and CEO Edwin Olson, as well as Chief Product Officer Nina Grooms Lee and Toyota AI Ventures founding partner Jim Adler on an episode of Extra Crunch Live.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> goes down every Wednesday at 3 p.m. EDT/noon PDT. Our next episode is with <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-sequoia-and-vise">Sequoia&#8217;s Shaun Maguire and Vise&#8217;s Samir Vasavada</a>, and you can check out the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/check-out-the-tech-leaders-joining-us-on-extra-crunch-live-in-may/">upcoming schedule right here</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, read on for highlights from our chat with Olson, Grooms Lee and Adler, and then stay tuned at the end for a recording of the full session, including our live pitch-off.</p>
<h2>A different approach to corporate VC</h2>
<p>One thing Adler brought up early in the chat is that Toyota AI Ventures likely takes a different approach than most traditional corporate VCs, which are often thought of as being more incentivized by strategic alignment than by venture-scale returns. Adler says the firm he founded within the automaker&#8217;s corporate umbrella actually does behave much more like a traditional VC in some ways than many would assume.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today announced it&#8217;s partnering with Shopify, giving the e-commerce platform&#8217;s over 1.7 million merchants the ability to reach consumers through Google Search and its other services. The integration will allow merchants to sign up in just a few clicks to have their products appear across Google&#8217;s 1 billion &#8220;shopping journeys&#8221; that take place every day through Search, Maps, Images, Lens and YouTube.</p>
<p>The company didn&#8217;t offer extensive details about the integration when it was announced during Google&#8217;s I/O Developer event this afternoon. But the news follows a series of updates to Google Shopping resulting from <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/29/amazons-ads-business-nears-7-billion-a-quarter-posts-77percent-growth.html">Amazon&#8217;s increased investment in its own advertising business</a>, which threatens Google&#8217;s core ads business.</p>
<p>Google made its pitch to online advertisers today, describing how its so-called &#8220;Shopping Graph&#8221; would now begin to pull together information from across websites, price reviews, videos and product data pulled directly from brands and retailers, to help better inform online shoppers about where to find items, how well they were received, which merchant has the best price, and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This Shopping Graph can span across Google&#8217;s platforms, whether someone is discovering products through Google Search or even watching videos on YouTube, among other things.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154126" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154126" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2154126" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-2.38.40-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="396" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-2.38.40-PM.jpg 1259w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-2.38.40-PM.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-2.38.40-PM.jpg?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-2.38.40-PM.jpg?resize=768,448 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-2.38.40-PM.jpg?resize=680,396 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-18-at-2.38.40-PM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2154126" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google I/O 2021</p></div></p>
<p>For example, when you now view screenshots of products in Google Photos, there will be a suggestion to search the photo using Google Lens, to help you find the item for sale. And Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/youtube-to-expand-shorts-to-the-u-s-add-4k-and-dvr-to-youtube-tv-launch-in-video-shopping-and-more-in-2021/">announced</a> earlier this year it was pilot-testing a new experience on YouTube that allows users to shop products they learn about from their favorite creators &#8212; a move to counteract the growing threats from TikTok and Facebook, and their own investments in e-commerce.</p>
<p>But before any of this Shopping Graph functionality can really work, Google needs consumers to find shopping for products via Google actually useful. That&#8217;s partly why <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/google-switches-its-shopping-search-service-to-mostly-free-listings/">Google made it free for merchants to sell their products across Google </a>this past year &#8212; a change that Google says drove an 80% increase in merchants on Google, with the &#8220;vast majority&#8221; being small to medium-sized business.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where the partnership with Shopify comes in, too. Though this integration doesn&#8217;t mean that every Shopify storefront will be included on Google &#8212; the merchants have to take an action to make that happen &#8212; it would be almost a no-brainer for them not to leverage the new option.</p>
<p>Shopify isn&#8217;t playing favorites when it comes to distribution, however. It&#8217;s integrated with other large platforms, too, including <a href="https://news.shopify.com/shopify-partners-with-facebook-to-help-businesses-launch-branded-facebook-shops">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/tiktok-invests-in-social-commerce-via-new-shopify-partnership/">TikTok</a>. And it&#8217;s been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-its-online-marketplace/">working with Walmart</a> to expand the retailer&#8217;s online marketplace, as well.</p>
<p>Investors seemed happy with the Shopify news this afternoon. Shortly after Google&#8217;s announcement, the <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/SHOP:NYSE?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjZv_LZ7tPwAhUgElkFHTjtBJ0Q3ecFMAB6BAgNEBo">stock</a> popped 3.52%.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is working with BMW and other automakers to develop a digital key that will let car owners lock, unlock and start a vehicle from their Android smartphone, the company announced Tuesday during its 2021 Google I/O developer event.</p>
<p>The digital key is one many new features coming to Android 12, the latest version of the company&#8217;s mobile operating system. The digital car keys will become available on select Pixel and Samsung Galaxy phones later this year, according to Sameer Samat, VP of PM for Android &amp; Google Play. The digital car key will be available in yet unnamed 2022 vehicle models, including ones made by BMW, and some 2021 models.</p>
<p>The digital key uses so-called Ultra Wideband (UWB) technology, a form of radio transmission for which the sensor can tell the direction of the signal, sort of like a tiny radar. This lets the antenna in your phone locate and identify objects equipped with UWB transmitters. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">By using UWB technology, the Android user will be able to lock and unlock their vehicle without taking their phone out. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2153897" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Digital-Car-Key.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153897" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2153897 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Digital-Car-Key.jpeg?w=680" alt="Google Android digital car key" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Digital-Car-Key.jpeg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Digital-Car-Key.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Digital-Car-Key.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Digital-Car-Key.jpeg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Digital-Car-Key.jpeg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Digital-Car-Key.jpeg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Digital-Car-Key.jpeg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Digital-Car-Key.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Digital-Car-Key.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Digital-Car-Key.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Digital-Car-Key.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Digital-Car-Key.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2153897" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Consumers who own car models that have enabled NFC technology, or near-field communication, will be able unlock their car by tapping their phone against the door. The phone communicates with an NFC reader in the user&#8217;s car, which is typically located within the door handle. Google said users will also be able to securely and remotely share their car key with friends and family if they need to borrow the car.</p>
<p>The announcement follows a similar move made by Apple last year that allowed users to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-turns-the-iphone-into-the-key-for-your-car/">add a digital car key</a> to their iPhone or Apple Watch. That feature, which was part of iOS 14, works over NFC and first became available in the 2021 BMW 5 Series.</p>
<p>A growing number of automakers have developed their own apps, which can also control certain functions such as remote locking and unlocking. The big benefit, in Google&#8217;s and likely Apple&#8217;s view, is that by offering the digital car key in its mobile operating system, users don&#8217;t have to download an app.</p>
<p>The intent is for a less clunky experience. And there&#8217;s a movement to make it even more seamless. The Car Connectivity Consortium, which Apple, Google, Samsung along with automakers BMW, GM, Honda, Hyundai and Volkswagen are members of, have spent the past several years creating an underlying agreement to make it easier to work in a seamless way and to standardize a digital key solution.</p>
<p>The development of the digital car key is just part of Google&#8217;s push to ensure the smartphone is the centerpiece of consumers&#8217; lives. And it&#8217;s a goal that can&#8217;t be achieved without including vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;When purchasing a phone these days, we’re buying not only a phone, but also an entire ecosystem of devices that are all expected to work together &#8212; such as TVs, laptops, cars and wearables like smartwatches or fitness tracker, Google&#8217;s vp of engineering Erik Kay wrote in a blog post accompanying the announcement during the event. &#8220;In North America, the average person now has around eight connected devices, and by 2022, this is predicted to grow to 13 connected devices.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google said it is expanding its &#8220;fast pair&#8221; feature, which lets users pair their devices via Bluetooth with a single tap, to other products, including vehicles. To date, consumers have used &#8220;fast pair&#8221; more than 36 million times to connect their Android phones with Bluetooth accessories, including Sony, Microsoft, JBL, Philips, Google and many other popular brands, according to Kay.</p>
<p>The feature will be rolled out to more devices in the coming months, including Beats headphones as well as cars from BMW and Ford, Sameer Samat, VP of PM for Android &amp; Google Play said during Google I/O.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For years, Wear OS has been, at best, something of a dark horse among Google operating systems. It’s certainly not for lack of partnership or investment, but for whatever reason, the company has never really stuck the landing with its wearable operating system.</p>
<p>It’s a category in which Apple has been utterly dominant for some time. Google has largely failed to chip away at that market, in spite of enlisting some of the biggest names in consumer electronics as partners. Figures <a href="https://news.strategyanalytics.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Strategy-Analytics-Global-Smartwatch-Shipments-Grow-20-Percent-to-14-Million-in-Q1-2020/default.aspx">from Strategy Analytics</a> classify Wear OS among the “others” category.</p>
<p>Google’s strategy is, once again, the result of partnerships – or, more precisely, partnerships combined with acquisitions. At the top of the list is an “if you can’t beat ‘em, join em’” approach to Samsung’s longstanding preference for open-source Tizen. It seemed like one of the stranger plays in the category, but building out its own version of Tizen has proven a winning strategy for the company, which trails only Apple in the category.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re making the biggest update ever to <a href="https://twitter.com/WearOSbyGoogle?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@wearosbygoogle</a>, including new capabilities for Google apps — like turn-by-turn navigation in Google Maps, or downloading songs from YouTube Music for offline listening… even if you leave your phone behind. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoogleIO?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GoogleIO</a> <a href="https://t.co/vOnxnWl0MA">pic.twitter.com/vOnxnWl0MA</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>During today’s I/O keynote, the company company revealed a new partnership with Samsung, “combining the best of Wear OS and Tizen.” We’re still waiting to see how that will play out, but it will be fascinating watching two big players combine forces to take on Apple. You come at the king, you best not miss, to quote a popular prestige television program. On the developer side, this seems to allude to the ability to create joint apps for both platforms, as third-party app selection has been a sticking point for both.</p>
<p>The other big change sheds some more light on precisely why the company was interested in Fitbit. Sure the company was a wearables leader that dominated fitness bands and eventually created its own solid smartwatches (courtesy of, among other things, its own acquisition of Pebble), but health is really the key here.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154142" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154142" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2154142" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/15_AndroidWear_Playicon_Still_2K.max-1000x1000-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="562" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/15_AndroidWear_Playicon_Still_2K.max-1000x1000-1.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/15_AndroidWear_Playicon_Still_2K.max-1000x1000-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/15_AndroidWear_Playicon_Still_2K.max-1000x1000-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/15_AndroidWear_Playicon_Still_2K.max-1000x1000-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/15_AndroidWear_Playicon_Still_2K.max-1000x1000-1.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/15_AndroidWear_Playicon_Still_2K.max-1000x1000-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2154142" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Health monitoring has become the dominant conversation around wearables in recent years, and Google’s acquisition seems to be, above all, about integrating that information. “[A] world-class health and fitness service from Fitbit is coming to the platform,” the company noted. Beyond adding Fitbit&#8217;s well-loved tracking features, the company will also be integrated Wear features into Google&#8217;s hardware, working to blur the line between the two companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Health and fitness tracking is essential for wearables,&#8221; Google notes in a blog post. &#8220;With the latest Wear update, we welcome Fitbit’s many years of health expertise to the experience. The best of Fitbit, including features like tracking your health progress throughout your day and on-wrist goal celebrations, will motivate you on your journey to better health.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The consumer-facing experience has been revamped here, as well. Apps like Calm, Sleep Cycle and Flo are getting their own tiles, while shortcuts are now accessible from anywhere. A number of Google&#8217;s own apps are getting a refresh, as well, including Maps, Assistant and Pay, the latter of which is rolling out to an additional 26 countries &#8212; adding to the 11 currently available. Later this year, the company will also be introducing a Watch version of the YouTube Music app.</p>
<p>The aforementioned updates are set to arrive later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With a long-standing history of working together on the mobile side, it’s always been a bit of surprise that Samsung hasn’t had much patience for Google’s wearables play. The hardware giant had flirted with Android Wear in the past, but for the last several years, it’s been invested in building out its own version of open-source operating system, Tizen.</p>
<p>Today, both companies announced a partnership featuring a “unified platform” between the two some time competitors. The goal of the deal is to essentially create a way for devs to build apps for both Wear OS and Tizen at once. The deal makes sense from that perspective. Third-party apps have been something of a sticking point for both companies.</p>
<p>Even more to the point, it’s an opportunity for two smaller players in the space to join forces and take on Apple, which has been utterly dominant in the smartwatch category, more or less since the first Apple Watch arrived.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Wear OS has already gone through a number of cycles, including a big rebrand from Android OS a while back, but nothing has really stuck over the years, leaving the wearable operating as something of an also-ran. For now, at least, this is far from a full-throated embrace of Wear OS on Samsung’s part and appears to be something more akin to an &#8220;the enemy of my enemy situation.&#8221; Along with developing a unified API, the companies are joining forces to pluck the best from each operating system, including longer battery life &#8212; perhaps the largest hurdle facing smartwatches at the moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that health and wellness are at the forefront of consumers’ minds, and we’re excited to continue building the industry-leading health experience on our new unified platform with Google,&#8221; Samsung company said in a blog post. &#8220;As our consumers turn to wearable technology to monitor their wellbeing, we’re meeting these needs head on. By creating world-class health technology, we hope to elevate how users approach to their wellbeing, and enable them to make positive changes in their everyday lives.</p>
<p>Samsung added that the next version of the Galaxy Watch will be the first to leverage this partnership, but offered little additional information on the hardware front. I’d anticipate big news on the Wear OS front in the next year. If nothing else, the company’s acquisition of Google is a sign that it’s ready to go for broke with the platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The one-dozenth versions of Android has been something of an odd duck. The latest version of Google’s mobile operating was announced back in February, and a beta version is already available to developers. But up to now, we’ve known glancingly little about how the final version of Android 12 will actually look. Fittingly, the new version looks to be delivering one of the biggest design updates in recent memory. The news arrives as Google is announcing that there are now more than 3 billion Android devices currently in use.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We first introduced <a href="https://twitter.com/Android?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Android</a> in 2008 — and now there are 3 billion active Android devices around the world. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f92f.png" alt="🤯" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoogleIO?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GoogleIO</a> <a href="https://t.co/G6wMXfWgNZ">pic.twitter.com/G6wMXfWgNZ</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The company unveiled Material You, a new cross-platform adaptable UI designed to give users more control over how their operating systems work. Among other things, that means that the content can be tailored to different design languages on the phones themselves. The feature will arrive first on Pixel phones this fall and will roll out to additional devices from there.</p>
<p>Per Google,</p>
<blockquote><p>The notification shade is more intuitive and playful, with a crisp, at-a-glance view of your app notifications, whatever you’re currently listening to or watching, and Quick Settings that let you control practically the entire operating system with a swipe and a tap. The Quick Settings space doesn’t just look and feel different. It’s been rebuilt to include Google Pay and Home Controls, while still allowing for customization so you can have everything you need most in one easy-to-access place.</p></blockquote>

<p>Android 12 will be the first to get the redesigned UI and widgets, along with other design elements. The company is calling it &#8220;the biggest design change to Android in years.&#8221; The updates include across the board refreshes to things including the lock screen and wallpaper, which uses a variety of algorithms to offer an ever-adapting color palette. The operative word here seems to be &#8220;dynamic,&#8221; as different elements and widgets adapt to things like the time of day.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Android has a new look. Inspired by Material You, we’ve rethought the entire experience for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Android12?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Android12</a>, from colors to shapes, light and motion. It’s more personal and expressive — a one-of-a-kind design, just for you. <a href="https://t.co/xCRLr7XLWM">pic.twitter.com/xCRLr7XLWM</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Along with ever-changing design, Google is also touting adapting security features with this latest update. The list includes new indicators for access to the microphone and camera &#8212; permissions that can be revoked directly from the operating system&#8217;s dashboard. The Private Compute Core, meanwhile, offers access to things like Smart Reply, based on the user&#8217;s personal setting. That information is isolated from the network, while the computing happens directly on the device itself.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2154108" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5._Andriod_12_Fluid_Motion.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="745" /></p>
<p>Android handsets will also work more closely with ChromeOS going forward, including the ability to use the mobile device to log directly into a Chromebook, as well as cross platform notifications.</p>
<p>On the dev side, the company says its improved performance. &#8220;We reduced the CPU time needed for core system services by 22%, so devices will be faster and more responsive,&#8221; Google writes on its developer blog. &#8220;We also improved Android&#8217;s power efficiency by reducing the use of big cores by the system server by 15% to help devices run longer before needing to charge.&#8221; Transition and app startup times have been improved here, as well.</p>
<p>The new beta is available starting today. Google is promising more updates in the near future to what appears to be the largest update to the mobile operating system in recent memory. The final version is set to arrive in the fall.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google&#8217;s Android operating system is now running on 3 billion active devices, Google announced at its (virtual) I/O developer conference today. In a briefing before today&#8217;s event, the company also noted that there were 250 million active tablets running Android last year, which is likely a larger number than some expected, but which explains Google&#8217;s increased focus on these large-screen devices at I/O this year.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Google shares new device stats at I/O, but since it canceled the event last year, we didn&#8217;t get an update for 2020. The most recent number Google provided was 2.5 billion active devices in May 2019. That was up from 2 billion devices in 2017, so at least for the time being, this growth rate of about 500 million new devices every two years continues to remain true.</p>
<p>In comparison, Apple in January <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-results/apple-tops-wall-street-expectations-on-record-iphone-revenue-china-sales-surge-idUSKBN29W2TD">announced</a> that it has an install base of 1 billion iPhones and that there are now a total of 1.65 billion active devices in its ecosystem, up from 1.5 billion devices a year before (this last number includes all active Apple devices, though).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric aviation startup Beta Technologies closed a $368 million Series A funding round on Tuesday, with investments from Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund. The new capital is the second round of funding announced by the company this year, after the company raised $143 million in private capital in March.</p>
<p>The funding round was led by Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company with undisclosed additions from Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, a $2 billion fund established in September 2019 to advance the development of sustainable technologies. The Climate Pledge fund has also made contributions toward electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian, battery recycler Redwood Materials and ZeroAvia, a hydrogen fuel cell aviation company.</p>
<p>The company’s valuation is now at $1.4 billion, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/18/beta-becomes-latest-eva-unicorn-with-amazon-fidelity-backing.html">CNBC reported</a>, putting it in a small circle of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) companies to have achieved valuations at over a billion dollars.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlike developers Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation, who have each also achieved valuations over the billion-dollar mark, Beta is not primarily focused on air taxis. Instead, it’s been targeting defense applications, cargo delivery, and medical logistics, as well as building out its network of rapid-charging systems in the northeast U.S. Its debut aircraft, the ALIA-250c, was built to serve these various solutions by being capable of carrying six people or a pilot and 1,500 pounds.</p>
<p>The Vermont-based startup has already scored major partnerships in all of these industries, including with United Therapeutics to transport synthetic organs for human transplant; UPS, who purchased 10 ALIA aircraft with the option of buying 140 more; and the U.S. Air Force.</p>
<p>The company has not entirely ignored passenger transportation, however, announcing last month a partnership with Blade Urban Air Mobility for five aircraft to be delivered in 2024.</p>
<p>Beta was the first company to be awarded airworthiness approval from the U.S. Air Force. The company expects to sign a contract in June with the Air Force to allow access to Beta’s aircraft and flight simulators in Washington, D.C. and Springfield, Ohio. However, it still must achieve certification with the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>
<p>The funds will be used to refine the ALIA’s electric propulsion system and controls, as well as to build out manufacturing space, including expanding its footprint in Vermont on land at the Burlington International Airport, the company said in a news release Tuesday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google announced a series of upgrades to its Google Photos service, used by over a billion users, at today&#8217;s Google I/O developer event, which was virtually streamed this year due to Covid. The company is rolling out Locked Folders, new types of photo &#8220;Memories&#8221; for reminiscing over past events, as well as a new feature called &#8220;Cinematic moments&#8221; that will animate a series of static photos, among other updates.</p>
<p>Today, Google Photos stores over 4 trillion photos and videos, but the majority of those are never viewed. To change that, Google has been developing A.I.-powered features to help its users reflect on meaningful moments from their lives. With Memories, launched in 2019, Google Photos is able to resurface photos and videos focused on people, activities, and hobbies as well as recent highlights from the week prior.</p>
<p>At Google I/O, the company announced it&#8217;s adding a new type of Memory, which it&#8217;s calling &#8220;little patterns.&#8221; Using machine learning, little patterns looks for a set of three or more photos with similarities, like shape or color, which it then highlights as a pattern for you.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2152890" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2152890" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2152890" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/LittlePatterns.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p id="caption-attachment-2152890" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>For example, when one of Google&#8217;s engineers traveled the world with their favorite orange backpack, Google Photos was able to identify a pattern where that backpack was featured in photos from around the globe. But patterns may also be as simple family photos that are often snapped in the same room with an identifiable piece of furniture, like the living room couch. On their own, these photos may not seem like much, but when they&#8217;re combined over time, they can produce some interesting compilations.</p>
<p>Google will also be adding Best of Month Memories and Trip highlights to the your photo grid, which you&#8217;ll now be able to remove or rename, as well as Memories featuring events you celebrate, like birthdays or holidays. These events will be identified based on a combination of factors, Google says. This includes by identifying objects in the photos &#8212; like a birthday cake or a Hanukkah menorah, for example &#8212; as well as by matching up the date of the photo with known holidays.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2152889" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2152889" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2152889" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Event-Memories.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Event-Memories.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Event-Memories.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Event-Memories.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Event-Memories.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Event-Memories.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Event-Memories.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Event-Memories.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2152889" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Best of Month and Trip highlight Memories will start to roll out today and will be found in the photo grid itself. Later this year, you&#8217;ll begin to see Memories related to the events and moments you celebrate.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2152894" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2152894" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2152894" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MemoriesintheGrid.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p id="caption-attachment-2152894" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Another forthcoming addition is Cinematic Moments, which is somewhat reminiscent of the<a href="https://blog.myheritage.com/2021/02/new-animate-the-faces-in-your-family-photos/"> &#8220;deep nostalgia&#8221; technology from MyHeritage</a> that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/06/this-week-in-apps-app-store-bill-passes-az-house-deep-nostalgia-goes-viral-twitter-spaces-arrives-on-android/">went viral earlier this year,</a> as users <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/myheritage-now-lets-you-animate-old-family-photos-using-deepfakery/">animated</a> the photos of long-past loved ones. Except in Google&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s not taking an old photo and bringing it to life, it&#8217;s stitching together a series of photos to create a sense of action and movement.</p>
<p>Google explains that, often, people will take multiple photos of the same moment in order to get one &#8220;good&#8221; image they can share. This is especially true when trying to capture something in motion &#8212; like a small child or a pet who can&#8217;t sit still.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2152888" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2152888" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2152888" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CinematicMoments_Part02.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p id="caption-attachment-2152888" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>These new Cinematic moments build on the Cinematic photos feature Google launched in December 2020, which uses machine learning to create vivid, 3D version of your photos. Using computational photography and neural networks to stitch together a series of near-identical photos, Google Photos will be able to create vivid, moving images by filling in the gaps in between your photos to create new frames. This feature doesn&#8217;t have a launch date at this time.</p>
<p>Of course, not all past moments are worthy of revisiting for a variety of reasons. While Google already offered tools to hide certain photos and time periods from your Memories, it&#8217;s continuing to add new controls and, later this summer, will make it easier to access its existing toolset. One key area of focus has been working with the transgender community, who have said that revisiting their old photos can be painful.</p>
<p>Soon, users will also be able to remove a single photo from a Memory, remove their Best of Month Memories, and rename and remove Memories based on the events they celebrate, too.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2152893" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2152893" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2152893" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MemoryControls.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MemoryControls.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MemoryControls.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MemoryControls.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MemoryControls.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MemoryControls.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MemoryControls.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MemoryControls.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2152893" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Another useful addition to Google Photos is the new Locked Folder, which is simply a passcode-protected space for private photos. Many users automatically sync their phone&#8217;s photos to Google&#8217;s cloud, but then want to pull up photos to show to others through the app on their phone or even their connected TV. That can be difficult if their galleries are filled with private photos, of course.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2152891" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2152891" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2152891" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/LockedFolder.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p id="caption-attachment-2152891" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>This particular feature will launch first on Pixel devices, where users will have the option to save photos and videos directly from their Camera to the Locked folder. Other Android devices will get the update later in the year.</p>

<p>Remember those influencers and potential investors we mentioned earlier? We’re talking about folks like Rachael Wilcox, a creative producer at Volvo Cars. Rachel told us that she goes to TechCrunch events to “find new and interesting companies, make new business connections and look for startups with investment potential.” She also shared her thoughts about Startup Battlefield.</p>
<p>“The Startup Battlefield translated easily to the virtual format. You could see the excitement, enthusiasm and possibility of the young founders, and I loved that. You could also ask questions through the chat feature, and you don&#8217;t always have time for questions at a live event.”</p>
<p>Your unicorn dreams might be on an early-stage startup budget, but this is a huge opportunity for you to gain global exposure and have a good shot at winning $100,000. <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/zM4H0xNn">Apply to compete in Startup Battlefield</a> at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> on September 21-23.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As far as AI systems have come in their ability to recognize what you&#8217;re saying and respond, they&#8217;re still very easily confused unless you speak carefully and literally. Google has been working on a <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/">new language model called LaMDA</a> that&#8217;s much better at following conversations in a natural way, rather than as a series of badly formed search queries.</p>
<p>LaMDA is meant to be able to converse normally about almost anything without any kind of prior training. This was demonstrated in a pair of rather bizarre conversations with an AI first pretending to be Pluto and then a paper airplane.</p>
<p>While the utility of having a machine learning model that can pretend to be a planet (or dwarf planet, a term it clearly resents) is somewhat limited, the point of the demonstration was to show that LaMDA could carry on a conversation naturally even on this random topic, and in the arbitrary fashion of the first person.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154028" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pluto.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154028" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2154028" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pluto.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="558" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pluto.jpg 1784w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pluto.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pluto.jpg?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pluto.jpg?resize=768,418 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pluto.jpg?resize=680,370 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pluto.jpg?resize=1536,837 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pluto.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2154028" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The advance here is basically preventing the AI system from being led off track and losing the thread when attempting to respond to a series of loosely associated questions.</p>
<p>Normal conversations between humans jump between topics and call back to earlier ideas constantly, a practice that confuses language models to no end. But LaMDA can at least hold its own and not crash out with a &#8220;Sorry, I don&#8217;t understand&#8221; or a non-sequitur answer.</p>

<p>While most people are unlikely to want to have a full, natural conversation with their phones, there are plenty of situations where this sort of thing makes perfect sense. Groups like kids and older folks who don&#8217;t know or don&#8217;t care about the formalized language we use to speak to AI assistants will be able to interact more naturally with technology, for instance. And identity will be important if this sort of conversational intelligence is built into a car or appliance. No one wants to ask &#8220;Google&#8221; how much milk is left in the fridge, but they might ask &#8220;Whirly&#8221; or &#8220;Fridgadore,&#8221; the refrigerator speaking for itself.</p>
<p>Even CEO Sundar Pichai seemed unsure as to what exactly this new conversational AI would be used for, and emphasized that it&#8217;s still a work in development. But you can probably expect Google&#8217;s AIs to be a little more natural in their interactions going forward. And you can finally have that <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2329">long, philosophical conversation with a random item</a> you&#8217;ve always wanted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google announced a new feature for its Chrome browser today that alerts you when one of your passwords has been compromised and then helps you automatically change your password with the help of&#8230; wait for it&#8230; Google&#8217;s Duplex technology.</p>
<p>This new feature will start to roll out slowly to Chrome users on Android in the U.S. soon (with other countries following later), assuming they use Chrome&#8217;s password-syncing feature.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that this won&#8217;t work for every site just yet. As a Google spokesperson told us, &#8220;the feature will initially work on a small number of apps and websites, including Twitter, but will expand to additional sites in the future.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now you may remember Duplex as the somewhat controversial service that can call businesses for you to make hairdresser appointments or check opening times. Google <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html">introduced</a> Duplex at its 2018 I/O developer conference and launched it to a wider audience in 2019. Since then, the team has chipped away at bringing Duplex to more tasks and <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/duplex-helpful-updates/">brought it the web</a>, too. Now it&#8217;s coming to Chrome to change your compromised passwords for you.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153878" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/05_SaferWithGoogle_PasswordAutoChange_OF_v20.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153878" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2153878" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/05_SaferWithGoogle_PasswordAutoChange_OF_v20.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2153878" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Powered by Duplex on the Web, Assistant takes over the tedious parts of web browsing: scrolling, clicking and filling forms, and allows you to focus on what’s important to you. And now we’re expanding these capabilities even further by letting you quickly create a strong password for certain sites and apps when Chrome determines your credentials have been leaked online,&#8221; Patrick Nepper, senior product manager for Chrome, explains in today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="BllfqjVd07"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/enterprise-security-attackers-are-one-password-away-from-your-worst-day/">Enterprise security attackers are one password away from your worst day</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Enterprise security attackers are one password away from your worst day&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/enterprise-security-attackers-are-one-password-away-from-your-worst-day/embed/#?secret=BllfqjVd07" data-secret="BllfqjVd07" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In practice, once Chrome detects a compromised password, all you have to do is tap the &#8220;change password&#8221; button and Duplex will walk through the process of changing your password for you. Google says this won&#8217;t work for every site just yet, but &#8220;even if a site isn’t supported yet, Chrome’s password manager can always help you create strong and unique passwords for your various accounts.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how well this works in the real world. Every site manages passwords a little bit differently, so it would be hard to write a set of basic rules that the browser could use to go through this process. And that&#8217;s likely why Google is using Duplex here. Since every site is a little bit different, it takes a system that can understand a bit more about the context of a password change page to successfully navigate it.</p>
<p>In addition to adding this feature, Google is also updating its password manager with a new tool for important passwords from third-party password managers, deeper integration between Chrome and Android and automatic password alerts when a password is compromised in a breach.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its I/O developer conference, Google today announced the next generation of its custom Tensor Processing Units (TPU) AI chips. This is the fourth generation of these chips, which Google says are twice as fast as the last version. As Google CEO Sundar Pichai noted, these chips are then combined in pods with 4,096 v4 TPUs. A single pod delivers over one exaflop of computing power.</p>
<p>Google, of course, uses the custom chips to power many of its own machine learning services, but it will also make this latest generation available to developers as part of its <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu">Google Cloud platform</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the fastest system we&#8217;ve ever deployed at Google and a historic milestone for us,&#8221; Pichai said. &#8220;Previously to get an exaflop you needed to build a custom supercomputer, but we already have many of these deployed today and will soon have dozens of TPUv4 pods in our data centers, many of which will be operating at or near 90% carbon-free energy. And our TPUv4 pods will be available to our cloud customers later this year.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The TPUs were among Google&#8217;s first custom chips. While others, including Microsoft, decided to go with more flexible FPGAs for its machine learning services, Google made an early bet on these custom chips. They take a bit longer to develop &#8212; and quickly become outdated as technologies change &#8212; but can deliver significantly better performance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google kicked off its Google I/O Developer event this afternoon with a set of new collaborative workspace tools, which it&#8217;s calling, as a group, &#8220;Smart Canvas.&#8221; The company demonstrated using how Smart Canvas works for brainstorming and project planning, showing how users could drop in ideas about an upcoming launch, share their thoughts, work on documents together, join Google Meet calls and solve problems together.</p>
<p>The company says it&#8217;s <a href="https://blog.google/products/workspace/google-workspace-features/">enhancing its everyday collaborative documents</a>, like Google Docs, Sheets and Slides, with a dozen some new features, as a part of its effort in the Smart Canvas new product experience.</p>
<p>Currently, when users @mention others in a document, a smart chip will pop up, displaying that person&#8217;s location, job title and contact information. Smart chips will also now appear for recommended files and meetings in Docs, and will soon roll out to Sheets. This will make it easier for collaboratives to scan the associated, linked documents, as well as people, without having to switch apps to see the information.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google has also improved the insert link experience to show relevant, intelligent suggestions for Drive files, headings and bookmarks within your document, based on the highlighted text where you&#8217;ll insert the link.</p>
<p>And Google&#8217;s assisted writing feature will now offer more inclusive language recommendations as you write — like that you use the word “chairperson” instead of “chairman,&#8221; for example.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/SDBbFETGiA4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/05/smartchips-for-files-and-meetings-checklists-in-docs.html">Other updates include</a> a pageless format in Docs to remove page boundaries, emoji reactions in Docs, the ability to import info from Calendar meeting invites, connected checklists in Docs that let you assign items to other people and see these action items in Google Tasks, Table templates in Docs, a timeline view in Sheets, more assisted analysis functionality in our Sheets, the ability to create Docs, Sheets and Slides from Google Chat rooms, and more.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting changes, however, was support for live captions and translations in Google Meet, and the ability to now present your content to a Google Meet call on the web directly from your Doc, Sheet or Slide. This puts Google in competition with other meeting transcription services, like Otter.ai.</p>
<p>The updates paint a picture of Google&#8217;s aim to make its workspace apps connect more seamlessly, instead of being separate components &#8212; that helps to lock users inside Google&#8217;s walled garden, and makes it more difficult to swap out one of Google&#8217;s workspace apps for a competitor.</p>
<p>Today the Smart Canvas update is rolling out features that include the ability to insert smart chips for Docs, Sheets or Slides files, other Google Drive files, and Calendar events; creating checklists; and inserting links more easily with intelligent suggestions in the insert link dialog box. Other features will come in the months ahead.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Until COVID-19, healthcare was either all in-person or all virtual. Patients had to choose. Some patients chose both &#8212; an in-person health system for most things and perhaps <a href="https://hello.livongo.com/">Livongo</a> for diabetes care or <a href="https://www.hingehealth.com/">Hinge Health</a> for back pain care.</p>
<p>The problem with this approach is that in-person all the time is inconvenient and a waste of time when all a clinician is doing is looking at a wound or responding to lab results. But all-virtual is not great when things are uncertain or patients need to be examined. While there are few silver linings to the horrendous COVID-19 pandemic, one is that nearly all providers and most patients have experienced virtual care and most have found it useful. This widespread adoption of virtual care, we believe, will lead to hybrid models that we call “click-and-mortar,” which combine the best elements of in-person and virtual care to deliver better outcomes more reliably and efficiently.</p>
<p>The uptake of virtual care in 2020 is stunning: <a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/us-doctors-turn-to-telehealth-as-covid-19-limits-in-person-care-snap-chart/">97%</a> of primary care doctors provided some kind of telehealth care in 2020. Moreover, <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/263866/hp-issue-brief-medicare-telehealth.pdf">nearly 44%</a> of Medicare beneficiaries’ primary care visits were provided by telemedicine in 2020, compared with a mere 0.1% the year before.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The notion of virtual care has become so common that Google searches for “doctor online” result in a specialized tool displaying widely available virtual care platforms, such as Teladoc, Amwell, Doctor On Demand and MDLive. Moreover, telemedicine providers like Doctor on Demand, MDLive, Galileo and Firefly have all launched “virtual primary care” services designed to deliver non-urgent longitudinal primary care virtually. While these services may meet the needs of healthier patients, the absence of a physical location for physical examinations, diagnostic tests and procedures may limit their utility.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			This widespread adoption of virtual care, we believe, will lead to hybrid models that combine the best elements of in-person and virtual care to deliver better outcomes more reliably and efficiently.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are several potential advantages of virtual primary care. The ability to see patients in their homes can contribute new information about safety, social support and social determinants. In cases like behavioral health, they can decrease the stigma associated with accessing care. Virtual care platforms can more easily incorporate remote monitoring data, and virtual visits can occur as groups with teams of caregivers or other specialists simultaneously.</p>
<p>Furthermore, virtual visits may allow for more frequent “microvisits” to monitor how patients are progressing. They also facilitate more rapid treatment adjustments because they eliminate the need to travel to a doctor’s office. Virtual visits also have lower cost for physicians, avoiding brick-and-mortar overhead costs, and for some services offer 24/7 access, which may reduce the need to seek urgent care or emergency department care. Finally, patients may be able to gain expanded access to clinicians who match preferences based on things like ethnicity, LGBTQ orientation and gender, particularly in rural areas where options are limited.</p>
<p>For pure-play virtual care models to work, they need to rely on connected devices and patient cooperation. Using connected blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes, oximeters, thermometers and scales, it is possible to replicate much of the physical exam. Just like for in-person care, a virtual provider can order lab tests, although it is impossible to do a quick urinalysis or strep test virtually without the supplies on hand.</p>
<p>Virtual providers who work closely with health plans may have more data on cost and quality to inform referrals but perhaps less local knowledge. A possible consequence is that virtual providers may have more transactional relationships with specialists and traditional local brick-and-mortar providers.</p>
<p>Data have shown virtual care delivers better clinical outcomes in certain cases. Virtual care has been shown to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1357633X16680541">reduce</a> emergency department visits and antibiotic overprescribing. Chronic conditions like Type 2 diabetes are examples where virtual care has <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33112529/">outperformed</a> in-person care. Virtual physical therapy has <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29695370/">generated</a> cost savings and resulted in fewer back surgeries.</p>
<p>Despite these benefits of purely virtual care, we believe that ultimately the most efficacious model of primary care is a hybrid one combining virtual and in-person interaction. We think that the mix of in-person and virtual is probably 80% virtual. We also think that most visits will be triggered by clinicians reaching out to patients in response to a change in remotely monitored data, perhaps a new fever, change in sleep patterns or weight change for a patient with heart failure.</p>
<p>The implications of visits being mostly virtual and largely triggered by changes in data are profound. It means that offices become places for problem-solving and procedures. It means clinicians spend their days responding to signals from patients and probably have their schedules largely unfilled until the night before. It means that patients will need to adopt passively collected and remotely monitored data.</p>
<p>We think this model ultimately will result in more frequent, shorter, virtual interactions that happen nearly continuously over text and be supplemented by email, phone and video. We also think this approach will deliver much better clinical outcomes and more rapid improvement since both the patient and clinician have much more data on how diseases are progressing.</p>
<p>There are risks with this model. It requires patients with mobile phones and devices to engage and respond to clinicians and ensure their remote monitoring devices stay online. Most importantly, patients need to follow the advice of virtual providers and prompts to get in-person labs, diagnostics or care when needed. Further, clinicians will need to be trained to conduct virtual clinical examinations and to incorporate as well as respond to remote monitoring data.</p>
<p>The COVID-19-fueled adoption of virtual care will hopefully create the demand on the part of patients and desire on the part of clinicians to embrace our “click-and-mortar” vision for care. These models have the potential to deliver more proactive, more engaging and, we think, far better care.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Humans may not have totally mastered getting objects to space, but we’ve done a pretty good job so far. The hundreds of satellites that orbit the Earth are proof enough that &#8220;send stuff to space&#8221; is firmly in humanity’s capacity. But what about refueling, repairing or even adding capabilities to spacecraft or satellites once they’re up there?</p>
<p>In the past few years, a host of companies have started to turn what has long been seen as a pipe dream into a real possibility. Now, satellite servicing company Starfish Space and space mobility provider Benchmark Space Systems will be entering into a new partnership aimed at advancing these much-needed capabilities &#8212; and their first demonstration will take place next month, on space startup Orbit Fab’s Tanker 1 mission.</p>
<p>Orbit Fab, which was a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/orbit-fab-gas-stations-in-space-seed-funding/">finalist in our TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield</a> in 2019, will be sending up an operational fuel depot on a SpaceX Falcon 9 in June. The tanker is the first of what Orbit Fab is envisioning as a “gas station in space” &#8212; in-orbit propellant available to satellite customers that will no longer be limited in terms of their spacecraft&#8217;s active life by the amount of fuel they take up on launch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Benchmark Space Systems and Orbit Fab already have an agreement to combine Benchmark’s Halcyon thruster system and the fuel depot startup’s fluid transfer interface (imagine a refueling apparatus) into an integrated propulsion package.</p>
<p>This is where Starfish Space comes in. It will be testing its CEPHALOPOD rendezvous proximity operations and docking (RPOD) software with Benchmark’s Halcyon thruster system to make sure that the refueling demonstration is as accurate as possible. The RPOD software is entirely autonomous and can give small servicing vehicles up to eight times more maneuvering capability, the company says.</p>
<p>Demonstration missions like the one in June are just the beginning. Refueling capacity could not only extend the mission length of satellites and other spacecraft, it could help open the door to new types of space missions and the emerging space economy.</p>
