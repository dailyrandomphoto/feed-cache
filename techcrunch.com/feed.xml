										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Huawei’s first foldable feels like a distant memory. Announced in 2019, the company went back to the drawing board prior to release, as Samsung ran into its own much publicized issues with the innovative form factor.</p>
<p>The Mate X was well-received among journalists &#8212; I had the opportunity to spend some time with it at the company’s HQ in China and was impressed with the build quality. But for various reasons, it never made its way outside of China. And there’s some reason to believe that the newly announced X2 will suffer a similar fate.</p>
<p>The new handset has already drawn its share of comparisons to Samsung’s early models &#8212; and rightfully so, to be honest. The X2’s form factor appears to share much more in common with the Galaxy Fold from a design standpoint than its own predecessor. And while Samsung’s model got off to a rocky start or two, the company was also the first to get things fairly right after a bit of public trial and error.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And like Samsung, Huawei is leading with improvements to the hinge mechanism as a big selling point here. It’s the sort of meat and potatoes thing that would be glossed over in most other devices, but the hinge has proven one of the major pain points for these devices &#8212; and as much as a company might test behind the scenes, there’s no replacing real-world usage.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Huawei set to debut a new, improved Mate X&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/huawei-set-to-debut-a-new-improved-mate-x/embed/#?secret=nmJOteGgt0" data-secret="nmJOteGgt0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The primary, foldable display is eight inches, with a 6.45-inch screen on the outside &#8212; a bit more than the Galaxy Fold 2, in both cases (at 7.6 and 6.2 inches, respectively). In the rendering, the front screen occupies most of the device, with a bit of a bezel and a camera cut out. There’s 5G on board, too, paired with Huawei’s proprietary Kirin 9000 chip and a 4,400mAh battery.</p>
<p>The system is, of course, missing a pretty significant feature, courtesy of all of those blacklists. The company is pushing the presence of the Android 10-based EMUI 11.0 (Based on Android 10). Likely the device will also feature Huawei’s own HarmonyOS, in lieu of Android. The company’s been building out its operating system in recent years with the understanding that it would likely become a flashpoint in U.S./China tensions.</p>
<p>We have yet to see a full version of the software, but it’s hard to imagine it being as complete or robust as Google’s 12-year-old mobile OS &#8212; not to mention Google’s various apps.</p>
<p>The Mate X2 arrives in China on February 25, starting at around $2,800.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zomato has raised $250 million, two months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/indian-food-delivery-giant-zomato-raises-660-million/">closing a $660 million Series J financing round</a>, as the Indian food delivery startup builds a war-chest ahead of its IPO later this year.</p>
<p>Kora (which contributed $115 million), Fidelity ($55 million), Tiger Global ($50 million), Bow Wave ($20 million), and Dragoneer ($10 million) pumped the new capital into the 12-year-old Gurgaon-headquartered startup, Info Edge, a publicly listed investor in Zomato, <a href="https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/2429b16a-c9e6-4fb7-b189-7206822195b8.pdf">disclosed in a filing</a> (PDF) to a local stock exchange. The new investment gives Zomato a post-money valuation of $5.4 billion, up from $3.9 billion in December last year, said Info Edge, which owns 18.4% stake in the Indian startup.</p>
<p>The new investment reinforces the strong confidence investors have in Zomato, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/indias-zomato-raises-62-million-from-temasek/">struggled to raise money</a> for much of last year. Zomato, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/20/uber-sells-food-delivery-business-in-india-to-zomato/">acquired the Indian food delivery business of Uber</a> early last year, competes with Prosus Ventures-backed <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/swiggy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="swiggy">Swiggy </a>(valued at about $3.6 billion) in India. Together they work with over 440,000 delivery partners, a larger workforce than that employed by Indian Department of Posts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A third player, Amazon, also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/amazon-launches-food-delivery-service-in-india/">entered the food delivery market</a> in India last year, though its operations are still limited to parts of Bangalore.</p>
<p>At stake is India’s food delivery market, which analysts at Bernstein expect to balloon to be worth $12 billion by 2022, they wrote in a report to clients. With about 50% of the market share, Zomato is the current leader among the three, Bernstein analysts wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;We find the food-tech industry in India to be well positioned to sustained growth with improving unit economics. Take-rates are one of the highest in India at 20-25% and consumer traction is increasing. Market is largely a duopoly between Zomato and Swiggy with 80%+ share,&#8221; wrote analysts at Bank of America in a recent report, reviewed by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Zomato and Swiggy have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/10/a-glint-of-hope-for-indias-food-delivery-market-as-zomato-projects-monthly-cash-burn-of-less-than-1m/">improved their finances in recent years</a>, which is especially impressive because making money with food delivery is very even more challenging in India. Unlike Western markets such as the U.S., where the value of each delivery item is about $33, in India, a similar item carries the price tag of $3 to $4, according to research firms.</p>
<p>Both the startups eliminated hundreds of jobs last year as coronavirus pandemic hit their businesses. Zomato co-founder and chief executive Deepinder Goyal said in December that the food delivery market was &#8220;rapidly coming out of COVID-19 shadows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;December 2020 is expected to be the highest ever GMV month in our history. We are now clocking ~25% higher GMV than our previous peaks in February 2020. I am supremely excited about what lies ahead and the impact that we will create for our customers, delivery partners, and restaurant partners,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In an email to employees in September last year, Goyal said Zomato was working on its IPO for &#8220;sometime in the first half&#8221; of 2021 and was raising money to build a war-chest for &#8220;future M&amp;A, and fighting off any mischief or price wars from our competition in various areas of our business.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The FCC has taken a major step towards offering financial support for people struggling to pay broadband bills during the pandemic. If approved, the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program could provide $50 per month to millions of households, and more in tribal lands.</p>
<p>The EBBP was created in the budget passed by Congress earlier this year, which earmarked $3.2 billion to offset the cost of broadband in households already struggling to make ends meet.</p>
<p>&#8220;From work to healthcare to education, this crisis has made it clear that without an internet connection too many households are locked out of modern life,&#8221; said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/the-fcc-has-its-first-chairwoman-in-jessica-rosenworcel/">acting FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel</a> in a statement. &#8220;It’s more apparent than ever that broadband is no longer nice-to-have. It’s need-to-have. But too many of us are struggling to afford this critical service.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="q5oD1Z4fvI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/the-fcc-has-its-first-chairwoman-in-jessica-rosenworcel/">The FCC has a new acting chairwoman in Jessica Rosenworcel</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The FCC has a new acting chairwoman in Jessica Rosenworcel&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/the-fcc-has-its-first-chairwoman-in-jessica-rosenworcel/embed/#?secret=q5oD1Z4fvI" data-secret="q5oD1Z4fvI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The general shape of the EBBP was already known, but since Congress first proposed it last year it has been up to the FCC to decide what it would actually look like. The rules for the program Rosenworcel<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership/jessica-rosenworcel#link-0"> circulated at the agency today</a> are an important step in taking it from idea to reality.</p>
<p>The important bit is spelling out exactly who qualifies for the benefit — to wit, anyone who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualifies for the FCC&#8217;s existing Lifeline connectivity subsidy program</li>
<li>Receives free and reduce-price school lunch or breakfast benefits</li>
<li>Received a Pell Grant</li>
<li>Meets other eligibility requirements for internet providers&#8217; existing low-income or pandemic-related programs</li>
<li>&#8220;Experienced a substantial loss of income since February 29, 2020&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>That last one is a bit vague, and I&#8217;ve asked the FCC for more details (the proposed rules are not yet public). It may involve something like qualifying for unemployment benefits or showing a given percentage reduction in income. Depending on exactly what is specified it could greatly increase the scope of the program. I&#8217;ve asked the FCC for more details.</p>
<p>Most qualifying households would get $50 per month, and those living on tribal lands would get $75 per month. There&#8217;s also the possibility of a one-time $100 to help cover the cost of a device purchased from certain providers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are plenty more steps before anyone is likely to get these discounts. The FCC will have to approve and vote on the rules, which even at the fastest pace may take a couple months. And then there is a period of considering requests from providers, which could take up further time. All told it could take as few as three months if everything goes at maximum speed, or much more than that if they get bogged down in red tape.</p>
<p>Now that the rules are at least set down, though, it is likely only a matter of time — a small comfort to those having trouble making ends meet, but it&#8217;s something to look forward to.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During its live-streamed event today, Spotify officially <a href="https://blog.anchor.fm/streamon">confirmed</a> its plans to launch paid podcast subscriptions on its platform. As a first step, the company will this spring begin beta testing a new feature in its Anchor podcast creation tool that will allow U.S. creators to publish paid podcast content aimed at their &#8220;most dedicated fans.&#8221; It also <a href="https://blog.anchor.fm/streamon">opened up signups</a> for this and other new features, starting today.</p>
<p>Spotify had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/spotify-hints-toward-plans-for-podcast-subscriptions-a-la-carte-payments/">hinted at its plans for paid podcast content</a> during its fourth-quarter earnings call earlier this month, when it said it was exploring ideas like paid podcast subscriptions and à la carte payments. But it didn&#8217;t detail when these new options would go live or how they would work.</p>
<p>At its online event today, Spotify more formally announced its plans to enter the market of paid podcasts, initially with a new service that would allow Anchor creators the ability to offer paid podcast subscriptions supported by their listeners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This sort of idea is not new, to be clear. Already, some podcasters offer paid access to bonus material &#8212; for example, through a service like Stitcher Premium, which promises both an ad-free experience and bonus episodes. Some creators may even independently offer paid feeds through their own platforms.</p>
<p>But until now, a similar option was not available to Spotify creators.</p>
<p>Anchor co-founder Michael Mignano said the company believes paid bonus material can work well as a means of podcast monetization, in addition to ads.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116160" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116160" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116160" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="337" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg 2242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=300,149 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=768,381 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=680,337 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=1536,762 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1016 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116160" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We have found that, through our research, it seems to work especially well for creators who have really engaged and dedicated audiences &#8212; regardless of the audience size,&#8221; he told TechCrunch in an interview following Spotify&#8217;s event. &#8220;We&#8217;ve also found that podcast listeners do tend to be open to financially supporting the shows they love,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The company was hesitant to detail some of the specifics of how paid subscriptions would work at launch, but did say that the model would involve a revenue share between creators and Anchor, where creators keep the majority of the earnings. Anchor will also allow creators to determine what price to charge their listeners for the paid experience and what that experience would include &#8212; like bonus episodes or interviews, or even ad-free content, if they prefer.</p>
<p>It will then use its understanding of what creators actually do with paid subscriptions to inform its product product launch and its &#8220;best practices&#8221; recommendations in the future.</p>
<p>We also understand the offering will be limited to those who use Anchor to record and publish across podcast platforms. However, it will more immediately benefit creators with a strong Spotify presence and a loyal listenership.</p>
<p>But Mignano points out that creators may be able to grow their paid subscriber base thanks to Spotify&#8217;s tools for podcast discovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem is the system for doing this type of paid subscription so far in podcasts has been really disjointed,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;It hasn&#8217;t been a really seamless experience for the listener, and it hasn&#8217;t really been a great experience for the creator. We feel like that&#8217;s really held this model back and hindered creators&#8217; reach and ability to gain paid subscribers,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>In other words, users may be open to the idea of paid bonus material, but they don&#8217;t necessarily want to switch between apps to gain access, nor do they want to figure out how to get paid RSS feeds into some third-party podcast listening app.</p>
<p>Spotify, meanwhile, will try to make discovery easier. It will highlight the paid content alongside the free material on the podcast&#8217;s main page, for example. Plus, in the same way that Spotify today helps users discover new podcasts they may like to try, it will also point to paid subscription-based podcasts in the future as the new model rolls out further.</p>
<p>Anchor says it will initially <a href="https://blog.anchor.fm/streamon">open up the beta</a> test in the U.S. to a small number of creators, but aims to expand access to more creators as soon as reasonably possible. The test, for the time being, will only focus on paid subscriptions, but Mignano told us the company may explore the à la carte model in the future.</p>
<p>Paid podcasts were only one of several new features Anchor announced today at the Spotify event.</p>
<p>The company also announced the launch of a WordPress partnership that makes it easier for bloggers to turn their posts into posts, either by reading the blog posts themselves or leveraging third-party text-to-speech technology Anchor provides.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/SJCVrqqqROw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Anchor will also expand beta testing of video podcasts, which so far have been tested by only a handful of creators, including Higher Learning from The Ringer.</p>
<p>And it will <a href="https://blog.anchor.fm/streamon">begin beta testing</a> new, interactive features, like polls and Q&amp;A, with a small number of creators in the months ahead.</p>
<p>These features could potentially overlap with paid subscriptions. For example, some podcast creators may choose to make their videos a paid feature, or perhaps other interactive features. It remains to be seen how they&#8217;re put to use.</p>
<p>But more broadly, features like polls and Q&amp;As could help Spotify better differentiate an interactive podcast from a live audio program, like those popularized by the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/report-social-audio-app-clubhouse-has-topped-8-million-global-downloads/">buzzy new app Clubhouse</a>. The advantage of the latter is that it allows for audience participation in the &#8220;show,&#8221; rather than being a one-way street where hosts control the experience. But on the flip side, Clubhouse rooms can also have folks who drone on and on, or they can become boring, when not carefully managed.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZGfM2TZgjMQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Anchor says it doesn&#8217;t intend to charge creators for access to its tools, beyond taking a rev share on subscriptions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think our vision with Anchor and Spotify has always been to really empower creators. In the Anchor suite of tools, we&#8217;ve never charged creators for any features because we believe that charging creators can often represent friction that stands in the way of them trying to actually make something and getting it out into the world,&#8221; Mignano said. &#8220;We want to enable creators to do whatever they want, as far as expressing themselves through these new tools,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amber Group has fixed a second security lapse that exposed private keys and passwords for the government&#8217;s JamCOVID app and website.</p>
<p>A security researcher told TechCrunch on Sunday that the Amber Group left a file on the JamCOVID website by mistake, which contained passwords that would have granted access to the backend systems, storage, and databases running the JamCOVID site and app. The researcher asked not to be named for fears of legal repercussions from the Jamaican government.</p>
<p>This file, known as an environment variables (.env) file, is often used to store private keys and passwords for third-party services that are necessary for cloud applications to run. But these files are sometimes <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/botnets-have-been-silently-mass-scanning-the-internet-for-unsecured-env-files/">inadvertently exposed</a> or uploaded by mistake, but can be abused to gain access to data or services that the cloud application relies on if found by a malicious actor.</p>
<p>The exposed environmental variables file was found in an open directory on the JamCOVID website. Although the JamCOVID domain appears to be on the Ministry of Health&#8217;s website, Amber Group controls and maintains the JamCOVID dashboard, app, and website.</p>
<p>The exposed file contained secret credentials for the Amazon Web Services databases and storage servers for JamCOVID. The file also contained a username and password to the SMS gateway used by JamCOVID to send text messages, and credentials for its email-sending server. (TechCrunch did not test or use any of the passwords or keys as doing so would be unlawful.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116057" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116057" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2116057" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/exposed-credentials.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="497" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/exposed-credentials.jpg 1443w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/exposed-credentials.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/exposed-credentials.jpg?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/exposed-credentials.jpg?resize=768,477 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/exposed-credentials.jpg?resize=680,422 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/exposed-credentials.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116057" class="wp-caption-text">A portion of the exposed credentials found on the JamCOVID website, controlled and maintained by Amber Group. (Image: TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p>TechCrunch contacted Amber Group&#8217;s chief executive Dushyant Savadia to alert the company to the security lapse, who pulled the exposed file offline a short time later. We also asked Savadia, who did not comment, to revoke and replace the keys.</p>
<p>Matthew Samuda, a minister in Jamaica&#8217;s Ministry of National Security, did not respond to a request for comment or our questions — including if the Jamaican government plans to continue its contract or relationship with Amber Group, and what — if any — security requirements were agreed upon by both the Amber Group and the Jamaican government for the JamCOVID app and website?</p>
<p>Details of the exposure comes just days after Escala 24&#215;7, a cybersecurity firm based in the Caribbean, <a href="https://nationwideradiojm.com/prominent-cyber-security-firm-says-theres-no-current-vulnerability-in-jam-covid-app/">claimed</a> that it had found no vulnerabilities in the JamCOVID service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/jamaica-immigration-travelers-data-exposed/">following the initial security lapse</a>.</p>
<p>Escala&#8217;s chief executive Alejandro Planas declined to say if his company was aware of the second security lapse prior to its comments last week, saying only that his company was under a non-disclosure agreement and &#8220;is not able to provide any additional information.&#8221;</p>
<p>This latest security incident comes less than a week after Amber Group <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/jamaica-immigration-travelers-data-exposed/">secured a passwordless cloud server</a> hosting immigration records and negative COVID-19 test results for hundreds of thousands of travelers who visited the island over the past year. Travelers visiting the island are required to upload their COVID-19 test results in order to obtain a travel authorization before their flights. Many of the victims whose information was exposed on the server are Americans.</p>
<p>One <a href="http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/business/20201030/amber-enters-four-more-markets-pandemic-tech">news report</a> recently quoted Amber’s Savadia as saying that the company developed JamCOVID19 &#8220;within three days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither the Amber Group nor the Jamaican government have commented to TechCrunch, but Samada told local radio that it has <a href="http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20210218/full-text-government-initiates-criminal-investigation-alleged-data-breach">launched a criminal investigation</a> into the security lapse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://equitybee.com/">EquityBee</a>, a stock option marketplace startup, has raised $20 million in a Series A round of funding.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Group 11 led the financing, which also included participation from Oren Zeev Ventures, Battery Ventures and ICON Continuity Fund. It brings the company’s total raised to over $28 million since its 2018 inception.</p>
<p dir="ltr">EquityBee CEO and co-founder Oren Barzilai says his company’s mission is to help educate startup employees on the meaning of their stock options, as well as provide them with funds to be able to purchase them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">“I have seen many of my friends and colleagues negotiate a $500 salary increase, but completely disregard their stock options package, from lack of knowledge due to the whole field of startup stock options being opaque,” said Barzilai, who also founded Tapingo, which was acquired by Grubhub in 2018 for $150 million. “As a founder I saw my team members who helped build the company not take part in our success because they left prematurely and didn&#8217;t exercise their stock options.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The way it works is fairly straightforward. EquityBee provides capital to startup employees so they can purchase stock options. The employees get money to cover the cost of exercising their stock options and the taxes. The investors who helped provide the funding so they could do that get a return, or a share of the profit, if there’s “a liquidity event.” EquityBee makes money by charging an upfront fee from the investor on the investment day, as well as any carried interest upon a successful exit or IPO.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Barzilai said that many employees don’t realize they have about 90 days to exercise options before they expire once they leave a company. And even if they do, they may not always have the money to exercise them. That’s where EquityBee wants to help.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company was originally founded in Israel before launching in the U.S. market, and moved its headquarters to Silicon Valley in February 2020. Since then, it’s funded employees from &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of companies, including Airbnb, Palantir, DoorDash and Unity, with capital provided by family offices, funds and high-net individuals. Its investor community is made up of 8,000 funds, family offices and high-net worth individuals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">2020 was a good year for EquityBee, according to Barzilai, who says it grew by more than 560% the amount of money it raised to fund employee stock options. It also saw a 360% increase in the number of individual employees funded through its platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, the 33-person company plans to use the money toward hiring and expanding product offerings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dovi Frances, founding partner of Group 11, said it doubled down on EquityBee after backing the company in its <a href="https://www.finsmes.com/2020/02/equitybee-raises-6-6m-in-funding.html">$6.6 million funding round </a>in February 2020 because it’s impressed by what it described as the company’s “perfect product market fit&#8221; and triple-digit growth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann led the company’s <a href="https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-adam-neumann-leads-15m-seed-round-in-equitybee-1001253286">$1.5 million seed round </a>in September of 2018.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA has released video taken by the Perseverance landing module and rover showing the famous &#8220;seven minutes of terror&#8221; in a bracing first-person perspective. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/dizzying-view-of-perseverance-mid-descent-makes-its-7-minutes-of-terror-feel-very-real/">images sent back Friday</a> were just a teaser — this is the full experience, and <a href="https://twitter.com/NASAPersevere/status/1363929492138254340">the first video of a Mars landing ever captured</a>.</p>
<p>A full description of the rover&#8217;s descent and mission <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/mars-rover-perseverance-touches-down-tomorrow-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">can be found here</a>, but briefly stated here&#8217;s what happened:</p>
<p>After decelerating in the atmosphere interplanetary velocity, the heat shield is jettisoned and the parachute deployed. Beneath the heat shield are a number of cameras and instruments, which scanned the landscape to find a good landing spot. At a certain altitude and speed the parachute is detached and the &#8220;jetpack&#8221; lower stage takes over, using rockets to maneuver towards the landing area. At about 70 feet above the surface the &#8220;skycrane&#8221; dangles the rover itself out of the lander and softly plops it down on the ground before the jetpack flies off to crash at a safe distance.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2113233" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-active-landing.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113233" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2113233" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-active-landing.jpg" alt="Diagram showing the various parts of the Perseverance landing process" width="1024" height="604" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-active-landing.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-active-landing.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-active-landing.jpg?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-active-landing.jpg?resize=768,453 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-active-landing.jpg?resize=680,401 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-active-landing.jpg?resize=1536,906 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-active-landing.jpg?resize=2048,1208 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-active-landing.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2113233" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NASA/JPL-Caltech</p></div></p>
<p>The whole process takes about seven minutes, the last few seconds of which which are an especially white-knuckle ride.</p>
<p>While previous rovers sent back lots of telemetry and some imagery, this level of visual documentation is a first. Even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/03/nasas-insight-mars-lander-will-gaze-and-drill-into-the-depths-of-the-red-planet/">Insight, launched in 2018</a>, wasn&#8217;t able to send back this kind of footage.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first time we&#8217;ve actually been able to capture an event like the landing of a spacecraft on Mars,&#8221; said Mike Watkins, head of JPL, at a press conference. &#8220;These are really amazing videos, we all binge watched them over the weekend if you can call a one minute video binge watching. We will learn something by looking at the performance of the vehicle in these videos but a lot of it is also to bring you along on our journey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about you, but it is unlikely at this point in my career that I will pilot a spacecraft down to the surface of Mars,&#8221; said Matt Wallace, deputy project manager of Perseverance at JPL. &#8220;But when you see this imagery I think you will feel like you are getting a glimpse into what it would be like to land successfully in Jezero crater with perseverance.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were upward-facing cameras on the capsule, jetpack, and rover, and downward-facing cameras on the latter two as well, providing shots in both directions for practically the whole process. This image of the heat shield falling away feels iconic already &#8211; revealing the desert landscape of Mars much like film we&#8217;ve seen of Apollo landings on the Moon:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116102" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-heatshield.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116102" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2116102" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-heatshield.gif" alt="Animated image of Perseverance jettisoning its heat shield as it descends toward Mars." width="800" height="639" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2116102" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NASA/JPL-Caltech</p></div></p>
<p>You can see the whole thing below:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/4czjS9h4Fpg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Over 30 gigabytes of imagery were captured of the descent even though one of the cameras failed when the parachute deployed. Sending data back (via Mars orbiters overhead) is a slow process at first, about a 2 megabit connection (still incredibly fast compared with old systems) that slowly gets stepped up to multiples of that.</p>
<p>Practically every frame of the video offers new information about the process of landing on Mars — for instance, one of the springs used to eject the heat shield can be seen to have disconnected, though it didn&#8217;t affect the process. All the footage has been and no doubt will continue to be scrutinized for other insights.</p>
<p>In addition to these amazing landing videos, Perseverance has sent back a number of full-color images taken by its navigation cameras, though not all of its systems are up and running yet. The team stitched together the first images of Perseverance inspecting itself and its surroundings to form this panorama:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116118" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pia24422-c1-3000.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116118" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2116118" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pia24422-c1-3000.jpg" alt="Panoramic image of the Martian landscape and Perseverance rover." width="1024" height="302" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pia24422-c1-3000.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pia24422-c1-3000.jpg?resize=150,44 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pia24422-c1-3000.jpg?resize=300,89 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pia24422-c1-3000.jpg?resize=768,227 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pia24422-c1-3000.jpg?resize=680,201 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pia24422-c1-3000.jpg?resize=1536,453 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pia24422-c1-3000.jpg?resize=2048,604 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pia24422-c1-3000.jpg?resize=50,15 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2116118" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NASA/JPL-Caltech</p></div></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have many, many more images soon as the team processes and uploads them.</p>
<p>As a parting &#8220;gift,&#8221; the team provided the remarkable first sound recording from the surface of Mars; they hoped that this would both provide new insights and also let anyone who can&#8217;t see the images experience the landing in a different way.</p>
<p>The EDL system included a microphone to capture the sound of the landing, but sadly didn&#8217;t work during the descent. It is, however, working perfectly well on the surface and has now captured the ambience of the Red Planet — and while the sound of a gust of wind may not be particularly alien, it&#8217;s incredible to think that this truly is wind blowing across another world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next few days, <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify</a> will be launching its service in 85 new markets, and will also roll out 36 new languages on the platform. The news was announced at its online event, “Stream On” today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expansion includes markets across Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean. Combined, these markets include more than a billion people. With these launches, Spotify says &#8220;sounds and stories that once remained local will have access to a global audience of fans across nearly 180 markets.&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as part of its ongoing commitment to building a truly borderless audio ecosystem— connecting creators, listeners, and content — this move represents the company&#8217;s broadest market expansion to date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the company, it will be working closely with local creators and partners in each market to deliver a tailored experience that meets their unique needs, with scaled language translations and specialized payment formats. In addition, Spotify&#8217;s expansion will likely accelerate the discovery of more genres like Afrobeats, Amapiano, K-Pop, Reggaeton, and Amapiano that have earned a place in the global music scene.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The existing rich music cultures in each of these markets will now be able to reach Spotify’s global audience. All this untapped music energy and access to our innovative creator tools will help propel artists to new heights and empower them to turn their passion into a profession,&#8221; an excerpt in the company&#8217;s statement read. </span></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/uGNYKIwJW-E?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with local creators and partners, here&#8217;s a holistic approach to how Spotify plans to roll out its music offerings in each region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First off, its free and premium plans will be available across all the markets. It will also offer individual, family, duo, and student plan options but in select markets which Spotify doesn&#8217;t specify. Also in each of these new markets, Spotify will offer its full global catalog. The company adds that it will continuously work with local rights holders and partners to expand its catalog to include more local offerings globally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full podcast catalogs of the global streaming giant will be launched in the majority of these markets. For the other markets,  Spotify will work closely with local partners to introduce more podcasts from its catalog, as well as Spotify’s proprietary creator platform, Anchor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other offerings include providing a personalized experience to users through its home screen, and browse and search features. Upon launch in these markets, Spotify will be available on mobile and desktop web players while the company works with local partners to introduce Spotify on more platforms, including TV, speakers, wearables, and cars in the coming months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Having more listeners on our platform creates more opportunities for artists and podcasters to make a living from their work. And more creators means more audio content for our users to discover,” said Alex Norström, Spotify chief freemium business officer. “This creates an essential flywheel between creators and listeners that is the foundation of our business — and in the end, it is what will propel the audio industry forward.”</span></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hm7YHHc8AqM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spotify currently has over 340 million active users and 150 million subscribers using its ad-free premium product across 93 markets. This expansion will take the streaming giant to 178 markets globally. Here are the new markets &#8212; in Africa, they include <span style="font-weight: 400;">Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cabo Verde, Cameroon, Chad, Comoros, Côte d&#8217;Ivoire, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Kyrgyzstan, Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, Macau, Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Timor-Leste, Uzbekistan make up the Asian market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Europe, it&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia and San Marino. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markets in the Caribbean and Latin America include Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Curaçao, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu complete the list from Oceania. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expansion news follows a thread of announcements Spotify made today where it also rolled out Spotify HiFi in select global markets and launched a new tool &#8220;Discovery Mode&#8221; in beta.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify provided more details today about how it plans to monetize its investments in podcasts. The company said it&#8217;s launching a new audio advertising marketplace, the Spotify Audience Network, which will allow advertisers to reach listeners across Spotify&#8217;s own Originals and Exclusives, as well as podcasts via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spotify-buying-podcast-hosting-and-ad-company-megaphone-for-235m/">Megaphone</a> and creation tool Anchor, and its ad-supported music, all in one place. The company also said it plans to offer podcasts on its self-serve ad platform, Spotify Ad Studio, starting with Spotify Originals and Exclusives in the U.S., in a beta test phase.</p>
<p>This will expand to include third-party podcasts in the future, the company noted today during its live online event, &#8220;Stream On.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently, Spotify Ad Studio is being used by advertisers across 22 markets following its 2017 launch, to reach Spotify music listeners with both audio and video advertisements. Spotify said the service is its fastest-growing buying channel, but didn&#8217;t provide specific figures to detail that growth.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2116037" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116037" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116037" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Ad-Studio-Podcast_Booking-Device-2021.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Ad-Studio-Podcast_Booking-Device-2021.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Ad-Studio-Podcast_Booking-Device-2021.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Ad-Studio-Podcast_Booking-Device-2021.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Ad-Studio-Podcast_Booking-Device-2021.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Ad-Studio-Podcast_Booking-Device-2021.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Ad-Studio-Podcast_Booking-Device-2021.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Ad-Studio-Podcast_Booking-Device-2021.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Ad-Studio-Podcast_Booking-Device-2021.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116037" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>However, the larger news on the advertising side was the launch of the new audio ad marketplace, Spotify Audience Network. Similar to some of its other forward-looking announcements today, Spotify was light on details about how exactly Spotify Audience Network would work &#8212; saying only that it&#8217;s in the &#8220;early stages of developing the offering,&#8221; and it expects to be able to share more at a later date.</p>
<p>However, the company positioned the marketplace as a &#8220;game changer,&#8221; particularly for podcasters looking to make money from ads, as well as for advertisers who want to reach Spotify&#8217;s audience of hundreds and millions, both on and off Spotify.</p>

<p>This news follows an investigative report by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22241066/spotify-anchor-sponsorships-ad-money-spend-podcasting">The Verge</a> earlier this year which found Spotify was the main sponsor for Anchor advertising to date &#8212; despite its promises to find sponsors for smaller podcasters. It now appears Spotify has been in the process of building out its ad marketplace and tooling to make good on those promises, and may not have prioritized advertiser outreach in the meantime.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116038" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116038" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116038" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Streaming-Ad-Insertion-2021.png?w=640" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Streaming-Ad-Insertion-2021.png 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Streaming-Ad-Insertion-2021.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Streaming-Ad-Insertion-2021.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Streaming-Ad-Insertion-2021.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116038" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Spotify today also spoke about how its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spotify-buying-podcast-hosting-and-ad-company-megaphone-for-235m/">recent acquisition of Megaphone</a> would allow it to scale its Streaming Ad Insertion (SAI) technology, launched in early 2020, to publishers beyond its own Originals and Exclusives audio programs. Today, SAI is available in the U.S., Canada, Germany and the U.K., and will expand to other new markets in 2021.</p>
<p>Since its debut, SAI has been rolling out new features like audience-based buying, native ad placements and reporting on creative performance. Later this year, Spotify says it will make SAI available to Megaphone podcast publishers and &#8220;leading&#8221; Anchor creators.</p>
<p>But Anchor creators won&#8217;t be limited to advertising to grow revenues.</p>
<p>Spotify also briefly noted it will, in a few months, begin beta testing a new feature that will allow Anchor creators to publish paid podcast content to Spotify aimed at their most dedicated fans, as TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/spotify-hints-toward-plans-for-podcast-subscriptions-a-la-carte-payments/">previously reported</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As part of its news announced at its live event today, Spotify announced a set of new creator tools and resources, including the expansion of Marquee, the launch of a tool called &#8220;Discovery Mode&#8221; into beta testing, the opening of the Canvas looping visual feature to all artists and its plans to expand its Spotify for Artists platform to be available in 25 additional languages.</p>
<p>Marquee, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/spotify-and-universal-sign-new-licensing-deal-will-partner-on-development-of-marketing-tools/">launched</a> in 2020, is a tool that allows artists and their teams to promote their new releases through full-screen, sponsored recommendations to both free and paid subscribers. Spotify says that users who see a Marquee pop-up are twice as likely to save the music.</p>
<p>Now, Marquee will be available as a self-serve buying experience for artists, allowing their teams to book campaigns at any time, as easily as they update their artist profile.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This self-serve feature will launch in the U.S., and this summer will expand outside North America, to the U.K. Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, before rolling out more broadly.</p>
<p>Spotify is also launching a beta of its audience development tool, Discovery Mode, a feature that lets artist teams select the music they want to prioritize for discovery, including through Spotify&#8217;s recommendations. During its pilot testing, this feature helped labels achieve higher royalty payments through the expanded discovery, the company claimed.</p>
<p>It will also require zero upfront budget to get started.</p>
<p>Finally, Canvas, the artwork feature that shows looping visuals as the music plays, will also now be available to all artists.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1895120" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1895120" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1895120" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/spotify-canvas.png?w=680" alt="spotify canvas" width="680" height="339" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/spotify-canvas.png 2382w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/spotify-canvas.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/spotify-canvas.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/spotify-canvas.png?resize=768,383 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/spotify-canvas.png?resize=680,339 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/spotify-canvas.png?resize=1536,766 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/spotify-canvas.png?resize=2048,1021 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/spotify-canvas.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1895120" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Along with the news of Spotify&#8217;s global expansion to 85 new markets, Spotify&#8217;s dashboard for artists will also expand to include support for 25 more languages.</p>
<p>&#8220;From providing new ways for artists to express themselves, to creating more chances to be discovered, to giving artists the ability to pitch their music for playlist consideration, we continue to iterate based on artist feedback, building new ways to surface artists to new fans,&#8221; said Spotify’s head of Marketplace, Charlie Hellman, about the expansions. &#8220;We’re seeing greater adoption of our tools by artists and labels of all sizes, and we’ve just scratched the surface of what’s to come,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://splice.com/">Splice</a>, the New York-based, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/splice-sample-store/">AI-infused, beat-making software service</a> for music producers created by the founder of GroupMe, has managed to sample another $55 million in financing from investors for its wildly popular service.</p>
<p>The GitHub for music producers ranging from <a href="https://splice.com/sounds/splice/hook-n-sling-spectrum-sounds?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_term=how-top-songwriters-producers-use-splice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hook N Sling</a>, <a href="https://splice.com/sounds/splice/mr-hudson-sad-robot-music?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_term=how-top-songwriters-producers-use-splice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mr Hudson</a> SLY, and Steve Solomon to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/splice-review-2014-6">TechCrunch&#8217;s own Megan Rose Dickey</a>, Splice gained a following for its ability to help electronic dance music creators save, share, collaborate and remix music.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s popularity has made it from bedroom DJs to the Goldman Sachs boardroom as the financial services giant joined MUSIC, a joint venture between the music executive Matt Pincus and boutique financial services firm Liontree  in leading the company&#8217;s latest $55 million round.  The company&#8217;s previous investors include USV, True Ventures, DFJ Growth and Flybridge.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;">“The music creation process is going through a digital transformation. Artists are flocking to solutions that offer a user-friendly, collaborative, and affordable platform for music creation,&#8221; said Stephen Kerns, a VP with Goldman Sachs’ GS Growth, in a statement. &#8220;With 4 million users, Splice is at the forefront of this transformation and is beloved by the creator community. We’re thrilled to be partnering with Steve Martocci and his team at Splice.”</span></p>
<p>Splice&#8217;s financing follows an incredibly acquisitive 2020 for the company, which saw it <a href="https://musically.com/2020/05/15/splice-acquires-audio-technology-startup-superpowered/">acquiring music technology companies</a> Audiaire and Superpowered.</p>
<p>In addition to the financing, Splice also nabbed Kakul Srivastava, the vice president of Adobe Creative Cloud Experience and Engagement as a director for its board.</p>
<p>The funding news comes on the heels of Splice’s recent acquisitions of music-tech companies Audiaire and <a href="https://splice.com/blog/building-next-generation-creative-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Superpowered, (opens in a new tab)">Superpowered,</a> creating more ways to improve and inspire the audio and music-making process. Splice is also pleased to announce that Kakul Srivastava has joined the company’s board.</p>

Image Credits:</strong> Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>Splice&#8217;s beefed up balance sheet comes as new entrants have started vying for a slice of Splice&#8217;s music-making market. These are companies like hardware maker Native Instruments, which launched the<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://sounds.com/">Sounds.com</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> marketplace last year, and there&#8217;s also Arcade by Output that&#8217;s pitching a similar service. </span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Splice continues to invest in new technology to make producers&#8217; lives easier. In November 2019 it unveiled its artificial intelligence product that lets producers match samples from different genres using machine learning techniques to find the matches.</p>

<p>“My job is to keep as many people inspired to create as possible,” Splice founder and chief executive Steve Martocci told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s another win for the serial entrepreneur who famously sold his TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon chat app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/11/from-disrupt-ny-to-a-43-million-skype-acquisition-groupme-tells-all/">GroupMe to Skype for $85 million</a> just a year after launching.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mere days after we discussed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/paying-115b-for-stripe-or-77b-for-coinbase-might-be-quite-rational/">Coinbase at $77 billion and Stripe at $115 billion</a> in the private markets, those same semi-liquid exchanges have provided a new valuation for the cryptocurrency company. It&#8217;s now $100 billion, <a href="https://www.axios.com/coinbase-valued-100-billion-direct-listing-9b43e316-7ff7-4f6a-a1db-4dc2481a93ee.html">per Axios&#8217; reporting</a>.</p>
<p>Good thing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/paying-115b-for-stripe-or-77b-for-coinbase-might-be-quite-rational/">we argued last week</a> that there could be <em>some</em> merit to Coinbase&#8217;s $77 billion secondary market valuation from a particular perspective. We&#8217;d look silly today if we&#8217;d mocked the $77 billion figure only for it to go up by about a third in just a few days.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Luckily for us, Axios also got its hands on a few numbers regarding Coinbase&#8217;s 2019 and 2020 financial performance, so we can get into all sorts of trouble this morning. We&#8217;ll look at the data, which stretches to the end of Q3 2020, and then do some creative extrapolating into Q1 2021 to decide whether Coinbase at $100 billion makes no sense, a little sense or perfect sense.</p>
<p>As always, we&#8217;re riffing, not giving investment advice. So read on if you want to noodle on Coinbase with me; its impending direct listing will be one of the year&#8217;s most watched financial events.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll drag Stripe back in at the end. Given that the companies now nearly share private-market valuations, we&#8217;d be remiss to not unfairly stack them against one another. Into the breach!</p>
<h2>Coinbase @ $100B</h2>
<p>Axios&#8217; <a href="https://twitter.com/danprimack">Dan Primack</a>, a good egg in my experience, got the goods on Coinbase&#8217;s historical performance. Summarizing the bits we need, here&#8217;s what the crypto exchange got up to recently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coinbase 2019: $530 million in revenues, $30 million in net losses.</li>
<li>Coinbase 2020 Q1-Q3: $691 million in revenues, $141 million in net income.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s simple to take the 2020 data that we have and extrapolate it into full-year data. Indeed, you get revenues of $921.33 million and net income of $188 million. Compared to its 2019 data, Coinbase would have managed around 74% growth while swinging steeply into the profitable domain.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a <em>killer </em>year. But it&#8217;s actually a bit better than we are giving Coinbase credit for. Poking around volume data compiled by <a href="http://data.bitcoinity.org/">Bitcoinity.org</a>, Coinbase had its biggest period of 2020 in terms of bitcoin trading volume in the fourth quarter. Thinking about Coinbase&#8217;s 2020 from a trading perspective using the same dataset, it had a great Q1, more staid Q2 and Q3, and a blockbuster Q4 that ramped to record highs at the end.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify today announced its plans to roll out a new high-end subscription service, called Spotify HiFi, along with other new features and updates, including new content deals, and features for creators. The company said Spotify HiFi will launch later this year to Spotify Premium subscribers in select global markets, allowing them to listen to music in &#8220;CD-quality, lossless audio format.&#8221;</p>
<p>The news was first announced at Spotify&#8217;s online event, &#8220;Stream On.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spotify said high-quality music streaming has consistently been one of users&#8217; most-requested features, and touted the power of high-quality audio &#8212; even by roping in Billie Eilish to make comments on Spotify&#8217;s behalf during the livestreamed event.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2116041" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116041" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116041" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BillieFINNEAS_2_clean_01283806.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BillieFINNEAS_2_clean_01283806.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BillieFINNEAS_2_clean_01283806.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BillieFINNEAS_2_clean_01283806.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BillieFINNEAS_2_clean_01283806.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BillieFINNEAS_2_clean_01283806.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BillieFINNEAS_2_clean_01283806.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BillieFINNEAS_2_clean_01283806.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116041" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Spotify also said the HiFi service will work across devices, including on Spotify Connect-enabled speakers. And it said it&#8217;s working with some of the world’s biggest speaker manufacturers to make Spotify HiFi accessible to more fans via Spotify Connect.</p>
<p>But Spotify&#8217;s news was light on the details users will really want to know &#8212; like pricing, launch date or even which markets will support the new subscription at launch. We understand the subscription will cost more than the Premium offering by itself, obviously, but the exact price will vary by market. It will also be marketed as a Premium &#8220;add-on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company today also offered an update on its existing artist programs, noting that it had added 76,000 artists to playlists for the first time and highlighted 175 up-and-coming artists through its Radar program, which offers editorial and marketing support. It highlighted, too, how artists were using newer tools like Enhanced Albums, and its Stories feature, Clips, which it says will soon roll out to more artists. It also noted Spotify Canvas, the looping visuals that accompany a track, is now available to all Spotify artists.</p>
<p>And it touted plans to significantly expand access to its service&#8217;s global footprint, saying that, over the next few days, it will expand to new markets that will allow it to reach more than a billion people worldwide, nearly half of whom are already using the internet. In total, Spotify says it&#8217;s expanding to 85 new worldwide markets, across Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, Europe and Latin America.</p>
<p>On the podcasts side, Spotify referenced its newer morning show, &#8220;The Get Up,&#8221; and a new multi-year content deal with AGBO, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo_brothers">Russo Brothers</a> entertainment company; plus a deal with Ava DuVernay for an unscripted podcast; and a new podcast &#8220;Tell Them I Am,&#8221; from its Higher Ground partnership, which will collect narratives from Muslim voices. And it noted Warner Bros. and DC will roll out a slate of narrative-scripted podcasts.</p>
<p>On the R&amp;D side, Spotify spoke about plans to improve podcast recommendations and discovery through new features and improvements to its algorithms and underlying technology.</p>
<p>One feature will help to identify podcasts by category without needing to know the actual show or episode name. For example, users could type in &#8220;cooking&#8221; in the search bar and find podcasts that match that data. This feature is being tested now in the U.S. and will roll out to more locations this year.</p>
<p>On its podcast creation app, Anchor, Spotify said it&#8217;s partnering with WordPress to turn text into audio, add video to their podcasts and access new interactive features like polls and Q&amp;As in order to add real-time communication with fans to their shows.</p>
<p><em>More to come&#8230;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is embarking on a major project to <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey</a> the venture capital investors of Europe, and their cities.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey of VCs in Oslo and Norway</a> will capture how the country is faring, and what changes are being wrought amongst investors by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>We’d like to know how Norway&#8217;s startup scene is evolving, how the tech sector is being impacted by COVID-19 and, generally, how your thinking will evolve from here.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Our survey will only be about investors, and <strong>only the contributions of VC investors will be included.</strong> More than one partner is welcome to fill out the survey. (Please note, if you have filled out the survey already, there is no need to do it again.)</p>
<p>The shortlist of questions will require only brief responses, but the more you can add, the better.</p>
<p><a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6"><strong>You can fill out the survey here.</strong></a></p>
<p>Obviously, investors who contribute will be featured in the final surveys, with links to their companies and profiles.</p>
<p>What kinds of things do we want to know? Questions include: Which trends are you most excited by? What startup do you wish someone would create? Where are the overlooked opportunities? What are you looking for in your next investment, in general? How is your local ecosystem going? And how has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy?</p>
<p>This survey is part of a broader <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys/">series of surveys</a> we’re doing to help founders find the right investors.</p>
<p>For example, here is the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/14-vcs-discuss-covid-19-and-londons-future-as-a-tech-hub/">survey of London</a>.</p>
<p>You are not in Norway, but would like to take part? That&#8217;s fine! Any European VC investor can STILL fill out the survey, as we probably will be putting a call out to your country next anyway! And we will use the data for future surveys on vertical topics.</p>
<p>The survey is covering almost every country in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_for_the_Mediterranean">Union for the Mediterranean</a>, so just look for your country and city on the <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey</a> and please participate (<em>if</em> you&#8217;re a venture capital investor).</p>
<p>Thank you for participating. If you have questions you can email mike@techcrunch.com.</p>
<p><em>(Please note: Filling out the survey is not a guarantee of inclusion in the final published piece.)</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’ve piloted Spot a number of ways in a number of different settings. I had the chance to control the robot for the first time at one of our Robotics events a number of years back, and drove one around an obstacle course at Boston Dynamics’ headquarters. More recently, I navigated it via web browser as a test of the robot’s new remote interface.</p>
<p>But a recent test drive was different. For one thing, it wasn’t officially sanctioned by Boston Dynamics. Of course, the highly sophisticated quadrupedal robot has been out in the world for a while, and a few enterprising souls have begun to offer a remote Spot walking experience through the streets of San Francisco.</p>
<p>The latest project form MSCHF isn’t that. That should come as no surprise, of course. The Brooklyn-based company is never that straightforward. It’s the same organization that gave us the “pirate radio” streaming service All The Streams.FM and that wild Amazon Echo ultrasonic jammer. More than anything, their events are comments &#8212; on privacy, on consumerism or this case, a kind of dystopian foreshadowing of what robotics might become.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Like the rest of the world, the company was fascinated when Boston Dynamics put Spot up for sale &#8212; but unlike most of us, MSCHF actually managed to cobble together $75,000 to buy one.</p>
<p>And then it mounted a paintball gun to its back.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115584" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115584" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2115584" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2170.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2170.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2170.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2170.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2170.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2170.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2170.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2170.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2170.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2115584" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MSCHF</p></div></p>
<p>Starting Wednesday, users will be able to pilot a <a href="https://spotsrampage.com/">Spot unit through MSCHF’s site</a>, and fire off a paintball gun in a closed setting. The company calls it &#8220;Spot&#8217;s Rampage.&#8221;</p>
<p>“The stream will start Wednesday at 1 PM EST,” MSCHF’s Daniel Greenberg told TechCrunch. “We will have a four-camera livestream going and as long as you&#8217;re on the site on your phone, you will have an equal chance of being able to control Spot, and every two minutes the driver will change. It should go for a few hours.”</p>
<p>Ahead of the launch of Spot’s web portal, the company built an API to remotely control both Spot’s SDK and the paintball gun mounted to the robot’s back. It’s a setup Boston Dynamics isn’t particularly thrilled with. Understandably so. For a company that has long been dealing with the blowback of cautionary science fiction like <em>Black Mirror</em>, the optics of a third-party mounting a gun &#8212; even one that shoots paint &#8212; are less than ideal.</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics tells TechCrunch that it was interested in working with the company early on.</p>
<p>“They came to us with the idea that they were going to do a creative project with Spot,” a rep told TechCrunch. “They’re a creative group of guys, who have done a bunch of creative things. In our conversations, we said that if you want to cooperate with us, we want to make it clear that the robots will not be used in any way that hurts people.”</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics balked when paintball gun entered the conversation. On Friday, it issued the following statement through Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today we learned that an art group is planning a spectacle to draw attention to a provocative use of our industrial robot, Spot. To be clear, we condemn the portrayal of our technology in any way that promotes violence, harm, or intimidation. Our mission is to create and deliver surprisingly capable robots that inspire, delight &amp; positively impact society. We take great care to make sure our customers intend to use our robots for legal uses. We cross-check every purchase request against the U.S. Government&#8217;s denied persons and entities lists, prior to authorizing a sale.</p>
<p>In addition, all buyers must agree to our Terms and Conditions of Sale, which state that our products must be used in compliance with the law, and cannot be used to harm or intimidate people or animals. Any violation of our Terms of Sale will automatically void the product’s warranty and prevent the robot from being updated, serviced, repaired or replaced. Provocative art can help push useful dialogue about the role of technology in our daily lives. This art, however, fundamentally misrepresents Spot and how it is being used to benefit our daily lives.</p></blockquote>
<p>The statement is in line with the language in Spot’s contract, which prohibits using the robot to do anything illegal, or to intimidate or harm people. The company says it does additional “due diligence” with potential customers, including background checks.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115585" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115585" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2115585" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2115585" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MSCHF</p></div></p>
<p>The application is something of a gray area where Boston Dynamics is concerned. MSCHF approached the robotics company with its idea and Boston Dynamics balked, believing it wasn&#8217;t in-line with the stated mission for the quadrupedal robots. The official Spot’s Rampage site notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>We talked with Boston Dynamics and they HATED [emphasis theirs] this idea. They said they would give us another TWO Spots for FREE if we took the gun off. That just made us want to do this even more and if our Spot stops working just know they have a backdoor override built into each and every one of these little robots.</p></blockquote>
<p>Boston Dynamics says the company’s “understanding of the interaction” is “inaccurate.”</p>
<p>“We get approached by marketing opportunities all the time to create a really fantastic and compelling experience,” the company adds. “Selling one robot is not that interesting. Creating an amazing interactive experience is really compelling for us. One of the things they pitched to us was an interactive idea. It’s an expensive robot and they wanted to create an interactive experience where anybody can control the robot. We thought that was super cool and compelling.”</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics says it pitched the idea of using Spot’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/boston-dynamics-spot-is-getting-an-arm-and-self-charging-dock-next-year/">robot arm</a> to paint the physical space with a brush, rather than using the paintball gun. The company also offered to send technicians to the site to help maintain the robot during the stream, along with a few models as back up.</p>
<p>MSCHF’s inclusion of the paintball gun is, ultimately, about more than simply painting the canvas. The image of the robot with a gun &#8212; even one that only shoots paint &#8212; is menacing. And that’s kind of the point.</p>
<p>“It’s easy to look at these robots dance and cavort and see them as cute semi-sentient little friends,” says Greenberg. “They’re endearing when they mess up and fall over. We’ve adopted the trappings of that scenario by creating a ‘bull-in-a-china-shop&#8217; scenario. Still, it’s worth remembering the big versions of Spot [Big Dog] were explicitly military mules, and that their public deployments tend to be by city agencies and law enforcement. At the end of the day, Spot is a terrestrial UAV &#8211; when you get to drive this robot and experience the thrill of pulling the trigger your adrenaline spikes &#8212; but, we hope, a few minutes later you feel a distinct chill. Anyone in their right mind knows these little cuties will kill people sooner or later.”</p>
<p>While early Boston Dynamics robots were, indeed, funded by DARPA for use as transport vehicles, the company is quick to distance itself from even the remotest hint of ominous imagery. Boston Dynamics <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/the-aclu-wants-details-about-videos-of-boston-dynamics-robot-in-police-exercises/">came under fire from the ACLU</a> after showcasing footage of a Spot being used in Massachusetts State police drills onstage at a TechCrunch robotics event.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115586" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115586" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2115586" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/spot-ramp-gif-1.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2115586" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>MSCHF</p></div></p>
<p>The company told TechCrunch at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>Right now we’re at a scale where we can pick and choose the partners we engage with and make sure that they have a similar deployment and a vision for how robots are used. For example, not using robots in a way that would physically harm or intimidate people. But also have a realistic expectation for what a robot can and cannot do.</p></blockquote>
<p>As MSCHF prepares to launch its event, the company is echoing those sentiments.</p>
<p>“I turned down a customer that wanted to use Spot for a haunted house,” Boston Dynamics tells TechCrunch. “Even putting it in that context of using our technology to scare people was not within our terms of use and not how we imagined the product being beneficial for people, and so we declined that initial sale. Had this concept been brought to us while we were in the initial sales discussions, we probably would have said, ‘there’s Arduino quadruped that you could easily put this activation together. Go do that. This isn’t representative of how we view our technology being used.&#8217; ”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115587" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115587" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2115587" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2115587" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MSCHF</p></div></p>
<p>But the question of whether the company can put the toothpaste back in the tube remains. In cases of violations of the Terms of Service, the company can opt not to renew the license, which effectively deactivates it the next time a firmware update is due. Other cases could essentially void the warranty, meaning the company won’t service it.</p>
<p>A paintball gun being fired in a closed space likely doesn’t fall under harm, intimidation or illegal activity, however. So it’s not entirely clear whether Boston Dynamics has a direct course of action in this case.</p>
<p>“This is something we’re evaluating now, around this particular use case,” Boston Dynamics says. “We do have other terms of service in there, regarding modification of the robot in a way that makes it unsafe. We’re trying to understand what the implications are.”</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics (whose <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/following-hyundai-acquisition-boston-dynamics-ceo-discussing-the-robotics-pioneers-future/">sale to Hyundai is expected to close in June</a>) has devoted a good deal of time to showcasing the various tasks the robot can perform, from routine inspections at hazard sites to the complex dance moves it’s performed in a recent viral video. MSCHF’s primary &#8212; and, really, only &#8212; use is an interactive art piece.</p>
<p>“To be honest, we don&#8217;t have any further plans [for the robot],” says Greenberg. “I know we won&#8217;t do another drop with it as we do not do repeats so we will just have to get really creative. Maybe a waking cup holder.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new market forecast predicts app spending will reach $270 billion by the year 2025, including paid downloads, in-app purchases and subscriptions. According to data from <a href="https://sensortower.com/">Sensor Tower</a>, in-app spending will return to pre-pandemic levels of stable growth over the next few years, downloads will continue to grow and, perhaps most notably, it&#8217;s predicting app store spending in non-game apps will overtake mobile game spending by 2024.</p>
<p>This is a big bet, given that, today, consumers spend twice as much on mobile games than on non-games. The firm, however, believes the subscription model now being adopted by a range of mobile apps will cause a shift in the market. By 2024, it expects non-game spending to reach $86 billion compared with $73 billion in game spending. And by 2025, that gap will widen, with non-games reaching $107 billion while mobile games reach $78 billion.</p>

<p>Last year, global consumer spending in the top 100 subscription apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/top-100-subscription-apps-grew-34-to-13b-in-2020-share-of-total-spend-remained-the-same/">was up by 34%</a>, year-over-year, to give you an idea of the current state of the market. But there were already some indications that subscription growth was being impacted by larger apps, like Netflix and Tinder, which found workarounds to in-app purchases.</p>
<p>What Sensor Tower also can&#8217;t predict is how the regulatory environment of the next several years will play out across the app stores. Today, companies like Apple and Google require apps to charge customers for subscriptions via Google and Apple&#8217;s own payment mechanisms. But new anti-competition laws could be enacted that would allow publishers to market their own subscriptions inside their apps, which then redirect users to their own channels to make those purchases. Such a change would have an outsized impact on app store subscription growth trends, and, therefore, this forecast.</p>
<p>Though the pandemic pushed in-app spending up by 30% year-over-year to a record $111 billion in 2020, the new forecast predicts general in-app spending will return to pre-COVID levels over the next five years. It says gross revenue across both app stores will climb each year with a 19.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) to reach $270 billion by 2025. Of that figure, $185 billion will be App Store spending, versus $85 billion on Google Play.</p>

<p>The U.S. will grow slightly slower than the rest of the global market, with a CAGR of 17.7% to reach $74 billion by 2025.</p>
<p>European markets will drive growth in app store spending from 2020 through 2025, led by the U.K. This is not the equivalent to which markets see the most spending in total, but rather is about where growth is taking place &#8212; in other words, opportunity for app makers. By 2025, 11 European countries will pass the $1 billion in consumer spending milestone, to collectively reach $42 billion in consumer spend.</p>

<p>Downloads, meanwhile, will continue to grow over the next several years, to reach 230 billion by 2025, the forecast predicts, with Google Play accounting for a majority of that figure, with 187 billion global downloads. In the U.S., however, App Store downloads in 2025 (10.6 billion) will top those from Google Play (6.3 billion), the report concludes.</p>

<p>Hi friends and new readers, welcome back to The Station, a newsletter dedicated to all the present and future ways people and packages move from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Before you get to reading The Station, a small update for you. As transportation editor — a new title I gained last month — I am focused on building a team and deepening our coverage. My first task was to bring on Mark Harris, who will be writing investigative pieces as well as articles for our subscription product Extra Crunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>His first EC piece, which will publish this coming week, is a deep dive into solid-state batteries. This isn&#8217;t some one-off. Each month, EC will publish two &#8220;market map&#8221; articles, which focus on a particular slice of the transportation industry, along with other mobility-related analysis. I&#8217;m also bringing on more reporters to beef up coverage over at TechCrunch. A few of these folks have expertise in automotive tech and are helping me revamp the traditional car review into something more TechCrunch-y.</p>
<p>Email me at <a href="mailto:kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com">kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com</a> to share thoughts, criticisms, opinions or tips. You also can send a direct message to me at Twitter — <a href="https://twitter.com/kirstenkorosec">@kirstenkorosec</a>.</p>

<p>Remember last week when I wondered out loud if a new diversification trend was afoot in the micromobility sector? A growing number of companies are either adding new products to their portfolios or technological upgrades. For instance, Lime has added mopeds to its portfolio and Spin is testing out new three-wheeled scooters that can be remotely operated via software and people power from Tortoise.</p>
<p>Revel has taken this diversification to a new level. The shared electric moped startup said it will start offering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/shared-scooter-startup-revel-adds-electric-bike-subscriptions-to-its-business/">monthly electric bike subscriptions</a> in New York, making this the second new business venture the company has announced in the past several weeks.</p>

<p>Until the end of January, Revel was just a shared electric moped startup. Then it added a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/electric-moped-startup-revel-launches-an-ev-charging-business/">DC fast-charging station for electric vehicles</a> in New York City. This new “Superhub&#8221; will contain 30 chargers and be open to the public 24 hours a day. Revel said it will open other Superhubs across New York City.</p>
<p>A week or so later it announced it was expanding into monthly subscriptions for electric bikes. The pedal-assist bikes, which are manufactured by WING Bikes, come equipped with a 36-volt battery that can travel 45 miles on a single charge and can reach speeds of 20 miles per hour.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t seem — based on comments I received from Revel CEO and co-founder Frank Reig — that the company is done adding business ventures or products. &#8220;Safe to say that this will not be our last big announcement in 2021,” Reig told me.</p>
<p><em>Stay tuned. </em></p>

<p>A few years ago, I thought that lidar — the light detection and ranging radar that measures distance using laser light to generate a highly accurate 3D map of the world — had reached its peak. More than 70 lidar startups existed at that time and the timelines around the deployment of autonomous vehicles, which would theoretically unleash massive demand for the sensors, was slipping.</p>
<p>Consolidation seemed inevitable. Then came the wave of pivots, when lidar companies employed various strategies. Some started to market their sensors to other industries and others touted the perception software that accompanied the lidar. Many targeted automakers with the pitch that their sensors could make the advanced driver assistance systems more robust, reliable and safe.</p>
<p>A new trend is afoot in lidar land. Merging with SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, have become a go-to path for companies wanting to access the level of capital that the public market can provide. Lidar companies have joined the party in recent months, with AEye becoming the latest guest to arrive.</p>
<p><strong>AEye</strong> announced it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/aeye-becomes-latest-lidar-company-to-go-public-via-spac/">going public through a merger</a> with CF Finance Acquisition Corp. III that will value the company at $2 billion. Under this deal, AEye said it was able to raise $225 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE, from institutional and strategic investors that include GM Ventures, Subaru-SBI, Intel Capital, Hella Ventures and Taiwania Capital. Other undisclosed investors also participated. Through the transaction, AEye will have about $455 million in cash on its balance sheet, proceeds that include $230 million in trust from CF Finance Acquisition Corp. III, a SPAC sponsored by Cantor Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>AEye is the sixth lidar company to announce a SPAC since last summer. Velodyne Lidar kicked off the trend when it announced that it planned to go public through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Graf Industrial Corp., with a market value of $1.8 billion. Others soon followed, including Luminar, Aeva, Ouster and Innoviz.</p>

<h2>Investor survey 2021</h2>
<p>Once a year, I like to reach out to investors and ask them a bunch of questions in an effort to understand where they&#8217;re putting their capital, identify emerging trends and get a general sense of where the industry, and its many sub sectors, are heading.</p>
<p>I surveyed 10 investors this time around and published the results in our subscription product Extra Crunch, where there will be a lot more transportation analysis in 2021. I encourage you to subscribe. In the meantime, here&#8217;s a taste of what a handful (not all 10) had to say when I asked this:</p>
<p><strong>What are the overlooked areas that you want to invest in, now that legacy automakers are shifting their portfolios to electric and new EV manufacturers are preparing to start production?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Clara Brenner, Urban Innovation Fund co-founder/managing partner</strong>: We are very interested in the emerging fleet management space — and this is reflected in a number of our recent investments, including Electriphi (software to help fleets transition to electric) and Kyte (activating underutilized fleets to deliver a magical car rental experience). There are so many efficiencies that come from the fleet model for transportation — we think this will be an increasingly important area in the coming years.</p>
<p><strong>Dave Clark, partner at Expa</strong>: Don’t give the incumbents too much credit. As technology becomes commoditized we’ll see new competitors push their way into the market, especially around new designs more suitable to an autonomous and shared system.</p>
<p>A few specific examples for your readers: EVs are approaching price parity with gas-powered cars with the improvements to carbon-neutral/negative-emission tech, energy storage, microgrids and battery tech. We’re about to see drone infrastructure and service business models scale as we approach an inflection point in consumer adoption and industry regulation.</p>
<p>Finally, as autonomous vehicle tech approaches commoditization, there will be plenty of opportunities in the software layers that optimize routes and orchestrate resources across supply chains.</p>
<p><strong>Abhijit Ganguly, senior manager at Goodyear Ventures</strong>: The secular trend toward electrification presents opportunities to OEMs, Tier 1 vendors and aftermarket participants alike. We continue to see opportunities in EV fleet management, aftermarket solutions for improving uptime and reducing cost of operations and supportive infrastructure development (software and hardware) for easy deployment. Envoy, a Goodyear Ventures portfolio company, is capitalizing on these opportunities through its shared mobility EV platform.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel Holt, co-founder/general partner at Construct Capital</strong>: We invested in a really interesting company building the software operating layer to help EV hardware manufacturers “connect;” the software layer of EV is going to be a very interesting space.</p>
<p><strong>Sasha Ostojic, Playground Global operating partner</strong>: There seems to be an overlooked opportunity with consumer automotive apps. We have apps to manage our homes (cameras, speakers, sensors, etc.) so it’s only natural that our cars should join that ecosystem. At first it will be OEM-specific apps (like the Tesla app or the terrible GM app), but I expect an evolution of open APIs where you can add any car to your “garage” (like adding a device to Google Home).</p>
<p><strong>Sebastian Peck, InMotion Ventures&#8217;s managing director</strong>: I think the market may not have fully appreciated the vast potential of connected vehicle data yet, in part because that data is currently still hard to access for developers. We see more OEMs making APIs available in 2021 and we expect this will become a very dynamic space with a lot of innovation benefitting consumers and commercial fleet managers.</p>

<h2>Commission on Future Mobility Q&amp;A</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://futuremobilitycommission.org/">Commission on the Future of Mobility</a> is a new global coalition of business, industry, technology and policy leaders with a gigantic mission. The organization recently announced a slew of appointments to its board, notably Mary Nichols, the former chair of the California Air Resources Board and Jim Farley, president and CEO of Ford Motor Co. Other commissioners include Ola Cabs Chairman Bhavish Aggarwal, Valeo Chairman and CEO Jacques Aschenbroich and Avinash Rugoobur, who is president of Arrival.</p>
<p>I thought it was time to learn more and so I reached out and had a chat with Alisyn Malek, the organization&#8217;s executive director and the former COO and co-founder of May Mobility.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an edited version of our conversation.</p>
<p><strong>ME</strong>: It says here that the ultimate objective of the commission is to recommend a framework for regulations in the American, European and Asian markets that reflects and facilitates the technological transformation taking place. That&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><strong>MALEK</strong>: It&#8217;s a big goal. (laughs)</p>
<p><strong>ME</strong>: Why take a global approach to this?</p>
<p><strong>MALEK</strong>: We think it&#8217;s really important to take a global approach because that allows you to be open to more options of what solutions could look like. If we were only looking at a specific region — yes, it&#8217;s a little bit easier in terms of what you need to focus on and the problems that you need to solve — but we also worried that it would limit us. By taking this global approach, we think it really creates the opportunity to take the best of what everybody is trying to do and put those out as options for people to really understand what the future could look like.</p>
<p><strong>ME</strong>: Will this framework acknowledge that each region has its own demographics and nuances and cultural behaviors and infrastructure?</p>
<p><strong>MALEK</strong>: We realize that there&#8217;s not going to be a one-size-fits-all solution, so our hope is to be able to put together a compelling vision and create options that different policymakers can select from and better understand the trade-offs between them.</p>
<p><strong>ME</strong>: The CFM emphasizes that its results are going to be based on data methodologies. Can you explain exactly the type of hard data that&#8217;s going to be used.</p>
<p><strong>MALEK</strong>: We recognize that a lot of work has been done in these spaces before, so we will be looking at the current literature and working to add some new information and insight. We do think that there are areas where data needs to be collected.</p>
<p>For example, the changes in freight and the rise of e-commerce through the pandemic. That may be an area where we go in and try to understand a new data set. I don&#8217;t know that we would be outfitting vehicles to take that type of data — we&#8217;ll be looking for existing data to feed our studies. That&#8217;s an area that is just so new that there really isn&#8217;t going to be a lot out there, so I think that&#8217;s a place where we may be substantially additive in the data perspective.</p>
<p><strong>ME</strong>: Why does the transportation world need another commission?</p>
<p><strong>MALEK</strong>: When we think about all of the commissions in mobility that exist today — and there are many — they are either focused on the advocacy of a specific topic or are interested in doing the research and adding to the knowledge base, but not necessarily carrying that through to advocacy to help drive change.</p>
<p>A big part of how the Commission on the Future of Mobility is different is the fact that it is bringing together industry leaders across the movement of people and goods so we can hash out the hard questions internally as we work on our proposals and then bring those to an advocacy stage and help drive that change.</p>
<h2>One AI thing</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2114880" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/levandowski-church-AI-1-1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114880" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2114880 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/levandowski-church-AI-1-1.gif" alt="levandowski-church-AI-" width="1600" height="900" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2114880" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bryce Durbin</p></div></p>
<p>Finally, I have to share my article about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/anthony-levandowski-closes-his-church-of-ai/">Anthony Levandowski</a>, the former Google engineer who avoided an 18-month prison sentence after receiving a presidential pardon last month.</p>
<p>I learned (and reported) that Levandowski has officially closed the church he created to understand and accept a godhead based on artificial intelligence. The church, called Way of the Future, sparked interest and controversy &#8212; much like Levandowski himself &#8212; from the moment it became public in a November 2017 article in Wired.</p>
<p>But as I noted in my article, it wasn&#8217;t just the formation of the church or its purpose that caused a stir in Silicon Valley and the broader tech industry. The church&#8217;s public reveal occurred as Levandowski was steeped in a legal dispute with his former employer Google. He had also become the central figure of a trade secrets lawsuit between Waymo, the former Google self-driving project that is now a business under Alphabet, and Uber.</p>
<p>Levandowski dissolved the church at the end of the year. However, the process had started months before, in June 2020, documents filed with the state of California show. The entirety of the church&#8217;s funds &#8212; exactly $175,172 &#8212; were donated to the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund.</p>
<p>I talked to Levandowski; while he didn&#8217;t get too deep into &#8220;why&#8221; he closed WOTF, he did say that he still believes in its premise. He believes that artificial intelligence will fundamentally change how people live and work and that it can be positive for society. He noted that is not guaranteed. Even without Way of the Future, Levandowski said he&#8217;s focused on making that happen.</p>

		Kathy Hannun is president and co-founder of <a href="https://dandelionenergy.com/">Dandelion Energy</a>. Prior to Dandelion, Kathy worked at X, Google Alphabet’s innovation lab. In May 2017, Kathy launched Dandelion as an independent startup. She graduated from Stanford with a B.S. in Civil Engineering and M.S. in Computer Science.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">I closed two major rounds of funding for my geothermal energy startup, Dandelion Energy, while pregnant. I did not disclose either pregnancy to my investors during the fundraising process either time. I felt fine doing this, and I believe other founders should feel free to keep their pregnancies private as well if they’d prefer to.</p>
<p>No one would think twice about a male founder who declined to share the details of his health or family status with investors during an initial fundraising meeting. On the contrary, it would be an unusual move for him to do so.</p>
<p>For some context, my co-founder and I spun our startup, Dandelion Energy, out of Alphabet’s X in April 2017 and raised our first small round of outside funding that summer. Our goal was to set up a commercial pilot and start selling and installing heat pumps to demonstrate that our product worked and show that there was demand for affordable geothermal before we raised a larger round. We had to prove that our business was viable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

		<blockquote>
			No one would think twice about a male founder who declined to share the details of his health or family status with investors during an initial fundraising meeting.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That same summer, in 2017, I became pregnant.</p>
<h2>Round one</h2>
<p>As summer turned to fall, I had to figure out how to approach being pregnant while raising Dandelion’s second round of funding. I was lucky to be able to choose whether to tell people I was pregnant because it turned out I didn’t end up looking visibly pregnant until about seven months in, and even then I could dress to make it nonobvious. Without knowing anyone who’d gone through a similar experience, I had to decide how I would handle my status as a pregnant person when speaking with investors.</p>
<p>At first, it worried me that I would be hiding something if I didn’t disclose my pregnancy. But I really didn’t want to. I was a first-time entrepreneur with no real track record. Oh yeah, and I was a woman. And almost all of the investors were men who typically funded men.</p>
<p>Especially early on in a startup’s life, these investors are judging the founder as much as the business. Making an impression is key, and &#8220;pregnant&#8221; didn’t strike me as accretive in any way to my ability to deliver the type of impression that would lead to investment in my business (I hope this changes over time, but I am being honest about how things seemed to me).</p>
<p>And then there was this: Even if I had decided to tell investors I was expecting, how could I broach the topic in a way that wouldn’t threaten to derail the entire tenor of the meeting? I was meeting most of these people for the first time and had a limited amount of time to spend explaining payback periods and vapor compression refrigeration cycles. It seemed like the best-case scenario was if disclosing pregnancy made the meeting no worse than it would otherwise have been. In no world could I imagine it would be a net positive.</p>
<p>Given all of this, I made the decision to not talk about it. It worked out for me. As soon as I started showing, around seven months in, everyone left their offices for the holidays, and so I was never forced to address what was becoming visibly obvious.</p>
<p>But of course there was a downside to my approach. I would have to tell them eventually, and I’d pushed it off so long that by the time I finally got around to it we basically had to have a conversation like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Me: “Some happy news to share: I’m pregnant!”</p>
<p>Investors: “Congratulations! We are so thrilled for you! When’s the due date?”</p>
<p>Me: “Ahhh … Next month.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Happily, all of them were extremely supportive and gracious when I told them. Their uncomplicated and positive acceptance of the news even made me wonder if all my internal wrangling about whether to tell investors had been unnecessary. I gave birth to my daughter literally one day after the money was wired.</p>
<h2>Round two</h2>
<p>Time passed and it became clear we were ready to raise our next round of funding. Also, I become pregnant again. This time, most of the fundraising happened in the early stages of my pregnancy. Early enough that I hadn’t even really told my friends, so it was obvious to me I wouldn’t be telling investors I was just meeting. After having gone through it once before, it was an easier decision the second time around.</p>
<h2>Looking back</h2>
<p>Reflecting on my experience, I do think it helped that I got to know my investors throughout the fundraising process, so by the time I told them I was pregnant, they already knew me and I had already established my credibility as an entrepreneur. Being pregnant was just something going on in my life; it didn’t define who I was to them. That is one advantage of introducing it later: It did not define me because they knew so much else about me by that point.</p>
<p>In many ways, I am a stereotypical founder: I have a CS degree from Stanford, I worked as a PM at Google, I have an engineering background. I have many advantages. Yet, more present in my mind during fundraising were the parts of my identity that seemed atypical, and the primary aspect here was my being a woman.</p>
<p>Because there is so much conversation about how women receive so much less investment, I was worried that being a woman would be a disadvantage, and there’s nothing like being pregnant to highlight in the strongest possible way that you’re a woman.</p>
<p>I now feel lucky to know other founders who have raised money while visibly pregnant, and so I’ve seen firsthand that it’s possible. But it is not something that a pregnant founder should feel obligated to disclose. I hope that it becomes common for women to start businesses and raise capital for those businesses in every stage of their lives, including when they’re pregnant.</p>
<p>Because as soon as the pregnant woman and the guy with the hoodie both seem equally probable as startup founders, it will suddenly matter much less whether to talk about your pregnancy.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a> — and be sure to check out our last main ep, in which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/equity-monday-the-electric-car-boom-tech-regulation-and-some-sad-american-vc-data/">Natasha coins a slogan for a16z that I both hate, and became the headline of the show</a>!</p>
<p>But enough of all of that, we have a lot to get through this morning. Here&#8217;s what we talked about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Weekend:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/danprimack/status/1362902732986867713">Coinbase at $100 billion</a>? More on that to come. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/restaurant-software-provider-toast-prepares-205100823.html">Toast is going public</a>! Probably! Wait, Toast the company that laid off staff last year? Yep that Toast! It&#8217;s not toast! And <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-internet-loans-china-banks-idUSKBN2AK0F2">new rules</a> on online lending in China.</li>
<li><strong>This Morning:</strong> Oscar Health put together <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1568651/000119312521049832/d28906ds1a.htm">an IPO price range</a> that is <em>interesting</em>, and Apex Clearing is <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210222005281/en/Leading-Fintech-Apex-Clearing-Holdings-to-List-on-NYSE-Through-Merger-With-Northern-Star-Investment-Corp.-II">going public via a SPAC</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Funding Rounds:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/gophr/">Gophr raises money</a>! <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/ageras-nabs-73m-at-a-244m-valuation-for-its-accountancy-marketplace-and-bookkeeping-tech-stack/">Ageras Group raises money</a>! <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/with-20m-a-round-promise-brings-financial-flexibility-to-outdated-government-and-utility-payment-systems/">Promise raises money</a>! It was hard to pick just three, but each of those rounds has something notable about it. Enjoy!</li>
<li><strong>Deeper Dive/Riff: </strong>If the public markets will float even the most leaden of startup via a SPAC-balloon, any late-stage startup that doesn&#8217;t take the ride out of the private markets must either be perfect or too heavy to lift. And if it&#8217;s the second, we can write it off? Maybe?</li>
</ul>
<p>And, finally, this is precisely <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1363849196193857538">what I feel like</a> this Monday morning. Chat soon and stay safe!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.creatio.com/">Creatio</a>, a Boston-based software company, announced that it has raised $68 million. <a href="https://www.volitioncapital.com/">Volition Capital</a>, a growth-equity fund, led the round. The deal was a minority investment in the startup.</p>
<p>The deal is notable not merely thanks to its sheer size, but because up until today Creatio had bootstrapped. That&#8217;s according to founder and CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/k_kostereva">Katherine Kostereva</a>, with whom TechCrunch caught up with last week regarding the investment.</p>
<p>Per Kostereva, her company&#8217;s low-code platform helps other companies automate business processes. Creatio&#8217;s competitive edge, she said, comes in part from how quickly it can help companies automate; the faster that companies can get from a low-code platform to live apps matters.</p>
<p>Creatio also has a genre focus, namely that it touts its platform&#8217;s ability to help automate work in the CRM space &#8212; think marketing and sales-related tasks. But its crowning &#8220;jewel,&#8221; Kostereva said, is Creatio&#8217;s underlying low-code automation platform.</p>
<p>The low-code world that Creatio competes in is a broad space that is seeing active investment from the very-early to the very-late stage. For example, last month TechCrunch covered no-code-focused <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/stacker-raises-1-7m-to-help-nocoders-build-apps-from-spreadsheets/">Stacker&#8217;s $1.7 million round</a>. And earlier this month TechCrunch wrote about low-code-focused <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/low-code-focused-outsystems-raises-150m-at-a-9-5b-valuation/">OutSystems&#8217; $150 million raise at a $9.5 billion valuation</a>.</p>
<p>To see another low-code company raise a big check was therefore not too surprising.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Five VCs discuss how no-code is going horizontal across the world’s industries&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/22/five-vcs-talk-about-how-no-code-is-going-horizontal-across-the-worlds-industries/embed/#?secret=TRVD2gOX2W" data-secret="TRVD2gOX2W" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>TechCrunch was curious where the company and its founder came down on the concept of low-code versus no-code, a topic that is always good to ask players in either space. Kostereva highlighted the importance of citizen developers, folks who can use drag-and-drop interfaces to create apps but who are less adept with code. But she added that with today&#8217;s no-code tools one can only build simple things. Creatio, she continued, is more focused on the mid-market and enterprise. As such, it&#8217;s just not possible for Creatio to go no-code today. But, her view did appear to be that citizen devs should be able to do more and more in time without code.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fair perspective, and an encouraging one. The more that folks can do sans code, the more power that can shift into the hands of business orgs that traditionally had to depend on other departments for dev lift.</p>
<p>Back to the money side of things; Creatio has historically targeted breakeven financial results, per its CEO. That means it reinvested in itself as it grew, an arrangement that made us curious as to why the company would raise capital now; why change up a working formula?</p>
<p>In short the company was getting itself ready to accelerate, according to its founder. Kostereva said that she wanted Creatio to have &#8220;world-class&#8221; numbers for metrics like net retention, revenue growth and net promoter score before it took on external funds.</p>
<p>Was the wait worth it? The company&#8217;s net retention was 122% last year, and its NPS score is 34, she disclosed. On the growth side of things, Kostereva said that her company started off doubling and tripling and is still close to doubling. Our read of her comments is that Creatio is probably growing its ARR in the high double digits today.</p>
<p>The company wants to use its capital to invest in sales and marketing to help spread the the word about its business, invest in its partner program, a key growth mechanism, and R&amp;D, it said. So, a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has recently noticed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/rapid-growth-in-2020-reveals-okr-software-markets-untapped-potential/">just how big the software world really is</a>, indexing off the fast that there is enough room for a host of OKR-focused startups to grow and raise external capital without weeding out weaker players. Given how many business processes there are in the world to automate, it may be that Creatio and other low-code platforms that want to help other companies accelerate will enjoy similar market dynamics. Investors, at least, are betting like that&#8217;s the case.</p>
