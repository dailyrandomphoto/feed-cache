										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As part of its recently announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/for-polestar-the-twos-are-anything-but-terrible-130059155.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">2022 lineup</a>, Volvo subsidiary Polestar introduced a new single-motor variant of its Polestar 2 electric sedan. If you were waiting on an EPA estimate before reserving one, wait no more. You can expect to get about 270 miles of range on a single charge from the car’s 75 kWh battery, Polestar announced on Wednesday.</p>
<p>That puts the FWD model in the company of vehicles like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagens-id-4-ev-is-the-basic-people-mover-youve-been-waiting-for-163027836.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">Volkswagen ID.4</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-3-2021-refresh-offers-more-range-and-other-improvements-114539380.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">Model 3</a>. With the entry-level models of those two cars, you can expect 249 miles and 263 miles of range, respectively. That’s not bad given the Polestar 2’s $47,200 starting price, but not nearly as good as the 303 miles of EPA-rated range Hyundai will offer with the $44,875 version of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundais-300-mile-ioniq-5-crossover-ev-makes-its-official-north-american-debut-190054008.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">Ioniq 5</a>.</p>
<p>The automaker also announced today it’s rolling out an over-the-air update for all Polestar 2 vehicles. The new software allows you to schedule when you want your car to charge, so that you can take advantage of off-peak pricing. The update also includes refinements for the car’s driver-assist systems. In the coming months, Polestar plans to release a software upgrade that will allow owners of the dual-motor Polestar 2 to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/polestar-2-over-the-air-update-torque-horsepower-acceleration-151000748.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">unlock additional torque and horsepower</a> from their car for a fee.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248228" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Katie Haun, who co-led Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s $2.2 billion crypto fund, is splitting off from the firm and taking a number of colleagues with her &#8212; including operating partner Rachael Horwitz &#8212; to start a new crypto-centric fund, <a href="https://www.axios.com/crypto-investor-katie-haun-leave-andreessen-horowitz-e11aa2f2-6ad9-4b27-abb4-b44e461174ec.html">Axios</a> reports.</p>
<p>Haun <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/25/andreessen-horowitz-has-a-new-crypto-fund-and-its-first-female-general-partner-is-running-it-with-chris-dixon/">joined the firm in 2018</a> after a career as a federal prosecutor for the Justice Department working on cyber crimes. She has been a highly visible public face for the firm&#8217;s crypto efforts, discussing the regulatory landscape of the industry at events like TechCrunch Disrupt.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the firm confirmed the news to TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248185" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz has grown to be a major presence in the crypto investment world as they&#8217;ve rapidly deployed capital into a number of startups in the space. They were an early mover with their first $300 million crypto investment fund in 2018, which they have since followed up with two larger funds, including their current vehicle, the $2.2 billion Fund III.</p>
<p>Haun has co-led the fund alongside long-time a16z GP Chris Dixon. The firm has maintained its edge among legacy firms but is seeing increased competition among a swatch of so-called &#8220;crypto native&#8221; investment funds like Paradigm and Variant Fund. Paradigm recently closed a $2.5 billion crypto fund, the largest of its kind.</p>
<p>Haun currently site on the boards of Coinbase and OpenSea, among others, where she is expected to retain her board seats. The report details that Andreessen Horowitz will be a large limited partner in her fund alongside personal investments from Andreessen, Horowitz, and Dixon. Haun notified her colleagues of the departure earlier today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A team at Google is today launching a new service called <a href="https://qaya.area120.google.com/">Qaya</a>, which will allow creators to easily set up new web storefronts where they can sell their products and services directly to their audiences. The project is the latest to emerge from Google&#8217;s in-house project incubator, Area 120, which was recently a part of a broader <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/google-reorg-moves-ar-vr-starline-and-area-120-into-new-labs-team-reporting-directly-to-sundar-pichai/">reorganization</a> at the company that elevated its status after many of its earlier projects exited to different parts of Google, including its Cloud, Search, Shopping and Commerce divisions.</p>
<p>The new project, Qaya, was co-founded by Nathaniel Naddaff-Hafrey, a founder-in-residence at Area 120 who previously worked on <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/03/11/google-area-120-kormo-job-seekers/">jobs marketplace</a> Kormo aimed at the &#8220;next billion&#8221; internet users, specifically those in markets like India, Indonesia, and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>After hearing from dozens of creators about how difficult and time-consuming it is to build their digital businesses, he got the idea for <a href="https://qaya.area120.google.com/">Qaya</a>, a service that would allow them to sell directly to fans. Several other members on the Qaya team are also creators, who bring with them their own experiences with existing creator tools. They understood from their own efforts and other creators they spoke to, there&#8217;s demand for a flexible, no-code product that could function as a one-stop-shop where creators can make money from their work and better connect with their audience.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248079" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Qaya&#8217;s solution allows creators to build personalized web storefronts featuring their products and services, and other digital downloads, which can then be linked to their YouTube Merch Shelf, and integrated with Google Search and Google Shopping. Through these stores, creators could include things like photos, files or ebooks, digital art, photo filters and presets, productivity templates, knitting patterns, fitness videos and much more. The company says up to 1,000 products can be hosted per storefront.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2248116" style="width: 363px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248116" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2248116" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ProductPage1000x.max-1000x1000-1.png?w=353" alt="" width="353" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ProductPage1000x.max-1000x1000-1.png 519w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ProductPage1000x.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=78,150 78w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ProductPage1000x.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=156,300 156w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ProductPage1000x.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=353,680 353w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ProductPage1000x.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=26,50 26w" sizes="(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248116" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, if the creator sells physical goods or services on other platforms, an import function will allow them to feature these items on their Qaya page, complete with their own personal branding.</p>
<p>Each store also gets its own custom URL in the form of qaya.store/your-name or yourname.channel, which could be used in place of the links they place on social media sites created with the &#8220;link in bio&#8221; solutions available today like <a href="https://linktr.ee/">Linktree</a> or <a href="https://beacons.ai/">Beacons</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These services let creators build micro-websites pointing to their various online presences, including social media channels, shops, blogs, music or podcasts, and more.</p>
<p>And like those services, the Qaya stores also allow creators to feature links to their other online profiles, which sit at the top of the page underneath the creator&#8217;s name and bio. But the larger purpose of the site is to connect fans directly to the content the creator has for sale, not just as a landing page to connect fans to the creator&#8217;s profile on other services.</p>
<p>Google Pay is built into Qaya, and supports a variety of monetization types including subscription, tipping, and one-time payments. Qaya also offers insights and analytics about how the creators&#8217; products are performing in terms of sales.</p>
<p>Currently, the product is free to use with monetization managed on a transactional basis. That is, creators will keep the &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of the revenue they generate from products they upload and sell on Qaya, notes Google.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2248115" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248115" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2248115" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dashboard2x.max-1000x1000-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="405" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dashboard2x.max-1000x1000-1.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dashboard2x.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dashboard2x.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=300,179 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dashboard2x.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=768,457 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dashboard2x.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=680,405 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dashboard2x.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248115" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company is now rolling out the YouTube Merch Shelf integrations for eligible YouTube creators who join Qaya&#8217;s beta, and in time, hints that Qaya aims to allow creators to sell even more products, including &#8220;other types of digital goods,&#8221; which sounds like a veiled reference to NFTs, though Google isn&#8217;t yet saying if that&#8217;s the case.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2248114" style="width: 564px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248114" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2248114" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/YouTube_mock10x.max-1000x1000-1.png?w=554" alt="" width="554" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/YouTube_mock10x.max-1000x1000-1.png 815w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/YouTube_mock10x.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=122,150 122w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/YouTube_mock10x.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=245,300 245w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/YouTube_mock10x.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=768,942 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/YouTube_mock10x.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=554,680 554w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/YouTube_mock10x.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=41,50 41w" sizes="(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248114" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Google says the new service is launching today into beta testing in the U.S., though non-U.S. users can join a waitlist while they wait for Qaya to roll out to their country. Creators who want to gain access to Qaya&#8217;s beta can request an <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScrnVCQI8oBzWv3NyQOcSnHBUbFlOgnv25nJx-sXrDxwa63Xg/viewform">invitation</a> from the Qaya website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.wonderdynamics.com/">Wonder Dynamics</a> aims to make &#8220;blockbuster-level&#8221; visual effects achievable by living-room-level creators using AI and cloud services, though it has kept its product closely under wraps. The secretive company, which boasts a star-studded set of advisors, has raised a $10M A round ahead of a planned launch later in 2022.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Nikola Todorovic and actor Tye Sheridan; they joined forces some years back after working on a film together and finding they shared a belief in democratizing cinema tools. Of course many tools have come down in price and difficulty, such as high-resolution cameras and the computing power to edit and color footage.</p>
<p>But serious VFX are another matter, and the higher fidelity of today&#8217;s cameras and displays demand improved quality in CG, something that has kept the cost and barrier to entry high.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248127" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Wonder Dynamics is a VFX platform that utilizes AI and cloud services to make these things easier, though exactly how is still something of a secret.</p>
<p>&#8220;The platform uses a completely new process, and it is an end-to-end solution for content creators who lack the technical knowledge necessary to produce CG and VFX content,&#8221; explained Todorovic. &#8220;For the professional artist, the output is exportable into existing workflow and software (Unreal, Blender, Maya, etc.). It is focused on post-production, but it will drastically reduce the need for hardware, equipment and additional effort in production as it exists today.&#8221;</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll know more when they debut the platform at SXSW in 2022, but until then skeptics might be comforted by the presence of Steven Spielberg and Joe Russo on its advisory board. Both are of course seasoned directors and picky about the looks of their films; Russo (and his brother Anthony Russo) in particular is known for preferring practical effects to CG where the latter is not absolutely required, so his support is notable.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we got deeper into our development we knew that this could be more than just software for Visual Effects,&#8221; said Sheridan in a press release. &#8220;Our platform can be used for film and TV, but also video games, social media content, and even the Metaverse.&#8221;</p>
<p>The latter provides additional justification for two of the new investors, Epic Games and Samsung Next. Horizon Ventures led the $10M round, with seed round investors Founders Fund and MaC Venture Capital returning as well.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Apple debuted the AirTag — a little puck-shaped widget meant to be thrown into your bag or attached to your keys to track their location. Know your bag is in the house somewhere but just can&#8217;t find it? Tap a button, make it beep.</p>
<p>And, well, these things are quite good! I bought four expecting to not find a use for all of them, then pretty much immediately went back and bought four more. I put one in my wallet, one in my pool bag, one in my favorite jacket so I never lose it at a party, one in my car because I&#8217;m bad at parking lots and more. The battery lasts a long time and is easily replaceable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One catch: They really only work with iOS devices, so consider alternatives for Android users.</p>

<p>Apple didn&#8217;t invent the concept of fully wireless headphones with the AirPods — but they definitely helped to explode the category.</p>
<p>Lots of competition has since hit the market, much of it worth checking out. Our own Brian Heater <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/nothing-ear-1-review/">checked out Nothing&#8217;s $99 Ear (1) buds</a> (pictured above) and found them to be &#8220;solid&#8221;; Jabra&#8217;s Elite 3 in-ear wireless buds, meanwhile, are basic (don&#8217;t expect much in the way of noise cancellation) but good.</p>
<p>If they specifically asked for AirPods, you&#8217;re gonna have to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PXGQC1Q/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07PXGQC1Q&amp;linkId=7234e5c616800e4404be43d347e2aaa6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jump back a generation to get&#8217;em for under $100</a>. Gen 2 AirPods are still quite good, but compared to Gen 3 they&#8217;ve got a different design, weaker battery life, no water resistance and a few other key differences.</p>

<p>I started tinkering with Philips Hue smart bulbs a few years ago, and they&#8217;re slowly taking over my house. They&#8217;re a dead simple and relatively affordable way to make any room feel <em>way</em> fancier, allowing you to tweak the lighting (brightness, color, temperature, etc.) in an instant with your phone or, if you&#8217;ve got smart speakers around your house, your voice.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a dozen of them around my house now and they&#8217;ve been absolutely rock solid for years. Want more smart home gift ideas? Check out our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/smart-home-gift-guide-ideas/">smart home starter guide</a> here.</p>

<p>There are a zillion e-book readers out there … but, for most people, and as much as it pains me, it&#8217;s hard to recommend anything over a Kindle. They&#8217;re well built, polished and the process of getting a book onto it is about as simple as could be.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re trying to stay under $100, the $75 base model Kindle will get the job done. You won&#8217;t get the waterproofing or much brighter LEDs of the $140 Kindle Paperwhite or the $250 Kindle Oasis … but if what you want is a device that&#8217;ll let you carry around a zillion books at once with a battery that lasts days/weeks, the base model checks all the boxes. Plus, if ads on the home screen don&#8217;t seem like a big deal, they&#8217;ll cut the price down to $55.</p>

<h2>Longer, better charging cables!</h2>

<p>The charging cables that come with most phones aren&#8217;t great. They&#8217;re too quick to fall apart, and way too short — especially if you like to look at your phone in bed. Is looking at your phone in bed a good idea? Nope! Do we all do it anyway? Yep!</p>
<p>Anker&#8217;s woven cables are a huge step up. They&#8217;re nice and long (6-10 ft), come in lightning or USB-C forms, and the woven nylon cable lasts <em>way</em> longer, in my experience, than the quick-to-fray plastic of the included cables. I keep a few of these around as stocking stuffers and back up gifts.</p>

<p>Speaking of Anker, I&#8217;m a big fan of their PowerCore Fusion backup battery.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the highest-capacity backup battery by any means, but it&#8217;s got a neat trick: It&#8217;s a wall charger <em>and</em> a backup battery, all-in-one. It&#8217;ll charge your phone first, then charge its own internal 10,000 mAh battery — so, assuming you use it as your regular charger, you&#8217;ll never reach for your backup battery to find that it, too, is dead. This thing has earned a forever spot in my travel bag and has saved my butt multiple times.</p>

<p>I friggin&#8217; love streaming sticks. They&#8217;re ridiculously affordable for all the services they can push to your TV (Netflix! Hulu! Paramount+! Disney+! HBO Max!) and are almost always far <em>far</em> better than the apps built into most smart TVs.</p>
<p>I like the Chromecast a lot — both the standard $30 Chromecast and the $40 Chromecast with Google TV — because I primarily control my TV through apps on my phone. If you want 4K support, Apple TV+ support, or a remote control, go with the latter option.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Amazon&#8217;s Firestick range and Roku&#8217;s streaming sticks are all quite good.</p>

<p>Basically a Google smart speaker with a display, the Nest Hub hits far above its weight. I put one in my kitchen a year or so back and now use it almost every time I cook — for asking Google &#8220;what temperature is medium rare?&#8221; for the 37th time, starting timers without touching anything or for playing something from Hulu (read: &#8220;Bob&#8217;s Burgers.&#8221; Always &#8220;Bob&#8217;s Burgers&#8221;) when making a recipe I&#8217;ve made a million times before.

<p>I&#8217;ve been driving <em>way less</em> since the pandemic started. No commute/less socializing will do that.</p>
<p>The unexpected side effect? My podcast listening time plummeted. Turns out I really only listened to podcasts in the car or on the bus.</p>
<p>A few months back, though, I started listening to podcasts in the shower with one of these simple-but-solid JBL GO 2 waterproof speakers, and I love it. It takes me like four showers to get through an episode I used to listen to in one commute, but hey — I&#8217;m back to listening!</p>
<p>I tend to just throw this speaker in my bag and take it with me wherever; something I can&#8217;t say of the many, many Bluetooth speakers I&#8217;ve owned before it. It&#8217;s small, feels indestructible, the battery life is good enough that I don&#8217;t really worry about it and it&#8217;s loud enough to provide tunes at a picnic without annoying everyone else at the park.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The challenges facing the U.S. transportation system are plentiful and worsen each year. As demand on our nation’s roadways increases, so do safety, efficiency and sustainability issues.</p>
<p>The historic $1 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, one of the largest and wide-reaching infrastructure packages in decades, is a massive down payment on the investment needs of the nation and will unlock thousands of important projects in every state. But public funds alone, especially when allocated over a period of five years, are insufficient to keep pace with the emerging needs of our population, cities and the vehicles that travel the roads every day.</p>
<p>For example, the plan allocates $100 billion for repairing aging and dilapidated highways, bridges and roads. Unfortunately, the U.S. has underfunded its roadways for years, leaving 43% of our public roadways in poor or mediocre condition and resulting <a href="https://infrastructurereportcard.org/cat-item/roads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a backlog of $435 billion in road repair needs</a>. Even with public funds dedicated to repairing our roads, we’re still behind where we need to be.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247975" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The transportation infrastructure industry has historically been risk-averse and limited by the availability of public transportation funds. However, there are several historic examples of early technology networks that we all rely on to this day that have had dramatic impacts on the national economy. These projects were spurred by public investment, required local implementation by local public works agencies, and were largely delivered and maintained by private organizations.</p>
<p>Paved roads were introduced a little more than 100 years ago to support the early automobile. The interstate system has been known as the <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/interstate/homepage.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;greatest public works project in history&#8221;</a> since President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956. It’s a means of everyday travel, commerce and culture.</p>
<p>You wouldn’t be reading this article on a computer, tablet or smartphone screen without the benefits afforded by the national power grid, cable and cell networks. As we rely upon, trust and relinquish more of our lives to technology, a growing number of transportation researchers and smart infrastructure providers are embracing creative new methods of improving safety, efficiency and sustainability.</p>
<p>There are more than 4 million miles of public roadways crisscrossing the United States. Smart roads are an obvious, accessible solution to transform infrastructure for the next generation of vehicles, people and cities. Too often we invent new technology to improve old technology. Transforming roads into networks is a solution that <em>enables</em> technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By transforming roads into a data and communications platform, we can collect anonymous data brick-and-mortar stores can use to have the same level of insight for vehicle traffic as online retailers get from internet traffic. Online retailers are informed about their customers’ demographics, shopping and buying habits, market trends and traffic patterns because traffic data is automatically and passively collected because of internet infrastructure and services.</p>
<p>Comparatively, brick-and-mortar stores essentially know nothing about their customer base. The entrepreneur invests millions into the local economy after spending months finding and fitting out a location, stocking and staffing it, all before a single transaction can be made. The anonymous data collected from roadways can help business owners improve their operations and enable traditional retailers to remain competitive with online retailers.</p>
<p>If we leverage these smart infrastructure services, roads can pay for themselves by relying on the cash flow from these new capabilities — much like cell and internet infrastructure markets have been mostly self-supporting. This means some public roads can be sustainably financed and self-funding, which allows cities to shift their limited budgets away from roads and toward other community needs.</p>
<p>The infrastructure plan’s $65 billion for broadband access would aim to improve internet services for rural areas, low-income families and tribal communities. The plan’s $7.5 billion allocated for electric vehicle charging stations aims to accelerate electric vehicle adoption to help curb climate change and reduce the nation’s dependence on oil.</p>
<p>If smart roads offered a menu of capabilities, including 5G wireless access and wireless EV charging, designed from the outset to be software-upgradeable, our nation’s road networks would be able to keep pace with evolving technology. Roads are already available in rural areas, so there&#8217;s no need to construct new cell towers. Embedding the roads with wireless EV charging capabilities would eliminate the need for charging stations to follow a gas station model — in fact, EV owners and drivers wouldn’t have to pull off the road and plug in to charge at all.</p>
<p>Assessing fees for the use of the commercial services delivered via these roadways &#8212; whether for communication services paid for by network operators, EV charging and navigation paid for by the vehicle owners, or data services paid for by the businesses that use them &#8212; enable smart roads to pay for themselves by relying on the cash flow from these new capabilities.</p>
<p>The main challenge to the adoption of smart roads is that public owners have gotten into the mindset that they cannot, and should not, take risks with public money. Historically, public money is risk capital and the first money in on these opportunities. We must get public owners out of this risk-free mindset and battle the idea that public agencies cannot or should not enable economic development through infrastructure.</p>
<p>Putting public investment into infrastructure opportunities that enable massive economic development is how we got paved roads 100 years ago and interstates 60 years ago. Therefore, it’s an approach that’s already been vetted and with some notable proof points that Americans are using every day. These aren&#8217;t new ways of doing things. These are old ways of doing things we&#8217;ve done many times, packaged in an updated way for the emerging needs of society.</p>
<p>Another challenge is how prolonged public projects are compared to market activities. In the 18 months it takes a public agency to issue a road work permit, we can see an entire generation of software and hardware pass by but not a single shovel has hit the ground. The slow pace of public works means we must look far, far ahead. We can&#8217;t focus on short-term goals because those will be gone before the project leaves the design stage. Public works&#8217; scope, scale and speed (or lack thereof) means we must take an extremely long time horizon.</p>
<p>Investing in our nation’s roadways is key to growing a thriving economy and critical to our future. Today, cities face pressure to respond to urbanization, streamline traffic flow, reduce pollution and help improve safety.</p>
<p>Smart road technology helps city planners and governments address these challenges head-on. From traffic management to pedestrian and vehicle safety to environmental monitoring, the Internet of Things (IoT) is making roadways more intelligent, efficient and well managed.</p>
<p>The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is a first step to help tackle the current state of our nation’s infrastructure. How this investment is used will be the change-maker. If it is distributed to apply Band-Aid solutions on aging processes simply because it’s how things have been done in recent years, then the money will go fast and soon be forgotten without any meaningful improvements.</p>
<p>But suppose we use this investment as a down payment on innovative infrastructure projects. In that case, we have an opportunity to build the proper cadence of consistent and meaningful upgrades that progress toward a stronger future and allow emerging technologies to be integrated easier and at a faster rate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://sqream.com/">SQream</a>, a <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3835636,00.html">well-funded</a> Israel-based data analytics platform, today <a href="https://blog.panoply.io/panoply-has-joined-the-sqream-data-family">announced</a> that it has acquired no-code data platform <a href="https://panoply.io/">Panoply</a> in an effort to expand its cloud services.</p>
<p>At the core of SQream&#8217;s service is its GPU-centric &#8220;<a href="https://sqream.com/product/data-acceleration-platform/">data acceleration platform</a>,&#8221; which promises to speed up SQL queries and enable users to run their queries on more data. Panoply, on the other hand, offers its users a no-code data integration platform with support for over 300 different sources, which its users can then query in their favorite BI and analytics tools, or analyze using SQL queries in Panoply itself. In addition, Panoply also helps its users automate their data warehouse configurations. As such, it looks like the two platforms are quite complementary, with Panoply providing SQream with the tools and expertise to expand its platform to a wider user base.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a significant step towards implementing SQream’s vision to provide our customers with the fastest data analytics platform in the industry, at any scale of data for multi-size enterprises, and in any environment &#8212; cloud, on prem and on the edge,&#8221; said SQream co-founder and CEO Ami Gal. &#8220;With Panoply’s acquisition, we are combining SQream&#8217;s GPU-powered, cutting edge technology with Panoply’s phenomenal ease of use and seamless integration and onboarding. This is a huge milestone on our journey to provide the world with the new category of analytics platform that is ready for tomorrow’s data challenges.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248072" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Panoply raised $24 million in outside capital since its inception in 2015. Investors include the likes of Ibex Investors and C5 Captial, which led the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/panoply-raises-10m-for-its-cloud-data-platform/">$10 million round</a> in 2020, as well as Blumberg Capital, 500 Startups, FundersGuild and Intel Capital. The two companies did not disclose the price of today&#8217;s acquisition.</p>
<p>Panoply will continue to operate as a separate business unit, but as Panoply co-founder and CEO Yaniv Leven notes in today&#8217;s announcement, the acquisition means that the 160+ strong team will now have access to additional resources and expertise. SQream says it has &#8220;ambition growth plans&#8221; for the service in order to meet demand for the platform&#8217;s services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since our inception, we’ve taken a different approach to cloud analytics,&#8221; Leven. &#8220;We’ve made it our mission to transform the focus of cloud architecture from data-centric to information-centric, by focusing on the insights you can gain from your data, rather than just the technical process of moving and storing it. SQream’s focus on driving fast data insights echoes this mission. The synergy between SQream and Panoply holds great promise for data practitioners as it expands Panoply’s reach to a wider audience and provides Panoply’s advantages of automation, no-code and simplicity to larger and larger organizations.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Olist said it tripled its size in 2021 and closed on four acquisitions within the last year.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.olist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olist</a>, a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace integrator, confirmed it is now valued at $1.5 billion after securing $186 million in Series E funding, led by Wellington Management.</p>
<p>The new round follows quickly behind a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/goldman-sachs-leads-23m-in-funding-for-brazilian-e-commerce-startup-olist/">$23 million Series D extension</a> the company announced in April, led by new investor Goldman Sachs Asset Management to bring its total Series D financing to $80 million.</p>
<p>It was then we profiled Olist, which connects small businesses to larger product marketplaces to help entrepreneurs sell their products to a broader customer base. Its technology enables small merchants to gain market share across the country through a SaaS licensing model to small brick and mortar businesses.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248119" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Joining Wellington in the round were funds managed by SoftBank, Corton Capital, Valor Capital Group, Goldman Sachs, Globo Ventures and Kevin Efrusy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Olist said it tripled its size in 2021 and closed on four acquisitions within the last year, including social commerce startup Clickspace, logistics company PAX and VNDA and Tiny ERP, both offering commerce tools for small businesses.</p>
<p>“With more than 45,000 shopkeepers and retailers as clients, Olist has always been at the forefront of digital retail, long before the e-commerce hype that helped drive the search for our solutions,” said Tiago Dalvi, founder and CEO of Olist, in a written statement. “With this new round, we want to go beyond what we do today and deliver more and more value to our customers.”</p>
<p>In fact, the company wants to go beyond marketplaces, and the new capital will enable it to offer a fulfillment operation, set to open early next year, and financial services. Retailers on Olist already have access to credit lines for working capital, but the company plans to expand that technology to include risk management, accelerated sales and internal credit models for merchants.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company recently began operations in Mexico and intends to expand its footprint across Latin America next year.</p>
<p><em>Update, 12/15 at 10:50 a.m. PST: Olist errored in saying Wellington&#8217;s investment was its first contribution to a private company in Latin America.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.prellisbio.com/">Prellis Biologics</a>, a company developing the tools to create 3D printed organs, announced a $14.5 million Series B round on Wednesday. Prellis has spent years developing tissue engineering capacity, but has focused recently on developing one type of structure in particular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up until this point, Prellis </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/11/3d-printing-organs-moves-a-few-more-steps-closer-to-commercialization/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has focused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on 3D printing vascular scaffolds that would allow companies to grow healthy and oxygenated human organs (or miniature versions, called organoids) for drug testing, and eventually transplant. But the company has recently debuted a new product, called EXIS (short for Externalized Immune System): a lab-grown version of a human lymph node. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lymph nodes are critical parts of the human immune system – they store certain immune cells, and help the body manufacture immune responses. Ideally, those lymph node organoids would aid in drug development by mimicking how a person’s immune system might respond to new treatment. And, perhaps, help create some new drugs along the way. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247290" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By creating this immune system in a dish, we can actually test if those therapeutics are going to elicit an immune response before it goes into a human,” founder and CEO Melanie Matheu told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our company’s edge is that [EXIS] is out of the box fully human.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prellis Biologics, founded in 2016, has raised about $29.5 million to date. This Series B round was led by Celesta Capital and existing investor Khosla Ventures. In addition, the company will add Kevin Chapman, Celesta advisor and former CSO of Berkeley Lights, as Chief Scientific Officer. Yelda Kaya, formerly of J&amp;J Innovation, will join as Chief Business Officer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lymph node responses to drugs or pathogens</span><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.711307/full#h2"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been recognized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a way to predict how the whole immune system might react. Correspondingly, a number of academic labs working on developing in-vitro models of human lymph nodes – from l</span><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.711307/full#h3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ymph nodes on chips</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to growing lymphoid organoids from</span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01145-0#Sec10"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tonsil tissue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prellis has entered the fray by using its scaffolds to facilitate oxygen and nutrient exchange needed to grow functioning lymph node organoids. This method, Matheu says, allows Prellis to “replicate the human immune system outside the human.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This focus on the lymph node, in turn, opens up new angle for the company: antibody drug development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing new antibody treatments and predicting how they’ll work in clinical tests is becoming a more competitive space, and there are a few different approaches underway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some are computational. Nabla Bio, which just raised a $11 million, has used </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/nabla-bio-raises-11m-for-an-end-to-end-antibody-design-platform/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">natural language processing to design antibodies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Generate Bio, which just raised a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/generate-biomedicines-raises-370m-series-b-with-a-focus-on-protein-based-drugs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$370m Series B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has also used a machine learning approach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prellis’ approach is to model the immune system in miniature and develop a cadre of drug candidates by mining immune responses. Matheu calls it “natural intelligence” as opposed to artificial intelligence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company can create 1,200 organoids from one blood draw, challenge those immune systems with a particular antigen, and see what each immune system comes up with. That process, she says, can be done with different blood donors with different immune system characteristics to create a plethora of responses to analyze. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s very rare that all 10 of those people are going to come up with the same antibody solution to the problem of: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">does it bind this protein</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">? And so from a given human, we&#8217;re averaging anywhere from 500 to 2000 unique antibodies, and then you just multiply that by the number of people, and these are all target binding antibodies.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes about 18 days to go from blood draw to “antibody library,” per materials provided by Prellis Biologics. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2247300" style="width: 1536px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2247300" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2247300 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-3.png" alt="" width="1526" height="329" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-3.png 1526w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-3.png?resize=150,32 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-3.png?resize=300,65 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-3.png?resize=768,166 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-3.png?resize=680,147 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-3.png?resize=50,11 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1526px) 100vw, 1526px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2247300" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Prellis Bio</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matheu says the company has developed antibodies responsive to SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (these results haven’t been published). It has also entered into partnership with five drug companies, though Matheu declined to name which ones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use this round to move from an R&amp;D driven company to a product focused one – which means developing more drug partnerships, and demonstrating the platform’s capability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The major marker of success, she says, would be to bring an antibody treatment into the clinic. That may occur through collaboration with a pharmaceutical partner, though the company hasn’t ruled out creating a drug pipeline of its own. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matheu is light on specifics, but says Prellis is developing “internal technology” that would support a therapeutic pipeline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will say, we will move in that direction as the technology develops,” she said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When COVID-19 closed down most of society in 2020, Kian Sadeghi, like many of his then-classmates at the University of Pennsylvania, found himself holed up in his bedroom. He prefers it that way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During those months at home in Brooklyn, Sadeghi filled eight spiral notebooks with research on genetic sequencing, computer science and statistics. The result was the formation of Nucleus Genomics (still listed as a “stealth” startup on his LinkedIn, as of writing), which he has dropped out of Penn to pursue full time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nucleus’ Genomics pitch, per Sadeghi, provides a fresher take on genomic analysis. Users can upload their genetic information obtained through an established company, like 23andMe or Ancestry, or order a genetic testing kit. Then the company’s “proprietary algorithms” will calculate polygenic risk scores – measure of disease risk based on analysis of genetic variants – and display them in a user-friendly platform. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245657" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The thesis is a human genome on every iPhone,” Sadeghi told TechCrunch. “So we combine genetic and non-genetic information to eventually calculate the absolute risk scores for people for disease.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nucleus announced a $3.5 million seed round on Tuesday led by Founders Fund. The round includes participation from Adrian Aoun (CEO at Forward Health), Patrick Hsu (Professor at UC Berkeley and co-inventor of CRISPR), Brent Saunders (former CEO at Allergan), Matteo Franceschetti (CEO at Eight Sleep), Joshua Browder (CEO, DoNotPay), Cory Levy, Adam Guild, Pareto Holdings, Pomp, Shrug, Ankur Nagpal, Quiet Capital, Salt Fund, Bluewatch Ventures, Night, and Brandon White. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The background behind Nucleus Genomics is the idea that people will be eager to know more about their genomes. And that they’ll want to learn how to actually interpret that information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadeghi clearly has this interest himself. He traces the ideological origin of his company to the premature death of a cousin from long QT syndrome, which in some cases, is genetically linked. He then started to experiment with genes on his own at Brooklyn-based Genspace, a community biology lab. (He was featured in a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Journal </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">story on </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/diy-gene-editing-fast-cheapand-worrisome-1488164820"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DIY CRISPR enthusiasts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadeghi’s interest in genetics is shared by others. Direct-to-consumer genetic testing initially spawned a subculture of people who have uploaded their genetic information to services like </span><a href="https://www.gedmatch.com/how-it-works"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GEDMatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has been used to help people find lost relatives, or under controversial circumstances, </span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/11/22/how-your-family-tree-could-catch-a-killer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solve cold cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But direct-to-consumer genetic testing has truly exploded in recent years. In 2013 fewer than </span><a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2018/06/DTC_graph.png"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people ordered consumer genetic tests. </span><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/02/12/145676/2017-was-the-year-consumer-dna-testing-blew-up/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2018,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it was north of 12 million. By 2021, </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-11-04/23andme-to-use-dna-tests-to-make-cancer-drugs"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">reported that one in five Americans has turned over their genetic data to either 23andMe or a competitor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There could be more fuel left to burn in this fire. One 2018 poll run by the Associated Press NORC Center for Public Affairs Research </span><a href="https://reports.norc.org/issue_brief/genetic-testing-ancestry-interest-but-privacy-concerns/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suggested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as much as 54 percent of Americans had still heard little or nothing about genetic testing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadeghi&#8217;s pitch is many of those who have yet to embrace genetic testing are younger people. There’s some evidence to back this up, though not a huge amount. </span><a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/455006#T02"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2017 survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of about 1,600 DTC genetic test consumers (from 23andMe and Pathway), found that the average user was middle aged, white, and, most likely, a college educated female. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average age of a 23andMe user, </span><a href="https://mediacenter.23andme.com/press-releases/23andme-database-surpasses-100000-users"><span style="font-weight: 400;">per the company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s 2011 numbers, is 45. TechCrunch has reached out to 23andMe to confirm the age of their user base, but has not heard back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nucleus, he says, will aim to boil down genetic testing into user-friendly reports that will be distributed through “newfound distribution channels” – an effort to reach younger audiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can tap into a brand-new audience and introduce an entire generation to genetic testing, just as you could say Robinhood introduced an entire generation to the stock market,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nucleus, though, won’t necessarily rely on new users. It also aims to become a third-party platform, where people could upload their genomic data collected by other companies. There are already third-party platforms like impute.me (a nonprofit), and </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210312005140/en/Allelica-Raises-1.75-Million-in-Seed-Financing-to-Advance-Polygenic-Risk-Score-PRS-Analysis-into-Clinical-Practice"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allelica (raised 1.75 million in a recent seed round) </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that provides detailed information on clinical disease risk if users upload genetic information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within that landscape, Nucleus does offer a good incentive to upload: cash for the user. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nucleus will also be open to sharing genetic information with drug companies, says Sadeghi, if users opt-in to sharing their information. Should they choose to share genetic information through Nucleus they can earn a potential “dividend payment.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer data is already being shared anyway. 23andMe has </span><a href="https://blog.23andme.com/news/collaboration-with-gsk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">struck a deal </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with GSK to use genetic information for drug identification and research – only data from users who opt-in to this service is shared. (</span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-11-04/23andme-to-use-dna-tests-to-make-cancer-drugs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">23andMe and GSK</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> already have a cancer drug in </span><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/07/29/cancer-drug-first-therapy-to-emerge-from-23andme-glaxosmithkline-collaboration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clinical trials</span></a>.<span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In exchange for the genetic data they provide, which increasingly could be used to develop money-making drugs and other medical products, users get their own payout. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, the amount of that dividend payment is undecided, says Sadeghi. </span></p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013, 23andMe first debuted reports using genetics to predict health risk. But FDA asked the company to pump the brakes and issued </span><a href="https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/211831908-23andMe-and-the-FDA#:~:text=In%202013%2C%2023andMe%20received%20a,the%20agency's%20regulatory%20review%20process.&amp;text=23andMe%20will%20continue%20to%20seek%20FDA%20authorization%20to%20offer%20new%20reports."><span style="font-weight: 400;">a warning letter.</span></a> <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-allows-marketing-first-direct-consumer-tests-provide-genetic-risk-information-certain-conditions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company has received FDA approval for a </span><a href="https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/211831908-23andMe-and-the-FDA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">number of genetic tests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that quantify health risks for conditions like Parkinson’s or breast cancer, to name a few. A diabetes risk calculation test was debuted in 2019, but didn’t go through FDA approval because it was called a “wellness product”– </span><a href="https://medcitynews.com/2019/03/23andme-launches-new-diabetes-risk-test-but-experts-are-wary-of-its-benefit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sparking some criticism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over its utility.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">23andMe essentially hammered out the process of getting DTC tests and reports approved. And that has opened up the possibility of obtaining 510(k) premarket clearance for other genetic analysis algorithms, should they show equivalent accuracy. (</span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1804591/000119312521210858/d154309ds1.htm#tx154309_4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">23andMe was concerned about this exact process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and disclosed it as a risk factor in S-1 filings). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, Nucleus is still developing its polygenic risk score algorithms. Those are the company’s secret sauce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s extremely technical, extremely hard, extremely cutting edge,” Sadeghi said. But as for regulatory strategy, the company initially plans to go a route </span><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/10/15/ancestry-health-launch/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">once used</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Ancestry – order tests from a clinical network, rather than creating their own. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That does allow the company to sidestep FDA approval of its algorithms at first (this process is regulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid). But perhaps not for long. Eventually Ancestry <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/ancestrys-new-510k-clearances-point-toward-otc-consumer-genetic-health-risk-testing">pivoted</a> and applied for 510(k) market approval for its own DNA testing kit and genetic test. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When TechCrunch pointed this out in a followup email: Sadeghi said: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, in the future, we do seek to go that route.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, the company plans to launch sometime around January 2022 and has plans to grow the team from three to six or seven members. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s an imminent inevitability that every person has the human genome sequence,” said Sadeghi. “The question is who is actually going to respond to collect that data? I&#8217;m hoping that it&#8217;s going to be Nucleus.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MFB Fertility, the creator of a suite of at-home pregnancy-related hormone tests, announced a $9.7 million Series A round this week. The round follows several milestones for the company including an FDA premarket approval for a progesterone urine test and the rollout of a mobile app. It also gives the company more fodder to build towards its thesis: that at-home hormone testing can save both time, and stress related to &#8220;unexplained&#8221; infertility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MFB Fertility is more commonly known as Proov – the name of the test developed by owner and CEO Amy Beckley. Proov was founded in 2018, after Beckley had her own struggles with infertility and miscarriage. She found herself classified as “unexplained infertile.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Beckley’s case, a prescription solved her problem. But the Proov tests, she says, were created for women who also find themselves in the “unexplained” category of infertility diagnoses. </span><a href="https://journals.lww.com/obgynsurvey/Abstract/2014/02000/Definition_and_Epidemiology_of_Unexplained.17.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have estimated that somewhere between 15 and 30 percent of infertility diagnoses worldwide fall into that unexplained category. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246221" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s just a cop out,” Beckley told TechCrunch. “For a woman to go in and get all the tests and then come out on the other end, and it&#8217;s like, oh, yeah, you know, you&#8217;re unexplained infertile.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round was led by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hambrecht Ducera Growth Ventures. It includes participation from SteelSky Ventures, WCC Partners, Lightship Capital, GingerBread Capital, and Portfolia FemTech II Fund. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unexplained infertility can come down to any number of male or female factors. Proov&#8217;s flagship test is designed to rule out two problems: the status of ovulation – the process by which an egg is matured and released, and the readiness of the uterus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you go to a doctor’s office, that doctor might perform a blood test for </span><a href="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/progesterone-test/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">progesterone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a hormone that helps ready the uterus for pregnancy, and spikes after an egg is released. Proov has developed an at-home urine test to measure a metabolite of progesterone, PdG.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">External research has validated PdG as a marker of ovulation. </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5689497/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One 2017 review paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notes that measuring urine PdG levels over three days was accurate when it came to confirming ovulation, but that no point of care tests using this method had been developed yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We developed the first and only FDA- cleared way to measure this at home through urine to understand what we call ovulation quality: is the uterus optimally prepared to have the highest chance of conception?” said Beckley. “We invented it. I literally was the first person to ever have this technology.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proov has gone through the process of getting the PdG test evaluated and approved by the FDA. It received 510(k) clearance in </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf19/K191462.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">February 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because its results were substantially similar to progesterone tests (not direct to consumer) that already exist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proov’s own clinical trials have suggested that progesterone (and PdG) can also be useful markers of other pregnancy outcomes. The data has yet to be published, but Proov reported data from </span><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05033366"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one trial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on 54 pregnant women suggesting that women who had two days or more of negative PdG tests during a critical window of time saw increased rates of miscarriage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That data is reported in a </span><a href="https://www.change.org/p/american-college-of-obstetricians-and-gynecologists-updated-guidance-for-the-use-of-progesterone-to-prevent-miscarriage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">change.org petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> run by the company. The petition is in response to </span><a href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(19)32762-0/fulltext"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggesting progesterone therapy only be given to women who have already had miscarriages (the company argues that certain tests could also used as impetus for progesterone therapy).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PdG tests, though, aren’t the only thing Proov has been up to. The company’s newest product is a “complete” testing product that will provide tests for PdG, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and an estrogen marker. And, it’s rolled out a mobile app to help users interpret those tests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app itself is an entry point for more detailed information. Users can submit photos of multiple test strips, which then yield numerical scores detailing certain hormone levels. Those scores are produced via “machine-learning and back-end algorithms,” says Beckley. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the month, the app will provide an ovulation score, says Beckley. Though, critically, the app does more than just provide a number. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offering a test or even a score on its own, she said, led to frustration with users. “Literally, they were writing on our Facebook: ‘I hate this, because I don’t know what to do with a negative result,” Beckley explained.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response the app allows patients to share their results with doctors, speak with experts and also receive certain lifestyle tips (like exercise or nutrition) that might go on to improve progesterone levels through the app. The company is also currently building a supplement platform that would be integrated with the app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The takeaway, per Beckley, is that testing alone isn’t enough. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have to take that information and gently give her that, but also give her solutions at the same time,” she said. </span></p>
<h3><b>General Trends </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few general trends playing in Proov’s favor. First, is the rise of at-home medical testing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Major diagnostics companies have already announced intent to expand from at-home COVID tests into other arenas. Quest Labs estimates that at-home consumer testing will become a <a href="https://www.medtechdive.com/news/quest-eyes-2b-dtc-testing-potential-to-capitalize-on-breakout-consumer-g/596609/">$2 billion dollar</a> industry by 2025. Robert Ford, CEO Of Abbott Labs, for example has also suggested that at-home COVID tests are</span><a href="https://www.medtechdive.com/news/abbott-quest-look-to-post-pandemic-home-testing-beyond-covid-19/599063/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “seeding” the idea of at-home tests </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">all over the country. If you’re getting used to taking at-home COVID tests, maybe you’ll become accustomed to at-home testing in general.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beckley too has noticed diagnostic company interest in Proov as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s a lot of the bigger kind of diagnostic companies that are the most interested in what we&#8217;re doing,” she said. “Their market is doctors, hospital systems, payers. They don’t understand consumers and what’s buying behavior, so they’re leaning into direct-to-consumer companies like us, that market directly to women.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fertility testing too – for both men and women – has </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/19/parenting/fertility/fertility-startups-kindbody.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proved to be</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/its-a-new-era-for-fertility-tech/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">especially active area</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for startups and investors since about 2019. Crunchbase’s numbers reported an </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/vc-startups-investment-fertility-services-birthrate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">89 percent increase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in funding for fertility startups between 2020 and 2021, suggesting that the trend is still going strong. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://kalendar.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kalendar AI</a>, a San Francisco-based startup that&#8217;s been building on top of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPT-3</a>&#8216;s language model &#8212; developing a SaaS for automating lead generation and sales outreach to make it easier for companies to get initial meetings with prospective customers &#8212; has raised $3.2 million in pre-seed funding from 500 Startups; <em>The Lean Start</em>up author, Eric Ries; VC firms Village Global and Metaplanet; and 20+ angel investors (including CEOs of &#8220;popular&#8221; but undisclosed companies).</p>
<p>&#8220;Our AI technology writes personalized invitations to ideal customers with personalized decks &#8212; inviting them to take a meeting,&#8221; explains founder and CEO Ravi Vadrevu.</p>
<p>The SaaS was launched in February this year, although the startup itself &#8212; which is called Kriya Inc &#8212; was founded back in 2017 and had been bootstrapping prior to raising this pre-seed.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247999" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The idea for the b2b product is to automate the time-consuming and expensive process of sales outreach, including locating and pitching leads, as well as to offer tools to streamline and enhance initial sales meetings.</p>
<p>Kalendar AI claims to have amassed a database of 340M+ &#8220;ideal customer profiles&#8221; upon which it unleashes its AI sales rep bots to send &#8220;personalized&#8221; pitches (including &#8220;interactive presentations that convert into one-click meetings&#8221;) to likely looking customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our solution brings down the time to initiate a conversation to book an appointment from 7 days to 30 seconds from a sales perspective,&#8221; claims Vadrevu, who also argues there are big productivity wins from a marketing perspective vs other channels.</p>
<p>So where is Kalendar AI getting data on all those hundreds of millions of potential customers from?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have our own datasets that we built over years from publicly available information,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch, specifying that it uses Common Crawl, an open-source repository of the Internet, to collect &#8220;publicly available metadata information&#8221; and &#8220;form an index for searching&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We get all the available B2B company domains and the people associated to those domains (this information updates every quarter),&#8221; he goes on, adding: &#8220;We only engage people on their business email, and don&#8217;t store any personal information. We disclaim this in the footer of our every interaction that our technology predicted their business email in real-time using machine learning patterns.&#8221;</p>
<p>For &#8220;content narratives&#8221;, Vadrevu says the AI relies upon &#8220;real-time data services&#8221; such as the latest company news, company descriptions, current weather/events around a location, industry news, etc.</p>
<p>&#8220;We plan to increase such contexts by investing in content R&amp;D,&#8221; he further notes.</p>
<p>Asked if it&#8217;s using any data scraped from LinkedIn, Vadrevu claims not &#8212; arguing: &#8220;We don&#8217;t need LinkedIn profiles as we process names &amp; predict emails from publicly available domain/company metadata in real-time. LinkedIn is a personal network, and most business interactions usually happen, and more effective on a business email.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scraping LinkedIn is &#8220;not only unethical but it&#8217;s also unnecessary&#8221;, he adds when pressed for a confirm that Kalendar AI does not scrape the Microsoft-owned professional social network to enrich its database.</p>
<p>The SaaS is &#8220;nearing&#8221; its first 100 customers at this stage, per Vadrevu, who says the best markets for the product so far are technology, marketing &amp; advertising, IT &amp; Infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have customers ranging from a small team of 5 people to public companies like Upwork. However, most of our customers are digital media companies, startups, and new growth entrepreneurs building businesses on top of our platform,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve reached $1M in ARR revenue in the last three months, consistently maintaining a 60% month-over-month growth,&#8221; he also tells us, specifying that the new funding will mostly go toward building out the engineering team and improving the product.</p>
<p>&#8220;Currently [we&#8217;re] focused on forming an engineering growth team responsible for optimizing our algorithms to ensure the engagement is pleasant, effective, and efficient for all of our customers and the recipients.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, it doesn&#8217;t require a ghost in the machine to tell you that while AI can be a powerful productivity tool it can also be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/07/here-are-a-few-ways-gpt-3-can-go-wrong/">terribly hit-and-miss</a>.</p>

<p>And even if the claimed &#8220;personalization&#8221; of sales pitches is spot on target, receiving an automated sales pitching might risk a potential customer feeling, well, roundly unimpressed at the robotic cold call. Or &#8212; to put it another way &#8212; like they just got spammed. So a pitch-by-robot might be all too easy to ignore.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very hard problem and we don&#8217;t please everyone yet,&#8221; admits Vadrevu. &#8220;We have a 2% error rate that sometimes creates unpleasant experiences where we created channels for people to directly give us feedback and let them opt-out of our platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;What surprises us by being transparent is that more people are considerate about helping businesses than we thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we become successful, the beauty of AI eventually empowers businesses &amp; individuals connecting in many ways beyond sales like how we call connect today,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;We&#8217;re still very early and are grateful for our investors who&#8217;re supporting us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s ultimate goal for is the product is to be able to provide a fully end-to-end SaaS for sales outreach and meetings (including videoconferencing and CRM), not just fancy personalized pitches that its AI sales bots fire out at inhuman speeds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our vision is to build an ecosystem around the appointments we set, including video conferencing, CRM, etc., to improve the quality of the meetings,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;The immediate impact of such technology is on sales (revenue autopilot), which otherwise involves heavy marketing &amp; sales processes to achieve. The adjacent markets for such a technology could also be recruiting, job search, etc., which is not our focus,&#8221; Vadrevu also suggests.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s own sales pitch for its SaaS is that it can radically reduce the time and cost of booking &#8220;a high quality meeting that directly impacts revenue<span style="color: #0e101a;">&#8220;. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">But of course the b2b product is certainly not free.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">A &#8220;basic plan&#8221; starts at </span>$2,000/m for 20 &#8220;AI authors&#8221; (booking an estimated range of 20 meetings per month; since its fee is pay-per-meeting), according to Vadrevu.</p>
<p>While a &#8220;Scale plan&#8221; starts at $4,000/m for 50 AI authors (booking an estimated range of 40 meetings pm).</p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Vadrevu argues this pricing puts the product &#8220;</span>on the cheaper side&#8221; vs other tools companies would be using to try to lock in leads, suggesting b2b companies&#8217; customer acquisition costs for a single meeting range from $150 to $2,000 (i.e. &#8220;using Google SEM, digital marketing, sales tools, etc to get the same ROI&#8221;).</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re making it cheap for our customers by bundling meetings into SaaS,&#8221; he further argues. &#8220;At scale, we might get into a price per meeting prediction but we saw that SaaS is ideal for our customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the competitive front, <span style="color: #0e101a;">Vadrevu claims Kalendar AI is breaking new ground &#8212; and that &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">no one else is doing what we are doing until now as it&#8217;s incredibly hard&#8221; &#8212; emphasizing that development covers product iterations on content personalization with real-time feedback loops; AI-powered matching that needs to be adequately accurate, safe and not (so) spammy; as well as compliance with variable data regulations &#8212; hence why it took the startup three years to push the button on a market launch.</span></p>
<p>But pressed to name some startup competition, he says that for the personalized outbound messaging component there are AI copywriting tools such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/gpt-3-powered-copy-ai-raises-2-9m-in-a-round-led-by-craft-ventures/">Copy.ai</a>; while for inbound decks he suggests it&#8217;s<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> competing with scheduling pages such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/sales-scheduling-platform-chili-piper-raises-33m-series-b-funding-led-by-tiger-global/">Chili Piper</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/how-calendly-is-building-a-platform-by-turning-scheduling-into-a-center-stage-event/">Calendly</a>, and &#8220;any other inbound marketing funnel tools&#8221;. </span></p>
<p>Still, Kalendar AI&#8217;s wider pitch is that it&#8217;s going further by using AI to join up a bunch of manual sales and marketing work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Currently for b2b companies, there&#8217;s marketing and sales working separately to book appointments. But it takes a lot of manual effort to reach a consistent number of meetings every month on autopilot,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;Our approach leverages personalized sales outreach, coupled with interactive inbound (decks with one-click meetings; we might patent it) bringing down the cost &amp; time to book a high quality meeting that directly impacts revenue<span style="color: #0e101a;">.&#8221;</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ample co-founder John de Souza shared the merits of a B2B GTM strategy, how to create a fun and functional company culture and what it takes to go after the idea most people say won't work.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The odds are against San Francisco-based electric vehicle battery swapping company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/ample-raises-160m-to-scale-its-battery-swapping-service/">Ample.</a> Other companies have tried to build a business on exchanging dead batteries for fresh ones to solve the problem of long EV charge times: Fourteen years ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/from-the-ashes-of-nearly-a-billion-dollars-ample-resurrects-better-places-battery-swapping-business-model/">Better Place</a> raised nearly a billion dollars to do what Ample&#8217;s doing, and it ended up declaring bankruptcy.</p>
<p>But that was more than a decade ago, when EVs weren&#8217;t sufficiently advanced —or plentiful — to make the business model work.</p>
<p>That didn&#8217;t deter Ample co-founder John de Souza. Born and raised in Ethiopia to a Greek/Ethiopian mother and a Portuguese/Indian father who found ways to send him and his siblings to school despite their poverty, his family relocated to Dubai when the Ethiopian Civil War started in the 1970s. After emigrating, de Souza finished out high school before heading to the United States at 16 to attend university under a full scholarship.</p>
<p>Since then, he has founded multiple companies, including fintech company Smartleaf, internet startup Flash Communications and consumer health platform MedHelp, where his current co-founder, Khaled Hassounah, served as CTO. Both de Souza and Hassounah come from immigrant backgrounds, which de Souza said affords them with that creative entrepreneurial mentality.</p>
<p>Neither co-founder had previous experience in the energy sector, but by 2018, both co-founders saw an opportunity in the EV market. The only problem was that it would be difficult to get people to convert to EVs when the technology, at least from a refueling UX perspective, was much worse than the status quo.</p>
<p>Many investors didn&#8217;t last five minutes into an Ample pitch because they could still see the smoldering ruins of Better Place, but de Souza and Hassounah raised upward of $275 million to solve for the limitations of plug-in charging.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/ev-battery-swapping-startup-ample-charges-up-operations-in-japan-nyc/">Ample has partnered with Sally</a>, an EV rental company that offers ride-hailing, taxi and last-mile deliveries, along with Uber and Eneos, a Japanese petroleum and energy company. The company&#8217;s path to market relies on contracts with fleets wherein Ample&#8217;s battery chemistry-agnostic modular battery packs can be swapped into and out of any vehicle. Ample already has deployed seven swapping stations in the Bay Area for participating Uber drivers and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/ample-is-the-ev-battery-industrys-newest-unicorn/">plans to launch in Europe</a>, starting with Madrid next year. Depending on COVID-19 border restrictions, Ample is also targeting late next year to start building stations in Japan.</p>
<p>We sat down with de Souza to discuss the merits of a B2B go-to-market strategy, how to create a fun and functional company culture and what it takes to go after an idea most people say won&#8217;t work.</p>
<p><em>The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><b>You have a track record of founding quite a few companies that span communications, fintech, health tech and now EV battery swapping. A couple of your companies did end up being acquired, so are you planning on sticking it out with Ample? Or are you already thinking about your next startup?</b></p>
<p>Well, it’s not just me, because I have my co-founder and you need to be in sync about what you’re doing. So firstly, I would recommend to any founder, it’s so much better doing it with somebody else than doing it on your own. And it’s easy to be friends with somebody you’ve worked with, but working with a friend is much harder because you may not be friends for long. But I think as we went into this, we’re not thinking about the exit. You go into it assuming it’s going to be a long journey, then it will be a fun journey.</p>
<p>To create something takes time. You need to go through the process, and as long as you’re creating value, you actually want to see the realization. I feel when you jump into it just to quickly create and sell, it&#8217;s not as much fun and it shows in the company culture. People spend so much time at the company that they need to enjoy being there, so if you’re a company where people love Fridays and hate Mondays, then you’re at the wrong company; it’s time to move on.</p>
<p><b>You don’t seem to have any competition in the EV swapping space. Maybe it’s not such a great idea if no one else is trying to solve the problem in the same way.</b></p>
<p>My co-founder and I connected on this idea of doing things that are very improbable, but possible. You just need to find a potential path. If everybody says, &#8220;Oh yeah, this is gonna happen,&#8221; it&#8217;s too late for us. We know it&#8217;s the right time and it&#8217;s possible there&#8217;s a path, but most people are saying this will never work. That doesn&#8217;t discourage us, because it’s clearly in that sector of low probability, and that’s a sector we’re most comfortable in.</p>
<p><b>Better Place tried and failed. Why do you think your company will be successful?</b></p>
<p>We did a lot of research on electric cars before starting this and found electric cars go back a century. One of the reasons people went over from electric to gas was everybody was building specific batteries for each type of car, but gas was possible to use in any car, and that became very convenient. So now with EVs, we’re asking people to go from something very convenient to something that’s exceedingly inconvenient.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is joining other tech giants by lowering its cut of developer revenue generated by voice apps, known as Alexa skills, which run on Amazon&#8217;s smart speakers and other Alexa-powered devices. The company this week <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2021/12/announcing-updated-benefits-to-help-developers-make-more-money-with-alexa">announced</a> it would next year reduce its commission from 30% to 20% for Alexa skill developers who earn less than $1 million in revenue through things like Skill purchases (paid installs), in-skill purchases (the Alexa equivalent of in-app purchases) and skill subscriptions.</p>
<p>The changes will go into effect starting in the second quarter of 2022, and will be joined by an expansion of developer benefits designed to help third-party developers generate traffic and increase their skills&#8217; visibility. Amazon says developers who generate less than $1 million in the previous calendar year, as well as new Alexa developers, will be eligible for the new program.</p>
<p>The update to Amazon&#8217;s commission structure for Alexa developer revenue follows similar moves made by other tech giants, including Apple, Google, and Microsoft.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247966" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Just over a year ago, Apple responded to the increased regulatory scrutiny of its App Store business by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">dropping its commission rate to 15%</a> for small businesses developers with under $1 million in App Store revenues over the course of a year. Previously, those developers had to pay Apple&#8217;s standard 30% commission. Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/google-play-drops-commissions-to-15-from-30-following-apples-move-last-year/">soon followed suit</a> with a similar program for Google Play which lowered its cut to 15%, with a slight differentiation as to how it calculated when the lowered commissions would apply. Both companies have since gone on to carve out further exceptions to their standard commission rates for select categories of apps, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-lowers-commissions-on-in-app-purchases-for-news-publishers-who-participate-in-apple-news/">news publishers</a> and other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/google-lowers-play-store-fees-to-15-on-subscriptions-apps-as-low-as-10-for-media-apps/">subscription apps.</a></p>
<p>In addition, Microsoft this year <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/">updated</a> its revenue share terms to more favorable rates, with an 85/15 revenue split for app developers using its payments platform and an 88/12 split for game developers.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s Alexa platform, however, isn&#8217;t quite in the same category as these other, larger app ecosystems.</p>
<p>While the company had originally planned for a voice app catalog to rival any other app store, the reality is that few developers have been able to capitalize on Alexa&#8217;s <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-maintains-big-lead-google-apple-u-s-smart-speaker-market-new-study-says/">sizable</a> footprint in U.S. consumers&#8217; homes to create profitable businesses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In fact, Amazon has struggled over the years with skill discovery, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/shopping-via-smart-speakers-is-not-taking-off-report-suggests/">studies found that</a> Alexa device owners largely used their smart speakers and screens for their built-in functions &#8212; like controlling smart home devices, playing music, making shopping lists, setting timers, listening to news and getting quick updates on things like the weather or sports scores, for example. Even voice-based shopping, which Amazon had hoped would take place through Alexa devices, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-reality-behind-voice-shopping-hype">never fully took off.</a></p>
<p>In other words, Amazon&#8217;s adjustment to its commission rates can&#8217;t be viewed in the same light as the changes to other app stores&#8217; policies. While, to some extent, Amazon likely feels pressure to follow market trends, it clearly also hopes that lowered commissions could incentivize Alexa developers to build for its platform.</p>
<p>In the same announcement, Amazon also said it will roll out more benefits designed to increase developers&#8217; potential revenue under the new program that begins next year. These additional perks could be worth &#8220;up to an additional 10 percent&#8221; of a developer&#8217;s potential revenue, Amazon noted. The benefits will include incentive programs, personalized feedback to help developers optimize their skills, help identifying monetization opportunities, and more.</p>
<p>Amazon has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/16/amazon-begins-rewarding-top-performing-alexa-skill-developers-with-direct-payments/">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/30/amazon-will-now-directly-pay-top-alexa-kid-skill-developers-in-the-u-k-and-germany/">tried</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/28/amazon-will-now-pay-alexa-developers-for-top-performing-skills-for-kids/">direct</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/amazon-expands-program-that-pays-developers-for-top-voice-apps-to-france-italy-spain/">payments</a> for top skill developers over the years. It&#8217;s unclear for now if the new incentives will be different, or just more of the same. Amazon said it will share more details about the program closer to its launch next year.</p>
<p>The company over the past year, has tried to bring back interest in skill development, by introducing<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/amazon-aims-to-inject-new-life-into-alexa-with-huge-release-of-developer-tools-and-features/"> more opportunities</a> to make Alexa skills profitable. It <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2021/08/developers-can-now-start-building-alexa-paid-skills-in-the-us">launched</a> <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/paid-skills/overview.html">Paid Skills,</a> where consumers pay upfront to access the add-on voice app, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/amazon-aims-to-inject-new-life-into-alexa-with-huge-release-of-developer-tools-and-features/">introduced</a> Alexa Shopping Actions to allow developers to sell from Amazon.com within their skill (and earn affiliate income), expanded access to in-skill <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/alexa-in-skill-purchasing-which-lets-developers-make-money-from-voice-apps-launches-internationally/">purchases</a> to more international developers, and <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/hosted-skills/build-a-skill-end-to-end-using-an-alexa-hosted-skill.html">reduced the cost of hosting skills</a> to nearly $0.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The crease, it seems, is unavoidable. It’s right there, smack in the middle of the those big, expensive folding displays. And it’s invariably (and perhaps understandably) the first comment on nearly every story I post about a foldable phone. The alternative isn’t ideal, either &#8212; a gap between two distinct displays à la Microsoft’s Surface Duo.</p>
<p>The “N” in Oppo’s new Find N foldable doesn’t stand for “no crease,” exactly, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22837149/oppo-find-n-hands-on-announcement-specs-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all reports</a> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/oppos-find-n-foldable-takes-on-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thus far</a> point to a reduction of that being among the biggest aesthetic complaints revolving around the first few generations of foldables. It is, according to Oppo, &#8220;up to 80% less noticeable” than on standard foldables. Crease detection is, of course, in the eye of the beholder, but more than anything, it depends on how the light hits the screen.</p>
<p>But either way, the crease has been a kind of nagging nuisance &#8212; far more than the notch &#8212; in the fact that it cuts right down the center of the screen. What’s notable here is how much work Oppo has been putting in behind the scenes. The company decidedly did not rush this thing to market. It reportedly comes on the tail of six generations of internally developed prototypes as part of a project the hardware maker has been operating since 2018.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247979" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The whole of the foldable landscape has decidedly been a mixed bag, thus far &#8212; with some of those failures self-inflected. The broad consensus is that Samsung was just too quick to market with its first foldable, though subsequent generations have made the product much more viable for consumer usage. There’s nothing mainstream about them yet (sorry Samsung), but they’ve undoubtedly come a long way, and the Galaxy Z Flip 3 is the first time I’ve seriously thought “I could use this phone” during the testing process.</p>
<p>Huawei’s original Mate X was promising the few times I had occasion to use it, but that, too, was sidelined when the company ultimately went back to the drawing board. And in the meantime, other, bigger issues than that have been plaguing the hardware maker. Meanwhile, Motorola’s first attempt at a foldable Razr was a flop, though it has managed to correct some of those mistakes with a second generation.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Oppo has avoided some of those pitfalls by waiting. Truth of the matter is, in this industry, being the first to something isn’t always an advantage. At a certain point in the process, you’re effectively doing widespread beta testing among early adopters. And while I sadly wasn’t at Oppo’s big show this week (though Rita’s been doing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/oppos-first-self-developed-chip-is-all-about-imaging-performance/">a splendid job covering it for us</a>), hands-ons have been complimentary with regards to the numerous things the company did right here.</p>
<p>At the very least, it’s easy to see Oppo got a lot right with the 18:9 aspect ratio in that &#8212; unlike other foldables &#8212; it looks like a phone when closed. It’s admittedly pretty thick when closed, but the hinge does a good job keeping the displays flush. At 7.1-inches, the screen falls short of the Fold 3’s 7.6-inches, though I suspect the former is large enough for most folks who feel compelled toward these devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s worth noting, too, that Samsung Display made the folding screen (though Oppo says it did a lot of proprietary work on top) &#8212; which means that, even if Oppo does well, Samsung still gets a cut. A rising tide lifts all boats, I suppose, assuming all of those boats happen to be largely comprised of Samsung components.</p>
<p>The rub here &#8212; and it’s a big one &#8212; is that this is a China-only device. The world’s largest smartphone market, it seems, is enough for Oppo. Of course, now that OnePlus has effectively <em>ahem</em> folded into Oppo, perhaps there’s some opportunity for synergy there. The brand <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/oneplus-tri-fold-foldable-phone-concept-shown-off-20211123/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has notably been toying around</a> with its own foldable concepts of late.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another travel startup that found itself scrambling to pivot as the COVID-19 pandemic took off is now announcing a huge round of funding after finding its feet and proving that it can grow, even under adverse circumstances. <a href="https://avantstay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AvantStay</a> &#8212; which has built a platform where it decorates and then lists properties owned by others for people to rent out for vacations or other short-term stays &#8212; has raised $160 million in a Series B round of funding. The company saw revenues grow tenfold in the last two years and its total number of properties balloon to over 1,000, and now it will use the new funding for expansion, specifically adding more properties to its platform; and to continue developing its technology as it expands into more aspects of the property rentals business.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tarsadia Investments and</span> <span class="s3">3L Capital (which led its Series A) co-led this round, with participation also from previous backers </span>Plus Capital, Bullpen Capital and Convivialite; new, strategic investors <span class="s3">Capital One,</span> Saluda Grade, Coller, Greenhawk, Stephen Pagliuca, Fred Tuomi, Jerry Coleman and Jay Mckee; and celebrity investors including Paul George and Shawn Mendes.</p>
<p>AvantStay&#8217;s basic premise is based around kitting out and then handling the rentals for high-end homes as a viable alternative, or even improvement on, the experience that a typical guest might have had in a five-star hotel; and it has harnessed technology in aid of that. The tools that it has built include Voyage, its proprietary operating system to manage properties; a concierge app to help its guests with services before, during and after stays; its front-end booking platform; and a recently launched real estate platform.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247902" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The concierge service is part of AvantStay&#8217;s strategy of complementing its rentals with as many amenities as guests might have in high-end hotels &#8212; and among its tech investment plans, it wants to continue extending the services that can be offered on it. The startup will also continue to evolve the real estate business, where it helps connect vacation property investors with properties, acting as the broker and then the sole agent for renting those homes out. (But to be clear, it does not own properties itself.)</p>
<p>Los Angeles-based AvantStay has been around since 2017 and had only raised $25 million in the last four years. In that context, this funding is significant &#8212; and large for a Series B &#8212; and underscores some of the traction the company has been having, especially at a time when vacationing all but ground to a halt. The company said that in the last two years it added more than 700 homes and 80 new destinations (some in part by way of six acquisitions that it has made in that time), and it grew revenues 10x.</p>
<p>In all, Sean Breuner, AvantStay&#8217;s CEO who co-founded the company with Reuben Doetsch (the CTO), said that 750,000 guests stay in its network of properties, with the average number per homes being seven guests. It&#8217;s currently not profitable, but it actually did tip into profitability during the pandemic, cutting lots of costs and also shifting to longer-term rentals aimed at corporates.</p>
<p class="p3">Airbnb has created and leads the market for private home accommodation &#8212; and it happens to be one of 60 partners that AvantStay has secured for marketing the homes on its platform &#8212; but Breuner believes the opportunity to develop a business distinct from that, aimed specifically at the opportunity with higher-end properties, still has a lot of growth left in it in its own right, in part because there are still a lot of consumers and business travelers that have yet to accept that they could have an experience better than what they have at high-end hotels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Customers are starting to meet the demand from an experience perspective in rental homes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It has always lagged hotels by a wide margin. But the experience now matches the needs and requirements of what a guest is looking for.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Since we led AvantStay’s Series A investment over two years ago, we’ve watched the company not only grow their supply and revenue tenfold, but also navigate one of the worst possible macro shocks that occurred in the hospitality industry,” said Jodi Kessler, a partner at 3L, in a statement. “Their incredible execution and resilience, combined with a massive tailwind in the travel sector for AvantStay’s product makes us excited to double down on and support the team as they continue to build both a world-class hospitality brand for travelers, and a vertically integrated platform through which individuals and institutions can invest in short-term rental properties.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aurora&#8217;s self-driving trucks are hauling goods for Uber Freight customers in Texas as part of a multiphase commercial pilot that aims to more closely integrate the two companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the pilot was officially announced Wednesday, Aurora&#8217;s self-driving trucks, which always have two vehicle safety operators on board, have been working with Uber Freight for about a year, according to a spokesperson. The news marks a progression from those early tests to a formal commercial pilot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aurora is using the Uber Freight brokerage platform, which connects truck drivers with shippers that need cargo delivered, to haul freight for customers between Dallas and Houston. Aurora said it will expand routes as it adds more terminals. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247544" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hauling goods via the Uber Freight platform is notable. The real opportunity, which the companies also plan to do, is to integrate Aurora&#8217;s trucking subscription service into Uber Freight. The trucking subscription service called Aurora Horizon can be thought of as an overarching digital and logistics companion to the self-driving system. Under Aurora Horizon are several other products, including a mission control system that integrates with a carrier or network&#8217;s system and app to communicate dispatching and routing, monitor vehicle health and handle incident response and a roadside assistance program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aurora plans to launch its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/aurora-shines-spotlight-on-autonomous-truck-tech-strategy-ahead-of-spac-merger/">autonomous trucking business</a> by the end of 2023. If the pilot with Uber Freight succeeds, carriers with subscriptions to Aurora Horizon will be able to access Uber Freight to haul more goods. Aurora&#8217;s pitch is that this will improve efficiency for carriers and ensure trucking capacity isn&#8217;t underutilized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement Wednesday is also a reminder of Aurora and Uber&#8217;s close ties. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/">Aurora acquired Uber ATG</a>, the company&#8217;s self-driving unit, a year ago. As part of that complex deal, Aurora didn&#8217;t pay cash for Uber ATG. Instead, Uber handed over its equity in ATG and invested $400 million into Aurora, which gave it a 26% stake in the combined company. Aurora was privately held at the time, a status that changed in 2021 when it merged with a special purpose acquisition company. Aurora became a publicly traded company in November. </span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Uber Freight has been making its own moves. The logistics business, which spun out of Uber in 2018, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/uber-freight-acquires-transpace-for-2-25b/">acquired Transplace</a> for about $2.25 billion from private equity group TPG Capital earlier this year. The acquisition is part of Uber Freight&#8217;s aim to carve out market share in its existing markets and an expand into Mexico.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Almost three million Americans a year are denied a mortgage. Most don&#8217;t even know where to start or understand what would qualify them. The system has become complex and confusing, causing people to never make it onto the housing ladder at all. This is in contrast to the mortgage industry, which is leaving these people on the table by being geared only to those who are ready and qualified to buy, a relatively small percentage of those who&#8217;d actually like to.</p>
<p>Fintech startups like NerdWallet, Lower.com, Divvy and Landis have appeared in recent years trying to, for instance, make it easier to save for home loans. But there’s clearly plenty of room for more entrants, especially ones that can hand-hold consumers through the complex process.</p>
<p><a href="http://quo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quo</a> is a relatively new startup with what it claims is a fresh approach to homeownership. Its consumer-oriented app shows users where they are today in terms of their financial position and goes through what mortgage qualification criteria they need to hit in order to secure a home loan.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247556" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It has now raised $7.2 million in a seed funding round led by <a href="https://signalfire.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SignalFire</a>, with participation by Justin Mateen and current investors Soma Capital, Global Founders Capital and others.</p>
<p>Alongside that, it has also acquired Uncapped Mortgage, a licensed mortgage brokerage startup based out of Nashville, and re-branded it to QuoHome. QuoHome provides mortgage brokering services for Quo users once they are ready to buy.</p>
<p>The bulk of the new funding will be used to accelerate the growth of the QuoHome coaching app. Quo claims its users have amassed $200 million in home buying power and are working towards $1.2 billion in homes, growing at over 100% CMGR.</p>
<p>The Quo product works by connecting to your credit, savings and income information to build a financial profile. It then compares your information to mortgage underwriting guidelines to assess how much you can afford today and the bar you need to hit across credit, debt and savings to afford the home you want.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It then finds shortcuts for you to be able to afford a home faster, such as working out whicht debts you should pay off, versus saving that money for a down payment.</p>
<p>Quo was founded in 2018 by Tucker Haas and Neel Yerneni while they were seniors at Stanford University with the mission to make building wealth more equitable, starting with homeownership.</p>
<p>Haas says he grew up in a household that struggled with home financing for years after they got into economic problems.</p>
<p>“Having grown up in a low-income household, I had firsthand experience with a broken financial system. Quo is our way of driving at the mission of making building wealth more equitable,” he said. “Since launching the beta in June, our members now manage over $21 million in home savings with Quo and are building towards almost half a billion dollars in homes. With our $7.2 million in funding led by SignalFire, we’re proving there’s a more aligned and accessible way to approach this industry.”</p>
<p>Josh Constine of Signalfire commented: “I think the big trend here is economic uncertainty spurring a new wave of fintech for savings and homeownership as the middle-class tries to find some stability.&#8221;</p>
