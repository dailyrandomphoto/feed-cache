										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A US/Israeli startup, <a href="http://www.getsorbet.com">Sorbet</a> — which is tackling what companies do with the financial risks as employees accrue Paid Time Off (PTO) — has raised $6 million in a Seed funding round led by Viola Ventures, with participation by Global Founders Capital, Meron Capital.</p>
<p>The economics of Paid Time Off is relatively hidden in the business world, but essentially,<br />
Sorbet takes on the burden of this PTO from employers and then allows employees to spend it. This gives the employers far more control over the whole process and the ability to forecast its impact on the business.</p>
<p>Sorbet says that in the US, employees use only 72% PTO balances, even though it’s the most sought-after benefit. But this, effectively, comes out at 768 million unused days off a year, worth around $224 billion. This creates a difficult problem for CFO’s and accountants because its creates balance sheet liabilities on the company’s books, says Sorbet. If the employee doesn’t use all of their PTO, the employer can end up owing them a lot of money which creates a cash flow liability on the company’s books. So Sorbet buys out these PTO liabilities from employees, then loads the cash value of the PTO on prepaid Credit Cards for the employees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking to me on a call, CEO and cofounder Veetahl Eilat-Raichel, said: “We researched this whole idea of paid time off and found this huge, massive market failure and inefficiency around the way that PTO is constructed. It&#8217;s kind of one of those things where, on the face of it, there&#8217;s this boring bureaucratic payroll item that turns into a boring balance sheet item. But under it is a $224 billion problem for US businesses… If you think about it, employers are borrowing money from their employees at the worst terms possible and employees aren’t benefitting either. So everyone&#8217;s hurting here.”</p>
<p>She said: “Sorbet assumes the liability on ourselves and so then we can allow the company to control their cash flow and decide when they want to pay us back. They gain a lot of financial value because we are able to be very, very attractive on our funding. So it saves costs, it provides them with complete control of their cash flow, and it allows them to give out amazing financial benefits to employees at a time where we can all use some extra cash right now.”</p>
<p>The platform Sorbet has built will, it says, sync with calendars, HR, and payroll systems, identifies habits, and then proactively suggests personalized, pre-approved 3-6 hour “Micro Breaks”, 1-4 day “Micro Vacations” and +1 week Vacations. This, says the startup, increases PTO used by as much as 15%.</p>
<p>Employers can constantly renegotiate the terms of the loan with Sorbet, thus matching future cash flow, insulating themselves against salary raises (wage inflation), and take advantage of other benefits.</p>
<p>The cofounders are Eilat-Raichel, who previously worked at L’Oreal and Lockheed Martin, and a Fintech entrepreneur; Eliaz Shapira, co-founder and CPO; and Rami Kasterstein co-founder and board Member.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Conventional wisdom over the last year has suggested that the pandemic has driven companies to the cloud much faster than they ever would have gone without that forcing event with some suggesting it has compressed years of transformation into months. This quarter&#8217;s cloud infrastructure revenue numbers appear to be proving that thesis correct.</p>
<p>With The Big Three &#8212; Amazon, Microsoft and Google &#8212; all reporting this week, the market generated almost $40 billion in revenue, <a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/amazon-and-microsoft-maintain-their-grip-market-others-are-also-growing-rapidly">according to Synergy Research data</a>. That&#8217;s up $2 billion from last quarter and up 37% over the same period last year. Canalys&#8217;s numbers were slightly higher at $42 billion.</p>
<p>As you might expect if you follow this market, AWS led the way with $13.5 billion for the quarter up 32% year over year. That&#8217;s a run rate of $54 billion. While that is an eye-popping number, what&#8217;s really remarkable is the yearly revenue growth, especially for a company the size and maturity of Amazon. The law of large numbers would suggest this isn&#8217;t sustainable, but the pie keeps growing and Amazon continues to take a substantial chunk.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Overall AWS held steady with 32% market share. While the revenue numbers keep going up, Amazon&#8217;s market share has remained firm for years at around this number. It&#8217;s the other companies down market that are gaining share over time, most notably Microsoft which is now at around 20% share good for about $7.8 billion this quarter.</p>
<p>Google continues to show signs of promise under Thomas Kurian, hitting $3.5 billion good for 9% as it makes a steady march towards double digits. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/ibm-breaks-latest-revenue-losing-streak-as-cloud-revenue-shows-modest-growth/">Even IBM had</a> a positive quarter, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/red-hat-ceo-looks-to-maintain-double-digit-growth-in-second-year-at-helm/">led by Red Hat</a> and cloud revenue good for 5% or about $2 billion overall.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146138" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146138" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2146138" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image002-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Synergy Research cloud infrastructure bubble map for Q1 2021.

<p>John Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy says that even though AWS and Microsoft have firm control of the market, that doesn&#8217;t mean there isn&#8217;t money to be made by the companies playing behind them.</p>
<p>&#8220;These two don’t have to spend too much time looking in their rearview mirrors and worrying about the competition. However, that is not to say that there aren’t some excellent opportunities for other players. Taking Amazon and Microsoft out of the picture, the remaining market is generating over $18 billion in quarterly revenues and growing at over 30% per year. Cloud providers that focus on specific regions, services or user groups can target several years of strong growth,&#8221; Dinsdale said in a statement.</p>
<p>Canalys, another firm that watches the same market as Synergy <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-cloud-market-Q121">had similar findings</a> with slight variations, certainly close enough to confirm one another&#8217;s findings. They have AWS with 32%, Microsoft 19%, and Google with 7%.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146139" style="width: 591px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146139" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2146139" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3-1.png?w=581" alt="Canalys market share chart with Amazon with 32%, Microsoft 19% and Google 7%" width="581" height="327" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3-1.png 581w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146139" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Canalys</p></div></p>
<p>Canalys analyst Blake Murray says that there is still plenty of room for growth, and we will likely continue to see big numbers in this market for several years. &#8220;Though 2020 saw large-scale cloud infrastructure spending, most enterprise workloads have not yet transitioned to the cloud. Migration and cloud spend will continue as customer confidence rises during 2021. Large projects that were postponed last year will resurface, while new use cases will expand the addressable market,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The numbers we see are hardly a surprise anymore, and as companies push more workloads into the cloud, the numbers will continue to impress. The only question now is if Microsoft can continue to close the market share gap with Amazon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Machine learning is capable of doing all sorts of things as long as you have the data to teach it how. That&#8217;s not always easy, and researchers are always looking for a way to add a bit of &#8220;common sense&#8221; to AI so you don&#8217;t have to show it 500 pictures of a cat before it gets it. <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/dino-paws-computer-vision-with-self-supervised-transformers-and-10x-more-efficient-training">Facebook&#8217;s newest research</a> takes a big step towards reducing the data bottleneck.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s formidable AI research division has been working on how to advance and scale things like advanced computer vision algorithms for years now, and has made steady progress, generally shared with the rest of the research community. One interesting development Facebook has pursued in particular is what&#8217;s called &#8220;semi-supervised learning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Generally when you think of training an AI, you think of something like the aforementioned 500 pictures of cats — images that have been selected and labeled (which can mean outlining the cat, putting a box around the cat, or just saying there&#8217;s a cat in there somewhere) so that the machine learning system can put together an algorithm to automate the process of cat recognition. Naturally if you want to do dogs or horses, you need 500 dog pictures, 500 horse pictures, etc — it scales <em>linearly</em>, which is a word you never want to see in tech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Semi-supervised learning, related to &#8220;unsupervised&#8221; learning, involves figuring out important parts of a dataset without any labeled data at all. It doesn&#8217;t just go wild, there&#8217;s still structure; for instance, imagine you give the system a thousand sentences to study, then showed it ten more that have several of the words missing. The system could probably do a decent job filling in the blanks just based on what it&#8217;s seen in the previous thousand. But that&#8217;s not so easy to do with images and video — they aren&#8217;t as straightforward or predictable.</p>
<p>But Facebook researchers have shown that while it may not be easy, it&#8217;s possible and in fact very effective. The DINO system (which stands rather unconvincingly for &#8220;DIstillation of knowledge with NO labels&#8221;) is capable of learning to find objects of interest in videos of people, animals, and objects quite well without any labeled data whatsoever.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146017" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/segmentation-gif2.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146017" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2146017" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/segmentation-gif2.gif" alt="Animation showing four videos and the AI interpretation of the objects in them." width="800" height="483" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2146017" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>It does this by considering the video not as a sequence of images to be analyzed one by one in order, but as an complex, interrelated set,like the difference between &#8220;a series of words&#8221; and &#8220;a sentence.&#8221; By attending to the middle and the end of the video as well as the beginning, the agent can get a sense of things like &#8220;an object with this general shape goes from left to right.&#8221; That information feeds into other knowledge, like when an object on the right overlaps with the first one, the system knows they&#8217;re not the same thing, just touching in those frames. And that knowledge in turn can be applied to other situations. In other words, it develops a basic sense of visual meaning, and does so with remarkably little training on new objects.</p>
<p>This results in a computer vision system that&#8217;s not only effective — it performs well compared with traditionally trained systems — but more relatable and explainable. For instance, while an AI that has been trained with 500 dog pictures and 500 cat pictures will recognize both, it won&#8217;t really have any idea that they&#8217;re similar in any way. But DINO — although it couldn&#8217;t be specific — gets that they&#8217;re similar visually to one another, more so anyway than they are to cars, and that metadata and context is visible in its memory. Dogs and cats are &#8220;closer&#8221; in its sort of digital cognitive space than dogs and mountains. You can see those concepts as little blobs here — see how those of a type stick together:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146016" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fb-concepts.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146016" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2146016" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fb-concepts.gif" alt="Animated diagram showing how concepts in the machine learning model stay close together." width="620" height="604" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2146016" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>This has its own benefits, of a technical sort we won&#8217;t get into here. If you&#8217;re curious, there&#8217;s more detail in the papers linked in Facebook&#8217;s blog post.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also an adjacent research project, a training method called PAWS, which further reduces the need for labeled data. PAWS combines some of the ideas of semi-supervised learning with the more traditional supervised method, essentially giving the training a boost by letting it learn from both the labeled and unlabeled data.</p>
<p>Facebook of course needs good and fast image analysis for its many user-facing (and secret) image-related products, but these general advances to the computer vision world will no doubt be welcomed by the developer community for other purposes.</p>

<p>Regardless, the Equity team got together once again this week to not only go over the news of the week, but also to do a little soul searching. You see, some news broke yesterday, so we figured that we had to talk about it in our usual style. So, here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you want to buy TechCrunch? <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/verizon-explores-sale-of-media-assets-11619642003">Apparently you can</a>? Albeit probably along with a few billion dollars worth of other assets &#8212; whatever is left of Yahoo and AOL &#8212; you can now own an NFT. A non-fungible TechCrunch. What is ahead for us? We don&#8217;t know. So if you do know, tell us. Until then we&#8217;ll just yo-yo gently between panic and optimism, as per usual.</li>
<li>We also dug into the latest All Raise venture capital data, and <a href="https://allraise.org/assets/all-raise-annual-report-2020.pdf">the results were abysmal. </a></li>
<li>Next up was the news that fintech startups are setting records in 2021, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/?p=2145633&amp;preview=true">raising more capital than ever before</a>. That brought us to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/brex-raises-425m-at-a-7-4b-valuation-as-the-corporate-spend-war-rages-on/">the latest from Brex</a>.</li>
<li>And then there was a suspicious trend when three fintech companies focused on teen banking raised in one exhale. We talk <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/teen-banking-service-step-raises-100m-series-c-announces-steph-currys-investment/">Step</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/kids-focused-fintech-greenlight-raises-260m-in-a16z-led-series-d-nearly-doubles-valuation-to-2-3b/">Greenlight</a>, and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/mobile-bank-current-raises-220-million-series-d-triples-valuation-to-2-2b/"> Current.</a></li>
<li>Natasha talked about her last Startups Weekly post, in which she unpacked <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/24/what-the-masterclass-effect-means-for-edtech/">The MasterClass effect&#8217;s impact on edtech.</a></li>
<li>And to close, we discussed the latest cool-kid venture capital funds. Sure memes are cool, but did you know that they can help you raise a $10 million fund? They can!</li>
</ul>
<p>We are back Monday morning with our weekly kick-off show. Have a great weekend!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tapping the geothermal energy stored beneath the Earth&#8217;s surface as a way to generate renewable power is one of the new visions for the future that&#8217;s captured the attention of environmentalists and oil and gas engineers alike.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s not only a way to generate power that doesn&#8217;t rely on greenhouse gas emitting hydrocarbons, but because it uses the same skillsets and expertise that the oil and gas industry has been honing and refining for years.</p>
<p>At least that&#8217;s what drew former the former completion engineer (it&#8217;s not what it sounds like) Tim Latimer to the industry and to launch<a href="https://www.fervoenergy.com/"> Fervo Energy</a>, the Houston-based geothermal tech developer that&#8217;s picked up funding from none other than Bill Gates&#8217; Breakthrough Energy Ventures (that fund&#8230; is so busy) and former eBay executive, Jeff Skoll&#8217;s <a href="https://capricornllc.com/">Capricorn Investment Group</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With the new $28 million cash in hand Fervo&#8217;s planning on ramping up its projects which Latimer said would &#8220;bring on hundreds of megawatts of power in the next few years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Latimer got his first exposure to the environmental impact of power generation as a kid growing up in a small town outside of Waco, Texas near the Sandy Creek coal power plant, one of the last coal-powered plants to be built in the U.S.</p>
<p>Like many Texas kids, Latimer came from an oil family and got his first jobs in the oil and gas industry before realizing that the world was going to be switching to renewables and the oil industry &#8212; along with the friends and family he knew &#8212; could be left high and dry.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one reason why he started working on Fervo, the entrepreneur said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What’s most important, from my perspective, since I started my career in the oil and gas industry is providing folks that are part of the energy transition on the fossil fuel side to work in the clean energy future,&#8221; Latimer said. &#8220;I’ve been able to go in and hire contractors and support folks that have been out of work or challenged because of the oil price crash&#8230; And I put them to work on our rigs.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146120" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146120" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2146120" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tim-Latimer-at-Fervo-Operations-Site.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tim-Latimer-at-Fervo-Operations-Site.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tim-Latimer-at-Fervo-Operations-Site.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tim-Latimer-at-Fervo-Operations-Site.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tim-Latimer-at-Fervo-Operations-Site.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tim-Latimer-at-Fervo-Operations-Site.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tim-Latimer-at-Fervo-Operations-Site.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tim-Latimer-at-Fervo-Operations-Site.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tim-Latimer-at-Fervo-Operations-Site.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146120" class="wp-caption-text">Fervo Energy chief executive, Tim Latimer, pictured in a hardhat at one fo the company&#8217;s development sites.

<p>When the Biden administration talks about finding jobs for employees in the hydrocarbon industry as part of the energy transition, this is exactly what they&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p>And geothermal power is no longer as constrained by geography, so there&#8217;s a lot of abundant resources to tap and the potential for high paying jobs in areas that are already dependent on geological services work, Latimer said (late last year, <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/10/21/21515461/renewable-energy-geothermal-egs-ags-supercritical">Vox published a good overview of the history and opportunity presented by the technology</a>).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;A large percentage of the world’s population actually lives next to good geothermal resources,&#8221; Latimer said. &#8220;25 countries today that have geothermal installed and producing and another 25 where geothermal is going to grow.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>Geothermal power production actually has a long history in the Western U.S. and in parts of Africa where naturally occurring geysers and steam jets pouring from the earth have been obvious indicators of good geothermal resources, Latimer said.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="il">Fervo</span>’s technology unlocks a new class of geothermal resource that is ready for large-scale deployment. <span class="il">Fervo</span>’s geothermal systems use novel techniques, including horizontal drilling, distributed fiber optic sensing, and advanced computational modelling, to deliver more repeatable and cost effective geothermal electricity,&#8221; Latimer wrote in an email. &#8220;<span class="il">Fervo</span>’s technology combines with the latest advancements in Organic Rankine Cycle generation systems to deliver flexible, 24/7 carbon-free electricity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Initially developed with a grant from the TomKat Center at Stanford University and a fellowship funded by Activate.org at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab&#8217;s Cyclotron Road division, Fervo has gone on to score funding from the DOE&#8217;s Geothermal Technology Office and ARPA-E to continue work with partners like Schlumberger, Rice University and the Berkeley Lab.</p>
<p>The combination of new and old technology is opening vast geographies to the company to potentially develop new projects.</p>
<p>Other companies are also looking to tap geothermal power to drive a renewable power generation development business. Those are startups like Eavor, which has the backing of energy majors like bp Ventures, Chevron Technology Ventures, Temasek, BDC Capital, Eversource and Vickers Venture Partners; and other players including <a href="https://www.greenfireenergy.com/">GreenFire Energy</a>, and <a href="https://www.sagegeo.com/">Sage Geosystems.</a></p>
<p>Demand for geothermal projects is skyrocketing, opening up big markets for startups that can nail the cost issue for geothermal development. As Latimer noted, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">from 2016 to 2019 there was only one major geothermal contract, but in 2020 there were ten new major power purchase agreements signed by the industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For all of these projects, cost remains a factor. Contracts that are being signed for geothermal that are in the $65 to $75 per megawatt range, according to Latimer. By comparison, solar plants are now coming in somewhere between $35 and $55 per megawatt, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514902/solar-energy-cost-historic-low-energy-agency-outlook-2020">as The Verge reported last year</a>. </span></p>
<p>But Latimer said the stability and predictability of geothermal power made the cost differential palatable for utilities and businesses that need the assurance of uninterruptible power supplies. As a current Houston resident, the issue is something that Latimer has an intimate experience with from this year&#8217;s winter freeze, which left him without power for five days.</p>
<p>Indeed, geothermal&#8217;s ability to provide always-on clean power makes it an incredibly attractive option. In a recent Department of Energy study, geothermal could meet as much as 16% of the U.S. electricity demand, and other estimates put geothermal&#8217;s contribution at nearly 20% of a fully decarbonized grid.</p>
<p>“We’ve long been believers in geothermal energy but have waited until we’ve seen the right technology and team to drive innovation in the sector,” said Ion Yadigaroglu of Capricorn Investment Group, in a statement.  “Fervo’s technology capabilities and the partnerships they’ve created with leading research organizations make them the clear leader in the new wave of geothermal.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube, Snapchat, Twitter, TikTok and Facebook&#8217;s Instagram have upended the film and TV industries, with a new wave of cinematographers, directors and actors leveraging innovations in technology to create new work and connect directly with billions of consumers to see it. Today, a startup is announcing some funding as it looks to make a similar impact in the world of music.</p>
<p><a href="https://rapchat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rapchat</a>, an app that lets people create music tracks &#8212; raps, as its names suggest, or something else &#8212; using a platform that crowdsources beats and lets people put vocals on top of them, has raised $2.3 million.</p>
<p>Co-led by Sony Music Entertainment and NYC VC firm Adjacent, this is an extension to Rapchat&#8217;s seed round of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/23/rapchat-raises-1-6-million-to-help-you-make-and-share-your-def-jams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.7 million back in 2018</a>, and CEO and co-founder Seth Miller tells me it&#8217;s coming as the startup is getting ready for a bigger Series A.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With no connection to Snapchat &#8212; not now at least, except that founders Seth Miller and Pat Gibson did think it was a funny pun at the time that they were first conceiving of the company as a side hustle while still in university in 2015 &#8212; Rapchat has already gone quite some way in scaling.</p>
<p>The company today has some 7 million registered users, and at the moment some 250,000 songs are being created around a catalog of about 100,000 beats by 500,000 active users on the platform <em>each month</em>. Engagement is hovering right now at 35 minutes per day on average, a mix not just of people making tunes, but through the beginnings of a social graph: people coming onto the app to discover and share those tracks.</p>
<p>Rapchat plans to use the funding to continue expanding the scope of what you can create on its platform, including growing the prize pools for Rapchat’s ‘Challenges&#8217; competition series; expand to have more artists, producers, and industry executives on the platform for mentoring; and to extend that platform&#8217;s reach to integrate more deeply with the likes of TikTok, Snapchat, Spotify and Apple Music &#8212; platforms where creators are already making a lot of content, and where music is figuring strongly in that effort.</p>
<p>Rapchat&#8217;s growth not only speaks to how the startup has pulled off its ambition to make it easier to make music, but it also speaks to an appetite, an itch, in the creator economy: there is a big wide world of music-making out there, and more want to see if they can strike the right note.</p>
<p>Rapchat is definitely not the only, nor the first, company to think of how to address music creators within the bigger creator economy.</p>
<p>Another app called <a href="https://www.voisey.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Voisey</a> had conceived of a similar idea but focused primarily on letting people create and record shorter clips rather than full music tracks before sharing them to other platforms. It has not quite come a household name, but it did have some small success in bringing attention to new artists, and interestingly, it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/snap-acquired-voisey-an-app-to-create-music-tracks-overlaying-your-own-vocals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quietly acquired by Snap last year</a> (and for now Snap&#8217;s kept Voisey&#8217;s app up).</p>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s parent ByteDance has also made an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/23/it-looks-like-titok-has-acquired-jukedeck-a-pioneering-music-ai-uk-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisition of another music creation app, Jukedeck</a>. As with Snap&#8217;s acquisition, so far we&#8217;re not fully clear on how and where that acquisition is going, but we&#8217;ve heard through the grapevine that TikTok is working on a new music service that sounds like it might let more content get plugged into TikTok&#8217;s music layer, so perhaps watch this space.</p>
<p>And in perhaps the most trend-endorsing act of all, Rapchat has been cloned &#8212; by Facebook, no less. NPE, the social networking behemoth&#8217;s in-house skunkworks team, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/facebook-launches-bars-a-tiktok-like-app-for-creating-and-sharing-raps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in February rolled out BARS</a> (all caps! stand out!) &#8212; which is, yes &#8212; an app on which you can create your own rap music.</p>
<p>Miller, at least for now, is about as laid back as you could be, considering all of the above, confident that at least for now, he is very happy with the engagement Rapchat is seeing, including around tests it has been running around offering new premium features &#8212; the app is free to use right now, but it has plans to offer creators more production tools and better ways of sharing their work and helping build a business out of it. Key to that will be never demanding licensing fees on music: creators keep the royalties, with Rapchat&#8217;s value lying in helping them make and track how that music gets used with the metadata that it holds on those tracks.</p>
<p>Some of the low-key approach might well come from the fact that Rapchat and its founders are somewhat outside of the startup fray. The idea for the app first came up in 2013, Miller said, when he and Gibson were students at Ohio University in Columbus.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were coming of age when everyone in college was using apps like Snapchat and Instagram,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We loved them for video, but saw there was nothing like them for creating music. So we pitched the idea during a Startup Weekend competition: snapping like Snapchat but for rap. Someone said, &#8216;Rapchat&#8217; and we liked it.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">They went full-time on the idea in 2015 when they got into 500 Startups with the app, but even so it&#8217;s taken them years to build up the business, get attention from investors and raise money. Why? Partly because music is hard, and frankly the main game in town for years has been streaming services, rather than creation services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Miller and Gibson persisted: &#8220;</span>I knew that this market was huge. It just made so much sense to me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The advent of the mobile devices the moment that apps like Instagram, VSCO and Snapchat have turned people into photographers and video makers, and Substack is turning people into writers.&#8221; And now Rapchat wants to tap the world for rappers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rapchat has created a music studio that fits into your pocket,” said Nico Wittenborn, lead Investor at venture capital firm Adjacent, in a statement. “It decreases the friction of creativity by allowing anyone, anywhere in the world to record and publish music straight from their phones. This mobile-enabled democratization of technology is what Adjacent is all about, and I am super excited to support the team in building out this next-level music platform.&#8221;</p>

		Ariel Katz is the founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.h1insights.com">H1</a>, a global healthcare platform that helps life sciences companies, hospitals, academic medical centers and health systems connect with providers, find clinical research, locate industry experts and benchmark their organization.	</div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In the early 2000s, Jeff Bezos gave a seminal TED Talk titled “<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_bezos_the_electricity_metaphor_for_the_web_s_future?language=en">The Electricity Metaphor for the Web’s Future</a>.” In it, he argued that the internet will enable innovation on the same scale that electricity did.</p>
<p>We are at a similar inflection point in healthcare, with the recent movement toward data transparency birthing a new generation of innovation and startups.</p>
<p>Those who follow the space closely may have noticed that there are twin struggles taking place: a push for more transparency on provider and payer data, including anonymous patient data, and another for strict privacy protection for personal patient data. What’s the main difference?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			This sector is still somewhat nascent &#8212; we are in the first wave of innovation, with much more to come.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Anonymized data is much more freely available, while personal data is being locked even tighter (as it should be) due to regulations like GDPR, CCPA and their equivalents around the world.</p>
<p>The former trend is enabling a host of new vendors and services that will ultimately make healthcare better and more transparent for all of us.</p>
<p>These new companies could not have existed five years ago. The Affordable Care Act was the first step toward making anonymized data more available. It required healthcare institutions (such as hospitals and healthcare systems) to publish data on costs and outcomes. This included the release of detailed data on providers.</p>
<p>Later legislation required biotech and pharma companies to disclose monies paid to research partners. And every physician in the U.S. is now required to be in the <a href="https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/">National Practitioner Identifier</a> (NPI), a comprehensive public database of providers.</p>
<p>All of this allowed the creation of new types of companies that give both patients and providers more control over their data. Here are some key examples of how.</p>
<h2>Allowing patients to access all their own health data in one place</h2>
<p>This is a key capability of patients’ newly found access to health data. Think of how often, as a patient, providers aren’t aware of treatment or a test you’ve had elsewhere. Often you end up repeating a test because a provider doesn’t have a record of a test conducted elsewhere.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/roku-alleges-google-is-using-its-monopoly-power-in-youtube-tv-carriage-negotiations/">Roku warned customers</a> that the YouTube TV app may be removed from its streaming media players and TVs, and alleged that Google was leveraging its monopoly power during contract negotiations to ask for unfair terms. Today, Roku is announcing the deal has fallen through &#8212; meaning YouTube TV will no longer be available to new Roku subscribers. However, the company says it has taken steps to ensure existing subscribers can continue to use the YouTube TV app.</p>
<p>Roku had argued that as a part of its attempts to renew the carriage agreement for YouTube TV, Google was asking for special treatment, including a preferential ranking of YouTube content in search results, and even the permission to override Roku customer&#8217;s default settings when the YouTube app was open. That is, if a customer used the voice search button to ask for music, Google wanted YouTube Music to play the request &#8212; even if the customer had set another app, like Pandora, as their default.</p>
<p>The company also alleged that Google was asking for customer data that was &#8220;outside the realm&#8221; of industry standard practices and more than Roku offered other customers. And it said Google threatened to increase the hardware spec requirements for YouTube TV which would ensure Roku&#8217;s low-end and competitively priced players wouldn&#8217;t be able to access it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google, however, disputed the claims were as Roku said. It pointed the finger back at Roku for turning to customers to help sway the negotiations in its favor. The company also said it had been working in &#8220;good faith&#8221; to reach an agreement and all its requests were about providing a good user experience. Notably, Google also said it made &#8220;no requests to access user data or interfere with search results.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roku today offered a statement on the decision to pull YouTube TV, as the agreement has not been renewed. A Roku spokesperson said the following:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“We are disappointed that Google has allowed our agreement for the distribution of YouTube TV to expire. Roku has not asked for one dollar of additional financial consideration from Google to renew YouTube TV. ​</em></p>
<p><em>We have only asked Google for four simple commitments. First, not to manipulate consumer search results. Second, not to require access to data not available to anyone else. Third, not to leverage their YouTube monopoly to force Roku to accept hardware requirements that would increase consumer costs. Fourth, not to act in a discriminatory and anticompetitive manner against Roku. ​</em></p>
<p><em>​Because our contract has expired, we have removed YouTube TV from our channel store. To continue to provide our users with a great streaming experience, we are taking the extra step to continue to offer existing subscribers access to YouTube TV on the Roku platform unless Google takes actions that require the full removal of the channel. Because of Google&#8217;s conduct, new subscriptions will not be available going forward until an agreement is reached. ​</em></p>
<p><em>​It is well past time for Google to embrace the principles that have made streaming so popular for millions of users by giving consumers control of their streaming experience, by embracing fair competition and by ceasing anticompetitive practices. We believe consumers stand to benefit from Google and Roku reaching a fair agreement that preserves these principles and we remain committed to trying to achieve that goal.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>An email was also sent to customers informing them of these details. We&#8217;ve asked Google for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Barely more than eight months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/10/mux-raises-37m-series-c-as-its-api-based-video-streaming-service-scales/">announcing a $37 million funding round</a>, <a href="https://mux.com">Mux</a> has another $105 million.</p>
<p>The Series D was led by Coatue and values the company at more than $1 billion (Mux isn&#8217;t disclosing the specific valuation). Existing investors Accel, Andreessen Horowitz and Cobalt also participated, as did new investor Dragoneer.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Jon Dahl told me that Mux didn&#8217;t need to raise more funding. But after last year&#8217;s Series C, the company&#8217;s leadership kept in touch with Coatue and other investors who&#8217;d expressed interest, and they ultimately decided that more money could help fuel faster growth during &#8220;this inflection moment in video.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Building on the thesis popularized by A16Z co-founder Marc Andreessen, Dahl said, &#8220;I think video’s eating software, the same way software was eating the world 10 years ago.&#8221; In other words, where video was once something we watched at our desks and on our sofas, it&#8217;s now everywhere, whether we&#8217;re scrolling through our social media feeds or exercising on our Pelotons.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mux raises $37M Series C as its API-based video streaming service scales&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/10/mux-raises-37m-series-c-as-its-api-based-video-streaming-service-scales/embed/#?secret=DvNRACgnvr" data-secret="DvNRACgnvr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We’re at the early days of a five- or 10-year major transition, where video is moving into being a first-class part of every software project,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Dahl argued that Mux is well-suited for this transition because it&#8217;s &#8220;a video platform for developers,&#8221; with an API-centric approach that results in faster publishing and reliable streaming for viewers. Its first product was a monitoring and analytics tool called Mux Data, followed by its streaming video product Mux Video.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to build a video platform and do it data-first, you need heavy data and monitoring and analytics,&#8221; Dahl explained. &#8220;We built the data layer [and then] we built the streaming platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Customers include Robinhood, PBS, ViacomCBS, Equinox Media, and VSCO — Dahl said that while Mux works with digital media companies, &#8220;our core market is software.&#8221; He suggested that back when the company was founded in 2015, video was largely seen as a &#8220;niche,&#8221; or &#8220;something you needed if you were ESPN or Netflix.&#8221; But the last few years have illustrated that &#8220;video is a fundamental part of how we communicate&#8221; and that &#8220;every software company should have video as a core part of its products.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, demand increased dramatically during the pandemic. During the past year, on-demand streaming via the Mux platform growing by 300%, while live video streaming grew 3700% and revenue quadrupled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is a lot of work,&#8221; Dahl said with a laugh. &#8220;We definitely spent a lot of the last year ramping and scaling and investing in the platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>This new funding will allow Mux (which has now raised a total of $175 million) to continue that investment. Dahl said he plans to grow the team from 80 to 200 employees and to explore potential acquisitions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were impressed by Mux’s laser focus on the developer community, and saw impressive customer retention and expansion indicative of the strong value their solutions provide,&#8221; said Coatue General Partner David Schneider in a statement. &#8220;This funding will enable Mux to continue to build on their customer-centric platform and we are proud to partner with Mux as it leads the way to this hybrid future.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Restoring and preserving the world&#8217;s forests has long been considered one of the easiest, lowest cost, and simplest ways to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s by far the most popular method for corporations looking to take an easy first step on the long road to decarbonizing or offsetting their industrial operations. But in recent months the efficacy, validity, and reliability of a number of forest offsets have been called into question thanks to some blockbuster reporting from Bloomberg.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s against this uncertain backdrop that investors are coming in to shore up financing for <a href="https://pachama.com/">Pachama</a>, a company building a marketplace for forest carbon credits that it says is more transparent and verifiable thanks to its use of satellite imagery and machine learning technologies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That pitch has brought in $15 million in new financing for the company, which co-founder and chief executive Diego Saez Gil said would be used for product development and the continued expansion of the company&#8217;s marketplace.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/03/pachama-launches-to-support-global-reforestation-through-carbon-markets/">Launched only one year ago</a>, Pachama has managed to land some impressive customers and backers. No less an authority on things environmental than Jeff Bezos (given how much of a negative impact Amazon operations have on the planet), <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders">gave the company a shoutout</a> in his last letter to shareholders as Amazon&#8217;s outgoing chief executive. And the largest ecommerce company in Latin America, Mercado Libre, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/mercado-libre-taps-pachama-to-monitor-and-manage-its-8-million-investment-in-latin-american-rainforest-restoration/">tapped the company to manage an $8 million offset project</a> that&#8217;s part of a broader commitment to sustainability by the retailing giant.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund is an investor in the latest round, which was led by Bill Gates&#8217; investment firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures. Other investors included Lowercarbon Capital (the climate-focused fund from über-successful angel investor, Chris Sacca), former Über executive Ryan Graves&#8217; Saltwater, the MCJ Collective, and new backers like Tim O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s OATV, Ram Fhiram, Joe gebbia, Marcos Galperin, NBA All-star Manu Ginobilli, James Beshara, Fabrice Grinda, Sahil Lavignia, and Tomi Pierucci.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DMXOOjfrz1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/03/pachama-launches-to-support-global-reforestation-through-carbon-markets/">Pachama launches to support global reforestation through carbon markets</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pachama launches to support global reforestation through carbon markets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/03/pachama-launches-to-support-global-reforestation-through-carbon-markets/embed/#?secret=DMXOOjfrz1" data-secret="DMXOOjfrz1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That&#8217;s not even the full list of the company&#8217;s backers. What&#8217;s made Pachama so successful, and given the company the ability to attract top talent from companies like Google, Facebook, SapceX, Tesla, OpenAI, Microsoft, Impossible Foods and Orbital Insights, is the combination of its climate mission applied to the well-understood forest offset market, said Saez Gil.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Restoring nature is one of the most important solutions to climate change. Forests, oceans and other ecosystems not only sequester enormous amounts of CO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">from the atmosphere, but they also provide critical habitat for biodiversity and are sources of livelihood for communities worldwide. We are building the technology stack required to be able to drive funding to the restoration and conservation of these ecosystems with integrity, transparency and efficiency” said Diego Saez Gil, Co-founder and CEO at Pachama. “We feel honored and excited to have the support of such an incredible group of investors who believe in our mission and are demonstrating their willingness to support our growth for the long term”. </span></p>
<p>Customers outside of Latin America are also clamoring for access to Pachama&#8217;s offset marketplace. Microsoft, Shopify, and Softbank are also among the company&#8217;s paying buyers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s another reason that investors like<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Y Combinator, Social Capital, Tobi Lutke, Serena Williams, Aglaé Ventures (LVMH’s tech investment arm), Paul Graham, AirAngels, Global Founders, ThirdKind Ventures, Sweet Capital, Xplorer Capital, Scott Belsky, Tim Schumacher, Gustaf Alstromer, Facundo Garreton, and Terrence Rohan, were able to commit to backing the company&#8217;s nearly $24 million haul since its 2020 launch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pachama is working on unlocking the full potential of nature to remove CO2 from the atmosphere,” said Carmichael Roberts from BEV, in a statement. “Their technology-based approach will have an enormous multiplier effect by using machine learning models for forest analysis to validate, monitor and measure impactful carbon neutrality initiatives. We are impressed by the progress that the team has made in a short period of time and look forward to working with them to scale their unique solution globally.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Commission has <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2061">issued</a> a formal &#8216;statement of objections&#8217; against Apple, saying today that its preliminary view is Apple&#8217;s app store rules distort competition in the market for music streaming services by raising the costs of competing music streaming app developers.</p>
<p>Apple has a period of 12 weeks to respond to the preliminary charges.</p>
<p>The Commission begun investigating competition concerns related to iOS App Store (and also Apple Pay) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/apple-pay-and-ios-app-store-under-formal-antitrust-probe-in-europe/">last summer</a>. But today&#8217;s charges relate only to music streaming apps, and the App Store&#8217;s role as a gatekeeper for such apps to access iOS users. This is also a market where Apple competes, with its eponymous offering (Apple Music).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The Commission takes issue with the mandatory use of Apple&#8217;s own in-app purchase mechanism imposed on music streaming app developers to distribute their apps via Apple&#8217;s App Store,&#8221; it wrote. &#8220;The Commission is also concerned that Apple applies certain restrictions on app developers preventing them from informing iPhone and iPad users of alternative, cheaper purchasing possibilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The statement of objections focuses on two rules that Apple imposes in its agreements with music streaming app developers: Namely what the Commission said is a &#8220;mandatory&#8221; requirement to use <strong>Apple&#8217;s proprietary in-app purchase system</strong> (IAP) to distribute paid digital content (with the Commission stating that Apple charges a 30% commission fee on all such subscriptions bought via IAP); and &#8216;<strong>anti-steering provisions</strong>&#8216; which limit the ability of developers to inform users of alternative purchasing options.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The Commission&#8217;s investigation showed that most streaming providers passed this fee [Apple&#8217;s 30% cut] on to end users by raising prices,&#8221; it went on, adding: &#8220;</span>While Apple allows users to use music subscriptions purchased elsewhere, its rules prevent developers from informing users about such purchasing possibilities, which are usually cheaper. The Commission is concerned that users of Apple devices pay significantly higher prices for their music subscription services or they are prevented from buying certain subscriptions directly in their apps.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, EVP and competition chief Margrethe Vestager, added:<em> “</em>App stores play a central role in today&#8217;s digital economy. We can now do our shopping, access news, music or movies via apps instead of visiting websites. Our preliminary finding is that Apple is a gatekeeper to users of iPhones and iPads via the App Store. With Apple Music, Apple also competes with music streaming providers. By setting strict rules on the App store that disadvantage competing music streaming services, Apple deprives users of cheaper music streaming choices and distorts competition. This is done by charging high commission fees on each transaction in the App store for rivals and by forbidding them from informing their customers of alternative subscription options.”</p>
<p>Apple sent us this statement in response to the Commission&#8217;s statement of objections:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Spotify has become the largest music subscription service in the world, and we’re proud for the role we played in that. Spotify does not pay Apple any commission on over 99% of their subscribers, and only pays a 15% commission on those remaining subscribers that they acquired through the App Store. At the core of this case is Spotify’s demand they should be able to advertise alternative deals on their iOS app, a practice that no store in the world allows. Once again, they want all the benefits of the App Store but don’t think they should have to pay anything for that. The Commission’s argument on Spotify’s behalf is the opposite of fair competition.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Spotify&#8217;s founder, Daniel Ek, has also responded to the news of the Commission&#8217;s charges against Apple with a jubilant tweet &#8212; writing: &#8220;Today is a big day. Fairness is the key to competition&#8230; we are one step closer to creating a level playing field, which is so important for the entire ecosystem of European developers.&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The music streaming company also sent us this statement, attributed to its head of global affairs and chief legal officer, Horacio Gutierrez &#8212; in which he suggests the antitrust charges will have &#8220;far-reaching implications&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Ensuring the iOS platform operates fairly is an urgent task with far-reaching implications. The European Commission’s Statement of Objections is a critical step toward holding Apple accountable for its anticompetitive behavior, ensuring meaningful choice for all consumers and a level playing field for app developers.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>&#8220;This is not a Spotify case&#8221;</h2>
<p>During a press conference following the announcement of the Commission&#8217;s charges, Vestager went into a little more detail on the case &#8212; saying the Commission believes the impact of Apple&#8217;s distortion of the music streaming market has led to raising subscription prices for consumers to €12.99, rather than the €9.99 Apple charges for its own service.</p>
<p>Apple of course is not subject to the 30% fee it levies on third party music streaming services which opt to sell subscriptions via its store. (Spotify stopped doing so in 2018 in order to avoid the IAP fee.)</p>
<p>During a Q&amp;A with journalists Vestager was pressed on the fact that Spotify is itself as thriving music streaming business &#8212; and Apple also points out that Spotify describes itself as the “largest global music subscription service” and has a market capitalization of $50BN+, so is hardly a minnow of a digital business &#8212; but she argued it&#8217;s &#8220;really difficult to say what would have been the market development without these conditions imposed by Apple in its App Store&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spotify is a big player in the music streaming market but we don&#8217;t know what would have been the conditions without this,&#8221; Vestager went on, pointing to other rivals who &#8212; the clear implication is &#8212; might have been able to cut themselves a larger chunk of Spotify&#8217;s (and Apple&#8217;s) music streaming pie, under different App Store conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are other rivals to Apple Music &#8212; there are Deezer, there are Soundcloud. Smaller competitors and here we have real concerns about their developments,&#8221; she said, adding: &#8220;This is not a Spotify case &#8212; this is a music streaming case. It&#8217;s about what are the different service providers, what are the conditions in order to be able to present to us their offers so we might be their customers. This is what it&#8217;s about&#8230; It&#8217;s important for a market to stay innovative and competitive and that we have the chance to see the different rivals and that they are free to make their own decisions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vestager suggested it&#8217;s not the level of the fee Apple charges on in-app subscriptions, per se, that the Commission is objecting to but the combination of the conditions it imposes on players in this market while also offering its own rival service which is not subject to the same conditions.</p>
<p>She also noted that Apple&#8217;s fee doesn&#8217;t apply universally to all apps in its store &#8212; but does apply to all music streaming apps except Apple&#8217;s own, remarking: &#8220;So you have a possible 30% price difference between the two.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Apple&#8217;s anti-steering provisions, she suggested the impact of it constraining music streaming apps&#8217; ability to communicate with subscribers who have signed up through the App Store significantly restricts their ability to compete, including by being combined with Apple&#8217;s own richer view of iOS users.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are a rival to Apple Music you cannot send your subscribers an email telling them to go to your website to subscribe at a price without the commission fee,&#8221; she emphasized.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rival music streaming services &#8212; they don&#8217;t even get to know their customers. So if I end my subscription they cannot even send me an email to say is there something we can do for you, why did you end your subscription?&#8221;</p>
<p>And while she noted Apple does have a rule allowing access to subscription content via an iOS app when the subscription has been purchased outside the store (aka, the &#8216;reader&#8217; app rule) she suggested the combination of the two rules Apple applies to music streaming apps &#8220;makes it quite difficult for competitors because your margins are being squeezed and you may not look that attractive to potential customers&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the Commission case has not concluded &#8212; and Apple will have 12 weeks to respond to today&#8217;s statement of objections, so it remains to be seen what the final outcome will be &#8212; but Vestager summed up her preliminary view by saying: &#8220;We are concerned that Apple&#8217;s rules negatively impact its rivals by raising its costs, reducing their profit margins as well as their attractiveness on the Apple platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also argued that iOS users simply don&#8217;t switch platforms &#8212; meaning that, even if there are cheaper music streaming options available via Android devices, it does not change Apple&#8217;s &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; role over iOS users&#8217; ability to access music streaming apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through these rules, Apple steps in between its competitors and their customers with access to valuable data from the in-app payments system Apple gets insights that music streaming providers don&#8217;t get,&#8221; she argued, suggesting &#8220;they may no longer be in a position to understand the reasons of termination of a subscription and communicate with their customers about them&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the specificities of this case is the market definition,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;Because when it comes to the concrete devices Apple is not necessarily the dominant player in Europe &#8212; it holds a high marketshare &#8212; but once you have an iPhone for instance you can go nowhere else. And this is why I said in the after markets of providing you with the apps that you would want to have Apple holds a monopoly in the Apple App Store. You can go nowhere else to get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Should the Commission end up formalizing its charges against Apple it has the power to issue a financial penalty (the fine threshold for breaches of EU competition law is 10% of the overall annual turnover of the company) &#8212; and would certainly order Apple to cease any behaviors deemed to infringe competition laws and avoid from any other practices with an equivalent effect.</p>
<p>Vestager wouldn&#8217;t be drawn on what remedies might look like in this case. But she pointed out that Apple charges developers a basic annual fee to list apps &#8212; to cover the costs of administering the App Store &#8212; suggesting: &#8220;So it&#8217;s not as if this will end the business model of the Apple App Store.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hopefully we can get to a situation where there is fair competition,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Because with the combination of the two concerns, that prices are so much higher for rivals of Apple Music and that rivals are not allowed to tell their customer that they can get their product cheaper then they are at a disadvantage.&#8221;</p>
<p>More Apple cases are being worked on by the EU regulator, per Vestager, who said the Commission continues to investigate ebooks &#8212; and a more general complaint against the App Store.</p>
<p>She also confirmed today&#8217;s case is also unrelated to the ongoing investigation into Apple Pay.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have more than one case concerning the Apple App Store,&#8221; she noted. &#8220;We have one specifically on ebooks, we have one specifically on the App Store as such &#8212; and the way that works &#8212; so this is not the last case we will have when it comes to the App Store as such.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vestager declined to give a timeline on when the other cases may progress to a next stage.</p>
<h2>Going after gatekeepers</h2>
<p>A number of complaints against Apple&#8217;s practices have been lodged with the EU&#8217;s competition division in recent years &#8212; including by music streaming service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/spotify-files-a-complaint-against-apple-with-the-european-commission-over-apple-tax-and-restrictive-rules/">Spotify</a>; video games maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/epic-games-takes-its-apple-app-store-fight-to-europe/">Epic Games</a>; and messaging platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/telegram-hits-out-at-apples-app-store-tax-in-latest-eu-antitrust-complaint/">Telegram</a>, to name a few of the complainants who have gone public (and been among the most vocal).</p>
<p>The main objection is over the (up to 30%) cut Apple takes on sales made through third parties&#8217; apps &#8212; which critics rail against as an &#8216;Apple tax&#8217; &#8212; as well as how it can mandate that developers do not inform users how to circumvent its in-app payment infrastructure, i.e. by signing up for subscriptions via their own website instead of through the App Store.</p>
<p>Other complaints include that Apple does not allow third party app stores on iOS.</p>
<p>Apple, meanwhile, has argued that its App Store does not constitute a monopoly. iOS&#8217; global market share of mobile devices is a little over 10% vs Google&#8217;s rival Android OS &#8212; which is running on the lion&#8217;s share of the world&#8217;s mobile hardware.</p>
<p>But monopoly status depends on how a market is defined by regulators (and if you&#8217;re looking at the market for iOS apps then Apple has no competitors).</p>
<p>The iPhone maker also likes to point out that the vast majority of third party apps pay it no commission (as they don&#8217;t monetize via in-app payments). While it argues that restrictions on native apps are necessary to protect iOS users from threats to their security and privacy.</p>

<p>Last summer the European Commission said its App Store probe was focused on Apple’s mandatory requirement that app developers use its proprietary in-app purchase system, as well as restrictions applied on the ability of developers to inform iPhone and iPad users of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities outside of apps.</p>
<p>It also said it was investigating Apple Pay: Looking at the T&amp;Cs and other conditions Apple imposes for integrating its payment solution into others&#8217; apps and websites on iPhones and iPads, and also on limitations it imposes on others&#8217; access to the NFC (contactless payment) functionality on iPhones for payments in stores.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s antitrust regulator also said then that it was probing allegations of &#8220;refusals of access&#8221; to Apple Pay.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/">March</a> this year the UK joined the Apple App Store antitrust investigation fray &#8212; announcing a formal investigation into whether it has a dominant position and if it imposes unfair or anti-competitive terms on developers using its app store.</p>
<p>US lawmakers have, meanwhile, been dialling up attention on app <em>stores</em>, plural &#8212; and on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/steps-from-the-house-judiciary-committee-are-too-little-too-late-when-it-comes-to-big-tech/">competition in digital markets more generally</a> &#8212; calling in both Apple and Google for questioning over how they operate their respective mobile app marketplaces in recent years.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/apple-and-google-pressed-in-antitrust-hearing-on-whether-app-stores-share-data-with-product-development-teams/">Last month</a>, for example, the two tech giants&#8217; representatives were pressed on whether their app stores share data with their product development teams &#8212; with lawmakers digging into complaints against Apple especially that Cupertino frequently copies others&#8217; apps, &#8216;sherlocking&#8217; their businesses by releasing native copycats (as the practice has been nicknamed).</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/apples-app-store-commission-structure-called-into-question-in-antitrust-hearing/">July 2020</a> the House Antitrust Subcommittee took testimony from Apple CEO Tim Cook himself &#8212; and went on, in a <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/competition_in_digital_markets.pdf">hefty report</a> on competition in digital markets, to accuse Apple of leveraging its control of iOS and the App Store to &#8220;create and enforce barriers to competition and discriminate against and exclude rivals while preferencing its own offerings&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple also uses its power to exploit app developers through misappropriation of competitively sensitive information and to charge app developers supra-competitive prices within the App Store,&#8221; the report went on. &#8220;Apple has maintained its dominance due to the presence of network effects, high barriers to entry, and high switching costs in the mobile operating system market.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report did not single Apple out &#8212; also blasting Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook for abusing their market power. And the Justice Department went on to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/justice-department-will-reportedly-file-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-today/">file suit against Google</a> later the same month.</p>
<p>So, over in the U.S., the stage is being set for further actions against big tech. Although what, if any, federal charges Apple could face remains to be seen.</p>
<p>A number of state-level tech regulation efforts are also brewing around big tech and antitrust &#8212; including a push in Arizona <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-next-big-tech-fights-are-in-state-capitals-11615714201?mod=djemalertNEWS">to relieve developers</a> from Apple and Google’s hefty cut of app store profits.</p>
<p>While an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/hawley-antitrust-bill-trust-busting-for-the-twenty-first-century-act/">antitrust bill</a> introduced by Republican Josh Hawley earlier this month takes aim at acquisitions, proposing an outright block on big tech&#8217;s ability to carry out mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>Although that bill looks unlikely to succeed, a flurry of antitrust reform bills are set to introduced as U.S. lawmakers on both sides of the aisle grapple with how to cut big tech down to a competition-friendly size.</p>
<p>In Europe lawmakers are already putting down draft laws with the same overarching goal.</p>
<p>In the EU, the Commission recently<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/"> proposed an ex ante regime</a> to prevent big tech from abusing its market power. The Digital Markets Act is set to impose conditions on intermediating platforms who are considered &#8216;gatekeepers&#8217; to others&#8217; market access.</p>
<p>While over in the UK, which now sits outside the bloc, the government is also drafting new laws in response to tech giants&#8217; market power. It has said it intends to create a &#8216;pro-competition&#8217; regime that will apply<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/"> to platforms with so-called  &#8216;strategic market status&#8217;</a> &#8212; but instead of a set list of requirements it wants to target specific measures per platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/17/vc-lior-susan-has-a-big-idea-that-seems-to-be-working-building-next-generation-industrial-companies/">Two years ago</a>, we talked with Lior Susan, the founder of now six-year-old Eclipse Ventures in Palo Alto, Ca. At the time, the outfit believed that the next big thing wasn&#8217;t another social network but instead the remaking of old-line industries through full tech stacks &#8212; including hardware, software and data &#8212; capable of bring them into the 21st century.</p>
<p>Fast forward, and nothing has changed, not inside of Eclipse anyway. While the world has gone through a dramatic transformation owing to the coronavirus pandemic &#8212; never has the U.S.&#8217;s crumbling infrastructure been so apparent to so many &#8211; Eclipse is backing exactly the same kinds of companies that it always has and with the same size fund. Indeed, after closing its second and third funds with $500 million, the firm quietly closed its fourth vehicle earlier this month with $500 million in capital commitments from predominantly endowments.</p>
<p>This morning, we talked with Susan about Eclipse&#8217;s focus on revitalizing old industries that remain largely untouched by tech, and why the pitch of Lior and the rest of Eclipse&#8217;s <a href="https://eclipse.vc/team/">team</a> has never been more powerful. Excerpts from that conversation follow, edited lightly for length and clarity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: Because of where Eclipse focuses, you were long aware of the coming supply chain crises that the pandemic brought to the fore. Have your priorities changed at all as an investor? Did you have a to-do list going into 2020 and has that changed?</strong></p>
<p>LS: Not really. We&#8217;ve been saying from inception that the infrastructure that we are living in is 50 to 60 years old across the board. We&#8217;ve been investing all of this time in social software and fintech, new ideas and consumer trends. But we don&#8217;t live in the internet, we actually live in the physical world. And the physical world is not [receiving investment] at all. But much of that innovation can be applied to the world in which we are living, and what we want to do is bring that $65 trillion backstage economy into the digital age.</p>
<p><strong>TC: In this go-go market, not a lot of funds are raising the same amounts as they have previously. Why did you choose to do so?</strong></p>
<p>LS: We have a very specific strategy. We only lead early-stage investments in around 22 companies per fund, we [want] 20% to 25% with our initial check, and we double down on companies that we think are breaking out and try to lead two or three rounds in a row. And we know how to run the spreadsheets and we know how to make an assumption [about] what is the enterprise value we need to create in order to deliver alpha returns, and [that math leads us to] $500 million.</p>
<p><strong>TC:  The last time we&#8217;d talked, Eclipse had also helped create and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/23/bright-machines-lands-179m-to-bring-smarter-robotics-to-manufacturing/">fund</a> a company, <a href="https://www.brightmachines.com/">Bright Machines</a>, which primarily develops software for robotic systems inside of manufacturing companies. Have you launched any other companies in the last couple of years? I remember you don&#8217;t like the word &#8216;incubate.&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>LS: We call it venture equity internally, but basically, we are very thesis oriented, so a lot of our investments start with us [circling around] an investment thesis and an area that we believe is getting really interesting. I&#8217;m right now working on a thesis around insurance in the manufacturing space [that will cover] working comp, facilities, assets . . . It [always] will start with a one-page thesis and we&#8217;ll talk inside the firm about it, and we&#8217;ll go hunt. But we don&#8217;t find what we like in a lot of cases. This is where we&#8217;re like, &#8216;Okay, we come from operating backgrounds. Why not roll up our sleeves and figure out how we can go and build these companies?&#8217;</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right that we did Bright Machines. We&#8217;ve also done <a href="https://brightinsight.com/">Bright Insight</a> (an IoT platform for biopharma and medtech that just raised <a href="https://brightinsight.com/press-releases/brightinsight-announces-101m-in-series-c-funding-led-by-general-catalyst">$101 million in Series C funding</a> led by General Catalyst), <a href="https://chord.co/">Chord</a> (a commerce-as-a-service software for direct-to-consumer brands that just raised <a href="https://www.alleywatch.com/2021/03/chord-commerce-as-a-service-arfa-headless-data-bryan-mahoney-henry-davis/">$18 million in Series A</a> funding), and <a href="https://metrolink.ai/">Metrolink</a> (a new company that helps organizations design and manage their data flows). We&#8217;ve done [this model] a [few] times where we didn&#8217;t just invest in the company but we&#8217;re part of the founding team or we&#8217;re carving out assets. We&#8217;re trying to keep it very flexible.</p>
<p><strong> TC: Interesting that you couldn&#8217;t find an insurance company focused on the manufacturing industry that you like.</strong></p>
<p>LS: We have a lot of theses like that. We see a lot of horizontal business models and tech that [could work well] in the verticals where we&#8217;re playing and that we know need solutions. So, can you do a Slack for construction, or can you find the right people to build a Lemonade for manufacturing, or can you find the Shopify for industrial assets or spare parts?</p>
<p><strong>TC: What size checks are you writing?</strong></p>
<p>LS: I&#8217;d say $3 million to $4 million initial checks and up to $20 million or $25 million in a Series B, but you will find a lot of our companies where we invested $150 million plus over the lifetime of the company.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Which company has attracted the most from Eclipse?</strong></p>
<p>LS: I&#8217;d guess Cerebras [Systems, which reportedly makes the <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/11/17/cerebras-wafer-size-chip-is-10000-times-faster-than-a-gpu/">world’s largest computer chip</a>].</p>
<p><strong>TC: What do you make of what we&#8217;re hearing from the new administration in the U.S. on the infrastructure front. Do you think it&#8217;s talking about pouring money into the right verticals?</strong></p>
<p>LS:  I was on a call with the manufacturing task force on Monday, and I will tell you &#8212; without getting into politics at all, because that&#8217;s above my pay grade &#8212; that the current administration is going to pour hundreds of billions of dollars, if not trillions of dollars, into upgrading the infrastructure of this country. And it&#8217;s going to be semiconductors, batteries, manufacturing, industrial infrastructure as a whole . . .</p>
<p>[I think last year&#8217;s ventilator shortage made clear] that we&#8217;d lost 100% of the manufacturing capabilities of this country and Western countries as a whole. And I think everyone now understands that you&#8217;re going to see a massive swing of investment in infrastructure and the only way to do it is through technology, because we actually don&#8217;t have a million people here that want to [work on an assembly line].  We actually need automation lines and software and computer vision and machine learning and everything that Silicon Valley is really good at.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You have insight into what&#8217;s happening on the semiconductor front through Cerebras and other bets. There&#8217;s obviously a huge chip shortage that&#8217;s impacting everyone, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-chip-shortage-set-to-worsen-for-car-makers-11619708393">including the auto industry. </a>How long will it take for supply to catch up to demand?</strong></p>
<p>LS: I think we&#8217;re going to see some big changes, but it&#8217;s  going to take many, many, many years. This is not software, we cannot bring everything up [to speed overnight] as you actually need fabs and cleaning rooms and assets. It&#8217;s pretty complicated.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to get worse in the next couple of quarters. It&#8217;s good for some of our companies that are working on the problem, but overall, as an economy, it&#8217;s pretty bad news.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Once the uncool sibling of a flourishing fintech sector, insurtech is now one of the hottest areas of a buoyant venture market. Zego’s $150 million round at unicorn valuation in March, a rumored giant incoming round for WeFox, and a slew of IPOs and SPACs in the U.S. are all testament to this.</p>
<p>It’s not difficult to see why. The insurance market is enormous, but the sector has suffered from notoriously poor customer experience and major incumbents have been slow to adapt. Fintech has set a precedent for the explosive growth that can be achieved with superior customer experience underpinned by modern technology. And the pandemic has cast the spotlight on high-potential categories, including health, mobility and cybersecurity.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Fintech has set a precedent for the explosive growth that can be achieved with superior customer experience underpinned by modern technology.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>This has begun to brew a perfect storm of conditions for big European insurtech exits. Here are four trends to look out for as the industry powers toward several European IPOs and a red-hot M&amp;A market in the next few years.</p>
<h2>Full-stack insurtech continues to conquer</h2>
<p>Several early insurtech success stories started life as managing general agents (MGAs). Unlike brokers, MGAs manage claims and underwriting, but unlike a traditional insurer, pass risk off their balance sheet to third-party insurers or reinsurers. MGAs have provided a great way for new brands to acquire customers and underwrite policies without actually needing a fully fledged balance sheet. But it’s a business model with thin margins, so MGAs increasingly are trying to internalize risk exposure by verticalizing into a &#8220;full-stack&#8221; insurer in the hope of improving their unit economics.</p>
<p>This structure has been prevalent in the U.S., with some of the bigger recent U.S. insurtech IPO successes (Lemonade and Root), SPACs (Clover and MetroMile), and more upcoming listings (Hippo and Next) pointing to the prizes available to those who can successfully execute this expensive growth strategy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly a year after </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/lambda-school-cuts-staff-and-exec-pay-amid-market-uncertainty/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">its last layoff</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, online coding bootcamp<a href="https://lambdaschool.com/"> Lambda School</a> just announced more cuts amid a broader structuring. In a blog post, CEO and founder Austen Allred said that the startup, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/lambda-school-raises-74m-for-its-virtual-coding-school-where-you-pay-tuition-only-after-you-get-a-job/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">which raised a $74 million Series C</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August, is laying off 65 employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The roles that were cut span senior product, engineering, design, community management, or instructional staff. There is a </span><a href="https://forms.gle/JNS5kz6WQuZoZG6H7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for companies to post job opportunities for new Lambda School alumni. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have been working for years on making incentive-aligned education work,” Allred wrote in a tweet. “It’s harder than we initially thought; we’ve had to invent a lot from scratch simultaneously and we have to get a lot of things exactly right.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lambda School creates online bootcamps in the career and technical space &#8212; and it’s also a pioneer of the ISA, an income share agreement, touting it as a vital way to finance employment-ready education. ISAs essentially allow students to avoid paying upfront fees to attend a bootcamp, and then ultimately pay back class fees through a percent of their future income. A number of startups have taken the ‘Lambda School for X’ format, such as </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/henry-picks-up-cash-to-be-a-lambda-school-for-latin-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/investors-bet-millions-on-microverse-a-lambda-school-for-the-developing-world/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microverse.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Other companies also offer ISAs such as Pursuit, V School, Launch School, and the Grace Hopper Program, </span><a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/bootcamp-market-report-2021/#income-share-agreements-isas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one analysis shows. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic, and volatile economic circumstances, have made ISAs a harder route. Allred said that some startups pivoted from the model, but it appears that Lambda School will not. It&#8217;s still a hard thing to finance as a startup, since the company is essentially in a waiting game of debt until students pay. The company might be looking at a variety of ways to fund the ISA business, one of which got them <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21135134/lambda-school-students-edly-isa-debt-swapping-partnership-shares-investors">in hot water years ago. </a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “We have a lot of interest in purchasing the income share agreements at the point of graduation, from investment funds and that kind of thing,” Allred said back in April 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t know how exactly the restructuring will look from a strategy perspective, beyond the fact that Lambda School is pausing new enrollment in part-time programs. . </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, Lambda School announced</span><a href="https://lambdaschool.com/the-commons/lambda-school-launches-backend-engineering-program-amazon"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a new partnership with Amazon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: a back-end engineering program that will last for nine months. Since the program is full-time, it is likely not impacted by the restructuring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s call by Lambda School illustrates how hard it is to build an edtech company that is truly doing something new. The company has a lot of stakeholders with different incentives to consider: students saving money, businesses making money, and venture capitalists who have given millions and millions to the company expecting some type of exit one day. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Despite these changes, our mission remains the same. As we move forward, we will continue to focus on unlocking opportunity, regardless of circumstance, for everyone willing to put in the work,&#8221; <a href="https://lambdaschool.com/the-commons/update-lambda-school-team">the blog post reads. </a>A<span style="font-weight: 400;">llred didn&#8217;t immediately respond to request for comment</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/orchard/">Orchard</a>, founded in 2017, was relatively early to the proptech industry. The company, originally called Perch, focused on dual-trackers, which are folks who are both buying and selling a home simultaneously. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/firstmark-capital/">FirstMark Capital</a> led both the Series A and the Series B funding rounds for Orchard, doubling down on the real estate platform.</p>
<p>It goes without saying, we&#8217;re absolutely thrilled to have FirstMark Capital Managing Partner Rick Heitzmann and Orchard CEO Court Cunningham join us on an upcoming episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>. The event takes place on <strong>May 5 at 3pm ET/noon PT</strong>. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-firstmark-capital-and-orchard">Register here.</a></p>
<p>Orchard has raised more than $350 million, including a $200 miilion+ debt financing. Alongside running a full brokerage company for dual-tracking home buyers and sellers, it also offers title and mortgage services. But what&#8217;s most interesting about the vertically integrated company is the innovation it&#8217;s doing around the consumer experience. Namely, Orchard is taking an entirely new approach to home searching, which has been incredibly stagnant despite the rush to digitize the process by major tech players.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Orchard allows consumers to get ML-driven recommendations based on homes they&#8217;ve already liked, and search by different rooms in the house. For example, perhaps the backyard or the kitchen is the most important part of the house &#8212; Orchard lets you default to that pic when browsing listings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rick Heitzmann founded FirstMark Capital all the way back in 2008. He&#8217;s led investments in companies including Pinterest, Airbnb, StubHub, Tapad, DraftKings, Riot Games, Ro, Discord, Carta and more.</p>
<p>On Extra Crunch Live, we&#8217;ll talk more about what Heitzmann looks for in a founder, what he sees in Cunningham and the future of proptech, why Cunningham chose FirstMark and even take a walk through Orchard&#8217;s early pitch deck.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll also look at pitch decks submitted by the audience, giving you the chance to hear directly from a founder and investor how they consume funding decks, what works and what doesn&#8217;t. If you want to submit your deck to be featured in a future episode of ECL, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">hit up this link</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s gonna be a blast.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The red-hot market for special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, has “screeched to a halt,” according to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/26/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html">CNN</a>. As the SPAC market grew in the past six months, it seemed that everyone was getting into the game, with celebrities from Shaquille O’Neal to former House Speaker Paul Ryan leading their own SPACs.</p>
<p>But shareholder lawsuits, huge value fluctuations and warnings from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have all thrown the brakes on the SPAC market, at least temporarily. So what do privately held tech companies that are considering going public need to know about the SPAC process and market?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Despite some warning signs, there are still hundreds of SPACs on the market looking to close deals, and this process can still have plenty of upsides.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>SPAC perks</h2>
<p>First, the upside of SPACs: They’re a much more efficient way for a private company to go public than a traditional IPO. By merging with a SPAC instead of launching an IPO, a private company can avoid the rigamarole of working with underwriters, hosting roadshows, preparing a prospectus and other complexities of the public filing process.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it can potentially be a fast track into an IPO with a seasoned partner who has experience navigating the process.</p>
<p>There are also big potential financial upsides. For example, stockholders of the private company will often roll over their stock and provide significant cash liquidity. SPACs also offer more certainty about a private company’s valuation than a traditional IPO, and some experts believe that a SPAC can add up to <a href="https://www.crestbridge.com/insights/special-purpose-acquisition-companies-innovative-solution-capital-raising#:~:text=There%20are%20numerous%20benefits%20to,a%20typical%20private%20equity%20deal">20%</a> to a company’s sale price compared to a typical private equity transaction.</p>
<p>And, especially when the SPAC market was hot, multiple SPACs could create a bidding war to increase value and generate more favorable terms for a transaction than through the traditional capital markets.</p>
<p>Lastly, partnering with an experienced management team and impressive industry insiders can help a private company accelerate its financial growth and create long-term value.</p>
<h2>Warning signs</h2>
<p>All these benefits led to a dramatic increase in SPAC transactions in late 2020 and early 2021. But the market cooled substantially in April, in part because of high-profile problems in the market and signs that the SEC will be scrutinizing the entities more closely in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Biden Labor Secretary Marty Walsh charged into the white-hot issue of the gig economy Thursday, asserting that many people working without benefits in the gig economy should be classified as employees instead.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-us-labor-secretary-says-most-gig-workers-should-be-classified-2021-04-29/?taid=608af69798240b0001ea90a3&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter">an interview with Reuters</a>, Walsh said that the Department of Labor is &#8220;looking at&#8221; the gig economy, hinting that worker reclassification could be a priority in the Biden administration.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; In a lot of cases gig workers should be classified as employees,&#8221; Walsh said. &#8220;In some cases they are treated respectfully and in some cases they are not and I think it has to be consistent across the board.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Walsh also said that the labor department would be talking to companies that benefit from gig workers to ensure that non-employees at those companies have the same benefits that an &#8220;average employee&#8221; in the U.S. would have.</p>

<p>&#8220;These companies are making profits and revenue and I&#8217;m not [going to] begrudge anyone for that because that&#8217;s what we are about in America&#8230; but we also want to make sure that success trickles down to the worker,&#8221; Walsh said.</p>
<p>Walsh&#8217;s comments aren&#8217;t backed by federal action, yet anyway, but they still made major waves among tech companies that leverage non-employee labor. Uber and Lyft stock dipped on the news Thursday, along with Doordash.</p>
<p>In the interview, Walsh also touched on pandemic-related concerns about gig workers who lack unemployment insurance and healthcare through their employers. The federal government has picked up the slack during the pandemic with two major bills granting gig workers some benefits, but otherwise they&#8217;re largely without a safety net.</p>
<p>Reforming labor laws has been a tenet of Biden&#8217;s platform for some time and the president has been very vocal about bolstering worker protections and supporting organized labor. One section of then President-elect Biden&#8217;s transition site was devoted to expanding worker protections, calling the misclassification of employees as contract workers an &#8220;epidemic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biden echoed his previous support for labor unions during a joint address to Congress Wednesday night, touting the Protecting the Right to Organize Act — legislation that would protect workers looking to form or join unions. That bill would also expand federal whistleblower protections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The middle class built this country,&#8221; Biden said. &#8220;And unions build the middle class.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Live audio experiences will be adopted by every major platform just like Stories have been, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek told investors on Wednesday&#8217;s earnings call. The streaming service recently <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-30/spotify-acquires-locker-room-and-announces-plans-for-a-new-live-audio-experience/">acquired</a> a live audio app, Locker Room, whose technology it expects to use to power a range of new live audio conversations centered around sports, culture and, of course, music.</p>
<p>Investors were curious how exactly Locker Room would fit in with Spotify&#8217;s current offerings, given the streamer today is focused on delivering recorded content &#8212; music and podcasts &#8212; and not some sort of live social networking experience.</p>
<p>Ek, mirroring what many in the industry have already been thinking, said he sees live audio as a new set of capabilities that will be broadly adopted by all. He basically dubbed it the next &#8220;Stories&#8221; &#8212; a feature popularized by Snapchat, but that eventually made its way to every platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really no different than how you think about Stories,&#8221; Ek said, explaining his thoughts on live audio. &#8220;Stories today exist on a format on a number of platforms, including Spotify, including, of course, Instagram, Snap and many others. So, I do look at [live audio] as a compelling feature set, and I think creators will engage in the places where they have the best sort of creator-to-fan affinity for the type of interactions that they&#8217;re looking for. And I think this is very similar to say how Stories played out historically.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, each platform may attract a certain kind of live audio creator, and Spotify sees its own potential in the realm of music and culture &#8212; the latter thanks to its existing and expansive investments in podcasts.</p>
<p>The interest in live audio emerged in the middle of a pandemic that trapped people at home and shut down traditional networking and large events, like conferences. But that doesn&#8217;t mean there&#8217;s no future for the format when the world opens back up.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jEbr5TB5Vi"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/spotify-is-getting-into-live-audio-because-of-course-it-is/">Spotify is getting into live audio because of course it is</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spotify is getting into live audio because of course it is&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/spotify-is-getting-into-live-audio-because-of-course-it-is/embed/#?secret=jEbr5TB5Vi" data-secret="jEbr5TB5Vi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Of course, Clubhouse gets credit for the interest in the live audio space as its exclusive invite-only status attracted a crowd of determined networkers (and clout-chasers) looking to participate in the next big thing. But as the app grew more popular, snagging big-name celeb guests &#8212; like Tesla founder Elon Musk, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, actor-turned-investor Ashton Kutcher, Drake, Oprah, and more &#8212; other tech companies began to take notice. Soon, everyone was building a Clubhouse clone.</p>
<p>Today, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Twitter, Discord, Telegram and even LinkedIn have plans for live audio in various stages of development or availability.</p>
<p>Instead of starting from scratch, however, Spotify made an acquisition. Thanks to Locker Room, originally a place to discuss sports, Spotify said it would soon open up live audio to more professional athletes, writers, musicians, songwriters, podcasters and &#8220;other global voices&#8221; who want to host real-time conversations. The Locker Room service will be rebranded as &#8220;Spotify Greenroom,&#8221; Ek noted, via a company <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4OsuS4G6ukepPsjme51uFt?si=EeR5IFrHRSqCJYIYXDh8Lg">podcast</a>.</p>
<p>In its first earnings call since the deal was announced, investors asked whether Spotify believed linear consumption of spoken word audio was more interesting than music streaming.</p>
<p>Ek explained how spoken word content may only be the beginning of what&#8217;s to come as the format evolves.</p>
<p>&#8220;As more people start engaging with a feature in a medium, you start seeing more and more professional creators jump on board. So I think it&#8217;s probably going to start out with spoken word content,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But specifically as it relates to Spotify, I think that there will be a lot of musicians that want to engage in everything from speaking to their fans to having listening parties and all other things because it&#8217;s so clear to them that on the Spotify platform, that engagement drives meaningful conversion to monetization opportunities just on the basis of our revenue model.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spotify said that the biggest request it gets from its over 8 million creators are to have more ways for them to connect with fans. Live audio, by its nature, would give them a very direct way to do just that, given Spotify&#8217;s reach of more than 350 million users.</p>
<p>In other words, live audio does not present some either/or scenario with regard to music streaming, as the investor&#8217;s question suggested. It&#8217;s more of a loop where one thing feeds the other. And &#8220;live,&#8221; apparently, could also mean music, not just chat.</p>

<p>For example, Ek hinted, when an artist has an album to promote, &#8220;you as the fan, may be able to experience that earlier than other consumers can.&#8221; Oh really?</p>
<p>Artists could also use live audio to talk about their thinking around writing a song, similar to what the <a href="https://support.spotify.com/nr/article/lyrics/">Genius integration</a> &#8220;Behind the Lyrics&#8221; today provides.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it really comes down to the quality of the content,&#8221; said Ek. &#8220;And I think when I look at our 8 million creators, we have some of the world&#8217;s best storytellers on the platform, and that&#8217;s ultimately what people will tune into, and that&#8217;s what matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>But one area that could be difficult is moderation of live content. Live audio presents a whole new range of challenges for any company, as conversations can go off the rails quickly. And Spotify&#8217;s position on drawing the line between free speech and policing misinformation or other inappropriate content is still somewhat murky. Its top podcaster, Joe Rogan, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/28/media/daniel-ek-responds-joe-rogan-podcast-controversy/index.html">recently advised listeners</a> to not get the COVID vaccine, if they were young and healthy, for example. Spotify <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/joe-rogan-anti-vaccine-podcast-spotify-1234961803/">declined</a> to weigh in on this particular controversy. But it has removed <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2021/04/06/joe-rogan-spotify-removing-shows/">some 40-plus episodes</a> from the same podcast in the past &#8212; some for seemingly lesser violations, like an episode about Bulletproof Coffee and its health claims, for instance.</p>
<p>Before Spotify wades into live audio, it may want to first solidify its own values around creator content. It will need a careful, worst-case scenario plan for what happens when a live session goes out of bounds, too.</p>
<p>Despite Ek&#8217;s optimism around live audio, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/spotify-stock-tumbles-in-the-premarket-amid-signs-subscriber-growth-is-slowing-11619615730">Spotify&#8217;s stock tumbled after earnings</a>, as there were signs of slowing growth on the horizon, thanks to increased pressure from rivals, like Apple and Amazon. The company added 3 million paid subscribers in the quarter, but missed on expectations of monthly active users and lowered its full-year guidance. Revenues were up €2.1 billion ($2.6 billion) in the quarter, a 16% increase from the same period last year but down 1% from Q4 2020, raising concerns. But live audio could give fans a reason to tune back in more often in the future, if the Spotify can make the integration work.</p>

<p>For over a decade, government agencies and consumers have pushed for this liberation.</p>

		<blockquote>
			This push for greater data liquidity coincides with demand from consumers for better information about cost and quality.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In 2009, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act <a href="https://www.asha.org/practice/reimbursement/hipaa/hitech-act/">(HITECH)</a> gave the first big industry push, catalyzing a wave of digitization through electronic health records (EHR). Today, over 98% of medical records are digitized. This market is dominated by multibillion‐dollar vendors like Epic, Cerner and Allscripts, which control 70% of patient records. However, these giant vendors have yet to make these records easily accessible.</p>
<p>A second wave of regulation has begun to address the problem of trapped data to make EHRs more interoperable and valuable. Agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services have mandated data sharing among payers and providers using a common standard, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) protocol.</p>

<p>This push for greater data liquidity coincides with demand from consumers for better information about cost and quality. Employers have been steadily shifting a greater share of healthcare expenses to consumers through high-deductible health plans — from 30% in 2012 to 51% in 2018. As consumers pay for more of the costs, they care more about the value of different health options, yet are unable to make those decisions without real-time access to cost and clinical data.</p>

<p>Tech startups have an opportunity to ease the transmission of healthcare data and address the push of regulation and consumer demands. The lessons from fintech make it tempting to assume that a Plaid for healthcare data would be enough to address all of the challenges within healthcare, but it is not the right model. Plaid’s aggregator model benefited from a relatively high concentration of banks, a limited number of data types and low barriers to data access.</p>
<p>By contrast, healthcare data is scattered across tens of thousands of healthcare providers, stored in multiple data formats and systems per provider, and is rarely accessed by patients directly. Many people log into their bank apps frequently, but few log into their healthcare provider portals, if they even know one exists.</p>
<p>HIPPA regulations and strict patient consent requirements also meaningfully increase friction to data access and sharing. Financial data serves mostly one-to-one use cases, while healthcare data is a many-to-many problem. A single patient’s data is spread across many doctors and facilities and is needed by just as many for care coordination.</p>
<p>Because of this landscape, winning healthcare technology companies will need to build around four propositions:</p>
