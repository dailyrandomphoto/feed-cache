										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The life of a tech journalist can be soul-sapping. I talk to so many founders — capable, smart, well-connected, experienced founders — who are working on problems that genuinely just don&#8217;t matter. They might have successfully raised money. Perhaps they even rounded up a team of smart people like them. They are solving problems that even if they execute everything A++ and they change the world exactly in the way they envision, even if they make their board and VCs happy, it&#8217;s ultimately so fantastically futile. I don&#8217;t want to name any names. Not to inspire existential angst, but if you&#8217;re reading this, and you&#8217;re feeling a twinge of &#8220;god what am I doing with my life,&#8221; well, sorry, friend, I am talking about you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.safely-you.com/">SafelyYou</a> reminded me of all of the above because the company is so profoundly the opposite of all of that. The team is solving a problem that is huge and will continue to grow at a rate that is absolutely terrifying:</p>
<p>&#8220;When I started this company, I didn&#8217;t even really know how big of an issue it was. I was just thinking about my own family,&#8221; said George Netscher, founder and CEO at SafelyYou. He explains that all the women in his family older than his mother have Alzheimer&#8217;s. His driving force is that it seemed as if it would be only a matter of time before the illness made its way to his mother. &#8220;As it turns out, it affects one in three people over 85, one in nine over 65. 20% of Medicare dollars are being spent in this arena, and things are about to get a lot worse. By 2030, it&#8217;s expected that the costs globally of dementia are going to double. In addition, the number of potential caregivers will be cut in half.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240477" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>SafelyYou describes a national healthcare crisis that cannot be solved with human power alone — a trend we are seeing across every aspect of the healthcare ecosystem. So instead of trying to find a way to train more nursing staff, SafelyYou is solving part of the problem with a software solution: Fall detection for patients in care and nursing homes. The company just raised its $40 million series B, led by <a href="https://www.omegahealthcare.com/">Omega Healthcare</a>, who also prepaid $10 million to install SafelyYou&#8217;s solution across close to 1,000 healthcare facilities. Also participating in the financing is SCAN Group, a mission-driven organization dedicated to keeping seniors healthy and independent. SCAN is supporting SafelyYou’s growth in order to expand the availability of its fall management technology to a wider range of older adults. SCAN Group is the parent organization of the <a href="https://www.scanhealthplan.com/">SCAN Health Plan</a>, one of the nation’s largest not-for-profit Medicare Advantage plans. The two new strategic investors join existing investors Eclipse Ventures, Foundation Capital, Founders Fund and Data Collective Venture Capital, and the new round raised SafelyYou’s venture funding total to approximately $70 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were immediately attracted to the mission of SafelyYou, which is not only an innovator and industry leader, but also supports our focus on improving senior care facilities for both staff and residents,&#8221; said Vikas Gupta, senior vice president, Acquisitions and Developments at Omega Healthcare Investors. &#8220;SafelyYou reflects our passion for improving the lives of seniors, especially those who are most vulnerable — our residents suffering from various forms of cognitive impairment including Alzheimer’s and dementia.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s technology solution is simple, but powerful. It installs cameras in each of the rooms where a care home resident might experience a fall. The feeds are all routed to a computer appliance in the care home and constantly monitored by an AI. The trick is that the cameras are not continuously recording — this is important to maintain the dignity and privacy of guests, while still promising the medical help needed. When a fall is detected, the video is recorded, and the care home team can be alerted. Because the fall itself was recorded and can be reviewed, the care team knows whether the resident hit their head on the way down or whether it was a less serious fall. Without this information, the right thing to do is always to send the resident to the hospital — but by reviewing the video, it&#8217;s possible to see whether that&#8217;s necessary.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t often do this, but I have to admit that I have a very personal story here that I&#8217;d like to share — for really stupid reasons (forgetting to eat), I sometimes faint. That happened to me a couple of months ago. When I came to, I realized I had fainted and fallen. As a very tall and very clumsy human, that&#8217;s a real problem — falling from 6.5 feet height is enough to sustain very serious head injuries. As luck would have it, I was also in the middle of recording a video presentation, so I knew there was a video recording of my fall. I reviewed it groggily and wondering if I should be dialing 911. When I saw the footage, I realized I had just gone down like a sack of potatoes, without bumping my head on anything. Shaken (but not stirred), I was able to continue with my day without a trip to the hospital, which saved me hours of my life and hundreds in dollars in co-pays (because, well, <a href="https://haje.medium.com/us-healthcare-is-so-fantastically-broken-95b2c7a6434d">healthcare in this country in so fantastically broken</a>). These types of situations are so profoundly scary — but most people aren&#8217;t willing to subject themselves to 24/7 surveillance to avoid a trip or two to the hospital. SafelyYou&#8217;s solution would have prevented this as well, but in a context where I wouldn&#8217;t have had to sacrifice my privacy to a care team.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not a repeat entrepreneur. This is a company that I plan to be with forever. I&#8217;m doing this because it is a calling. And the same is true for my whole executive team,&#8221; says Netscher. &#8220;All of us share a personal connection to Alzheimer&#8217;s disease; a very close connection, like a parent or a son with Alzheimer&#8217;s or another kind of cognitive impairment. We all think quite differently, but we&#8217;re all here for the same mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that mission is shining ever so brightly at the moment; the company has thousands of cameras out in the field and has captured more than 30,000 fall events in its history. Of course, this also means that SafelyYou is building up a unique data set of computer vision around residents falling. Understandably, that&#8217;s where a significant chunk of the money raised in this round is going.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have more [in-care home video fall] data than anyone&#8217;s ever had here. That is what enables the AI to run with such high accuracy. That enables our product in two ways. It&#8217;s not just a technology, it&#8217;s a technology-enabled care program, and there&#8217;s a pretty heavy emphasis on the human element as well. We detect when somebody had a fall with super, super high accuracy — higher accuracy than anyone&#8217;s ever had. Today, we generate one false alert per camera, every two years. We take a lot of pride in that,&#8221; explains Netscher. &#8220;We know more about falls than anybody&#8217;s ever known. We&#8217;ve watched more falls than anybody in the world. So we have this expertise that we have an obligation to share. And so we publish our learnings regularly, and we are looking at ways to use our dataset to release a bunch of additional features.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I still pinch myself that I got all these VCs to believe that this is financially scalable, when really what we care about is just helping people and our own families,&#8221; concludes Netscher.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.life-house.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Life House</a>, a boutique hotel brand that has built software aimed at helping independent hotel owners and operators, has raised $60 million in a Series C round of funding co-led by new investors Kayak and Inovia Capital.</p>
<p>Existing backers Tiger Global, Thayer Ventures, JLL, Trinity Ventures, Sound Ventures and Cooley LLP, among others, also participated in the financing, which brings the company’s total raised since its 2017 inception to just over $100 million.</p>
<p>Rami Zeidan started Life House after nearly a decade of working in different areas of the hotel industry. The New York-based company started out as a hotel brand and operator for independent hotels, developing its own software in an effort to become “the best operator.” Its goal was to fix “the broken and complex hotel operational model” before morphing into a combination of tech provider, hotel manager and boutique hotel brand.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241935" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Today, the company is announcing that in addition to the capital raise, its software is “comprehensive and mature enough” to sell directly to global hoteliers and operators that want to own the on-site management of hotels. With the move, Life House has essentially evolved from a tech-enabled hotel operator into a (70-person) SaaS company.</p>
<p>“We’ve been pretty efficient,” said CEO Zeidan. “In the past four years, we’ve spent just a little over $20 million. Now we have three times that, so we’re excited about what that’s going to translate into in terms of product.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2241949" style="width: 325px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241949" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2241949 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rami_Zeidan_Photographer_Daniel_Dorsa.jpg?w=225" alt="" width="315" height="421" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rami_Zeidan_Photographer_Daniel_Dorsa.jpg 3750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rami_Zeidan_Photographer_Daniel_Dorsa.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rami_Zeidan_Photographer_Daniel_Dorsa.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rami_Zeidan_Photographer_Daniel_Dorsa.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rami_Zeidan_Photographer_Daniel_Dorsa.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rami_Zeidan_Photographer_Daniel_Dorsa.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rami_Zeidan_Photographer_Daniel_Dorsa.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rami_Zeidan_Photographer_Daniel_Dorsa.jpg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241949" class="wp-caption-text">Founder and CEO Rami Zeidan. <strong>Image Credits: </strong>Daniel Dorsa</p></div></p>
<p>The fact that Kayak, one of the world’s largest travel sites, is one of its lead investors is notable. CEO Steve Hafner said his company plans to “reimagine the hotel experience” with Life House as its software and operations partner.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our investment will help accelerate innovation and the expansion of Kayak’s hotel initiatives,” said Hafner. “We share a vision that independent hotels can improve operations and profitability through better technology — they also have a great team and top-tier VC co-investors. Rami and team are combining hands-on operations with agile software development — it’s a great combination.”</p>
<p>Life House currently manages the operations of close to 50 hotels in North America. At the time of its $30 million Series B in January of 2020, branded hotels made up about 50% of the startup’s portfolio. Today, about 85% of its portfolio is not branded Life House and rather consists of third-party hotels that are using its software via a white-label agreement.</p>
<p>“Now we&#8217;re launching the sale of our SaaS products to third-party hotels that we don&#8217;t manage,” Zeidan told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Its software over the years has “consistently” increased its hotels profitability by over 200% and net revenues by over 45%, according to Zeidan.</p>
<p>Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Life House has grown over 600%. Put simply, the company’s mission is to serve as a one-stop shop and make it easy for anyone to own, create and operate any hotel of any shape or size and do so “maximally profitably.” It helps owners with things like revenue management and dynamic pricing, financial reporting and accounting, general operations as well as branding and design.</p>
<p>“Hotels today are complicated to operate and they&#8217;re essentially owned by people or firms as investment assets,” Zeidan told TechCrunch. “And so, the fundamental goal is to deliver profitability and value to the financial asset of the real estate. Our approach to solving this problem is being extremely profitability-centric with the platform that we&#8217;re building, so that everything that we sell to hotels directly drives an improvement in profitability.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2241947" style="width: 2130px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241947" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2241947 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Product.jpg" alt="" width="2120" height="1332" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Product.jpg 2120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Product.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Product.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Product.jpg?resize=768,483 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Product.jpg?resize=680,427 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Product.jpg?resize=1536,965 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Product.jpg?resize=2048,1287 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Product.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2120px) 100vw, 2120px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241947" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Life House</p></div></p>
<p>Life House is initially focused on small hotels where it believes owners are particularly underserved, and which represents nearly half of the market, but has plans to grow out of that in good time.</p>
<p>“We see a world where we ship iPads and we’re initially focused on small hotels where we can grow quickly with minimal competition, but there’s no reason why we can’t eventually be the best solution for any sized hotel,” Zeidan said “Our software really does care about the guest experience and can be used at the most luxurious of hotels. It has now been proven to be extremely helpful, no matter what kind of hotel it is.”</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Thus far, its hotels have ranged in size from 14 rooms to 375 rooms. It has under management a range of hotels &#8212; from a $2,000 a night chateau in the Berkshires to two motels in the Midwest.</span></p>
<p>The CEO believes that the fact that Life House was a user of its own software has been a big advantage. “It can take time to build a lot of software in the hotel management ecosystem,” he said. “But we had a really fast feedback loop that allows us to innovate really quickly. Also, we really understand hotels and guests.”</p>
<p>The new capital will largely go toward hiring, particularly software developers, product folks, engineers and building out its sales organization.</p>
<p>Inovia Associate Pranit Tukrel believes that while travelers are increasingly attracted to boutique and lifestyle independent hotels versus commoditized brand hotels, minimal tech adoption on the part of such hotels have often left them at a disadvantage compared to their larger competitors in terms of pricing, lead generation and cost management.</p>
<p>“There is a clear opportunity for Life House to manage these underserved independent hotels and provide a true economic benefit via its end-to-end technology suite,” Tukrel wrote via email. “Thanks to its strategic real estate and channel partners, LifeHouse has a unique position to become the leader in small independent hotel management. Traditional managers such as Marriott and Hilton are not investing in this end market, as it is not as rewarding in the public markets to try and win share with smaller (50 key) independent hotels versus large standardized properties.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla hasn&#8217;t yet shipped the Cybertruck, or the full-size Cyberquad that made a splashy debut at the introduction of its Blade Runner-esque pickup truck, but you can get a <a href="https://shop.tesla.com/product/cyberquad-for-kids">mini Cyberquad designed for the kiddos</a> starting in 2-4 weeks if you order one right now from its website.</p>
<p>The Tesla &#8216;Cyberquad for Kids&#8217; is available to purchase on Tesla&#8217;s site for $1,900 — a steep price relative to your average Power Wheels, but the lowest-priced vehicle in Tesla&#8217;s existing lineup by far. And the Cyberquad&#8217;s materials are a cut above your average battery electric kid car, with a &#8220;full steel frame,&#8221; along with cushioned seating and fully adjustable suspension.</p>
<p>It may be the cheapest Tesla you can buy, but it&#8217;s also the most limited when it comes to range: You&#8217;ll get up to around 15 miles on a full charge, which takes five hours to wooer up, according to the company. It&#8217;s also not going to break any land speed records, with a speedometer that tops out at 10 mph (which you can limit to a max of 5 mph for safety if desired). That&#8217;s still plenty fast for a kid&#8217;s ride-on vehicle, which is probably why Tesla labels this one as designed for kids at least 8 and up, with a max weight of 150 lbs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242071" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Cyberquad for Kids is only available in the U.S. for now, and Tesla doesn&#8217;t guarantee delivery in time for Christmas though this would be an impressive thing to unwrap under the tree (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/elon-musk-shills-a-50-tesla-cyberwhistle-with-a-joke-about-whistleblowers/">better than a whistle</a>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the actual Cybertruck that inspired it is delayed to the end of 2022, and it&#8217;s still unclear if the full-size Cyberquad will arrive then, though Elon Musk has suggested it&#8217;ll ship alongside the all-electric pickup in the past.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Technology and visual effects startup <a href="https://monstersaliensrobotszombies.com/">Monsters Aliens Robots Zombies (MARZ)</a> has raised $5.3 million in Series A funding. The investment was led by Round13 Captial with participation from Rhino Ventures and Harlo Equity Partners. MARZ plans to use the funding to grow its core VFX business and accelerate the development of its &#8216;AI for VFX&#8217; technology solutions.</p>
<p>The Toronto-based studio launched in 2018 and is developing AI solutions that aim to address some of the challenges faced by the entertainment industry regarding VFX capacity shortage spurred by streaming wars, the corresponding explosion of on-demand content and the importance of VFX in driving subscriber growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will use the funds to accelerate research and development of our ‘AI for VFX’ solutions, of which there are two AI products currently in development,&#8221; MARZ co-founder and co-president Jonathan Bronfman told TechCrunch in an email. &#8220;In line with this, funding will be allocated to the hiring of key personnel in our research, engineering and product organizations. The funding will also be used to grow our hardware capabilities and infrastructure, which will help to meaningfully shorten AI research and development, as well as increase capacity efficiency for both our AI products.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241728" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Bronfman said that while the majority of funding will be allocated to the development of proprietary AI solutions, it will also help the company accelerate its growth in its traditional VFX services business, which he says is synergistic with MARZ&#8217;s AI business.</p>
<p>The company has worked on 88 projects in its first three years since launch, including Marvel&#8217;s &#8220;WandaVision,&#8221; HBO&#8217;s &#8220;Watchmen,&#8221; Netflix&#8217;s &#8220;The Umbrella Academy&#8221; and Apple TV+&#8217;s &#8220;Invasion.&#8221; MARZ completed 13 projects in its first year, 21 in its second year and 54 in its third year.</p>
<p>MARZ has grown from 45 employees in 2019 to 194 today, with plans to grow its team to 300 over the next year. Of the current employees, more than a quarter are focused on machine learning and artificial intelligence. Although the company is based in<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Toronto, MARZ is a remote-first company with a distributed workforce based in cities around the world, including Vancouver, Winnipeg, Montreal, Madrid, Los Angeles, Melbourne, London, Moscow, Mumbai, and Mexico City.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Our mission is to democratize VFX and in doing so to empower creatives around the globe to produce the most ambitious video content possible — whether that be a streaming service or Hollywood studio, gaming studio, metaverse developer, or a talented up-and-comer who wants to integrate VFX into their social media content.&#8221; Bronfman wrote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company plans to create a suite of automated AI-driven products that are integrated into both VFX and gaming technology. <span style="font-weight: 400;">For Hollywood, MARZ&#8217;s products will aim to allow for the ability to create more ambitious content. Regarding other markets like the end consumer, Bronfman says MARZ&#8217;s solutions will aim to make VFX accessible for the first time ever. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">​​“MARZ is one of the fastest-growing VFX studios in the industry with a reputation for leveraging technology to deliver a best-in-class product within record timelines,” said Brahm Klar, a partner at Round13 Capital, in a statement. “By partnering with MARZ, alongside some of Canada&#8217;s most successful investors, we can work closely with the team to build on the company&#8217;s extraordinary success so far.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swiggy, India’s top food-delivery startup, will invest $700 million in its express grocery delivery service Instamart, significantly intensifying the competition for quick commerce in the world’s second largest market.</p>
<p>The SoftBank-backed startup, which initially launched Instamart in two Indian cities in 2020, said on Thursday that the quick grocery delivery service is now available in 18 cities and clocking over a million orders per week.</p>
<p>Fast-grocery delivery is making quick inroads in markets across the globe and investor money is piling up. Instacart plans to launch a 15-minute or less grocery delivery service in the U.S., The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/instacart-plans-15-minute-delivery-trial-as-rival-startups-grow">reported this week</a>. Deliveroo has expanded into this space in the UK; Getir of Turky is promising a 10-minute grocery delivery in Chicago.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242061" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Zapp, a UK-based startup that promises delivery of essential items within 15 to 20 minutes, is raising about $100 million in a round led by Atomico, GIC, and Lightspeed, two sources familiar with the matter told me. The round values Zepto at over $375 million, the sources said.</p>
<p>In India, too, more startups are beginning to explore the space.</p>
<p>Mumbai-based Zepto is aggressively expanding its quick-delivery startup in several Indian cities. The startup, which launched its app this year, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/31/indias-zepto-a-10-minute-grocery-delivery-app-founded-by-two-19-year-old-stanford-dropouts-raises-60-million/">announced a $60 million fundraise</a> and is already in talks to raise a much larger round, according to a source familiar with the matter. (Zomato, Swiggy&#8217;s chief rival in India, too, previously tried to enter this space but shuttered its effort after poor traction.)</p>
<p>Swiggy said it is adding one seller-run dark store to its platform each day. The startup is hoping to make its deliveries in 15 minutes by January 2022 by setting up the network of dark stores close to the majority of its customers, it said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“At our current growth trajectory, Instamart is set to reach an annualised GMV run rate of USD 1 billion in the next three quarters. With our food delivery business trending at a USD 3 billion annualised GMV run rate, and Instamart’s super-charged growth, we’re very excited about our convenience mission coming to life in a very big way,” said Sriharsha Majety, co-founder and chief executive of Swiggy, in a statement.</p>
<p>The announcement comes at a time when Swiggy, which has raised $1.25 billion this year, is finalizing a new fundraise of over $500 million that would value it at over $10 billion, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/indian-food-delivery-giant-swiggy-in-talks-to-raise-funds-at-over-10-billion-valuation/">reported two months ago</a>. Invesco is leading the round, the report said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bangalore-based Bounce on Thursday priced its first electric scooter at as low as 36,000 Indian rupees ($480), considerably undercutting the heavily-backed rival Ola as the mobility war intensifies in the world&#8217;s second most populous nation.</p>
<p>The startup, backed by B Capital and Falcon Edge, launched its first electric scooter called the Bounce Infinity E1 that features a swappable battery and several other unique features including tubular frame, hydraulic telescopic front suspension and twin shock absorbers at the rear ithat it said are designed for the Indian roads.</p>
<p>Customers will be able to swap the battery once it discharges from a nearby swapping station. The startup is building a network of swapping stations, for which it is tapping thousands of gas stations as well as mom and pop stores, in several Indian cities, Bounce said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242048" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty big, not just for us but we believe that it&#8217;s a game-changer for India as well,&#8221; said Vivekananda Hallekere, co-founder and chief executive of Bounce, in an interview with TechCrunch. The startup said it has tested the swappable battery for over 200 million kilometers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2242049" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2242049" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2242049 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-electric-vehicle.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="498" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-electric-vehicle.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-electric-vehicle.jpg?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-electric-vehicle.jpg?resize=300,146 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-electric-vehicle.jpg?resize=768,373 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-electric-vehicle.jpg?resize=680,330 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-electric-vehicle.jpg?resize=1536,746 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/india-electric-vehicle.jpg?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2242049" class="wp-caption-text">Vivekananda Hallekere, founder of Bounce, outlining the challenges holding back the adoption of EVs in India. (Image credits: TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p>Bounce has already set up a factory in the Indian state of Rajasthan and is planning to set up another one, Hallekere said. He said Bounce is setting aside $100 million to invest in the electric vehicle business in the next one year.</p>
<p>The startup is hoping that most of Infinity E1 customers will purchase the scooter without the battery. In the state of Gujarat, the variant will be available for $480 and the price will slightly vary in other states depending on government subsidies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Customers will also be able to purchase the scooter with the battery and charger for 68,999 Indian rupees ($921). Depending on the state subsidy, the price can go as low as 59,999 Indian rupees ($800; as is the case in Gujarat).</p>
<p>Those opting to go for the Bounce Infinity E1 without the battery will pay for swapping each time they replace an empty battery, the startup said. &#8220;This pushes the running costs of the scooter down substantially, by as much as 40% compared to conventional scooters,&#8221; the startup said.</p>
<p>The Bounce Infinity E1 can run as fast as 65 kmph and lasts for about 85 kilometres on one charge, the startup said. It will ship in five different colors and can be customised. Customers will also have full visibility about the vehicle&#8217;s performance as well as will have the ability to trace and remotely lock the scooter.</p>
<p>India is the world&#8217;s largest two-wheeler market. Two-wheelers &#8212; scooters and bikes &#8212; command over 80% of all vehicles sold in the country Electric vehicles are yet to make inroads in the country. In recent years, scores of entrepreneurs have started to make a push in the space as the nation attempts to cut its carbon emission. India is currently the third-largest carbon-emitter after China and the U.S.</p>
<p>SoftBank-backed Ola recently launched its electric vehicle that is priced at 99,999 Indian rupees, or $1,350. Ola has delayed the shipping of its scooter several times. It&#8217;s hoping to make its electric vehicles a big success and counting on it becoming a headline as it eyes the public markets, according to two sources familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Bounce said it will take pre-orders for the Infinity E1 scooter starting today. It will start shipping the scooter in early March.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story. More to follow&#8230;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple today released its anticipated annual list of the best apps and games of the year across iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV and Apple Watch. This year, children&#8217;s app maker Toca Boca won iPhone App of the Year for &#8220;Toca Life World,&#8221; and Riot Games&#8217; &#8220;League of Legends: Wild Rift&#8221; was the iPhone Game of the Year.</p>
<p>Other winners included the iPad App of the Year &#8220;LumaFusion&#8221; from LumaTouch; iPad Game of the Year &#8220;MARVEL Future Revolution&#8221; from Netmarble; Mac App of the Year &#8220;Craft,&#8221; from Luki Labs Limited; Mac Game of the Year &#8220;Myst,&#8221; from Cyan; Apple TV App of the Year &#8220;DAZN,&#8221; from DAZN Group; Apple TV Game of the Year &#8220;Space Marshals 3,&#8221; from Pixelbite; Apple Watch App of the Year &#8220;Carrot Weather,&#8221; from Grailr; and the Apple Arcade Game of the Year: &#8220;Fantasian,&#8221; from Mistwalker.</p>
<p>Typically, the award winners represent relative newcomers to the App Store, those who have taken advantage of Apple technologies in interesting ways, or those that gained special attention during the year. For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/apple-releases-its-best-of-2020-app-store-winners-and-most-downloaded-apps-of-the-year/">last year&#8217;s award winners</a> reflected how the pandemic played out in the world of apps, when home workout app &#8220;Wakeout!&#8221; won iPhone App of the Year and &#8220;Zoom&#8221; won for iPad.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241864" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But this year&#8217;s iPhone App of the Year, &#8220;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toca-life-world-build-stories/id1208138685">Toca Life World</a>,&#8221; is an interesting pick for another reason. Its maker, Toca Boca, this March <a href="https://twitter.com/tocaboca/status/1371884474858897409?lang=en">celebrated</a> its ten-year anniversary. In the time since the launch of its first app, the company has gone on to release over 40 other kids&#8217; apps &#8212; or as Toca Boca likes to call them, digital toys. &#8220;Toca Life World&#8221; is the culmination of a lot of this work, as it connected the prior &#8220;Toca Life&#8221; apps into one connected experience.</p>
<p>Apple praised the award winner for &#8220;still masterfully iterating on the art of play and self-expression for kids,&#8221; ten years later.</p>
<p>The pick also serves as a subtle reminder amid a year that&#8217;s seen much App Store backlash and upheaval, that developers are building long-term businesses on the App Store and Apple has helped play a role in supporting that success, including through awards like these.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today is our 10TH YEAR (yes, we&#39;re THAT old <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f633.png" alt="😳" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) making digital toys for kids and we couldn&#39;t have done it without YOU! 10 years ago we released our first app: Toca Tea Party. Since then we’ve released 40+ apps, with lots more fun in store! <a href="https://t.co/kTRJpOm3ky">pic.twitter.com/kTRJpOm3ky</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Toca Boca (@tocaboca) <a href="https://twitter.com/tocaboca/status/1371884474858897409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 16, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Apple also praised other winners, remarking how streaming service &#8220;DAZN&#8221; guided local sports culture into the global spotlight. Meanwhile, Apple is quietly building out <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/16/apple-developing-new-sportskit-framework-as-it-invests-in-sports-content-for-apple-tv/">a SportsKit framework</a> for Apple TV and iOS apps, which DAZN could one day utilize, perhaps.</p>
<p>Apple also touted &#8220;Carrot Weather&#8217;s&#8221; best-in-class meteorological forecasts, which compete with Apple&#8217;s default Weather app and use data from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/apple-acquires-dark-sky-android-version-shutting-down-in-july/">Apple-owned Dark Sky.</a> Apple promoted <a href="https://luma-touch.com/lumafusion-for-ios-2/">LumaFusion&#8217;s</a> ability to make video editing faster and less intimidating and document editor <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/luki-labs-limited/id1487937126">Craft&#8217;s</a> &#8220;efficiency and artistry.&#8221;  But it&#8217;s hard to ignore that those apps also compete with Apple products &#8212; iMovie and iWork&#8217;s Pages, respectively. If anything, much of the list is a reminder of how closely the fates of third-party apps are tied to Apple&#8217;s own software developments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The past year has been a transitional one for the App Store, which has faced increased regulatory scrutiny, new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">legislation</a> in global markets, and various lawsuits over the App Store&#8217;s commission-based business model &#8212; including the ongoing one with Epic Games, now under <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/">appeal</a>. As a result, Apple has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-will-now-let-app-store-developers-talk-to-their-customers-about-buying-direct/">adjusted</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/apple-updates-its-app-store-guidelines-to-permit-developers-to-contact-customers-about-other-payment-methods/">clarified</a> its policies and even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-lowers-commissions-on-in-app-purchases-for-news-publishers-who-participate-in-apple-news/">reduced</a> its commissions in some cases, as dictated by the market demands and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apple-announced-new-settlement-with-japan-allowing-developers-to-link-to-external-website/">settlement</a> agreements.</p>
<p>Despite the changes, the success and quality of many apps, award winners included, remains high.</p>
<p>In announcing its year-end winners, Apple also dubbed &#8220;Connection&#8221; as the top Trend of the Year and celebrated a number of apps and games that had a lasting impact on people&#8217;s lives with this theme in mind. This list included the cooperative and competitive game &#8220;Among Us!&#8221; from InnerSloth; dating and networking app Bumble (whose top rival, Match, happens to be a noted App Store critic); design resource Canva; local eatry guide focused on Black-owned businesses, EatOkra; and social network for women Peanut, which launched its audio chatrooms this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The developers who won App Store Awards in 2021 harnessed their own drive and vision to deliver the best apps and games of the year — sparking the creativity and passion of millions of users around the world,&#8221; said Apple CEO Tim Cook, in a statement. &#8220;From self-taught indie coders to inspiring leaders building global businesses, these standout developers innovated with Apple technology, with many helping to foster the profound sense of togetherness we needed this year,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The award winners will again receive physical App Store awards, which are inspired by the signature blue App Store icon, which is set into the 100% recycled aluminum used to make Apple products, with the name of the winner engraved on the other side.</p>
<p>Apple also released its lists of the most downloaded apps of the year, as usual. In the U.S., the most downloaded apps are as follows:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://gozem.co/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gozem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a super app that provides a host of services &#8212; including transport, e-commerce and financial services in Francophone Africa &#8212; has raised $5 million in Series A financing, the company confirmed to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Togo- and Singapore-based company received investment from AAIC, Thunes (TransferTo), Momentum Ventures (SMRT), Innoport Ventures (Schulte Group), CMC Ventures (National Express) and Liil Ventures (Mobility ADO)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It follows the $7 million raised in previous seed rounds via three tranches from investors such as U.S. firm Plug and Play Ventures, Launch Africa, BANSEA and Virtual Network</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In total, the multi-vertical application has raised over $12 million.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241478" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gozem </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sg.linkedin.com/in/gregorycostamagna"> Gregory Costamagna</a>, <a href="https://sg.linkedin.com/in/raphaeldana">Raphael Dana</a> and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/eajene">Emeka Ajene</a>. The startup kicked off operations in Togo in 2018 as a motorcycle ride-hailing service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A plan to replicate the model of Grab and Gojek in Southeast Asia saw Gozem expand its transport verticals to include taxi and tricycle services across </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cities in Togo and Benin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the pandemic hit, the platform halted its geographic expansion moves and went vertical. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It introduced e-commerce and logistics plays, allowing merchants to list an inventory of products users want and get them delivered through its drivers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the company launched an asset financing option for its drivers, employing a lease-to-own model for vehicles and associated equipment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a call with the founders, the chairman, Costamagna, said the three verticals work together to increase the disposable income of drivers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gozem’s premise is that it creates a win-win situation wherein its drivers become the next middle-class population in Francophone Africa while its super app plans take effect </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">flawlessly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So people [merchants, suppliers, companies] that find a lot of interest working with them [riders], will then work hard and provide a lot of different services to our customer base,” he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And when we do this, we increase their disposable income by sending them more passengers, more delivery trips by adding more merchants on our platform and finding companies that want to use delivery services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also reduce their cost of operation through asset financing because they have no formal alternative and it’s generally informal and expensive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Gozem started the lease model, it has provided up to 1,500 vehicles to drivers. Costamagna, in a statement, said the funding will help Gozem increase the figure to over 200,000 before 2025.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2241940" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241940" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2241940" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211202_002313.jpg?w=680" alt="Gozem" width="680" height="443" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211202_002313.jpg 953w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211202_002313.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211202_002313.jpg?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211202_002313.jpg?resize=768,500 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211202_002313.jpg?resize=680,443 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211202_002313.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241940" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gozem</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that Gozem is present across 13 cities, having moved to Gabon and Cameroon with over 800,000 registered users and completed more than 5 million trips, the founders say the company is setting sights on providing digital banking services and lending to its users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a model other super app companies across Africa have adopted in the past, such as Nigeria’s</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/african-fintech-opay-valued-at-2b-in-softbank-vision-fund-2-led-400m-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> OPay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (which has since shelved its super app plans to strengthen its financial services arm) and</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/the-motorcycle-ride-hailing-wars-in-nigeria-and-uganda-is-safebodas-to-lose/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SafeBoda</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more recently. Other players like North Africa-focused</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/algerias-yassir-picks-up-30m-to-build-a-super-app-in-north-africa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Yassir</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are also looking to offer banking and payment services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gozem plans to use its existing network of marketplace users (drivers and merchants) as agents across all the cities it operates in. This way, individual users can exchange cash for mobile money via the Gozem app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we have a fantastic differentiator. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally speaking, our competitors are the telco, which offers mobile money services, and sometimes you have standalone digital wallets as well,” said Costamagna</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “What we’re trying to offer is an integrated wallet solution that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is included</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a suite of different services. And so the key difference in the market is this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Francophone Africa minted its first unicorn in the form of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/sequoia-heritage-stripe-and-others-invest-200m-in-african-fintech-wave-at-1-7b-valuation/">fintech startup Wave</a>, which shed some light on the opportunities that abound in the market, Francophone Africa has been largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> left</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of the tech and startup disruption sweeping across other African regions, particularly in Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa and Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was the very reason why the founders started Gozem in the first place, they told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Almost 95% of the money and the attention goes to always four, five countries in Africa &#8230; Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, Egypt,” said Dana. “But generally, Francophone Africa is a bit left on the side on all the significant traction. This is where we’ve seen the big opportunities in Francophone as a nice market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And having built companies in Singapore </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">before</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gozem, Dana and Costamagna brought Ajene on board, adding his on-the-ground African expertise to a team with vast knowledge of the Southeast Asian market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three years in, Gozem is now 250-staff strong in its four markets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company will use the Series A financing to expand into more Francophone African countries, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Senegal and Ivory Coast</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company is also looking to improve its asset financing model while </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launching its financial services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where we operate on the continent </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is kind of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what some might call second-tier African markets. But we have an opportunity and believe in the model we’re pursuing. It’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a wide berth where there’s lesser competition, as discussed across all our verticals. While we are operating in four countries, we want to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be embedded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across the region over the next year,” Ajene said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Less than 20% of India’s 1.3 billion people speak English. But LinkedIn, the largest professional social network globally, has so far catered only to this sliver of the population in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market. On Thursday, the Microsoft-owned service said it’s beginning to change that.</p>
<p>LinkedIn has started to roll out support for Hindi on its social network, it said on Thursday. Hindi, a language spoken or understood by more than half a billion people in India and over 600 million people globally, is the first Indian regional language to be supported by the social network.</p>
<p>The company, whose service supports 25 languages, said its website and mobile apps will give users the option to access their feed, profile, and messages in Hindi. Users will also be able to create content in Hindi through LinkedIn’s desktop and mobile apps, it said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242025" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Even as India is a major market for several global services, LinkedIn has struggled to make deep inroads in the country. India accounts for just over 6% of over 1.3 billion visits LinkedIn garners in a month, according to analytics firm SimilarWeb. LinkedIn says it has over 82 million users in India, more than 20 million of whom joined the service in the last three years. LinkedIn has over 800 million users globally.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, a handful of startups are beginning to address the same problems as LinkedIn. Apna, a two-year-old startup that is helping people find jobs in India, became <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/tiger-global-led-100m-investment-makes-apna-indias-fastest-unicorn/">the youngest unicorn in the country</a> two months ago. The startup, which as of September was facilitating over 18 million job interviews each month and offers its app in multiple Indian languages, recently conducted a survey that found that 57% of users in India preferred using a vernacular interface over English.</p>
<p>Other than traction, LinkedIn has also faced challenges with keeping the top job role in India intact. In the past four years, at least three different people have been given the top LinkedIn job in India. The chain of events started after Akshay Kothari, now the chief operating officer of Notion, resigned from LinkedIn India head role in 2018.</p>
<p>The announcement on Thursday also comes less than two months after Microsoft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/microsoft-to-pull-linkedin-from-chinese-market/">shut down LinkedIn in China</a>, the world&#8217;s largest internet market, and replaced its marquee social offering with a job board.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“In India, LinkedIn has been mission critical to helping people connect, learn, grow and get hired during the pandemic and in this new world of work we are in. With the launch of Hindi, now more members and customers can unlock greater value from the platform through content, jobs, and networking, and express themselves in a language that they feel comfortable in,” said Ashutosh Gupta, India Country Manager, LinkedIn, in a post.</p>
<p>In the coming months, LinkedIn said it will work towards widening the range of job opportunities available for Hindi speaking professionals across industries. It is also looking to add more Hindi publishers and creators in the coming weeks to boost engagement in Hindi on the platform.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The startup will use the fresh capital to advance its AI-powered mobility platform and fuel autonomous driving technology development. The strategic partnership with GS Retail enables Kakao Mobility to enter the logistics and last-mile delivery business using Kakao Mobility’s transportation management system (TMS) technology that provides optimal routes for delivery vehicles. Next year, the two companies also plan to launch a pet taxi service, which allows pet owners to use taxis without putting their pets in carriers. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kakao Mobility, which launched its taxi-hailing service in 2015, was spun off from South Korea’s largest messaging app operator <a href="https://www.kakaocorp.com/page/?lang=ENG&amp;tab=all">Kakao Corp</a> in 2017 to expand into bike rental, designated driving, parking lot search service and navigation businesses. Kakao Mobility is also developing autonomous driving technology. In March 2020, it obtained permission from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOTIE) to operate its autonomous driving vehicle, which is in a pilot project, for the next five years, the company spokesperson said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kakao Mobility’s ride-hailing app has more than 30 million registered users, with 230,000 taxi drivers registered on its platform, the spokesperson noted. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to the industry sources, the company posted $237 billion in revenue as of 2020 and expects to generate profits in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Kakao Mobility is a leading startup in the mobility industry with big data and autonomous driving technology. We expect to provide new [mobility infrastructure] experience to our users through the strategic partnership,” said SungHwa Lee, head of corporate venture capital at GS Retail. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bret Taylor finds himself in a unique position in Silicon Valley: in just one week at age 42, he's accepted substantial positions at two tech powerhouses.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For even a casual observer of the tech industry, it&#8217;s been a good week for Bret Taylor: He was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-reportedly-stepping-down-from-twitter-ceo-role/">named board chair at Twitter</a> on Monday, and yesterday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/bret-taylor-has-been-promoted-to-salesforce-co-ceo/">he became the co-CEO and co-chair at a SaaS company called Salesforce</a>.</p>
<p>From outward appearances, Taylor seemed extraordinarily well positioned to influence what goes on at Twitter while simultaneously finding himself on an equal footing with Salesforce co-founder and outgoing CEO Marc Benioff.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;The co-CEO setup can be a tricky one,&#8221; advised Holger Mueller of Constellation Research.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But there was a reality check today when <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/salesforces-taylor-will-report-to-benioff-despite-co-ceo-title" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Information reported</a> that Taylor was would actually be co-CEO in name only, reporting to Benioff after all.</p>
<p>Salesforce has not responded to our request for comment on this report, but Taylor still has to be feeling pretty good about himself, regardless of his position on the company&#8217;s org chart.</p>
<p>After a stint working as a product manager on Google Maps and other services at the company, he joined Benchmark Capital in 2007 as an entrepreneur-in-residence. He eventually co-founded FriendFeed, an early social media network along with MySpace that was popular before Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and TikTok arrived on the scene.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Elon Musk’s recent announcement of an upcoming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/musk-the-tesla-bot-is-coming/">Tesla Bot</a> &#8212; complete with a human form, “human-level hands” and a characteristically optimistic delivery date &#8212; has garnered a healthy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633958/tesla-bot-elon-musk-ai-day">serving of criticism</a> for good reason.</p>
<p>Among other capabilities, Musk says, the robot will eventually be capable of running errands such as going to the grocery store alone. Boston Dynamics, which has developed the most advanced humanoid robot ever created, has spent more than a decade working on its Atlas platform. While progress has been impressive, with Atlas running, jumping and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn3KWM1kuAw">even dancing</a> in front of tens of millions of YouTube viewers, the company is quick to acknowledge that the robot is a long way from performing complex tasks autonomously.</p>
<p>One of the best examples of evolutionary robotics potential — and unfulfilled promise — goes as far back as 2010 to a study published in the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000292">PLOS Biology journal</a>. The study’s authors used physical robots equipped with motors and sensors (not just simulations) to conduct several evolutionary models and fitness goals: collision-free navigation, homing, predator-prey coevolution and more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240403" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>They concluded that “these examples of experimental evolution with robots verify the power of evolution by mutation, recombination and natural selection. In all cases, robots initially exhibited completely uncoordinated behaviour because their genomes had random values.”</p>
<p>In sum, the study concluded that “a few hundreds of generations of random mutations and selective reproduction were sufficient to promote the evolution of efficient behaviours in a wide range of environmental conditions.”</p>
<p>That requirement of so many generations of evolution is illustrated by Alphabet’s recent release of more than 100 Everyday Robot prototypes to perform cleaning chores around the Google offices — with their awkward and halting movements, the machines are still <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791267/alphabet-google-everyday-robot-project-cleaning-office-prototype">very much a work in progress</a>.</p>
<h2>Progress versus perfection</h2>
<p>I think there’s a chance Musk could actually leapfrog the competition in the field of robotics, but he’ll need some help from the robots themselves. According to many experts in the evolutionary computation space, robots capable of complicated tasks that require constant feedback or learning loops are simply too complex for humans to design directly on their own. Instead, the future of robotic development and design could be a product of “evolution” that has the robots selecting which features are most useful for a specific outcome.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Evolutionary robotics sounds like sci-fi, <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/emerging-tech/guides/your-guide-to-robotics">but it isn’t a new concept</a>. Even as early as the 1950s, Alan Turing postulated that the creation of intelligent machines would be too complex for human designers and that a better method might be introducing “mutations” and selective reproduction into the process. Of course, while the idea behind evolutionary robotics was taking shape long ago, the tools necessary to put the concept into action have only now become available.</p>
<p>For the first time in modern history, we have all the necessary building blocks to facilitate evolutionary robotics: rapid prototyping and physical reproduction using 3D printing, neural networks for learning and training, improved battery life and cheaper materials and much more.</p>
<p>NASA has already deployed artificial evolution to <a href="https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub-archive/1244h/1244%20%28Hornby%29.pdf">develop antennas for satellites</a>, for example. Even more exciting than that, creators at the University of Vermont and Tufts University in 2020 <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/news/story/scientists-create-next-generation-living-robots">unveiled “xenobots,”</a> which are “tiny biological machines first designed in computer simulations using the techniques of evolutionary robotics.”</p>
<p>These self-healing biological machines were built using frog stem cells, and they exhibited the ability to move and push payloads; the thought is that these “nanorobots” could one day be used to deliver drugs after being injected into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>But even with all these breakthroughs, evolutionary iterations in physical robots remain time-consuming, partly because of the risk involved. Even a task like going grocery shopping is deceivingly complex, and a variety of robotic mistakes like crossing a street in front of traffic could put humans in danger.</p>
<h2>So many possibilities</h2>
<p>Musk is correct that his existing Tesla cars are simply robots on wheels, but it’s a gross oversimplification. Teslas are specialized for a single task and incapable of the self-learning necessary to navigate a complex world without direct supervision. He may have at his disposal a supercomputer, already advanced robots and a phenomenal team of AI experts, but delivering a humanoid robot capable of independently venturing out into public is likely a long way off.</p>
<p>Creating a robot that can operate on its own would likely require several hundred “generations” of evolution in which robots perform mutations and combine the most desirable traits from two different parents.</p>
<p>To daydream some useful real-world applications, think along the lines of security and recon, building safety inspections and code compliance, firefighting assistance or even search and rescue assistance.</p>
<p>In June 2021, a beachfront tower of condos collapsed in Surfside, Florida, claiming close to 100 lives. A great example of the usefulness of drone swarms would be building and code inspections: They could perform much more regular and frequent inspections of aging condo buildings — from the top floor to the bottom, inside and out — using sensors and cameras to check for waterproofing issues, concrete spalling and cracks, sinking and other problems. This could be done at the fraction of the cost of a team of human engineers.</p>
<p>Other useful applications for events include security and medical assistance. Think of the recent Astroworld tragedy in Houston. At a 100,000-person event, it can often be difficult to cover expansive and crowded terrain with human security personnel. A drone or robot swarm can be very helpful in this regard, monitoring for security issues, fights, people having seizures or other medical emergencies and even bringing medical devices such as an automatic external defibrillator much faster than human staff could.</p>
<p>Why a drone swarm and not a single drone? Quite a few reasons, but chiefly resilience and redundancy. If one drone fails, the operation continues uninterrupted. This is particularly helpful for high-risk situations in which the “mission” cannot be aborted.</p>
<h2>Creating better robots</h2>
<p>The term &#8220;evolutionary robotics&#8221; is a bit misleading because it’s really about replicating processes learned from organic evolution to non-organic devices. A better descriptor might be “artificial evolution” or “embodied evolution.” It’s not so much the robots that are evolving, but rather the processes themselves that are creating an evolution.</p>
<p>The same approach could be applied to any entity that can be equipped with a neural network and evolutionary algorithms to create “offspring” through both mutation and subsequent recombination from two or more parents. In fact, evolution doesn’t even need a physical form — these same processes can be deployed inside supercomputers to solve major problems. What could a better understanding of evolution help us accomplish?</p>
<p>Autonomous real-world interactions, for one. Evolutionary robotics is the only way to create robots capable of complex, autonomous real-world interaction. The benefits of such robots are too long to list, but use cases could range from robotic firefighters and search-and-rescue robots to nuclear waste cleanup robots, home care robots and more.</p>
<p>We could also gain a better understanding of organic evolution. A more nuanced knowledge of evolution could have such broad applications that it’s difficult to fathom. We could gain incredible insights into the best ways to treat diseases and build immunities, improve our life spans, lessen our impact on the ecological world and otherwise gain a better grasp of our future on this planet.</p>
<p>We could also garner clues into life’s origins. By studying and mastering artificial evolution, we’ll be able to better understand all the possible ways life could form and evolve on other planets. Although the possibility of life existing elsewhere in the universe remains low according to many scientific experts, a better understanding of evolution and the ability to replicate macroevolution on a micro scale will undoubtedly help guide us in any search for extraterrestrial life.</p>
<h2>A double-edged sword</h2>
<p>Finally, think about a deeper exploration of our solar system. With fully autonomous, self-replicating and evolving robots, we could send unmanned missions deep into space — farther than we’ve ever imagined. These robots would be able to adapt to whatever planet they landed on, reusing components, evolving according to their environment and eventually sending data or offspring back to Earth.</p>
<p>If the idea of robots roaming the streets conjures images of a &#8220;Terminator&#8221;-like robot uprising, you can take solace in the fact that a robot capable of learning, reproducing, observing its environment and evolving is still a long way from reality.</p>
<p>Instead, the biggest drawback to mastering truly autonomous robots capable of complex real-world interaction is the inevitable displacement of the human workforce. Musk believes the solution for this is universal basic income and that work in the future will be entirely optional.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I agree. Humans derive a sense of self-worth and value from working and creating, and to take that away could have far-reaching psychological impacts in addition to the potential financial fallout. It’s a complex problem, but evolutionary robotics could be one of the greatest achievements and biggest challenges humanity will have to face.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new study claims that Amazon makes far more from fees on its Marketplace platform than even the cash cow known as AWS. The report says that Amazon&#8217;s fees for participating effectively on its store have grown to the point where sellers now give the company about 34% of their earnings — and this has lately become Amazon&#8217;s primary revenue stream. The company disputes the report&#8217;s findings.</p>
<p><a href="https://ilsr.org/amazons-toll-road/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The report, &#8220;Amazon&#8217;s Toll Road,&#8221; by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance</a>, makes two primary claims. First, the ILSR&#8217;s researchers say that in 2021 Amazon will bring in some $121 billion from sellers in the form of fees and advertising payments, about 34% of those sellers&#8217; total revenue. That&#8217;s twice the estimated $60 billion from 2019, which at the time was 31% of seller revenue, according to the report.</p>
<p>Founder Jeff Bezos himself attempted to counter this narrative when he told Congress that the increasing amount of money going from sellers to Amazon is something of an optical illusion, due to more of them choosing to pay for add-on services like better placement on keyword searches and using Amazon&#8217;s own shipping and warehouse infrastructure.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241854" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In a statement to TechCrunch, Amazon called the ILSR report &#8220;inaccurate,&#8221; saying it &#8220;conflates Amazon’s selling fees with our optional add-on services&#8221; and that its selling fees are competitive with other online retailers — and certainly the report does combine those numbers.</p>
<p>But as its author, Stacy Mitchell, points out, the add-ons have gone from optional to must-have as Amazon has given advantage after advantage to sellers that use them. Reports over the last few years show that the number of ads and sponsored listings on common product searches have <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/9/16/20868514/amazon-sponsored-content-ads-growing-jumpshot-antitrust" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased dramatically</a>. And Amazon <a href="https://promarket.org/2019/11/06/how-amazon-rigs-its-shopping-algorithm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gives a score bonus</a> to sellers using the &#8220;Fulfilled By Amazon&#8221; service, which contributes strongly to whether a product gets certain coveted spots in the listings. And this is without considering the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-rigging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shady business</a> of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-changed-search-algorithm-in-ways-that-boost-its-own-products-11568645345" target="_blank" rel="noopener">duplicating successful products</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon did not address the claim that sellers are spending 4-5 times as much on ads and placement today as they did in 2016, contributing to the huge increase in income. The company merely said there is a range of ad types and processes, and that it&#8217;s &#8220;a great way for sellers to help increase the visibility of their products.&#8221; It denied that it favors FBA users in search results, though as the link above shows, it seems to do so by indirect means.</p>
<p>The other claim made by the report is that Amazon is using creative accounting to mask the enormous revenues generated by seller fees, grouping the huge profits of the Marketplace division with enormous losses incurred in building out their shipping infrastructure. Sure, they&#8217;re related — but it&#8217;s hardly forthcoming to present an aggregate of two wildly different numbers and claim it represents the business accurately. This is not a new allegation, but Mitchell puts specific numbers on it for 2020, making it more than a general idea.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2241908" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AmazonTollRoad-Graph-Profits.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241908" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2241908" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AmazonTollRoad-Graph-Profits.jpg" alt="A diagram showing how one aggregate number might misrepresent the actual profits and losses happening within Amazon." width="1024" height="622" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AmazonTollRoad-Graph-Profits.jpg 1090w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AmazonTollRoad-Graph-Profits.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AmazonTollRoad-Graph-Profits.jpg?resize=300,182 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AmazonTollRoad-Graph-Profits.jpg?resize=768,466 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AmazonTollRoad-Graph-Profits.jpg?resize=680,413 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AmazonTollRoad-Graph-Profits.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2241908" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ILSR</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We conclude that seller fees likely generate more profit than AWS. This contradicts conventional wisdom about the company; news stories commonly describe AWS as the source of most of Amazon’s earnings,&#8221; writes Mitchell in the summary. &#8220;Drawing on analysts&#8217; estimates of the margins Amazon likely earns on seller advertising and other seller fees, we find that Marketplace may have generated operating profits of $24 billion in 2020 — significantly more than the $13.5 billion in profit that Amazon reported for AWS. AWS has long been seen as Amazon’s cash cow. But this report finds that the tech giant has a second cash cow, which it keeps quietly out of view.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amazon told me that it &#8220;cannot speculate&#8221; on 2021 revenue numbers during the year but did not respond to a follow-up question asking whether the previous years&#8217; numbers in the ILSR report were accurate.</p>
<p>Some of these practices are under scrutiny by various government powers, including an FTC led by perhaps now the world&#8217;s most famous questioner of Amazon&#8217;s business practices, Lina Khan. The ILSR report is merely informative and Amazon can wave it away, but if an FTC task force is looking into similar questions and drawing similar conclusions, the company may have reason to start sweating.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for December 1, 2021! Yes, we’ve made it to the final inning of the year, which means that the news cycle will slow and we all get some time off? Right? Probably not, but in <em>alternative</em> good news, <a href="https://twitter.com/bheater" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Heater’s</a> robotics newsletter launches tomorrow. It’s called <strong>Actuator</strong> and it is going to kick maximum backside. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Snag it here!</a> —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a></p>
<p><em>P.S. </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/blue-origins-ariane-cornell-is-coming-to-tc-sessions-space-2021/"><em>Blue Origin’s Ariane Cornell is coming to TC Sessions: Space 2021!</em></a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241735" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/china-banning-foreign-ipos-would-be-pretty-unsurprising/">China may ban foreign IPOs:</a> </strong>Big news from a leading startup market as reporting indicates that the Chinese government may block a method by which domestic tech companies are listed on foreign exchanges. Alibaba and others have used the technique, which opens the door for further economic and technological decoupling between China and the rest of the world.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/match-settles-lawsuit-with-tinder-co-founders-for-441-million/"><strong>Match settles with Tinder co-founders:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Allegations that “IAC and its then-subsidiary Match Group had manipulated financial data” to put a low valuation on Tinder when it was folded into the larger company have been settled for more than $400 million. That’s a right bucket of duckets.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/federal-lorex-surveillance-ban/"><strong>Taxpayer money to support Chinese surveillance?</strong></a> In a critical piece of reporting, TechCrunch&#8217;s Zack Whittaker writes that “at least three U.S. federal agencies, including the military, have purchased China-made video surveillance equipment banned from use in the federal government.” Not good!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we dive into a bevy of discrete pieces of startup news, another 3D printing company is going public! Via a SPAC! This time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/3d-printing-company-essentium-set-to-go-public-via-spac/">it’s Austin-based Essentium</a>. Recall <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/desktop-metal-going-public-in-spac-led-deal-that-could-value-3d-printer-company-at-2-5b/">that Desktop Metal went public via a SPAC previously</a>. Its stock traded as high as $34.94. It is worth $6.08 per share today.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/sounding-board-lands-series-b-to-move-coaching-beyond-services-and-into-saas/">From coaching to SaaS:</a> </strong>Providing coaching to corporate staff is big business, but it remains, at its core, a human game. That means modest margins. Sounding Board is moving from the coaching world into the coaching <em>software</em> industry, which helped it land a $30 million Series B. Jazz Venture Partners led the round, which is a firm I had not heard of before.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/butter-raises-7m-to-end-accidental-churn-due-to-payment-failure/"><strong>Butter wants to cut the churn:</strong></a><strong> </strong>To avoid making an extensive butter/churn joke that would surely get cut before this newsletter reaches you, let it suffice to say that Butter, a startup, is in the anti-churn game. Yes, Butter doesn’t want you to have to churn all by yourself. See? Impossible to avoid. Regardless, the company just added $7 million to its accounts to help companies avoid losing revenue to payments issues.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/ai-does-pure-mathematics-and-protein-hallucination/"><strong>What’s AI good for?</strong></a> A lot, it turns out. Our own Devin Coldewey has notes on how AI is showing promising signs as a solution for both protein generation and mathematics. Startups, take note!</li>
<li>And speaking of AI, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/sydney-based-medtech-startup-harrison-ai-gets-129m-aud-led-by-horizons-ventures/"><strong>Sydney-based Harrison.ai has raised $129 million</strong></a> (AUD) for its work to build medical tech using artificial intelligence.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/goalsetter-raises-15-million-to-go-b2b-with-childrens-financial-literacy-app/"><strong>Goalsetter is taking on youth financial literacy:</strong></a> Let’s be clear, most people are bad with money. This is for a number of reasons, including the simple fact that financial education in the U.S. is weak at <em>best</em>. Kid-focused financial platform Goalsetter wants to work on the matter by tying child access to allowances and the like to learning more about money.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/republic-acquires-the-uks-seedrs-in-100m-deal-to-push-into-europe/"><strong>Republic buys Seedrs:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Republic helps private-market shares trade in the United States. Seedrs helped U.K.-based companies crowdfund equity rounds. Now, thanks to a $100 million deal, the American company will own the European concern.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/supernet-credit-card-cannabis-weed-dispensaries/"><strong>Do you want a weed credit card?</strong></a><strong> </strong>Buying legal cannabis is a pain in the neck in the United States, thanks to both historically racist laws and neo-Puritan forces. Regardless, SuperNet has built a credit card that will work for, and with, dispensaries. A small step, but a welcome one.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/nuro-draft/"><strong>Nuro + 7/11 = autonomous deliveries in California:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Yes, another week, another news item of a small-scale self-driving service making its way to market. While I am not sure that Slurpee delivery is the real killer app for autonomous delivery, I would try this out for no other reason than to encourage more of the same.</li>
<li>And if you need even more, the Equity crew <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/have-we-reached-peak-founder-friendliness/">recently dug into</a> the matter of founders, CEO status and when a company might outgrow its progenitor as chief exec.</li>

<p>Every blog post, Tweet and Instagram Story is an opportunity to explain to customers (and the board) how the company creates value or is a step ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>But quality will always beat quantity when it comes to content marketing; Googlebot may be hungry for new links, but potential customers demand expertise and insights.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/how-to-execute-an-amplified-marketing-strategy/">Marketers need a new plan of action</a> that puts creativity before quantity, audience before engine, and sets connection as the top priority,&#8221; says Lindsay Tjepkema, CEO of audio and video content marketing platform Casted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snapdragon&#8217;s G3x is Qualcomm&#8217;s fantastically exciting bid to embrace the gaming market — a brand new reach for the manufacturer, which introduces powerful GPUs, 5G-enabled connectivity, the ability to power external screens, immersive audio capabilities, haptic feedback and a slew of other features that handheld gaming manufacturers have had to cobble together from other sources. Uniting all of this in a single platform is new — and might mean a renaissance of handheld gaming, unlike anything we&#8217;ve ever seen before. Razer today showed off a developer kit based on the new platform, kick-starting an exciting new era in handheld gaming.</p>
<p>The rapid development in mobile phone technologies have been unlocking new products in all sorts of categories for a couple of decades. People are now so used to iPads that we don&#8217;t accept crappy airline check-in kiosks anymore. We&#8217;re so used to excellent battery life and high-speed internet, that anything that falls short of it sparks impatience and frustration. Relatively affordable consumer-grade quadcopter drones only became possible when accelerometers and processors became cheap enough for consumer electronics tinkerers to take existing components and put them together in new and interesting ways.</p>
<p>The march of technology advances is never-ending — and it&#8217;s ever so exciting to see <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apple-m1-max-launched/">Apple launch its own ludicrously powerful processors</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/with-tensor-google-bets-on-its-own-chip-design-for-the-pixel-6/">when Google shows off the Tensor processors in the newest-generation Pixel phones</a>, you&#8217;d better believe we lean in for a closer look. These are technologies that will have far-reaching impacts in the computing world, but they live in the siloed universes of Apple and Google respectively. Fun, sure, but where the real impact of new processors can be felt by the startup-loving readership of this very publication, is when the OEM manufacturers flex their vision for the future. In short — as a startup, you&#8217;re probably not going to be able to get your hands on an Apple M1 Max or a Google Tensor for your own hardware devices. The same isn&#8217;t true for Qualcomm and its Snapdragon silicon.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240815" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Qualcomm is in the unusual space of making processors that are powering the entire world around us. This is the technology that&#8217;s going to be powering everything from fridges to cars to drones to … well, anything you can possibly imagine, really. SnapDragon 8 lives in smartphones across the world. The 4100+ platform powers wearables. XR2 with its 5G chipset is going to be doing the heavy lifting for AR/VR applications. The 8cx processors will be living in tablets and PCs — and we&#8217;ve seen the Snapdragon Ride platform turn up in cars. Seeing Qualcomm taking a serious look at the gaming market is interesting, taking deep niche products like the Nintendo Switch and giving hardware manufacturers a toolkit to build their own, powerful handheld gaming console platforms.</p>
<p>More than just tossing together a pile of chips and wishing console developers a happy journey, Qualcomm made the ever-so-shrewd move to partner with gaming veteran Razer to build a developer kit, so software developers can start getting busy while the hardware manufacturing world spools up its product development afterburners.</p>
<p>The Snapdragon G3x Gen 1 Gaming Platform delivers cutting-edge performance and the entire arsenal of Snapdragon Elite Gaming technologies to run all Android games, play content from cloud gaming libraries, stream games from a home console or PC and much more. Available today, the platform is a battle cry for market dominance — and it&#8217;s going to be spectacularly interesting to see this one play out.</p>

<p>The platform has a lot that is particularly interesting, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Qualcomm Adreno GPU, which promises 144 frames per second and 10-bit HDR for gaming in over a billion shades of color.</li>
<li>A built-in 1080p60 webcam with two microphones for livestreaming the gaming action to audiences.</li>
<li>A full battery of connectivity options using Qualcomm&#8217;s FastConnect 6900 Mobile Connectivity suite. That means Wi-Fi 6 and 6E for low latency and fast upload and download speeds. 5G mm Wave and sub-6 for cloud gaming while streaming the most bandwidth-intensive games from services like Xbox Cloud Gaming or Steam Remote Play.</li>
<li>Incredible display: 6.65-inch OLED display with Full HD+ resolution and 10-bit HDR, operating at up to 120 hz.</li>
<li>Snapdragon Sound technology, optimized for quality, latency and robustness, giving gamers the option to pinpoint opponents aurally. On-device 4-way speakers provide fantastic audio and when paired with Snapdragon Sound-enabled earbuds, gamers can experience lag-free wireless audio.</li>
<li>Multiscreen experience can tether to an AR/VR viewer via USB-C. The same tech also enables the device to act as a companion controller to a TV with up to 4K resolution.</li>
<li>Controls: The developer kit has built-in controller mapping from AKSys to provide precise touch to controller mapping technology to enable use of the built-in controllers across a wide array of games.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Razer is extremely excited to partner with Qualcomm Technologies and support them on their way to introduce new cutting-edge technology to the global gaming industry,” says Min-Liang Tan, Razer co-founder and CEO. “Together, Qualcomm Technologies and Razer will lead the way with new and innovative solutions that push the boundaries of fidelity and quality available in portable gaming, transforming the way these games are experienced.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The fintech giant Square is changing its name to <a href="https://www.block.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Block</a>, effective December 10. The name change, which has been in the works for <a href="https://twitter.com/Square/status/1466158918724472837" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over a year</a>, is intended to house the company&#8217;s various products &#8212; including music streaming service Tidal, Cash App, TBD, and of course, Square &#8212; under one brand.</p>
<p>This announcement comes just days after Square founder and CEO Jack Dorsey <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-reportedly-stepping-down-from-twitter-ceo-role/">stepped down</a> from his CEO role at Twitter, which he also co-founded.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re changing our company name so we can give the full <a href="https://twitter.com/Square?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Square</a> brand to our Seller business. So now we need a name to tie <a href="https://twitter.com/Square?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Square</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/CashApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CashApp</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/TIDAL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TIDAL</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/TBD54566975?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TBD54566975</a> together into one. That name is “Block.” Why? <a href="https://t.co/vVSKNnMUU3">https://t.co/vVSKNnMUU3</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241817" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&mdash; Square (@Square) <a href="https://twitter.com/Square/status/1466158910067388423?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>“We built the Square brand for our Seller business, which is where it belongs,” said Dorsey in a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211201006139/en/Square-Inc.-Changes-Name-to-Block" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a>. “Block is a new name, but our purpose of economic empowerment remains the same. No matter how we grow or change, we will continue to build tools to help increase access to the economy.”</p>
<p>The name Block is also a nod to the company&#8217;s growing interest in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. The existing Square Crypto product will also be renamed to Spiral.</p>
<p>&#8220;Block references the neighborhood blocks where we find our sellers, a blockchain, block parties full of music, obstacles to overcome, a section of code, building blocks, and of course, tungsten cubes,&#8221; the company <a href="https://twitter.com/Square/status/1466158911413760004" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in a Tweet</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Square isn&#8217;t the first major tech company to rebrand this year, of course. Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/#:~:text=Facebook%20creator%20Mark%20Zuckerberg%20announced,our%20company%20is%20now%20Meta.">changed its corporate branding</a> to Meta just over a month ago, as the company faced increased scrutiny <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the press</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">in Congress</a>. But like Square, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg felt that the Facebook brand didn&#8217;t represent the company&#8217;s growth to include products like Instagram, WhatsApp, Horizon and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-errr-meta-unceremoniously-kills-off-oculus-brand/">Quest</a>.</p>
<p>Square even referenced the timing of this rebrand in its <a href="https://twitter.com/Square/status/1466158911413760004" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a>: &#8220;Not to get all meta on you … but we&#8217;re going to!&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/the-next-generation-of-global-payments-afterpay-square/">Afterpay agreed to merge</a> with Square. The company&#8217;s Cash App also recently expanded to allow teens aged 13 to 17 to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/squares-cash-app-opens-up-to-teens-ages-13-to-17-with-parental-oversight/#:~:text=Square's%20Cash%20App%20opens%20up,17%20with%20parental%20oversight%20%7C%20TechCrunch">open accounts</a> with parental oversight, while Tidal is preparing for a shift toward <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/tidal-is-investing-direct-artist-payments-a-step-toward-fair-streaming-payouts/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">direct artist royalty payments</a> in the new year.</p>
<p>Block&#8217;s NYSE ticker symbol SQ will remain the same. The company also added that there will be no organizational changes at this time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;re just starting to build out a smart home, look no further than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/smart-home-gift-guide-ideas/">Zack Whittaker&#8217;s excellent starter kit guide</a>, which should lay the groundwork for a connected home experience. But if you&#8217;ve already taken the plunge and find yourself with the key ingredients in place for a smart home, let&#8217;s look at some options that can take it to the next level for a truly divine digital domicile.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this guide, I&#8217;m going to assume that the giftee on your list (which can be you, no shame) already has a lot of the basics in place, like smart lighting, a connected thermostat, etc. That said, I&#8217;m going to specifically suggest a few things that work with particular brands of the above, like the Philips Hue smart lighting system, which I continue to maintain is the best and most consistently reliable.</p>

<h2>Lights you never think about</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2241638" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hue-sensors.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241638" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2241638" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hue-sensors.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="733" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hue-sensors.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hue-sensors.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hue-sensors.jpg?resize=300,220 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hue-sensors.jpg?resize=768,563 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hue-sensors.jpg?resize=680,498 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hue-sensors.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2241638" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Signify</p></div></p>
<p>I have long had smart lighting, across multiple homes over many years. But only more recently did I introduce a key quality-of-life upgrade into the mix that made smart lighting more than just a convenience and into something much more transformative that I now really couldn&#8217;t live without.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about motion sensors. It may seem simple, but I at first balked at picking any up because they&#8217;re actually fairly pricy and rarely go on sale. Specifically, the ones I find the best are the Hue sensors, including both their indoor and outdoor versions depending on your needs. I&#8217;ve tried HomeKit sensors (and the Hue sensors can act as HomeKit sensors, too) but they just don&#8217;t work as reliably as when you&#8217;re working within Hue&#8217;s ecosystem with its own smart lights and sensors.</p>
<p>Even after I stopped being amazed by it, guests have many times commented on how remarkable it is to walk through our house and have lights just &#8220;magically&#8221; turn on when they enter a room or area. Being able to change the light&#8217;s intensity and other behavior based on time of day is also key.</p>

<p>I walk the dog every morning and one thing I&#8217;ve become very accustomed to is checking the weather to see how to dress before I leave. A range of apps can offer local forecasts, and a lot are even quite granular, but nothing compares to being able to check the weather immediately outside your door from your device.</p>
<p>There are a number of connected weather stations available, but the best for me in terms of value for money, features and privacy is the Eve Weather. It&#8217;s specifically made for HomeKit, so it&#8217;s best for people already in the Apple connected home ecosystem, but if that is you or the person you&#8217;re shopping for, the Eve Weather is perfect.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an IPX4 water resistance-rated aluminum puck, powered by a single CR2450 replaceable battery. It sets up in minutes, handles all connectivity locally and works with Siri for voice requests about weather conditions. The Eve Weather tracks temperature, as well as humidity and barometric pressure, and can provide you with weather trends for up to 12 hours based on all those signals.</p>

<p>In general, I don&#8217;t put a lot of stock in connected kitchen gadgets (see what I did there) but some of the more experienced appliance makers have started to figure out where it makes sense to add smarts to old favorites, and how to do so in a way that results in a reliable and consistent piece of hardware.</p>
<p>Instant Pot is a regular Black Friday shopper&#8217;s favorite, but this year it&#8217;s worth taking a special look at one item in their increasingly vast range: The Instant Pot Pro Plus Smart Multi-Cooker. This 6-quart cooker has all the pressure cooking goodness you expect out of the brand, as well as steaming, sous vide, rice cooking and more, but it also integrates with a receipt app powered by smart cooking company Drop.</p>
<p>The recipes are great and a nice feature, but my main reason for suggesting this Instant Pot versus others is the handy remote control of functions like cooking time and pressure level, as well as remote pressure release right from your device via the Instant Brands app.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve included the Brilliant Control in past TC Gift Guides, but it really is just that good, and usage over time has only reinforced that. The Brilliant Control is a touchscreen smart home controller that you install in place of a standard light switch using existing wiring (it&#8217;s easy to do regardless of your level of skill and experience — just remember to cut power at the breaker).</p>
<p>The Brilliant Control panels all include a built-in camera for local network-based video intercom functionality, and the software is compatible with a wide range of smart home devices, including Sonos systems, Hue lights, Ring doorbells and many more. You can assign specific lights and speakers to individual panels, too, so that they can control specifically the lights and playback in the room they&#8217;re in.</p>
<p>I can recall some adventurous smart home DIY pioneers trying to cobble together a system like this using iPod touches and hacky mounts, but Brilliant makes it remarkably easy to build a smart home system that rivals a lot of those you&#8217;ll find in expensive custom pre-build installations. They also come in up to four-switch panels for whatever bank of switches you want to replace.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Varies based on configuration; as pictured above, <a href="https://www.brilliant.tech/products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$449 from Brilliant</a></p>

<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s Greg Kumparak dropped by to add this one:</p>
<blockquote><p>Being able to lock your front door from an app — or, better yet, with your voice while lying in bed — rules.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using Yale&#8217;s smart door lock for years, and I&#8217;ve been nothing but pleased. There&#8217;s a Nest x Yale version for people in Google&#8217;s ecosystem, or the slightly more expensive &#8220;Assure&#8221; model that&#8217;s more broadly compatible with Google, Alexa, HomeKit, etc. The battery life is solid (4 AAs. Buy rechargeables!), and if you somehow ignore the loud &#8220;battery low&#8221; warning for too long, a 9V battery will kick-start it long enough to let you punch in your PIN.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s arguments to be made that physical security shouldn&#8217;t be trusted to the cloud … but, for most people, I&#8217;d counter that a burglar is more likely to bust in through your window than they are to hack your spaceman door lock.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fairly easy to install, but make sure to double-check it&#8217;s physically compatible with your door — and even if it is, don&#8217;t be surprised if you have to do some sanding/chiseling to make everything sit just right.</p></blockquote>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">It seems like just yesterday that exchanges like Coinbase opened the eyes of the traditional economy to the benefits that cryptocurrencies offer as an asset class.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies and other decentralized technologies have created applications that promise to create real social value by offering an automated way to establish trust, but at a much lower cost than traditional intermediaries (banks and governments) that have monopolized trust as a service.</p>
<p>Building on the decentralized revolution, forward thinkers are already talking about the next big breakthrough — the decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO — that can guarantee trust at the organizational level. But while the problems DAOs might solve are real, DAO proponents misunderstand the nature of these problems and offer a tool that creates more harm than benefit.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241545" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Decentralized applications are built on smart contracts &#8212; algorithms that run when predetermined conditions are met and, by doing so, automate common decisions. Smart contracts create trust by guaranteeing predictability; when a predetermined set of actions occur, you will get paid in tokens.</p>
<p>Enthusiasts look at DAOs as the next logical step to this trust-building process by bundling a series of smart contracts to create what they describe as a smart “organization” &#8212; where business decisions like inventory control, cash management, pricing and even hiring are made based on predetermined inputs.</p>
<p>For an extreme example, think about an Amazon third-party reseller. This business operates on a number of simple inputs &#8212; the level of interest in its various products, the cost of raw materials and production at different facilities, shipping costs and so on. Based on these predetermined inputs, the value for an investor of the business should be pretty simple to determine, and a DAO would eliminate managers making bad — or self-interested — decisions.</p>
<p>Business owners are constantly making decisions that may be suboptimal from an investor perspective for reasons that are at best opaque and far too often made for personal benefit. For example, the decision to switch to a higher-cost manufacturer could be a hedge against product returns based on poor quality, or it could be because the new manufacturer is the owner’s cousin.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With a DAO, the entire business could be run with no humans at all, with all decisions made by a series of smart contracts. If a certain line of products is not selling, production decreases automatically, and price may also decrease until inventory is reduced. As sales increase, production increases. As production costs increase, price increases and so on. And profits would accrue to DAO investors that had, in turn, made investment decisions made based on preset (and preapproved) smart contracts.</p>
<p>But this very reliance on smart contracts solving small problems remains subject to what proponents misleadingly call the edge cases. What if there is a strike or a fire at a manufacturer? It is hard to imagine a smart contract anticipating better than a human manager when it is safe to resume placing orders with them.</p>
<p>This is why businesses use traditional contracts in addition to smart contracts &#8212; the reality is that the world of business relationships is far more messy and multivalent than can be predicted by a series of smart contracts. DAOs, of course, could continue to retain humans (as employees or as consultants) to solve these kinds of edge cases, but I question whether humans would want to get called in to clean up smart contract messes.</p>
<p>Decentralized finance has created value by more effectively validating quantifiable economic decisions. This has been successful because an automated trust mechanism for simple (or even complex) transactions has a simple metric (economic value) to measure the benefit of the decision.</p>
<p>But there is a profound difference between solving for trust in transactions and creating trust in relationships, let alone in organizations or communities. People gain economic value from transactions, but they gain other, different kinds of value from being a part of relationships and organizations. From being a part of an organization, we derive a sense of place, and from this sense of place, ultimately a sense of self.</p>
<p>This sense of place is derived from the web of reciprocal relationships that are constantly being renegotiated between one another and within a group. And in an organizational relationship, we constantly have to weigh between competing values in making a decision &#8212; should I do something that doesn’t make economic sense, but makes it more likely that someone will help me in the future?</p>
<p>Pierre Bourdieu described the totality of these values as a field and stressed that each person’s field is constituted differently based on their accumulated historical and cultural circumstances. According to Bourdieu, to master these relationships, one needs not an all-purpose algorithm, but an intuition that he called a “sense of the game.”</p>
<p>This sense of the game is what separates a visionary from a good businessman. And, more importantly, it is what separates a good person from a good manager. For me, the ultimate proof that a DAO can replace our existing flawed business organizations is when a smart contract can decide that it is a good time to give an employee the day off. If you are a DeFi enthusiast, that should be your challenge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Credit card companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/everyone-loves-bnpl/">are seeking to push further</a> into the “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) market. American Express (Amex) announced today that it plans to partner with Opy, the U.S. subsidiary of Australian fintech Openpay, to allow all of its U.S. cardmembers to pay in installments for qualifying purchases in the healthcare and automotive segments.</p>
<p>The partnership is American Express’s first third-party BNPL agreement in the United States, a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch in an email. Amex will help onboard merchants in these sectors onto its platform.</p>
<p>Opy describes its solution as an improved version of the traditional BNPL model, which it calls “buy now, pay smarter.” Opy will lend up to $20,000 at once to a customer, charging them a fixed fee and offering plans as long as 24 months, unlike the shorter-term installments offered by companies like Affirm and Klarna.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241698" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>American Express <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/buy-now-pay-later/2020/american-express-expands-bnpl-options-for-cardholders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already offers</a> its own BNPL options under its “Pay it Plan it” program launched in 2017 for purchases above $100, which also offers a fixed interest rate. The Opy partnership will help Amex meet demand for options to finance large purchases over longer periods of time, Opy U.S. CEO Brian Shniderman told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“If it&#8217;s a big item &#8212; and this is where we specialize &#8212; things that are $1,000 to $20,000, 60 days isn&#8217;t really enough time to pay off something that&#8217;s more expensive,” he said.</p>
<p>The company is able to offer lower rates, never higher than 9.99%, because it targets very specific sectors that attract financially savvy customers, per Shniderman. Its average customer is 40 years old, while many other BNPL providers’ average customers are in their 20s, he added. Besides healthcare and automotive, Opy offers financing for home improvement and educational certification, though those two verticals are not set to be included in the Amex partnership.</p>
<p>“[Our product is] predictable, transparent. If you look at the other buy, now pay later companies out there, they have deferred interest, there&#8217;s back interest if you miss a payment. They recalculate all of that 0% interest as though you had a very high interest rate for the life of the loan,” Shniderman, who worked closely with Amex in his prior role at Deloitte, said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amex’s major competitors have also made recent forays into BNPL in an attempt to keep pace with payments companies like Stripe and Square. Mastercard launched its homegrown Mastercard Installments offering this fall, and Visa announced a brand partnership with Klarna shortly thereafter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One day after announcing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/better-com-gets-750m-cash-infusion-in-new-agreement-with-its-spac-backers/">an amendment to its SPAC agreement</a>, digital mortgage lender Better.com confirmed today that it is laying off roughly 9% of its nearly 10,000 person staff.</p>
<p>Doing the math, that amounts to about 900 people.</p>
<p>The company declined to comment beyond the following written statement from CFO Kevin Ryan: &#8220;A fortress balance sheet and a reduced and focused workforce together set us up to play offense going into a radically evolving homeownership market.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241727" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>People familiar with internal happenings in the company, which is set to go public in the near future at a $6.9 billion valuation, told TechCrunch that a few factors drove the decision behind the staff reductions.</p>
<p>For one, the mortgage market is expected to contract pretty significantly after 18 months of rapid expansion driven by historically lower interest rates. Better has been vocal about its desire to build out its purchase experience and move beyond digital lending to help people find and purchase homes. It’s also working to expand value-added offerings like title and homeowner’s insurance as part of its product suite.</p>
<p>Bottom line, the company has “too many people in the wrong places,” according to our sources, who preferred to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>This also appears to be a case of technology replacing human labor. Better’s automation efforts means fewer manual process and a business that is more machine-driven, hence the need for fewer human resources.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The layoffs are primarily taking place in the U.S. and India, the sources said.</p>
<p>On Nov. 30, TechCrunch reported that the company was getting a cash infusion from its backers sooner than expected. Blank-check company Aurora Acquisition Corp. and SoftBank decided to amend the terms of their financing agreement to provide Better with half of the $1.5 billion they committed immediately instead of waiting until the deal closes.</p>
<p>No word on whether the company has been in a cash crunch, but an email from CFO Ryan to employees obtained by TechCrunch revealed that Better would have about $1 billion on its balance sheet by week’s end. It’s possible that the layoffs were a condition to getting that deal approved.</p>
<p>According to the Daily Beast, the layoffs were quick and a big surprise.</p>
<p>The Daily Beast&#8217;s Noah Kirsch reported that in the U.S., all affected workers were summoned into a mass webinar on Wednesday, where founder and CEO Vishal Garg &#8220;delivered a short speech informing them that they were being terminated.&#8221;</p>
<p>After Garg’s speech, the meeting ended abruptly, and the affected employees’ computers automatically shut down, Kirsch also reported.</p>
