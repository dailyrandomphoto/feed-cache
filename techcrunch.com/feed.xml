										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cookies and other third-party data sources are going the way of the dodo bird for many companies, regulators and platforms, and that&#8217;s giving a new emphasis on technology that will help companies better manage their customer data on their own steam. Today, one of the companies building tools for that end is announcing a big round of funding, underscoring its growth.</p>
<p>Amperity, which provides a customer data platform for its businesses, has raised $100 million in funding at a valuation of over $1 billion. The startup typically works with large, consumer-focused enterprises along the lines of Starbucks, Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts, Patagonia and some 100 others, helping them to tap and organize their own data troves better to develop better profiles of their customers.</p>
<p>The Series D funding &#8212; led by HighSage Ventures with previous backers Tiger Global Management, Declaration Partners, Madrona Venture Group, and MaderaTechnology Partners also participating &#8212; brings the total raised by Amperity to $187 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The last year of increased online activity and online shopping has put a much bigger focus on the data that companies are amassing about thier users and how they can better leverage that information to grow further. Amperity said that in 2020, annual recurring revenues were up 200%, partly on the back of that surge of interest in how to tap into customer data, not least because the older way of doing things has fallen out of favor.</p>
<p>Indeed, Kabir Shahani, the CEO who co-founded the company with CTO Derek Slager, believes that the trend away from third-party to first-party data has played and will play a much bigger role in Amperity&#8217;s growth longer term.</p>
<p>&#8220;Covid certainly &#8216;helped,'&#8221; he said, &#8220;but to me the story is less about that and more about how our idea has been validated.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea  he and Slager had been thinking about was the dependency, and problems with, third-party cookies, an issue that has been lingering &#8220;for decades,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;When this idea started percolating, when we looked to start the company, we thought this must have already been solved. It was mind blowing that it hadn&#8217;t.&#8221; The reason why: data is in too many silos, and it&#8217;s not connected, which renders it impossible or at the least very challenging to use.</p>
<p>Amperity&#8217;s approach has been to build the connectivity to bring the data together out of its silos, and then to create ways to merge and make it useful. In that regard, it&#8217;s not unlike another company that also got some funding today, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/quantexa-raises-153m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quantexa</a>, which originally build something similar to track fraud but is now also going after the customer data platform business as well.</p>
<p>As with Quantexa, Amperity has taken the approach of treating this like a big-data problem that AI can help solve.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the root of this is a hard computer science problem, all the disparate data runs off different keys,&#8221; he said. Some customer identifiers are based on phone numbers, some on physical addresses, some on email, and so on. &#8220;To connect all that you need one single key, but no one had done that before. So we thought, what if we tried to do that using machine learning?&#8221; They engaged &#8220;the world’s leading researcher in probabilistic data,&#8221; who built the models for Amperity, and that&#8217;s what powers the service today.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a massive market worth over $114 billion, so it&#8217;s no surprise to see investors like Tiger Global looking to get involved.</p>
<p>“<span class="il">Amperity</span> represents the future of how customer data can benefit both consumers and businesses by offering the most comprehensive AI-driven CDP on the market today,” said John Curtius, partner at Tiger Global Management. “The company’s technology is bringing outsized value to the biggest and most admired consumer brands in the world. Additionally, they continue to attract exceptional talent at all levels of the company to advance their mission, including the addition of Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson to its board last year.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WebOps SaaS platform <a href="https://pantheon.io/">Pantheon</a>, which started out as a Drupal and WordPress hosting service many years ago, today announced that it has raised a $100 million Series E round solely funded by the Softbank Vision Fund. With this round, Pantheon has now reached unicorn status, with a valuation of over $1 billion.</p>
<p>Pantheon co-founder and CEO Zack Rosen told me that the company wasn&#8217;t under any pressure to raise. &#8220;It really just helps us accelerate everything that we&#8217;re doing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t need the funding. We had plenty of cash in the bank. We were planning to raise in a year or two years down the road. But we have a lot of conviction in and where this industry is going and our customers&#8217; needs are pretty apparent, so we just used this as an opportunity to pull things in by six months to a year and accelerate all the things that were already on our operational plans for the company.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2176496" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-07-12-165814.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2176496" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2176496" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-07-12-165814.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="108" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-07-12-165814.jpg 1141w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-07-12-165814.jpg?resize=150,54 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-07-12-165814.jpg?resize=300,108 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-07-12-165814.jpg?resize=768,276 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-07-12-165814.jpg?resize=680,244 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-07-12-165814.jpg?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2176496" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pantheon</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As Rosen noted, the role of company websites has changed quite a bit since Pantheon launched almost a dozen years ago. While originally, they were mostly about brand building and having a publishing channel, these days, they are directly tied to revenue. &#8220;The majority of buying decisions get made before anyone talks to a customer these days,&#8221; Rosen said. &#8220;All the research is getting done &#8212; hopefully &#8212; on your company&#8217;s website. Any link in an advertisement or link in an email is going to route that customer back to the website. That&#8217;s your most important digital product. And so marketers are really starting to think about it like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>So while hosting and publishing may be solved problems, driving revenue through a company&#8217;s website &#8212; and measuring that &#8212; is where Pantheon sees a lot of opportunities going forward. Though at the core of the company&#8217;s offering, of course, is still its serverless hosting platform and developers remain its core audience. But it&#8217;s the collaboration between the marketing teams and developers that is driving a lot of what the company is now investing in. &#8220;In order to deliver a best-in-class digital experience &#8212; and be able to iterate it every single day and work with designers and developers and website owners and project managers &#8212; you need a system of record for that work. You need a solid workflow for those teams,&#8221; Rosen noted.</p>
<p>Companies, he argues, are looking for a solid SaaS platform that provides them with those workflows, in addition to the high-performance hosting, CDNs and everything else that is now table stakes for hosting websites. &#8220;[Teams] want to stop thinking about this stuff,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They just want a partner &#8212; like any other SaaS application, whether it&#8217;s Stripe, Twilio or Salesforce. They just want it to work and not to worry about it. And then, once you have that taken care of, then you can move up into the things that really drive the outcomes these teams care about.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for raising from the SoftBank Vision Fund, which features the likes of ByteDance, Perch, Redis Labs, Slack and Arm among its investments (and, infamously, WeWork), Rosen said that Pantheon had its choice of firms, but at the end of the day, SoftBank&#8217;s team turned out to be &#8220;huge believers in this category,&#8221; he said, and could help Pantheon reach the scale it needs to define the WebOps category.</p>
<p>“Digital transformation has accelerated the movement to the cloud for essential business infrastructure. By automating workflows and do-it-yourself with its SaaS offering, we believe Pantheon’s leading platform is transforming how modern website experiences are created,” said Vikas Parekh, Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers. “We are excited to partner with Zack and the Pantheon team to support their ambition of helping organizations embrace a new and better way of building websites that deliver results.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Affiliate marketing may have started as a kind of side hustle for bloggers and others that were making the majority of their revenues through advertising or other channels, but with the rise of influencers and the huge profusion of spon-con on social media, the idea of leveraging a person&#8217;s own presence to make some money and give a huge sales boost to a product, brand or service has taken on a life of its own. And to underscore that, today a company that&#8217;s built a marketplace to help connect people and companies in that larger set of relationships is announcing a big round of funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://impact.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Impact</a> &#8212; which has built a partnership management platform that lets brands engage people for influencer and affiliate marketing or wider business development; lets publishers also connect with brands and influencers; and provides the infrastructure both to track that content and collect revenues around it &#8212; has closed $150 million in funding on a $1.5 billion valuation.</p>
<p class="p1">Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) is leading this round, with Providence Public also participating. The company will be using the funds to continue expanding its partnership network as well as the kinds of tools it builds for brands, agencies and publishers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Impact runs what it calls a &#8220;partnership cloud&#8221; &#8212; somewhat akin to a &#8220;marketing cloud&#8221; &#8212; that it targets at what it terms the &#8220;partnership economy.&#8221; Those who use affiliate or influencer marketing to spread the word about their products; those who leverage their personalities or content to do that; and those platforms that house the content can all use Impact to engage with each other, and run their business operations within it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started as a platform that was mostly used in a private marketplace setting,&#8221; said David A. Yovanno, Impact’s CEO, in an interview. &#8220;We were the first with a product and tech-led product in the affiliate space. We call this category partnerships but we didn’t come up with that term, our customers did after they started to use us in innovative ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>Impact has seen a big boom with the rise and increasing ubiquity of influencer marketing and spon-con. In the last year, the New York startup passed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, with its customers a list of some of the biggest names in the worlds of technology, retail and more, including Lenovo, Microsoft, Uber, eBay, Amex, CapitalOne, Disney, NBC&#8217;s Peacock, Walmart, Target, lots of D2C brands, and some other really huge tech companies that I&#8217;m not allowed to name&#8230; In all, its customer list has grown by 50% in the last year.</p>
<p>Spon-con and related marketing techniques have been on an upward trend for years, making gradually bigger dents in the 60% committment that brands typically dedicate to online advertising to get the word out. The last year of Covid-19 living has, perhaps unsurprisingly, worked as a particular boost, however: people spending a lot more time online, and much more time idling hours away on social media rather than engaging in the physical world, has led to a much bigger rush of brands leveraging that landscape to get their names in front of would-be buyers.</p>
<p>The snag in the market that Impact has been building to fix reminds me somewhat of the challenges in the digital music industry: initially, and frankly currently, it remains a challenge for rights owners in the world of music to accurately and efficiently track where and when music gets used, and then to collect revenues based on that, particularly when that music is used across the long tail of user-generated content.</p>
<p>A similar scenario exists in the spon-con world, especially when you consider how video clips are sampled and occasionally go viral, with those re-uses wander far from their origins in the process.</p>
<p>The play that Impact is providing here, therefore, is not just one of accounting and providing a marketplace for entities to discover and engage with one another, but potentially a big data play to track how and where content will be used and engaged with wherever that happens to be. If the space continues to grow as it look like it will, that means a bigger job and more investment needed to track the space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.zoominfo.com/">ZoomInfo</a> announced this morning it intends to acquire conversational sales intelligence tool Chorus.AI for $575 million. Shares of ZoomInfo are unchanged in pre-market trading following the news, per Yahoo Finance data.</p>
<p>Sales intelligence, Chorus’s market, is a hot space that uses AI to &#8220;listen&#8221; to sales conversations to help improve interactions between salespeople and customers. ZoomInfo is mostly known for providing information about customers, so the acquisition expands the acquiring company’s platform in a significant way.</p>
<p>The company sees an opportunity to bring together different parts of the sales process in a single platform by &#8220;combining ZoomInfo’s historic top-of-the-funnel strength with insights driven from the middle of the funnel in the customer conversations that Chorus captures,&#8221; it said in a release.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;With Chorus, the entire organization can make better decisions by surfacing insights and analytics that you would only get if you sat in on every sales or customer success call,&#8221; ZoomInfo CEO and founder Henry Schuck said<a href="https://blog.zoominfo.com/zoominfo-chorus/"> in a blog post</a> announcing the deal.</p>
<p>Ahead of the transaction, ZoomInfo was valued at just under $21 billion.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Chorus.ai rings up $33M for its platform that analyses sales calls to close more deals&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/13/chorus-ai-rings-up-33m-for-its-platform-that-analyses-sales-calls-to-close-more-deals/embed/#?secret=vAc33uC3zZ" data-secret="vAc33uC3zZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Chorus looks for what it calls &#8220;smart themes&#8221; in sales calls, which help managers steer sales teams towards the types of conversation and tone that is likely to drive more revenue. In fact, Chorus holds the largest patent portfolio related to conversational intelligence, according to the company.</p>
<p>Chorus was founded in 2015 and raised over $100 million along the way, <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/125617-96/company/profile#insights">according to Pitchbook data</a>. The most recent round was a $45 million Series C last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/focusing-on-relationships-chorus-ai-brings-in-45m-series-c-to-track-sales-conversations/">Crunchbase News reports</a> that at the time of its Series C round of funding, Chorus had “doubled its headcount to more than 100 employees and tripled its revenue over the past year.” That’s the sort of growth that venture capitalists covet, making the company’s 2020 funding round a non-surprise.</p>
<p>Notably PitchBook data indicates that the company’s final private valuation was around the $150 million mark; if accurate, it would imply that the company’s last private round was expensive in dilution terms. And that its investors did well in the exit, quickly more than trebling the capital that was last invested, with investors who put capital in earlier doing even better.</p>
<p>But we’re slightly skeptical of the company’s available valuation history given the growth that it claimed at the time of its Series C; it feels low. If that’s the case, the company’s exit multiple would decrease, making its final sale price slightly less impressive.</p>
<p>Of course a half-billion dollar exit is always material, even if venture capitalists in today’s red-hot, and expensive market are more interested in $1 billion exits and larger.</p>
<p>Chorus.ai will likely not be the final exit in the conversational intelligence space. Its rival Gong (often known by its URL, Gong.io) is one of the hotter startups in this space, having raised over $500 million. Its most recent raise was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/gong-going-gangbusters-grabs-250m-series-e-on-7-25b-valuation/">$250 million on a $7.25 billion valuation</a> last month.</p>
<p>The implication of the Chrous.ai exit and Gong’s enormous private valuation is that the application of AI to audio data in a sales environment is incredibly useful, given the number of customers the two companies’ aggregate valuation implies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/softbanks-vision-fund-2-leads-775m-investment-in-perch-sets-new-record-for-fastest-company-to-achieve-profitable-unicorn-status-in-the-us-301299324.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising $775 million</a> earlier this year, <a href="http://perchhq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perch</a> has made a big acquisition that will bring on a number of new brands and operations infrastructure to enhance its position in the race to roll up smaller merchants that sell and fulfill sales through Amazon. The company has acquired <a href="https://webdealsdirect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web Deals Direct</a>, an Amazon seller that owns 30 brands of its own pulling in $80 million in revenue annually and also operates its own warehouse.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal are not being disclosed but I understand from sources that it was a nine-figure deal valued between $100 million and $200 million.</p>
<p>There are millions of merchants currently on Amazon&#8217;s marketplace, leveraging the e-commerce giant&#8217;s storefront, search tools, fulfillment infrastructure, payment tools, warehouses and delivery network to sell products to buyers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Companies like Perch compete against the likes of Elevate Brands (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/elevate-brands-banks-250m-to-roll-up-third-party-merchants-selling-on-amazons-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday announced $250 million in funding</a>), Thrasio, Heyday, SellerX, Branded, Razor Group and many others that are seizing an opportunity to snap up and roll up the more successful of these to bring better economies of scale into the model, while also building technology to better measure and leverage sales analytics and more.</p>
<p>While these companies are, essentially, acting as marketplace consolidators, this latest acquisition is significant because, in a sense, it underscores an interesting shift towards a consolidation of the consolidators themselves.</p>
<p>WDD&#8217;s categories span home goods, sports, arts and crafts, pet supplies and office products, and Perch&#8217;s VP of acquisitions, <span class="il">Nate</span> Jackson, said Perch was interested in them because they are one of the more successful Amazon merchants. In a market where visibility is based on how well engaged previous buyers are with your products, WDD has picked up some 110,000 reviews and 2.3 million customers.</p>
<p>For WDD the idea is that joining Perch will give it more reach in terms of targeting more customers, and to bring it better analytics leveraging insights and sales from Perch&#8217;s other brands, which currently number at around 70 and cover the same categories.</p>
<p>&#8220;We took our business from zero to $80 million in sales in 5 short years,” said Adam Feinberg, CEO of Web Deals Direct, in a statement. “But, with Perch, who are proven eCommerce operators, we think the possibilities of growth in the next 5 years are just as exciting. I’ve been so impressed with the caliber of their team, and I trust their long-term vision to steward our business into the next phase of growth. This was a complex deal, but Perch has made the process fair and transparent. I want to thank all of the great Web Deals Direct team members for the organization we’ve built together; our employees could not be in better hands with Perch.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a signal of what the next steps might be for these roll-up companies, with Perch gaining a 230,000 square foot warehouse in California and now looking to get more warehouse space on the East Coast. While Amazon might still be an important storefront for visibility, it&#8217;s a sign of how these companies may be looking at taking on more of the process themselves on the fulfillment side to grow margins.</p>
<p>“This deal marks a major milestone for Perch,” said Perch founder and CEO, Chris Bell, in a statement. “The complexity and size of the business is a testament to the excellent organization Adam and the entire team at Web Deals Direct have built, and it is a pleasure to work with such inspirational entrepreneurs.”</p>
<p>This is not a completely new area for Perch, and perhaps the writing has always been on the wall that it would eventually bring more fulfillment into its own e-commerce operations to lessen some of the reliance on Amazon.</p>
<p>Before founding Perch, Bell and Perch&#8217;s COO designed and built the Wayfair Delivery Network for online furniture company Wayfair &#8212; a service that handled 3 million &#8220;heavy bulky orders&#8221; annually, and did so with a view to speeding up the turnaround time, turning what typically takes a month to deliver into a two-day process. That will be some of what the team now hopes to bring to Perch, it seems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If there’s one thing we’ve learned from some of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/making-sh-with-simone-giertz-this-is-an-adventure-inc/">our favorite YouTube shitty robots</a>, it’s that human-robot interaction can be a tricky business. Developing methods to get rigid robotic arms to perform delicate tasks around soft human bodies is easier said than done.</p>
<p>This week, a team at MIT’s CSAIL department is <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/getting-dressed-help-robots">showcasing its work using robotic arms to help people get dressed</a>. The promise of such technology is clear: helping people with mobility issues perform tasks that many of us take for granted.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-9JrDMBg2HE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Among the biggest hurdles is creating algorithms that are able to navigate around the human form efficiently, without hurting the person it&#8217;s trying to help. Preprogrammed modes can run into all sorts of variables, including shapes and human reactions. Overreacting to variables, on the other hand, can effectively freeze the robot, unsure of the best route to take.</p>
<p>So, the team set out to develop a system that could adapt to different scenarios and learn as it goes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2176438" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2176438" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2176438" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_5614.png" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_5614.png 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_5614.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_5614.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_5614.png?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_5614.png?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_5614.png?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_5614.png?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_5614.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2176438" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MIT CSAIL</p></div></p>
<p>“To provide a theoretical guarantee of human safety, the team&#8217;s algorithm reasons about the uncertainty in the human model. Instead of having a single, default model where the robot only understands one potential reaction, the team gave the machine an understanding of many possible models, to more closely mimic how a human can understand other humans,” MIT writes in a blog post. As the robot gathers more data, it will reduce uncertainty and refine those models.”</p>
<p>The team says it will also be researching how human subjects react to these sorts of tasks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Arctic Wolf, a managed cybersecurity company that offers &#8220;security operations-as-a-concierge&#8221; service, has raised $150 million at Series F.</p>
<p>This round was led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/viking-global-investors/">Viking Global Investors</a>, Owl Rock, and other existing investors, and lands less than a year after the company’s last round of investment when it became the first managed detection and response (MDR) companies to secure a valuation of over $1 billion. This latest round brings its total amount of funding raised to date to just shy of $500 million, and sees the company’s valuation soar from $1.3 billion to $4.3 billion.</p>
<p>“This is a recognition on our part, and our investors’ part, of the challenge that our industry is facing,” Arctic Wolf CEO Brian NeSmith told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>As a result of this challenging <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> landscape, fueled by pandemic turbulence and a mass shift to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/remote-work/">remote working</a>, Arctic Wolf has seen impressive growth over the last 12 months. The company, which provides round-the-clock security monitoring for small and mid-sized organizations through its cloud security operations platform, saw its revenues double on rapid platform adoption growth, with nearly 60% of its 3,000 customers using at least three of its security operations solutions. This, the company claims, makes it fastest-growing company at scale in the fastest-growing area of the cybersecurity market.</p>
<p>The company’s headcount has also increased dramatically: the company onboard approximately 400 employees over the past 12 months and plans to add 500 new roles in the coming year.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The newly-raised funds will be used to keep its momentum going, NeSmith said, and to step up its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ma/">mergers and acquisitions</a> strategy. Arctic Wolf has made three acquisitions since it was founded 2012 — including cybersecurity vulnerability assessment startup RootSecure in 2018 — and it&#8217;s planning to increase this number significantly over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>“We’ve got letters of intent for a couple more, and I expect that over the next year we’ll probably do between 5 and 10 acquisitions,” said NeSmith.</p>
<p>With Series F funding under its belt, Arctic Wolf is now starting to think about its exit strategy. NeSmith tells TechCrunch that while the company is weighing up its options, an IPO is likely the next logical move for the company.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“I think ultimately the exit is IPO. That’s the most likely outcome,” he says. “Frankly, from some of the companies I’ve seen IPO over the last 3-6 months, we could be a public company today. We’re a little more measured, so we want to realize that not being public is an end point, you’re just changing the way you run the company.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Female Founders Fund announced Tuesday the closing of its Fund III after raising $57 million to create what it considers “the largest fund for seed capital specifically for female founders.”]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://femalefoundersfund.com/">Female Founders Fund</a> announced Tuesday the closing of its Fund III after raising $57 million to create what the seven-year-old New York-based early-stage fund considers “the largest fund for seed capital specifically for female founders.”</p>
<p>The oversubscribed fund is backed by institutional investors including Goldman Sachs, Cambridge Associates, Melinda French Gates’ Pivotal Ventures, Twitter, Plexo Capital and the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. It also includes investments from 23andMe founder Anne Wojcicki, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki and Houseparty co-founder Sima Sistani.</p>
<p>“I firmly believe we are missing out on transformational ideas by not putting resources behind women,” said Melinda French Gates, founder of Pivotal Ventures, in a statement. “I’ve invested in the Female Founders Fund because we need women founders and funders at the table if we want to build a more prosperous and inclusive economy for everyone. New and innovative ideas come from everywhere; we can&#8217;t keep looking in the same old packages.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fund III brings FFF’s total assets under management to over $95 million since it was formed in 2014 to invest in female-founded technology companies and lifestyle brands. The third fund’s portfolio is already 70% invested in BIPOC founders, which stands for Black, Indigenous and people of color, Anu Duggal, founding partner of Female Founders Fund, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>FFF began raising its third fund in 2020, making its first close just before the global pandemic locked everything down. That didn’t slow down Duggal’s ability to meet potential investors, which she said was done from her kitchen table.</p>
<p>“It was an incredible testament to how fast so much can be done without the flights and in-person meetings, which does take a bunch of time,” she said. “I think investors felt the same because March through June was preoccupied with making sure portfolio companies were in a good spot.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Anu Duggal on COVID-19, promoting diversity and building a fund&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/anu-duggal-on-covid-19-promoting-diversity-and-building-a-fund/embed/#?secret=g56cOlkmgw" data-secret="g56cOlkmgw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The new fund is a continuation of FFF’s existing strategy — essentially doubling down on investing in female, women of color and LGBTQ+ founders who are building companies at the seed stage. The biggest differentiator with the third fund is that FFF will be able to increase its check sizes to between $750,000 to $1 million, Duggal said. Half of the fund will go to follow-on funding.</p>
<p>While fundraising over the past 18 months, Duggal said she was inspired by the momentum of female-led companies going public, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/bumble-ipo-could-raise-more-than-1b-for-dating-service/">Bumble</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/23andme-set-to-go-public-via-a-virgin-group-spac-merger/">23andMe</a> and Figs, which also drove investor backing of the new fund, she added.</p>
<p>Fund III’s fundraising goal is in line with the transition from FFF’s previous funds: Fund I was $6 million and Fund II was $25 million. So far, FFF has invested in more than 50 female-led companies nationwide.</p>
<p>To date, FFF has invested in seven companies from Fund III, including a few that haven’t been announced yet or are in stealth mode. Duggal expects to be able to invest in 25 companies from this fund.</p>
<p>Many of the companies are pre-launch, so there aren’t early successes quite yet, but one of the first investments was in an at-home blood test created by one of Facebook’s female engineers, she said. FFF was able to bring in Anne Wojcicki as an angel investor.</p>

<p>“One of our themes is consumerization of digital health, and this is a great example,” Duggal said. “It can be annoying to have to go get blood drawn, and this is putting the experience and the data in the hands of the consumer.”</p>
<p>The Female Founders Fund is also looking at startups focused on the development of the workplace — tools for employees, small businesses and creators. Most everyone had to adjust to a pandemic working lifestyle, and the firm doesn’t see that ending soon.</p>
<p>Two newer areas of focus are climate change and education. Within education, FFF sees a trend in opportunities for technology to enable senior citizens to remain mentally engaged through continuing education. The firm is also looking at the climate market for technology to replace plastic food containers, refillable solutions, alternatives to meat and ways to record carbon usages on a daily basis.</p>
<p>“From day one, we have been committed to building the largest and most powerful network of female operators in technology,” Duggal added. “We are happy with the support we have received from Anne Wojcicki and Susan Wojcicki, Houseparty and some of our founders, as well as Melinda French Gates.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Shared micromobility operator Veo has raised $16 million in new funding as the company ramps up its expansion plans in the United States. The Series A funding round, which follows permit awards in Santa Monica, San Diego and New York, will be used to expand Veo&#8217;s fleet and focus on developing city and community partnerships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veo, which was founded in 2017,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has sought venture funding a bit later in the game than other micromobility companies. </span><a href="https://veo-mobility.medium.com/sorry-boys-the-first-profitable-micromobility-company-was-veo-not-lime-97b6b279243f?source=user_profile---------4----------------------------"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veo’s co-founder and CEO Candice Xie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been vocal about creating a sustainable business model that’s profitable on its own before seeking external funding, which the company says it’s done. But as Veo expands its footprint, it needs the additional funds to purchase the vehicles necessary to deploy in new markets, according to the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to make sure we have very high-quality vehicles as well because vehicle depreciation cost is a huge factor in unit economics, and we have a very good control of that,” Edwin Tan, co-founder and president of Veo, told TechCrunch. “By leveraging our design and supply chain, we want to show that we can continue to develop high quality, long-lasting vehicles.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which has always designed and manufactured its own electric scooters and bikes rather than partnering with a manufacturer, recently rolled out its <a href="https://veo-mobility.medium.com/innovating-our-way-to-safer-streets-with-the-veo-astro-4-ea6188dc7b17">newest Astro 4</a>, which Tan said can last about three years. Veo&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">previous vehicle generation can last two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New features on the vehicle can help greatly reduce operational costs and help users get more for their money, said Tan. The Astro 4 is the first shared e-scooter with turn signals, according to Veo. It will also feature a new lighting feature that asks passerby to “Please pick me up” on the bottom of the board if knocked over — an effort to alert people with disabilities to the presence of the scooter while solving the public nuisance problem. A brighter headlight, decklight and taillight have also been added along with and other features like improved suspension and IoT will be helpful in keeping costs down, Tan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are expanding out R&amp;D budget,” said Tan. “We want to make sure we can create new technology or a new product that can solve for new form factors. We believe this industry is still very early, and think we can create more form factors and really change how people move around with different vehicles. That unmet demand is really important for us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veo averages one new vehicle each year, according to Tan. The company plans to launch a new vehicle in the first quarter of 2022 that will solve for the “winter problem” and overcome the seasonality of rides. The company said it already has a solution for that but isn’t ready to share more details. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veo also wants to address the needs of people who don’t feel safe or comfortable riding a stand-up kick scooter or a bike. Veo&#8217;s Cosmo model, which is a sit-down scooter design, is an example of the company&#8217;s attempt to meet that demand. Veo plans to offer additional models that are accessible to a wider range of people, a move that aligns with requests from cities. </span></p>
<p>The funding round was led by Autotech Ventures, with participation from UP Partners, FJ Labs and Interplay Ventures.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Endgame, enabling software companies to turn customer observations into go-to-market strategies, raised a total of $17 million raised in back-to-back seed and Series A funding rounds.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.endgame.io/">Endgame</a>, enabling software companies to turn customer observations into go-to-market strategies, announced Tuesday it raised a total of $17 million in back-to-back seed and Series A funding rounds.</p>
<p>The $12.25 million Series A was led by Menlo Ventures, while the $5 million seed round was led by Upfront Ventures. Also participating in the round are a group of investors including Todd and Rahul’s Fund, Liquid 2 Ventures and Gainsight CEO Nick Mehta.</p>
<p>Los Angeles-based Endgame was founded in 2020 and provides a self-service look at what’s happening in a software trial so that a sales team can prioritize accounts based on user behavior signals and act on them faster without having to be a data scientist or engineer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Company CEO Alex Bilmes told TechCrunch that the concepts of product-led sales and product-led growth have taken over the sale of software. Today’s customers sign up for a trial, and if they like it, they invite their friends to try it.</p>
<p>However, at a certain point, some sales pressure is needed to close the deal. That’s where Endgame comes in: It shows who is doing what, and what features are being used — data that is typically opaque to sales and revenue teams.</p>
<p>Traditional customer relationship management systems are designed to be user-driven, meaning the sales rep is responsible for adding notes. It’s simpler if a rep only has a few accounts, but across tens of millions of users, Endgame analyzes the data and identifies which accounts are most likely to convert, who are the users to engage, what makes a good customer and how to take action with the right people.</p>
<p>Endgame is not competing against other companies so much as in-house developers that are cobbling a bunch of apps together in efforts to create a system that works for them, Bilmes said.</p>
<p>“Most of this is solved with do-it-yourself,” he added. “I have built Endgame a number of times at other companies using databases and other piece-meals to put together something so I could mash data from lots of places and build subscriptive views for revenue teams. We compete with those data scientists and internal teams stitching together horizontal tools.”</p>
<p>Endgame is pre-revenue and is already catering to a group of beta customers like Figma, Loom, Airtable, Clubhouse, Mode, Retool and Algolia that are looking for a dedicated software platform to capture product-led value.</p>
<p>Bilmes said the customer relationship management market, both huge and fast-growing at 35% annually, is expected to reach $114 billion by 2027. To meet demand, he intends to use the new funds to continue hiring aggressively. He has already tripled the size of the team to nine in the past few months, and expects to double that in the coming year. In addition, funds will go toward R&amp;D and to further define the product-led sales landscape.</p>
<p>Growth over the next year will be customer-focused as Endgame works to get into the hands of the right customers and making it as accessible as possible for people to begin doing product-led motions.</p>
<p>“Our efforts are product-focused,” Bilmes said. “We’ve seen more demand than we can possibly hope to fill given the problem is so real for so many.”</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Upfront Ventures Partner Kara Nortman and Menlo Ventures Partner Naomi Ionita will join Endgame’s board of directors. Sandhya Hegde, partner at Unusual Ventures, which also participated in both rounds, joins as a board observer to create an all-women investor board.</p>
<p>When Endgame was raising its seed fund, it wanted to work with Nortman, who has expertise in applying consumer concepts to enterprise, Bilmes said. When it came to the Series A, Bilmes said he felt Ionita was the perfect partner due to her similar background to Bilmes and expertise in teaching salespeople how to engage.</p>
<p>Ionita told TechCrunch she learned about Endgame from Nortman, with whom she has invested in other startups. The company understands the pain point and is also providing something self-serve that gives the “why and how.”</p>
<p>“This intelligence doesn’t exist, and I know that because I lived it — building in-house or seeing companies flying blind,” she added. “Alex just gets this, and I see Endgame being the system of record and intelligence for bridging self-serve. They will be the final bridge that needs to exist between product teams and product-facing sales reps for which accounts to address and why.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For many of us, going to work these days no longer means going into a specific office like it used to; and today one of the startups that&#8217;s built a platform to help cater for that new, bigger world of employment &#8212; wherever talent might be &#8212; is announcing a major round of funding on the back of strong demand for its tools.</p>
<p><a href="https://remote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remote</a>, which provides tools to manage onboarding, payroll, benefits and other services for tech and other knowledge workers located in remote countries &#8212; be they contractors or full-time employees &#8212; has raised $150 million. Job van der Voort, the Dutch-based CEO and co-founder of New York-based Remote, confirmed in an interview that funding values Remote at over $1 billion.</p>
<p>Accel is leading this Series B, with participation also from previous investors Sequoia, Index Ventures, Two Sigma, General Catalyst and Day One Ventures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding will be used in a couple of areas. First and foremost, it will go towards expanding its business to more markets. The startup has been built from the ground up in a fully-integrated way, and in contrast to a number of others that it competes with in providing Employer of Record services, Remote fully owns all of its infrastructure. It now provides its HR services, as fully-operational legal entities, for 50 countries has a target of growing that to 80 by the end of this year. The platform is also set to be enhanced with more tools around areas like benefits, equity incentive planning, visa and immigration support and employee relocation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are doubling down on our approach,&#8221; Van der Voort said. &#8220;We try to fully own the entire stack: entity, operations, experts in house, payroll, benefits and visa and immigration &#8212; all of the items that come up most often. We want to to build infrastructure products, foundational products because those have a higher level of quality and ultimately a lower price.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, Remote will be using the funding to continue building more tools and partnerships to integrate with other providers of services in what is a very fragmented human resources market. Two of these are being announced today to coincide with the funding news: Remote has launched a Global Employee API that HR platforms that focus on domestic payroll can integrate to provide their own international offering powered by Remote. HR platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/rippling-nabs-145m-at-a-1-35b-valuation-to-build-out-its-all-in-one-platform-for-employee-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rippling</a> (Parker Conrad&#8217;s latest act) is one of its first customers. And Remote is also getting cosier with other parts of the HR chain of services: applicant tracking system Greenhouse now integrating with it to help with the onboarding process for new hires.</p>
<p>$150 million at a $1 billion+ valuation is a very, very sizable Series B, even by today&#8217;s flush-market standards, but it comes after a bumper year for the company, and in particular since November last year when it raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/remote-raises-35m-to-help-orgs-with-global-workforce-payroll-benefits-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series A of $35 million</a>. In the last nine months, customer numbers have grown seven-fold, with users on the platform increasing 10 times. Most interestingly, perhaps, is that Remote&#8217;s revenues &#8212; it&#8217;s packages start at $149 per month but go up from there &#8212; have increased by a much bigger amount: 65x, the company said. That basically points to the fact that engagement from those users &#8212; how much they are leaning on Remote&#8217;s tech &#8212; has skyrocketed.</p>
<p>Although there are a lot of competitors in the same space as Remote &#8212; they include a number of more local players alongside a pretty big range of startups like Oyster (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/oyster-an-hr-platform-for-distributed-workforces-snaps-up-50m-on-a-475m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced $50 million in funding in June</a>), Deel, which is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-21/payroll-startup-deel-raises-funds-at-1-25-billion-valuation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now valued at $1.25 billion</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/turing-nabs-32m-more-for-an-ai-based-platform-to-source-and-manage-engineers-remotely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turing</a>; Papaya Global (now also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/papaya-global-raises-100m-more-at-a-1b-valuation-for-tools-to-hire-pay-and-manage-distributed-workforces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at over $1 billion</a>); and many more &#8212; the opportunity they are collectively tackling is a massive one that, if anything, appears to be growing.</p>
<p>Hiring internationally has always been a costly, time-consuming and organizationally-challenged endeavor, so much so that many companies have opted not to do it at all, or to reserve it for very unique cases. That paradigm has drastically shifted in recent years, however.</p>
<p>Even before Covid-19 hit, there was a shortage of talent, resulting in a competitive struggle for good people, in company&#8217;s home markets, which encouraged companies to look further afield when hiring. Then, once looking further afield, those employers had to give consideration to employing those people remotely &#8212; that is, letting them work from afar &#8212; because the process of relocating them had also become more expensive and harder to work through.</p>
<p>Then Covid-19 happened, and everyone, including people working in a company&#8217;s HQ, started to work remotely, changing the goalposts yet again on what is expected by workers, and what organizations are willing to consider when bringing a new person on board, or managing someone it already knows, just from a much farther distance.</p>
<p>While a lot of that has played out in the idea of relocating to different cities in the same country &#8212; Miami and Austin getting a big wave of Silicon Valley &#8220;expats&#8221; being two examples of that &#8212; it seems just a short leap to consider that now that sourcing and managing is taking on a much more international provide. A lot of new hires, as well as existing employees who are possibly not from the US to begin with, or simply want to see another part of the world, are now also a part of the mix. That is where companies like Remote are coming in and lowering the barriers to entry by making it as easy to hire and manage a person abroad as it is in your own city.</p>
<p>“Remote is at the center of a profound shift in the way that companies hire,&#8221; said Miles Clements, a partner at Accel, in a statement. &#8220;Their new Global Employee API opens up access to Remote’s robust global employment infrastructure and knowledge map, and will help any HR provider expand internationally at a speed impossible before. Remote’s future vision as a financial services provider will consolidate complicated processes into one trusted platform, and we’re excited to partner with the global leader in the quickly emerging category of remote work.”</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s interesting to see it now partnering with the likes of Rippling. It was a no-brainer that as the latter company matured and grew, that it would have to consider how to handle the international component. Using an API from Remote is an example of how the model that has played out in communications (led by companies like Twilio and Sinch) and fintech (hello, Stripe), also has an analogue in HR, with Remote taking the charge on that.</p>
<p>And to be clear, for now Remote has no plans to build a product that it would sell directly to individuals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Individuals are reaching out to us, saying, &#8216;I found this job and can you help me and make sure I get paid?&#8217; That&#8217;s been interesting,&#8221; Van der Voort said. &#8220;We thought about [building a product for them] but we have so much to do with employers first.&#8221; One thing that&#8217;s heartening in Remote&#8217;s approach is that it wouldn&#8217;t want to provide this service unless it could completely follow through on it, which in the case of an individual would mean &#8220;vetting every major employer,&#8221; he said, which is too big a task for it right now.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Remote itself has walked the walk when it comes to remote working. Originally co-founded by two European transplants to San Francisco, the pair had first-hand experience of the paradoxical pains and opportunities of being in an organization that uses remote workforces.</p>
<p>Van der Voort had been the VP of product for GitLab, which he scaled from 5 to 450 employees working remotely (it’s now a customer of Remote’s); and before co-founding Remote CTO Marcelo Lebre had been VP of engineering for Unbabel — another startup focused on reducing international barriers, this time between how companies and global customers communicate.</p>
<p>Today, not only is the CEO based out of Amsterdam in The Netherlands and CTO in Lisbon, Portugal, but New York-based Remote itself has grown to 220 from 50 employees, and this wider group has also been working remotely across 47 countries since November 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world is looking very different today,&#8221; Van der Voort said. &#8220;The biggest change for us has been the size of the organization. We&#8217;ve gone from 50 to more than 200 employees, and I haven’t met any of them! We have tried to follow our values of bringing opportunity everywhere so we hire everywhere as we solve that for our customers, too.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">France has hit Google with a fine of half a billion euros after finding major breaches in how it negotiated with publishers to remunerate them for reuse of their content &#8212; as is required under a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/european-parliament-votes-for-controversial-copyright-reform/">pan-EU reform of digital copyright law</a> which extended neighbouring rights to news snippets.</p>
<p>The size of the fine is notable as it&#8217;s over half of the entire <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/google-to-pay-out-1b-to-publishers-to-license-content-for-new-google-news-showcase/">$1BN news licensing pot that Google announced last October</a> &#8212; when it said it would be paying news publishers “to create and curate high-quality content” to appear on its platforms.</p>
<p>At the time, the move that looked intended to shrink Google&#8217;s exposure to legal mandates to pay publishers for content reuse by pushing them to accept commercial terms which give it broad rights to &#8216;showcase&#8217; their content.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>France&#8217;s watchdog has now called out &#8212; and sanctioned &#8212; the practice.</p>
<p>The half a billion euro penalty is also notable for being considerably more than Google had already agreed to pay French publishers, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-france-copyright-exclusive-idUSKBN2AC27N">Reuters</a> &#8212; which reported, back in February, that the tech giant had inked a deal with a group of 121 publishers to pay them just $76M over three years.</p>
<p>France&#8217;s competition authority <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/fr/article/remuneration-des-droits-voisins-lautorite-sanctionne-google-hauteur-de-500-millions-deuros">said today</a> that it&#8217;s applying the sanction of €500 million ($592M) against the tech giant for failing to comply with a number of injunctions related to its earlier, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/frances-competition-watchdog-orders-google-to-pay-for-news-reuse/">April 2020 decision</a> &#8212; when the watchdog ordered Google to negotiate in good faith with publishers to remunerate them for displaying their protected content.</p>
<p>Initially, Google sought to evade the neighbouring news right by stopping displaying snippets of content alongside links it showed in Google News in France. But the watchdog found that was likely to be an abuse of its dominant position &#8212; and ordered Google to stop circumventing the law and negotiate with publishers to pay for the reuse in good faith.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;France&#8217;s competition watchdog orders Google to pay for news reuse&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/frances-competition-watchdog-orders-google-to-pay-for-news-reuse/embed/#?secret=r5bx5CKu02" data-secret="r5bx5CKu02" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The<em> Autorité de la Concurrence</em> is not happy with how Google has gone about this, though.</p>
<p>A number of publishers complained to it that the negotiations were not carried out in good faith and that Google did not provide them with key information necessary to inform payments.</p>
<p>The Syndicate of magazine press publishers (SEPM), the Alliance de Presse d&#8217;Information Générale (APIG) and Agence France Presse (AFP) made complaints in August/September 2020 &#8212; kicking off the investigation by the watchdog and today&#8217;s announcement of a major penalty.</p>
<p>Further fines &#8212; of up to €900,000 per day &#8212; could be headed Google&#8217;s way if it continues to breach the watchdog&#8217;s injunctions and fails to supply publishers with all the required information within a new two-month deadline.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/fr/communiques-de-presse/remuneration-des-droits-voisins-lautorite-sanctionne-google-hauteur-de-500">press release</a> detailing its investigation, the <em>Autorité </em>said Google sought to unilaterally impose its global news licensing product, aka &#8216;Showcase&#8217;, under a partnership the tech giant calls Publisher Curated News &#8212; in negotiations with publishers &#8212; pushing for the legal neighbouring right to be incorporated as &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">an ancillary component with no separate financial valuation&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>Publishers requests to break out copyright remuneration negotiations were denied, per the watchdog&#8217;s investigation.</p>
<p>It also found Google &#8220;unjustifiably&#8221; reduced the scope of negotiations with regard to the scope of income derived from the display of protected news content &#8212; with Google telling publishers that only advertising income from Google Search pages posting news content should be taken into account in determining the level of remuneration due.</p>
<p>The authority found this exclusion of income from other Google services and all indirect income related to this content to be in breach of the copyright law and its earlier compliance order.</p>
<p>Google also &#8220;deliberately circumscribed&#8221; the scope of the law on neighboring rights by excluding titles that do not have a Political and General Information certificate &#8212; which the watchdog couched as a &#8220;bad faith&#8221; interpretation of the code on intellectual property.</p>
<p>It also found the tech giant sought to exclude press agencies from renumeration related to their content when used by third party publishers &#8212; highlighting that as another breach of its April 2020 decision, by further noting: &#8220;The French legislator has been very explicit on the need to include press agencies.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another finding, it said Google had only provided publishers with &#8220;partial&#8221; and &#8220;insufficient&#8221; information for a &#8220;transparency assessment of renumeration due&#8221;; and further accused the tech giant of delaying until just a few days before the injunction deadline to provide it &#8212; so of being &#8220;late&#8221; too.</p>
<p>The authority&#8217;s investigation highlights compliance problems with another injunction &#8212; related to an obligation of neutrality in how protected content is presented on Google&#8217;s platforms &#8212; with the watchdog writing on that: &#8220;The strategy put in place by Google has thus strongly encouraged publishers to accept the contractual conditions of the <em>Showcase</em> service and to renounce negotiations relating specifically to the current uses of protected content, which was the subject of the Injunctions, under penalty of seeing their exposure and their remuneration degraded compared to their competitors who would have accepted the proposed terms. Google cannot therefore claim to have taken the necessary measures to prevent its negotiations from affecting the presentation of protected content in its services.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another injunction sought to prevent Google from seeking to leverage its dominance by offsetting remunerations paid to publishers for the neighbouring rights.</p>
<p>On this the watchdog also took issue with its approach &#8212; noting that its Showcase product requires publishers to make not just snippets of their content available for display on Google&#8217;s platforms but &#8220;large extracts&#8221; and even whole articles.</p>
<p>It also found that Google linked participation in the <em>Showcase</em> program to subscription to another service called <em>Subscribe with Google</em> (SwG) &#8212; enabling it to link negotiation on neighboring rights with the subscription of new services that could financially benefit its business.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google inks agreement in France on paying publishers for news reuse&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-inks-agreement-in-france-on-paying-publishers-for-news-reuse/embed/#?secret=MUKLVkgHz9" data-secret="MUKLVkgHz9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Under a subhead which denounces what it found as &#8220;extremely serious practices&#8221;, the authority goes on to accuse Google of &#8220;a deliberate, elaborate and systematic strategy of non-compliance&#8221; &#8212; and of continuing an already years-long &#8220;opposition strategy&#8221; to the principle of neighbouring rights; and then, after they&#8217;d been baked into EU and French law, seeking to &#8220;minimize the concrete scope of those rights as much as possible&#8221;.</p>
<p>Google has, the authority asserts, sought to use a global strategy to close down publishers&#8217; ability to negotiate for remuneration for their content reuse at a national level &#8212; using its Showcase product as a cloak for &#8220;avoiding or limiting as much as possible&#8221; payments to publishers; and, simultaneously, seeking to use negotiations on neighboring rights as an opportunity to obtain access to new content by press publishers that could allow it to collect additional income, such as from subscriptions to press titles.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sanction of 500 million euros takes into account the exceptional seriousness of the breaches observed and that the behavior of Google has further delayed the proper application of the law on neighboring rights, which aimed to better take into account the value of content from publishers and news agencies included on the platforms. The Authority will be extremely vigilant about the correct application of its decision, as non-execution can now lead to periodic penalty payments,&#8221; added the watchdog&#8217;s president, Isabelle de Silva, in a statement (which we&#8217;ve translated from French).</p>
<p>The half a billion euro fine and the warning to Google that its practices will attract daily fines if it persists in ignoring the injunctions put the tech giant on notice that the detail of commercial deals won&#8217;t be allowed to fly under the radar in France.</p>
<p>Any more attempts to shape a self-serving version of &#8216;compliance&#8217; are likely to attract further sanction from the watchdog &#8212; which also recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/france-fines-google-268m-for-adtech-abuses-and-gets-interoperability-commitments/">applied a number of interoperability requirements</a> on Google&#8217;s ad business (and slapped it with a $268M fine), also acting on complaints from publishers.</p>
<p>While anything Google agrees to in France on the neighbouring rights issue is likely to set the bar for what it can achieve with commercial deals elsewhere &#8212; at least in other EU markets, where the copyright extension also applies (once it&#8217;s been transposed into a Member State&#8217;s national law).</p>
<p>In a statement responding to the authority&#8217;s sanction, Google expressed disappointment with the outcome of the investigation &#8212; claiming to have acted in good faith throughout negotiations with publishers:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are very disappointed with this decision &#8212; we have acted in good faith throughout the entire process. The fine ignores our efforts to reach an agreement, and the reality of how news works on our platforms. To date, Google is the only company to have announced agreements on neighbouring rights. We are also about to finalize an agreement with AFP that includes a global licensing agreement, as well as the remuneration of their neighbouring rights for their press publications.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The tech giant went on to suggest that the authority&#8217;s decision is &#8220;primarily&#8221; related to negotiations in France which took place between May and September 2020, further claiming it has continued to engage with publishers and press agencies since then to find &#8220;solutions&#8221;.</p>
<p>By way of example it pointed to a January 2021 framework agreement inked with the Alliance de la Presse d’Information Générale &#8212; which it claims covers every IPG title (Information de Presse Générale) in a &#8220;transparent and non-discriminatory way&#8221;. It also pointed to agreements it has inked with other publications in the market, including Le Monde, Courrier International, L&#8217;Obs, Le Figaro, Libération, and L’Express.</p>
<p>Google also reiterated its confident it can sign a global licensing agreement with Agence France Presse &#8212; which it said it also wants to include remuneration of neighbouring rights for press publications from the agency.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our objective remains the same: We want to turn the page with a definitive agreement,&#8221; it added, saying it would take the French Competition Authority’s &#8220;feedback into consideration and adapt our offers&#8221; and that: &#8220;We are already engaging with press publishers and agencies beyond IPG, by covering publications that are recognised by the CPPAP as &#8216;online press services&#8217;, and we reiterate our offer to have an independent third party in a position to evaluate our offers and allow us to base our discussions on facts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other major fines for Google in France in recent years include the aforementioned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/france-fines-google-268m-for-adtech-abuses-and-gets-interoperability-commitments/">$268M for adtech abuses</a> last month; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/">$120 for dropping tracking cookies without consent</a> back in December; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/france-slaps-google-with-166m-antitrust-fine-for-opaque-and-inconsistent-ad-rules/">$166M in December 2019</a> for opaque and inconsistent ad rules; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/21/french-data-protection-watchdog-fines-google-57-million-under-the-gdpr/">$57M for privacy violations</a> in January 2019.</p>
<p>Beyond the EU, Australia <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers/">recently passed a law</a> which requires tech giants, Google and Facebook, to enter mandatory arbitration with publishers for reuse of their content if they fail to agree commercial terms on their own.</p>
<p>Its law has attracted considerable attention worldwide as legislators grapple with how to rein in powerful tech platforms and ensure the sustainability of traditional news businesses whose revenues have been hit by the Internet-driven shift to digital publishing.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uks-digital-markets-unit-starts-work-on-pro-competition-reforms/">UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority</a> has, for example, described Australia&#8217;s backstop of mandatory arbitration if commercial negotiations fail as a “sensible” approach &#8212; at at time when the government is working on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">shaping an ex ante regulation regime</a> to enable competition authorities to pro-actively tackle abuses by platforms with strategic market power.</p>
<p>Ahead of Australia&#8217;s law being passed, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/google-threatens-to-close-its-search-engine-in-australia-as-it-lobbies-against-digital-news-code/">Google had warned that it might have to close its services in the country</a> if legislators went ahead and also suggested the quality could degrade or that it may have to start to charge for products. In the event, it did not shut up shop down under.</p>
<p>The tech giant was also an active lobbyist against the EU&#8217;s plan to extend digital copyright to cover snippets of news content &#8212; and, as recently as <a href="https://blog.google/perspectives/richard-gingras/how-google-invests-news/">2019</a>, it was vowing never to pay for news.</p>
<p>A few years later it announced the $1BN pot to pay publishers to licence content. But Google&#8217;s eventual bill for its ad business piggybacking upon others&#8217; journalism may be rather larger than that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Moving services giant <a href="https://updater.com/">Updater</a> is bringing on the team from <a href="https://dolly.com/">Dolly</a> as the New York company looks to expand its scope of offerings with the acquisition of the on-demand startup known for helping consumers execute small-scale moves.</p>
<p>Dolly connects users in need of moving a large item like a piece of furniture with a contractor ready to lend a hand. Like competing services such as Lugg, the app has been a popular solution for picking up items from peer-to-peer marketplaces like Craigslist. Dolly boasts a partnership with Facebook Marketplace that has allowed its users to coordinate picking up items with the service, available in 45 major cities across the US, according to their website.</p>
<p>In addition to its user-facing service, Dolly has also built a major business partnering with retailers directly allowing them to tap into their mover network and coordinate same-day delivery for customers. Dolly&#8217;s retail partners include companies like Costco, Lowe&#8217;s and The Container Store.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>A price tag for the deal wasn&#8217;t disclosed and couldn&#8217;t be learned. Dolly raised $17.2 million over several rounds, including a $7.5 million Series B in May of 2019. The startup&#8217;s backers include Maveron, Hyde Park Venture Partners and Version One Ventures.</p>
<p>As part of the acquisition, Dolly will be living on an independent, wholly-owned subsidiary of Updater.</p>
<p>The SoftBank-backed Updater is an &#8220;invite-only&#8221; service focused on building a more premium end-to-end moving experience. The team has partnered with a number of major brokerage firms whose customers are given the option to use Updater&#8217;s services to coordinate their move, pairing them with moving companies who use Updater&#8217;s MoveHQ software platform. Today, a quarter of US household moves are facilitated using one of Updater&#8217;s products, the company says.</p>
<p>The firm has raised nearly $200 million since its founding in 2010. Dolly&#8217;s acquisition will allow Updater to expand their services to customers that are &#8220;conducting a small move or don’t want to book a full-service moving company,&#8221; CEO David Greenberg tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We want to be the go-to place for Americans to conquer their move.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">United Arab Emirates-based shared micromobility operator Fenix is expanding the use of its electric scooters and back-end logistics to not only move people, but also to move goods. On Tuesday, the company announced the launch of a 10-minute fresh grocery delivery service on Reem Island, a dense, mixed-use development off the coast of Abu Dhabi. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fenix’s new service, F10, will utilize available vehicles from the operator’s normal shared fleet for deliveries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delivery riders will also be considered shared resources with Fenix’s e-scooter service, taking turns between making fast deliveries and swapping batteries. The company is building a single integrated platform to manage the fleets and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shared e-scooter business is still new and has not yet been incredibly profitable for existing operators due in large part to the low life expectancy of the vehicles and the cost of paying workers to swap batteries. Fenix’s expanded business model is a novel way to make the most out of the sunk cost of its hardware and employee base while also exploring a market that is expected to grow by nearly $632 billion over the next three years, according to market research and advisory company <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/-631-84-billion-growth-in-online-grocery-delivery-services-market-2020-2024--includes-insights-on-key-products-offered-by-major-vendors--technavio-301242113.html">Technavio</a>.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bird&#8217;s SPAC filing shows scooter-nomics just don&#8217;t fly&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-spac-filing-shows-scooter-nomics-just-doesnt-fly/embed/#?secret=ws6IpyEBJV" data-secret="ws6IpyEBJV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Logistically speaking, Fenix might be onto something. Its “dark stores,” or compact, private retail facilities, are scattered around Reem Island in optimized locations, each with a large catchment area that falls within a narrow delivery radius, according to Jaideep Dhanoa, co-founder and CEO of Fenix. Dhanoa did not reveal how many dark stores the company has placed throughout the island.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Fenix, the dark store is also a distributed charging center for our swappable battery e-scooter operations, which allows us to share the real estate costs between the two businesses and also increase the productivity of our e-scooter operations via more distributed charging locations,” said Dhanoa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dhanoa said Fenix’s full-time employees, who are all company stakeholders, are trained to accept, pick and pack items for delivery in the dark stores within two minutes before relaying the goods to a rider who has a mere eight minutes to make it to the customer. Not a stressful situation at all! It wouldn’t be surprising to see Fenix&#8217;s next funding round focus on R&amp;D for robots that will gather groceries faster and without the pressure of human error.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such quick delivery couldn’t be done without urban density, which is largely what drew Fenix to Reem Island. The small island, which is one of the only free zones in the city where foreign nationals can buy property, holds a residential population of about 100,000 people. Dhanoa said the island also presents multiple use cases in the form of residential and commercial towers and shopping malls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wherever there is a dense population, there will be a market for F10,” said Dhanoa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new business expansion was in part funded by an undisclosed round that was recently raised from existing investors, like Maniv Mobility, the Israeli venture firm that also funded electric mobility company Revel and invested </span><a href="https://www.menabytes.com/fenix-seed/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$3.8 million in Fenix’s seed round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last November. (Maniv Mobility’s investment in Fenix was the first time an Israeli firm invested in a business from the UAE, a sign that companies are making good on the </span><a href="https://www.state.gov/the-abraham-accords/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abraham Accords’ </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">promise to normalize relations between the two countries.) But Dhanoa told TechCrunch that the costs of launching the F10 delivery service didn’t require deep pockets, “given the unique synergies with our existing micromobiltiy business.”</span></p>
<p>The F10 app can be downloaded in the Google Play Store and the iOS App Store. To kick things off, Fenix is offering new users their first order up to AED 50 (~$14 USD) for free.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic&#8217;s effect on the global app market has not been hard to miss. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first quarter and first half of this year, consumer spending in mobile apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/consumer-spending-on-apps-hit-record-64-9b-in-first-half-of-2021-but-install-growth-slowed-to-1-7/">hit new records</a> at $32 billion and $64.9 billion, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Africa, it can be tough to call out exact numbers on consumer spending because the continent gets hardly a mention in global app market reports. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, other metrics are worth looking at, and a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new <a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/resources/others/african-mobile-apps-landscape/">report</a> from <a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/">AppsFlyer</a> in collaboration with Google has some important insights into how the African app market has fared since the pandemic broke out last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report tracked mobile app activities across three of Africa&#8217;s largest app markets (Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa) between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the first half of 2020 to the first half of 2021, the African mobile app industry (which is predominantly Android) increased by 41% </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overall</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> installs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was analyzed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from 6,000 apps and 2 billion installs in the three markets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria registered the highest growth, with a 43% rise; South Africa&#8217;s market increased by 37% and Kenya increased 29%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<h2>Lockdown numbers</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 22, 2020, Rwanda imposed Africa&#8217;s first lockdown. Subsequently,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> other countries followed; (those in the report) Kenya (March 25), South Africa (March 27), and Nigeria (March 30)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As more people spent time at home from Q2 2020, app installs increased by 20% across the three countries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Africans were the quickest to take to their phones as the lockdowns hit with installs increasing by 17% from the previous quarter</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Nigerians and Kenyans recorded a 2% and 9% increase, respectively. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report attributes the disparity to the varying levels of restrictions each country faced; South Africa experienced the strictest and most frequent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the report, gaming apps showed strong performance between Q1 and Q2 2020. The segment experienced a 50% growth compared to an 8% increase in nongaming apps pulled. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It followed a global trend where gaming apps <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/08/app-annie-mobile-gamers-broke-app-store-records-in-q2-2020/">surged to a record high in Q2 2020</a>, at 14 billion downloads globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>In-app purchasing revenue and almost year-on-year growth</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to AppsFlyer, the biggest trend it noticed was in in-app purchasing revenue. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Q3 2020, in-app purchasing revenue numbers grew with a staggering 136% increase compared to Q2 2020, and accounted for 33% of 2020&#8217;s total revenue, &#8220;highlighting </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how much African consumers were spending within apps, from retail purchases to gaming upgrades</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In-app purchasing revenue among South African consumers increased by 213%, while Nigeria and Kenyan consumers recorded 141% and 74% increases, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the advertising front and on an almost year-on-year basis, in-app advertising revenue also increased </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as Africans </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were glued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to their smartphones more than ever</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Per the report, in-app advertising revenue increased 167% between Q2 2020 to Q1 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For gaming and non-gaming apps, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was highlighted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between the first two quarters, they both increased by 44% and 40% respectively in Q1 2021 compared to Q2 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Fintech and super apps</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last five years, fintech has dominated VC investments in African startups. It&#8217;s a no brainer why there is so much affinity for the sector. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintechs create so much value for Africa&#8217;s mobile-first population, with large sections of unbanked, underbanked and banked people</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This value is why all but one of the continent&#8217;s billion-dollar startups are fintech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">African fintechs have grown by 89.4% between 2017 and 2021, according to a Disrupt Africa <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/finnovating-for-africa/">report</a>. Now, there are more than 570 startups on the continent. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many fintechs are mobile-based, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">therefore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reflecting the number of fintech apps Africans use each day</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumers in South Africa and Nigeria saw year-on-year growth in finance app installs by 116% and 60%, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mGyyZ2VpPv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/02/nigeria-is-becoming-africas-unofficial-tech-capital/">Nigeria is becoming Africa’s unofficial tech capital</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nigeria is becoming Africa’s unofficial tech capital&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/02/nigeria-is-becoming-africas-unofficial-tech-capital/embed/#?secret=mGyyZ2VpPv" data-secret="mGyyZ2VpPv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AppsFlyer says that like fintech apps, super apps are on the rise as well. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These &#8220;all-in-one&#8221; apps offer users a range of functions such as banking, messaging, shopping and ride-hailing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report says their rise, partly due to device limitations on the continent, owes much to the same conditions that have led to a surge in fintech apps: systemic underbanking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Super apps remove some of the barriers that these users face, as well as providing a level of customer insight and experience that traditional banks cannot,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; the report said.</span></p>
<p>Daniel Junowicz, RVP EMEA &amp; Strategic Projects for AppsFlyer, commenting on the trends highlighted in the report said, “&#8230;The mobile app space in Africa is thriving despite the turmoil of last year. Installs are growing, and consumers are spending more money than ever before, highlighting just how important mobile can be for businesses when it comes to driving revenue.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As financial crime has become significantly more sophisticated, so too have the tools that are used to combat it. Now, <a href="https://www.quantexa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quantexa</a> &#8212; one of the more interesting startups that has been building AI-based solutions to help detect and stop money laundering, fraud, and other illicit activity &#8212; has raised a growth round of $153 million, both to continue expanding that business in financial services and to bring its tools into a wider context, so to speak: linking up the dots around all customer and other data.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve diversified outside of financial services and working with government, healthcare, telcos and insurance,&#8221; Vishal Marria, its founder and CEO, said in an interview. &#8220;That has been substantial. Given the whole journey that the market’s gone through in contextual decision intelligence as part of bigger digital transformation, was inevitable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Series D values the London-based startup between $800 million and $900 million on the heels of Quantexa growing its subscriptions revenues 108% in the last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Warburg Pincus led the round, with existing backers Dawn Capital, AlbionVC, Evolution Equity Partners (a specialist cybersecurity VC), HSBC, ABN AMRO Ventures and British Patient Capital also participating. The valuation is a significant hike up for Quantexa, which was valued between $200 million and $300 million in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/quantexa-raises-64-7m-to-bring-big-data-intelligence-to-risk-analysis-and-investigations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its Series C last July</a>. It has now raised over $240 million to date.</p>
<p>Quantexa got its start out of a gap in the market that Marria identified when he was working as a director at Ernst &amp; Young tasked with helping its clients with money laundering and other fraudulent activity. As he saw it, there were no truly useful systems in the market that efficiently tapped the world of data available to companies &#8212; matching up and parsing both their internal information as well as external, publicly available data &#8212; to get more meaningful insights into potential fraud, money laundering and other illegal activities quickly and accurately.</p>
<p>Quantexa&#8217;s machine learning system approaches that challenge as a classic big data problem &#8212; too much data for a humans to parse on their own, but small work for AI algorithms processing huge amounts of that data for specific ends.</p>
<p>Its so-called &#8220;Contextual Decision Intelligence&#8221; models (the name Quantexa is meant to evoke &#8220;quantum&#8221; and &#8220;context&#8221;) were built initially specifically to address this for financial services, with AI tools for assessing risk and compliance and identifying financial criminal activity, leveraging relationships that Quantexa has with partners like Accenture, Deloitte, Microsoft and Google to help fill in more data gaps.</p>
<p>The company says its software &#8212; and this, not the data, is what is sold to companies to use over their own datasets &#8212; has handled up to 60 billion records in a single engagement. It then presents insights in the form of easily digestible graphs and other formats so that users can better understand the relationships between different entities and so on.</p>
<p>Today, financial services companies still make up about 60% of the company&#8217;s business, Marria said, with 7 of the top 10 UK and Australian banks and 6 of the top 14 financial institutions in North America among its customers. (The list includes its strategic backer HSBC, as well as Standard Chartered Bank and Danske Bank.)</p>
<p>But alongside those &#8212; spurred by a huge shift in the market to relying significantly more on wider data sets, to businesses updating their systems in recent years, and the fact that, in the last year, online activity has in many cases become the &#8220;only&#8221; activity &#8212; Quantexa has expanded more significantly into other sectors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Financial crisis [of 2007] was a tipping point in terms of how financial services companies became more proactive, and I&#8217;d say that the pandemic has been a turning point around other sectors like healthcare in how to become more proactive,&#8221; Marria said. &#8220;To do that you need more data and insights.&#8221;</p>
<p>So in the last year in particular, Quantexa has expanded to include other verticals facing financial crime, such as healthcare, insurance, government (for example in tax compliance), and telecoms/communications, but in addition to that, it has continued to diversify what it does to cover more use cases, such as building more complete customer profiles that can be used for KYC (know your customer) compliance or to serve them with more tailored products. Working with government, it&#8217;s also seeing its software getting applied to other areas of illicit activity, such as tracking and identifying human trafficking.</p>
<p>In all, Quantexa has &#8220;thousands&#8221; of customers in 70 markets. Quantexa cites figures from IDC that estimate the market for such services &#8212; both financial crime and more general KYC services &#8212; is worth about $114 billion annually, so there is still a lot more to play for.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quantexa’s proprietary technology enables clients to create single views of individuals and entities, visualized through graph network analytics and scaled with the most advanced AI technology,&#8221; said Adarsh Sarma, MD and co-head of Europe at Warburg Pincus, in a statement. &#8220;This capability has already revolutionized the way KYC, AML and fraud processes are run by some of the world’s largest financial institutions and governments, addressing a significant gap in an increasingly important part of the industry. The company’s impressive growth to date is a reflection of its invaluable value proposition in a massive total available market, as well as its continued expansion across new sectors and geographies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interestingly, Marria admitted to me that the company has been approached by big tech companies and others that work with them as an acquisition target &#8212; no real surprises there &#8212; but longer term, he would like Quantexa to consider how it continues to grow on its own, with an independent future very much in his distant sights.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Sure, an acquisition to the likes of a big tech company absolutely could happen, but I am gearing this up for an IPO,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Those who’ve followed Nintendo with any sort of frequency over the years know the gaming giant has a tendency to be extremely protective with its IP. Ultimately, it’s probably for the best that the market wasn’t flooded with cheap Mario knickknacks the way it easily could have been.</p>
<p>In recent years, however, the company has seemingly loosened its approach, more readily embracing brand partnerships in ways it has shunned in the past. Heck, we’ve even gotten a bunch of mobile games and a theme park out of the deal.</p>
<p>Today, it takes the wraps off of one of the more surprising brand partnerships in recent memory, in a deal with Swiss watch company TAG Heuer, which makes very nice &#8212; and extremely expensive &#8212; timepieces. The “long-term collaboration” is kicking off with a limited-edition (2,000 units) Mario smartwatch that will set you back $2,150.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Clearly there’s a bit of a disconnect between the pricing on the TAG Heuer Connected and the sort of accessibility the company offers with hardware like the Switch. In fact, you can buy six of the high-end new OLED Switches for the price of a single Mario-branded smartwatch &#8212; or, for that matter, five Apple Watch Series 6s.</p>
<p>I will give it this &#8212; it’s a pretty sweet-looking watch. And, given the barrier of entry, there’s a pretty good chance you’ll be the only person you know who owns one (forget for a moment that, unlike expensive analog watches, smartwatches aren’t designed to last forever). The hook here are little Mario animations that pop up throughout the day as you hit your step count and meet other goals. It’s fun and something that would play really well on a fitness watch for kids (for, one imagines, a fraction of the price).</p>

<p>The watch is, effectively, a redesigned version of the TAG Heuer Connected, a $2,000 Wear OS device that launched last April. The timepiece got high marks for design quality &#8212; as one would expect from the company. This version adds touches like a Mario “M” on the dial, red accents throughout and a matching red rubber strap (along with a black leather version).</p>

<p>The case measures 45mm in diameter and the watch sports a 430 mAh battery the company says should get you between six and 20 hours of life, depending on usage. That’s due in part to the inclusion of GPS and a heart rate monitor.</p>
<p>It’s available starting July 15.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s clear that there is an enormous and growing appetite amongst consumers to switch to products and services which address some of the biggest issues of our era, whether it be climate change or problems with society. So we’ve seen the rise of ethical investing apps, or ways to reduce our carbon footprint, or shop more ethically. so it follows that VC should come up with funds to invest in these consumer spaces.</p>
<p>That’s been the focus of UK-based <a href="https://www.ekavc.com/">Eka Ventures</a> ventures since started investing in April 2020, prior to today&#8217;s announcement of the fund&#8217;s closing.</p>
<p>It’s now reached a final close on its $95m (£68m) fund, and now claims to be the “largest impact-driven early-stage venture capital fund focused on the UK” although TechCrunch was unable to verify that claim.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Investors in the fund include British Business Bank, BSC, Isomer, Guys and St Thomas Foundation, Planet First Partners, Draper Esprit, Snowball and others. It’s also backed, it says, by 24 entrepreneurs, 12 of whom are founders the Eka partners have previously backed either at fund or individual level.<br />
 <br />
Eka’s aim will be to invest in consumer technology companies focused on sustainable consumption, consumer healthcare, and the ‘inclusive economy’. The fund will focus on the UK at between £500k and £3m per deal.<br />
 <br />
Founders Jon Coker, Camilla Dolan and Andrew Richardson has previous experience in venture where they were involved in VC deals for Gousto, Bloom &amp; Wild, Peak and Elder. Coker was previously with London-focused VC MMC Ventures.<br />
 <br />
Jon Coker, General Partner of Eka told me: “We only invest in companies where we see a clear impact directly connected to the product or service that they sell. So as they grow, the impact grows with the company. We won&#8217;t invest in companies where we don&#8217;t see that. We’ve said to all of our investors that we will only invest in companies where that is delivered. We&#8217;re assessing companies we look for founder alignment, so understanding how the founders are thinking about building their company and the impact that&#8217;s delivered through the products and services. Once we&#8217;ve gone through that process of alignment and assessment we then measure that impact over time. We will also co invest with investors that don&#8217;t have a specific impact focus on their fund.”</p>
<p>I asked him how they expect to measure the impact of their investments: “We use a framework called the Impact management project framework which is trying to create an industry-standard around the measurement of impact in venture. It looks at different dimensions to identify the specific impact that the company you&#8217;re investing in is creating. When you&#8217;re backing really early-stage companies, you can measure the impact that their product is currently having but you also want to measure progress against projects that will deliver future impact. We have a number of impact-focused LPs in the fund who have done a lot of work with us actually on helping us think about this framework.”<br />
 <br />
Camilla Dolan, general partner of Eka, said: “One of our first investments was Urban Jungle insurance. This is an example where we think about it as being inclusive, as they saw a big opportunity to try and serve the segment that has historically been underserved. They do that through underwriting using behavioral characteristics rather than demographic characteristics, which is how the incumbent industry does it. This excludes a lot of the customers. They&#8217;re now launching a social housing-specific product because they had so many testimonials from social housing.”</p>
<p>She added: “When it comes to working with companies, we are clear in our desire for scale, and we will do everything in our power to help the founders we work with achieve their ambitious goals. We are looking for entrepreneurs who set the bar for impact-driven innovation high and who are focused on fundamentally changing or creating a category, in the same way Tesla has single-handedly propelled the electric vehicle industry forward. We set Eka up to back companies with that level of ambition.”<br />
 <br />
Timo Boldt, Founder of Gousto said: “Jon and Camilla are two of the best investors a founder could possibly hope for. They supported Gousto with our Series A back in 2013 and have been cheerleaders ever since. Their new venture, Eka, is tightly aligned with our own philosophy because of their focus on sustainability. Much like them, we believe in the power of people to drive change.”<br />
 <br />
Ken Cooper, Managing Director, Venture Solutions, British Business Bank said: “The Bank’s Enterprise Capital Funds programme is a key tool in helping to develop and maintain an effective venture capital provision in the UK, lowering the barriers to entry for emerging fund managers and for those targeting less well-served areas of the market.  Our commitment of £36m to Eka Ventures, will enable them to support new and growing sustainable consumer technology businesses in the UK.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Southeast Asia’s car marketplace wars are going into high drive. Today <a href="https://www.carsome.my/">Carsome Group</a>, one of the region’s largest online used car marketplaces, said it plans to acquire listings platform <a href="https://www.icarasia.com/">iCar Asia </a>in a transaction worth more than $200 million.</p>
<p>Carsome has agreed to acquire 19.9% of iCar Asia from Malaysia internet conglomerate Catcha Group. In exchange, Catcha Group will become a shareholder in Carsome Group. Carsome and Catcha Group have also made a joint proposal to iCar Asia’s directors to buy the rest of the company from its shareholders.</p>
<p>Carsome rival Carro <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/automotive-marketplace-carro-hits-unicorn-status-with-360m-series-c-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2/">revealed one month ago that it raised a $360 million Series C</a> led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, boosting it to unicorn status. A day after Carro’s announcement, <a href="https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/carsome-raising-200m-pre-ipo-245775/">DealStreetAsia reported that Carsome</a> is in talks to raise over $200 million in a pre-IPO round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Carsome hasn’t confirmed the funding, but it has been making moves to expand its reach, including <a href="https://www.carsome.my/news/item/carsome-indonesia-universal">a strategic investment in PT Universal</a>, an offline car and motorcycle auction company that has retail branches in five Indonesian cities. Carsome said its investment in PT Universal will allow it to double its automotive transaction volumes in Indonesia.</p>

<p>Now Carsome says its integration with iCar Asia will create a marketplace that is targeting $1 billion in revenue for this year, with about 100,000 cars transacted annually, more than 460,000 live partner listings and over 13,000 car dealers in its network. iCar Asia, which is listed on the Australian stock exchange,<a href="https://www.techinasia.com/icar-asia-reveals-acquisition-proposal-chinas-autohome"> announced last year</a> that it had received a takeover offer from China-based online auto marketplace Autohome.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Carsome co-founder and group chief executive officer Eric Cheng said the deal “is the first step toward consolidation to form the largest digital automotive group in terms of revenue, user base, largest live listing and the best end-to-end fulfilment capacity in the region.”</p>

<p>If you follow startup news from Indonesia, you know that the country’s <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-fintech-can-help-indonesias-small-and-medium-enterprises-survive-the-covid-19-pandemic-148528">estimated 60 million small businesses</a> are a hot target for tech companies. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/bukukas-gets-50m-from-investors-including-doordashs-gokul-rajaram-and-transferwise-co-founder-taavet-hinrikus/">BukuKas</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/bukuwarung-a-fintech-for-indonesian-msmes-scores-60m-series-a-led-by-valar-and-goodwater/">BukuWarung</a>, for example, both recently raised large rounds to fuel their race to digitize SMEs’ operations. Founded in November 2020, <a href="https://varaapp.com/">Vara</a> is focused specifically on making staff management easier for small businesses and their workers, replacing the notebooks or spreadsheets many relied on to keep track of payroll with an app called Bukugaji.</p>
<p>The company announced today it has raised $4.8 million in seed funding from Go Ventures, RTP Global, AlphaJWC, Sequoia Capital India’s Surge, FEBE Ventures and Taurus Ventures. Founded by Vidush Mahansaria and Abhinav Karale, who met while studying at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, Vara is part of the Surge accelerator program’s fifth cohort of startups. It says more than 100,000 small businesses are already using Bukugaji.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The app has features to track attendance, calculate salaries and worker loans and disburse payroll. Mahansaria told TechCrunch that Bukugaji is aimed at companies that have less than 30 employees. Many of them are in retail, food and beverage or labor-heavy service sectors like construction and transportation. Bukugaji has features for specific employee segments, like operational staff who usually work in shifts, or permanent staff whose paychecks are fixed over a specific time period.</p>
<p>“Before downloading and onboarding on Bukugaji, the vast majority of our users utilized notebooks to mark attendance and track payroll,” Mahansaria said. “A small portion used the notes features on their phones or simple Excel sheets.” Bukugaji is designed to be fully self-service, so businesses can download and start using the app on their own. Its main app is mobile only, but the platform also has a web version.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;BukuKas gets $50M from investors including DoorDash&#8217;s Gokul Rajaram and TransferWise founder Taavet Hinrikus&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/bukukas-gets-50m-from-investors-including-doordashs-gokul-rajaram-and-transferwise-co-founder-taavet-hinrikus/embed/#?secret=FvdF7YND4i" data-secret="FvdF7YND4i" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The businesses Bukugaji serves often have workers who are unbanked, meaning they don’t have access to a bank account or traditional financial services. Vara’s founders say many of them live paycheck to paycheck and this means they sometimes have to take out loans from their employers.</p>
<p>“Employees often request cash advances from their employers toward the end of the month, when they need the money the most because sometimes they can’t make ends meet,” said Mahansaria. “This has two outcomes: first, it ties up working capital for the employer. Second, it makes the employee increasingly reliant on the employer to meet emergency needs. It’s hard to break out of this cycle given the current limited accessibility to formal financial infrastructure for this market segment.”</p>
<p>Earned wage access (EWA) platforms are focused on solving this problem by giving employees on-demand access to wages, instead of having to wait for their paycheck. EWA companies are gaining traction around the world, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/wagely-an-indonesian-earned-wage-access-and-financial-services-platform-raises-5-6m/">Wagely</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/gajigesa-a-fintech-startup-serving-underbanked-indonesian-workers-raises-2-5-million-seed-round/">GajiGesa</a> in Indonesia. Vara doesn’t have immediate plans to add an EWA feature to Bukugaji, but it is something the company is thinking about as part of the value-additive services it will build into the platform.</p>
<p>“Owning end-to-end payroll and attendance gives us an information edge that is unparalleled for this labor segment,” Mahansaria said, noting that the data can enable companies to add things like benefits that their employees usually don’t have access to, and in turn give workers a digitally-verified work history.</p>
<p>In the near future, Bukugaji will add time-saving features like automated allowances and overtime, dashboard shortcuts, reminders and customizable reports. It also plans to allow employers to disburse salaries directly through the platform. Over the longer term, Bukugaji will offer data analytics to companies and their workers. For example, employees will also be able to see how their earnings have changed over time. Employers, meanwhile can spot trends in attendance and salary.</p>
<p>Though Vara may eventually expand into markets, Mahansaria said it is currently “razor-focused on Indonesia,” where <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2020/07/17/smes-safeguard-economy.html">SMEs account </a>for about 60% of the country’s gross domestic product and employ the vast majority of its workforce.</p>
