										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the third time this month, AWS today suffered an outage in one of its data centers. This morning, a power outage in its US-EAST-1 region affected services like Slack, Asana, Epic Games and others.</p>
<p>The issues started around 7:30 a.m. ET and the knock-on effect of these issues continues to plague the service as of 1 p.m. ET, as AWS continues to report issues with a number of services in this region, specifically its EC2 compute service and related networking functions. Most recently, the single sign-on service in this region also started seeing increased error rates.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can confirm a loss of power within a single data center within a single Availability Zone (USE1-AZ4) in the US-EAST-1 Region,&#8221; the company explained in an <a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/?ascsubtag=[]vg[p]22613821[t]w[d]D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a> at 8 a.m. ET. &#8220;This is affecting availability and connectivity to EC2 instances that are part of the affected data center within the affected Availability Zone. We are also experiencing elevated RunInstance API error rates for launches within the affected Availability Zone. Connectivity and power to other data centers within the affected Availability Zone, or other Availability Zones within the US-EAST-1 Region are not affected by this issue, but we would recommend failing away from the affected Availability Zone (USE1-AZ4) if you are able to do so.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250723" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If this had been the only AWS outage in recent weeks, it would have barely been noteworthy. Given the complexity of the modern hyper clouds, outages are bound to happen every now and then. But outages are currently a weekly occurrence for AWS. On December 7, the same US-EAST-1 region went <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/amazon-web-services-went-down-and-took-a-bunch-of-the-internet-with-it/">down for hours</a> due to a networking issue. Then, on December 17, an outage that affected connectivity between two of its West Coast regions took down services from the likes of Netflix, Slack and Amazon&#8217;s own Ring. To add insult to injury, all of these outages happened shortly after AWS touted the resilience of its cloud at its re:Invent conference earlier this month.</p>
<p>Ideally, of course, none of these outages would ever happen and there are some ways that AWS users can protect themselves from them by architecting their systems to fail over to a geographically separate region &#8212; but that can add significant cost, so some decide that the trade-off between downtime and cost isn&#8217;t worth it. At the end of the day, it&#8217;s on AWS to provide a stable platform. And while it&#8217;s hard to say if the company is just having a string of bad luck or if there are any systematic issues that have led to these problems, if I were hosting a service in the US-EAST-1 region right now, I would probably at least consider moving it elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Great news! After a long COVID delay, my fiancée finally arrived in the U.S. on her K visa. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We’re thinking about eloping to Las Vegas for a quick wedding so we can get started on her green card application. (In Silicon Valley, we’d have to wait a few months to get a marriage license.) </strong></p>
<p><strong>After we file, we want to have a big wedding in the spring with her family and friends in her hometown and then go on a honeymoon. Is that allowed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Happy in Hayward</strong></p>
<p>Dear Happy,</p>
<p>Congratulations on being reunited with your fiancée through the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/k-1-visa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K-1 visa</a> and your upcoming wedding! My law partner, Anita Koumriqian, has been immersed in her own wedding planning these past few months. So, in addition to being an expert in family immigration law, she’s super knowledgeable about all things related to getting married, including local Silicon Valley jurisdictions that have residency requirements for a marriage license and generally how long it takes to get a marriage certificate. On our <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/102-home-for-the-holidays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a>, we chatted about wedding planning, marriage licenses, applying for a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/marriage-based-green-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">green card for a spouse</a> once you’re married, and the dos and don’ts of proving to immigration that your marriage is legit.</p>
<p>Always consult with an immigration attorney first and never just rely on Googling your way through the green card process. For more details, check out our prior podcast, <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/058-engaged-now-what/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engaged, Now What?</a></p>

<h2>Vegas is still possible</h2>
<p>Once you have your marriage certificate, you can file for a green card for your wife. Locally, while <a href="https://clerkrecorder.sccgov.org/services-we-provide/vital-services-birth-death-marriage/apply-marriage-license" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santa Clara</a> and <a href="https://sfgov.org/countyclerk/marriage-license-and-civilcommitment-ceremony-online-reservations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">San Francisco</a> counties are still backlogged in issuing marriage licenses due to COVID, nearby <a href="https://www.sccoclerk.us/CountyClerkHome/MarriageLicenses.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santa Cruz County</a> is quicker and allows you to get married in California.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As nostalgia goes, the Fisher-Price Chatter phone doesn&#8217;t disappoint. The classic retro kids toy was given a modern revamp for the holiday season with the new release for adults which, unlike the original toy designed for kids, can make and receive calls over Bluetooth using a nearby smartphone.</p>
<p>The Chatter — despite a working rotary dial and its trademark wobbly eyes that bob up and down when the wheels turn — is less a phone and more like a novelty Bluetooth speaker with a microphone, which activates when the handset is lifted.</p>
<p>The Chatter didn&#8217;t spend long on sale; the phone sold out quickly as the waitlists piled up. But security researchers in the U.K. immediately spotted a potential problem. With just the online instruction manual to go on, the researchers feared that a design flaw could allow someone to use the Chatter to eavesdrop.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250695" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ken Munro, founder of the cybersecurity company Pen Test Partners, told TechCrunch that chief among the concerns are that the Chatter does not have a secure pairing process to stop unauthorized phones in Bluetooth range from connecting to it.</p>
<p>Munro outlined <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/audio-bugging-with-the-fisher-price-chatter-bluetooth-telephone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a series of tests</a> that would confirm or allay his concerns. Since the Chatter is only available in the U.S. and was persistently sold out, TechCrunch set a page monitor to tell us when it was back in stock, bought one, and started testing.</p>
<p>First, we switched on the Chatter phone, which activates its Bluetooth connection, paired a phone over Bluetooth, then switched off Bluetooth to simulate someone walking the phone out of range. We then paired another phone with the Chatter without hindrance, allowing us to remotely control the Chatter&#8217;s audio.</p>
<p>Mattel, which makes the Chatter phone, said the phone &#8220;will time out if no connection is made or once the pairing occurs — it is only discoverable within a narrow window of time and requires physical access to the device.&#8221; We left the Chatter on and found the Bluetooth pairing process did not time out after more than an hour.</p>
<p>Then, Munro asked what would happen if we called the phone connected to the Chatter. Sure enough, the Chatter rang — loudly — as expected. Then we called the Chatter again, this time without properly replacing its receiver. With the handset off the hook, the Chatter automatically answered the call, immediately activating the handset&#8217;s microphone and allowing us to hear ambient background audio.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Pen Test Partners found a similar Bluetooth vulnerability in a child&#8217;s toy doll called My Friend Cayla, which the researchers found <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/making-childrens-toys-swear/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could be paired</a> with another person&#8217;s phone if the parent&#8217;s phone goes out of range. The toy was eventually pulled from shelves after it was found the doll, when <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/12/20/506208146/this-doll-may-be-recording-what-children-say-privacy-groups-charge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connected to its app</a>, was recording what children were saying.</p>
<p>The Chatter doesn&#8217;t have an app, and Mattel said the Chatter phone was released as &#8220;a limited promotional item and a playful spin on a classic toy for adults.&#8221; But Munro said he&#8217;s concerned the Chatter&#8217;s lack of secure pairing could be exploited by a nearby neighbor or a determined attacker, or that the Chatter could be handed down to kids, who could then unknowingly trigger the bug.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t need kids to interact with it in order for it to become an audio bug. Just leaving the handset off is enough,&#8221; said Munro.</p>
<p>When reached about the findings, Mattel spokesperson Kelly Powers said the company is &#8220;committed to security and we will be investigating these claims.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the past year, AngelList has grown from a platform that connects angel investors with startups to an end-to-end suite of tools, working on everything from fund operations to founder cap table management.</p>
<p>Throughout this growth, the company has quietly amassed millions of data points that show appetite, both from investors and regular employees, for burgeoning startups. And, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1900605/000190060521000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">per SEC filings</a>, AngelList isn’t letting those fresh insights go to waste.</p>
<p><a href="https://angel.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AngelList</a> has quietly landed $25 million for the AngelList Early Stage Quant Fund, a new investment vehicle that plans $250,000 checks into over 100 companies. The largest limited partner in the fund is WorldQuant Ventures, an early-stage investment firm connected to a quantitative asset management firm. Other investors in Quant Fund include Two Sigma Ventures, KAMCO Ventures, Plexo Capital, Tom Tunguz of Redpoint and AngelList founder Naval Ravikant.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250682" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The operation, part of AngelList Venture, will be led by a four-person data team from within the company. In an interview with TechCrunch, <a href="https://angel.co/p/abraham-othman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abraham Othman</a>, head of the investment committee and of data science at AngelList Venture, explained that Quant Fund’s mission is to use more quantitative factors to decide which startups to invest in.</p>
<p>&#8220;If<span style="font-weight: 400;"> you think about quant investing in venture, there’s a lot of understanding around the metrics that drive SaaS startup success, particularly B2B startup SaaS,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is vastly different for other sectors.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>His team tracks the velocity of hiring demand for a startup, looking at how many job applications a single company gets within a specific period of time. The signal strips out factors like investor bias, the founder’s networks and even buzzy valuations.</p>
<p>“I do think, in general, one of the aims of AngelList as it moves forward is to manage more institutional capital,” Othman said. “We are taking advantage of some of the data” the platform already has. Other than <a href="https://www.angellist.com/access-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AngelList’s access fund</a>, a smaller investment vehicle, this is the company’s first, more traditional-looking venture fund.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>About 2 million users use AngelList Talent to apply to startups each quarter. Currently, AngelList is primarily going to be investing in startups in the United States and India, because that’s where the majority of applicants on its platform are coming from.</p>
<p>AngelList talent sees about 35,000 companies a quarter get active interest, but only half of those companies are investable early-stage businesses (the rest being Series B+ companies, consulting companies, venture capital firms, etc). Of those 17,000 companies per quarter, AngelList’s data team reaches out to the 20 companies getting the most hiring demand as potential investments.</p>
<p>Othman thinks they win deals because of the cut-and-dry approach, which he thinks is “less adversarial” than other investors who may be more focused on risk factors, or traditional pitches, before writing a check.</p>
<p>“Our approach? This is our data set, let’s see if we can put money into them,” he said.</p>
<p>Othman says that the data-driven approach has led to greater diversity of the startups, both in mission and founder, compared to traditional generalist funds. He estimates that about 50% of founders within the fund’s portfolio identify as women.</p>
<p>There are some challenges with leaning on one, somewhat broad, signal to make investments. As history often reminds us, due diligence matters &#8212; and vetting an investment beyond its ability to attract talent can save firms from headaches or legal woes. Additionally, a startup could get a ton of applicants due to pay, location or even recent coverage in a Well Known Tech Blog &#8212; which can bode for success, but could also just be a result of great marketing. To Othman, the fact that hiring demand can be impacted by so many different dynamics makes it a positive signal to look at, not a manipulated one.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">A future of data-driven investments comes with a key tension: The bias of the “art” of an investment may be what has left out historically overlooked individuals, but it also adds some layer of humanity to decision-makers before they get millions to execute on a vision.</span></p>
<p>Algorithm-based investing is getting more attention, with Rocketship VC flexing<a href="https://www.rocketship.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a data-driven investment strategy</a>, ClearCo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/clearco-gets-the-softbank-stamp-of-approval-in-new-215m-round/">writing checks based on startup spend</a> and Hum Capital using artificial intelligence <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/hum-capital-thinks-the-future-of-funding-is-a-return-to-old-school-wall-street/">to connect businesses to the available funders on the platform. </a></p>
<p>AngelList has already made several investments with this strategy, putting money into startups such as <a href="https://www.pinata.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Piñata</a>, a reward and credit building platform for renters, and <a href="https://hiemile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emile</a>, an on-demand <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/emile-learning-seed-kleiner-perkins/">educational service for high schoolers. </a>The fund also plans to put money into roll-up vehicles, which allow founders to raise capital from up to 250 accredited investors with a single line on the cap table, but that will be a minority of investments.</p>
<p>It seems that AngelList has been rethinking its recruitment penetration for quite a while now. In the early innings of the pandemic, April 2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/angellist-lays-off-a-number-of-staff-and-cuts-executive-salaries/">the startup had layoffs</a> that sources say largely impacted the company’s talent arm, which connects job-seekers with startups looking to hire. Then the layoffs came as a response to hiring freezes from tech startups waiting out the economic downturn.</p>
<p>If there’s a repeat of that freeze, Othman thinks that hiring can still work as a “pretty robust signal across economic conditions.” He explained that his team got a glimpse of which companies were recruiting talent in April and May 2020, and said that “companies at the top of the list have since 6’xd their valuation.”</p>
<p>In the past, AngelList CEO Avlok Kohli said that the AngelList will not return to its fundraising marketplace roots. “Our view is that the market is quite efficient, and we can’t offer an experience that is much better than what is happening today,”<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/angellist-stack-founder/"> he said in September. </a></p>
<p>Today, Kohli’s sentiment seems to be changing, as his company begins to directly invest in the founders on the platform. In an e-mailed statement, Kohli said that “the new fund is a small yet important step to connect institutional capital with startups in a quantitative fashion…we’re the only platform with the dataset and reach to execute an initiative like this.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Short video app Triller is set to go public via a reverse merger with video-tech company SeaChange International, the two companies <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/12/22/2356795/0/en/Triller-to-the-ILLR-Triller-Hold-Co-LLC-expected-to-become-publicly-traded-on-Nasdaq-through-a-reverse-merger-with-publicly-traded-company-SeaChange-International-Inc-NASDAQ-SEAC.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on Wednesday. The combined entity will be valued at approximately $5 billion. The boards of both companies have approved the proposed merger and the deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022, subject to regulatory and stockholder approvals.</p>
<p>Similar to TikTok, Triller allows users to create and share short-form videos set to music. The Los Angeles-based company initially launched in 2015 and the app has been downloaded more than 250 million times. Triller has attracted many notable users, like Justin Bieber, Marshmello, The Weeknd, Alicia Keys, Cardi B, Eminem, Post Malone and Kevin Hart. The app has also inked deals with popular TikTok users, such as Charli D&#8217;Amelio and Noah Beck. Former U.S. President Donald Trump also used the app, although he hasn&#8217;t posted a new video on the platform since January.</p>
<p>Following the completion of the merger, SeaChange will change its name to TrillerVerz Corp. The Acton, Massachusetts-based company describes itself as a supplier of video delivery software solutions that power cloud and on-premise video delivery platforms. The combined company will be led by Mahi de Silva, the CEO of Triller&#8217;s parent company. Peter Aquino, the president and CEO of SeaChange, will join the TrillerVerz team.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250666" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We believe TrillerVerz is becoming the voice of youth culture, a brand that sits at the nexus of content, creator, commerce, and culture in the digital world,&#8221; said de Silva, in a statement. &#8220;Our strategy is to continue to build the world&#8217;s largest stage for creators to distribute and monetize viral and engaging content with experiences that elevate culture. We believe that combining with SeaChange accelerates our advertising and marketing capabilities by extending our reach to cable, satellite, and OTT media.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two companies say TrillerVerz is positioned to become a leading AI-powered social media platform for content, creators and commerce. TrillerVerz plans to expand its revenue streams by increasing its global footprint and investment in new growth opportunities across the creator economy and emerging technologies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The business combination with TrillerVerz represents a tremendous opportunity to invest in the future of creativity,&#8221; SeaChange CEO Peter Aquino said in a statement. &#8220;We believe that TrillerVerz&#8217;s unmatched social media reach, Gen Z engagement, and the opportunity to meaningfully expand its global multi-platform presence across content, commerce, creators, and being at the forefront of e-commerce, adtech, and NFTs, including the metaverse, is a compelling investment with the potential to create significant value.”</p>
<p>News of the merger comes as Triller and its parent company have been expanding the social video platform over the past year. Last month, Triller <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/triller-acquires-thuzio-leader-in-b2b-premium-influencer-events-and-experiences-strategic-acquisition-is-latest-step-in-trillers-rapid-growth-in-live-event-programming-301430578.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> Thuzio, a company focused on business-to-business premium influencer events and experiences.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In April, Triller <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/triller-owner-gets-a-new-ceo-with-acquisition-of-amplify-ai-also-acquires-live-streaming-service-fite-tv/">acquired</a> AI-based customer engagement platform Amplify.AI, which works with brands in CPG, financial services, automotive, telecom, politics and digital media, among others. In the same month, Triller also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/triller-owner-gets-a-new-ceo-with-acquisition-of-amplify-ai-also-acquires-live-streaming-service-fite-tv/">acquired</a> FITE TV, a live event and pay-per-view combat sports streaming platform. In March, Triller acquired live music streaming platform Verzuz, which was founded by Swizz Beats and Timbaland.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Enterprise software giant Sage has acquired the remaining stake in <a href="https://www.brightpearl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brightpearl</a>, originally a U.K.-based startup in cloud retail management, for $340 million. Brightpearl provides a SaaS-based retail operating system, enabling real-time business insights.</p>
<p>Sage previously owned 17% of the Bristol, U.K.-based startup, which MMC Ventures, a U.K. Series A investor, backed in 2014. The startup had previously raised $15 millionin 2018 and $11 million in 2016.</p>
<p>The consideration for the 83% of Brightpearl that Sage does not already own is $299 million (£226 million), which will be funded from Sage’s existing cash and available liquidity.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250701" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Brightpearl CEO Derek O’Carroll said: “Bringing our two teams together will help combine the retail strength of Brightpearl and the scale, brand and financial expertise of Sage.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement, Sage said that for the year ending December 2021, Brightpearl is expected to generate revenues of $27 million (£20 million), representing growth of around 50% compared to the prior year, and to achieve operating profit around the breakeven level.</p>
<p>The transaction is subject to regulatory clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in the U.S., and is expected to close in January 2022.</p>
<p>Steve Hare, chief executive officer of Sage, commented: “Sage’s purpose is to knock down barriers so everyone can thrive. Together, Sage and Brightpearl will remove the barriers that hold back retailers and wholesalers, streamlining their systems and enabling them to focus on growth. I’m delighted to welcome Brightpearl, its management team and colleagues to Sage, and look forward to executing on our strategic priorities together and delivering accelerated growth.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6879427549739397121/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Writing on linkedIn</a>, former co-founder Andrew Mulvenna said: “This is a fantastic end to a chapter started 14 years ago when Chris Tanner and I started the business with the vision to help every small retailer digitise their data and workflows and embrace omni-channel retail and become one of the success stories of tomorrow…Our CEO Derek O&#8217;Carroll and team have been exceptional, and there are too many others to mention.

</div><p id="speakable-summary">It’s human nature to reflexively categorize and sort the information we encounter in our daily lives. To influence the way prospective customers understand your brand, you must present it in a way that helps them decide how to think about your brand.</p>
<p>This process is called positioning, and it’s the single most important (and least understood) component of your brand book. Positioning is the message that’s received, not the one that’s delivered. It’s not simply what you say, it’s how that information is arranged in a customer’s mind. Essentially, where does it land? What space does it ultimately wind up occupying?</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Positioning is about, well, taking a position. It’s a stake you plant in the minds of your prospective customers about what your brand can uniquely claim and defend. A positioning statement is a crisp, comprehensive way to guide someone on how to think about your company.</p>
<p>It defines and frames your brand, making it the central organizing structure of your brand’s messaging and strategy. To construct your positioning statement, you first have to do some work in surfacing its component parts.</p>
<p>Here’s how:</p>
<p>Since positioning is about the space you occupy in the mind of your customer, you can’t figure out how to position your brand until you know exactly who that customer is. There’s an order of operations in developing your brand, and developing your target personas comes before positioning. It’s also useful to have your brand’s ethos fully developed before attempting to determine your positioning. Understanding who you are and who you’re serving are vital first inputs.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Your positioning statement serves as the foundation for developing your key messaging, value propositions, tag lines, and voice and tone.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>After the target customer is established, it’s time to figure out your frame of reference — the context in which consumers view your brand. By providing consumers with a frame of reference, you’re equipping them with the information they require to categorize, contextualize and then compare your brand with what’s already familiar to them.</p>
<p>This is important, because potential customers need to consider points of parity (that is, what your brand is like) before they can consider points of differentiation (what makes your brand unique). Competitive frames of reference tend to be specific to reduce the number of brands competing for that prospect’s attention.</p>
<p>The specificity of a frame of reference signals to the customer where to place it in their minds, and the smaller the category, the better your chances of owning it (or at least, standing out).</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Write down the top five brands in your category. If you’re not No. 1 in that category, brainstorm other categories your brand is first or best in.</p>
<p><em>Some inspiration:</em></p>
<p>Panera Bread is not the No.1 fast-food chain, but it is the No. 1 fast-casual bakery cafe. Their frame of reference doesn’t try to compete with entrenched giants like McDonald’s or Starbucks. Instead, it puts Panera in a more specific, more ownable category.</p>
<p>White Claw isn’t the top canned alcoholic beverage, but it IS the No. 1 seltzer that gets you drunk. That makes “hard seltzer” an effective frame of reference for a brand that would rather lead a category than compete with beer, malt beverages and wine coolers.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serial fintech entrepreneur Walter Cruttenden founded Acorns with his son, Jeff, in 2012 with the goal of helping low- and middle-income households invest and save responsibly. The pair wanted to simplify investing for the millions that have trouble getting started or continuing to invest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then in 2018, Walter went live with a new company &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/17/acorns-co-founder-nabs-another-5-million-for-blast-a-startup-that-saves-while-you-game">Blast</a>. With that venture, he aimed to challenge traditional banking yet again by bringing personalized financial tools to gamers. In other words, Blast wanted to give users a way to save money while playing video games. (Cruttenden apparently acquired some patents from Acorns in order to start this company.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now as 2021 comes to a close, Cruttenden’s latest fintech, Ant Money, is announcing it has raised $20 million in funding (a mix of previously unannounced seed and Series A capital) and acquired Blast via a stock-for-stock merger.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250567" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cruttenden founded </span><a href="https://antmoney.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ant Money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a micro-income startup, with Mike Gleason in March of 2020. Gleason, who previously founded and sold Consumer Brands, also had previously teamed up with Walter to start a data monetization company called Ant Transaction Machines. He serves as Ant Money’s CEO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the process of building another company called Ant Transaction Machines and working with Blast, we realized that if we created a common platform that we could move faster in terms of our larger mission, which was helping people open their first investment account,&#8221; Gleason said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That common platform is (obviously) Ant Money. Gleason describes the startup as “a comprehensive, larger vision which now involves three apps and a platform.” Its current apps that are driving investment accounts launched about this time last year: ATM and Learn &amp; Earn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The merger brings three apps &#8212; ATM, Blast and Learn &amp; Earn &#8212; under the Ant Money umbrella. The company insists that the move is not a consolidation. Each app will continue to exist and function on its own. </span><a href="https://blast.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will continue to be gaming-focused. </span><a href="https://atm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ATM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is focused on letting users earn micro-income. </span><a href="https://app.learnandearn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn &amp; Earn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is focused on increasing financial literacy. And all three are focused on helping users to open financial investment accounts.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ATM specifically is </span><span class="s1">an app designed so users earn micro-income to save money or invest in the stock market through the company&#8217;s <span class="s2">SEC-licensed &#8220;advisors,&#8221; or </span>embedded finance tools. Ant Money claims that users can earn $100 to $1,000 or more per year with the ATM app based on their level of engagement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ATM app started off with a &#8220;monetize your data&#8217; angle, but Ant has since softened that up a bit because, according to Gleason, it’s not actually selling or even sharing any data at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are doing is we&#8217;re basically creating a way for investors to participate in rewards programs. So instead of opening an investment account and saying, ‘Hey, here&#8217;s some rewards,’ we&#8217;re actually going out and saying here&#8217;s income from rewards or advertising and then go ahead and invest that,” Gleason said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the merger, the Ant Money apps (ATM and Learn &amp; Earn) had more than 500,000 users that were acquired over the past 12 months. Of those 500,000 users, 100,000 have investment accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re able to go now and offer investment to more and more of those 500,000 users,” Gleason said. “Our target is to end next year with a million investment accounts and over 3 million users.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ant Money is working with “very large” companies (some with over 100 million customers) who offer cash back or rewards or rebates about making its SDK (software development toolkit) available for them to embed into its investment platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we think of Ant Money, we think of ourselves as the ‘Affirm of investment,’” Gleason told TechCrunch. “Affirm went out with buy now, pay later and it’s embedded everywhere. We at Ant Money are going out and embedding what we’ve already created and built as a way to open investment accounts. I think that’s a really big differentiator for us from our competitors.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon first learning about Ant Money, my first thought was, “Is it an Acorns competitor? Or is it more like Robinhood?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It actually is positioned “somewhere in between Acorns and Robinhood,” according to Gleason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acorns rounds up change, and that goes into ETF buckets to diversify. There is no individual choice of stocks. Robinhood gave choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And Walter really created </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robo-Bumpers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is a hybrid model where  the funds flow into ETFs and then the investor can allocate up to 50% of those individual stock picks from our pre-curated list,” Gleason said. (One half </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the portfolio comprises five of “the largest, lowest-cost ETFs in the world,” according to the company, and the other half allows for customization of up to 10 individual stocks.)</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2250571" style="width: 362px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2250571" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2250571 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/walter-cruttenden.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="352" height="352" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/walter-cruttenden.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/walter-cruttenden.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/walter-cruttenden.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/walter-cruttenden.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/walter-cruttenden.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/walter-cruttenden.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/walter-cruttenden.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/walter-cruttenden.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/walter-cruttenden.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/walter-cruttenden.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2250571" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walter Cruttenden / Ant Money</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coinbase too could be viewed as competition, since it leveraged the concept of “Learn &amp; Earn” within its platform to help educate investors. And then there’s Public.com, which is also bringing in education and other information to investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we’re in the middle of all this but I think we have a great advantage in terms of our ability to open investment accounts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with very low customer acquisition costs that are much lower than our competitors, and scale,” Gleason said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Acorns, Ant Money is not targeting any specific income bracket. Users can be as young as 13 but so far, the startup is gaining a lot of traction with younger investors &#8212; in the 18-22/23-year-old range. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ant Money currently has 55 employees and plans to use some of its new capital to increase its headcount as well as continue to acquire new customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, the company’s revenue model is a mix of adtech and fintech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ant Money gets revenue from advertisers indirectly as well as through a monthly subscription fee for its educational component. And lastly, some large corporations or nonprofits are sponsoring content or classes. Gemini, for example, is offering sponsored courses on crypto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We really want to make this all easy, simple and straightforward for our investors,” Gleason said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Cross, managing director of Franklin Templeton’s Franklin Venture Partners, believes that embedding investment functionality into apps that already pay users rewards or other incentives is “a fantastic way to help young investors get started, and an innovative way for Ant Money to build a large customer base with relatively low customer acquisition costs.” His firm led the round, with participation from Steelpoint Capital Partners, Walter Cruttenden, RX3 Ventures and SteelBridge Laboratories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gleason declined to say how much Newport Beach, California-based Ant Money paid for Blast but did note that some of the Series A capital was issued to Blast holders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides founding several fintechs, Walter Cruttenden also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">founded Roth Capital Partners and is the former head of eTrade’s investment banking arm. Today, he serves as Acorn an Ant Money’s chairman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Declining to be interviewed due to a quiet period as Acorns is set to go public, Cruttenden said in a written statement that his hope is that Ant Money, which helps people generate small amounts of money to seed investment accounts, “can foster new growing accounts and provide increased financial security for millions.&#8221;</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Avoma aims to set it apart from competitors by bringing meeting management, AI assistant and conversation intelligence into one tool.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Taking notes during a meeting is an art form, requiring multitasking skills for listening, typing and coming up with intelligent things to say while you do the other two. Not to mention the three or four different applications we use to prepare, run and follow-through with meetings.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.avoma.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avoma</a> thinks we are doing too much and using too many apps during meetings and something is bound to get lost. It developed software that automates meeting workflows and makes nearly any kind of conversation more actionable.</p>
<p>Today, the Palo Alto-based company announced $12 million in Series A funding in a round led by Headline, with participation from Storm Ventures, Global Founder Capital, Zoom Apps Fund, Operator Partners, Industry Ventures and existing investors K9 Ventures, Dragon Capital and Twin Ventures. The new round gives the company $15 million in total funding.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250482" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Founded in 2017 by Aditya Kothadiya, Devendra Laulkar and Albert Lai, Avoma developed an artificial intelligence meeting assistant that has templates for meeting agendas and takes both notes and video, transcribes everything in real time, summarizes the notes and calls out actionable insights for participants in the agenda.</p>
<p>CEO Kothadiya was previously with [24]7.ai, a customer acquisition and engagement software and services provider, which acquired his company, Shopalize, in 2013. He says Avoma gives people a few hours of their time back per week, and on average, improves meeting outcomes by 30%.</p>
<p>“As a product leader, I was constantly in meetings and spent time taking notes,” he said. “With every new product, I would hand it over to the customer or product market team, but would find that during meetings, I was not listening to what was going on because I was taking notes. We wanted to apply technology to this so we would make sure nothing was lost.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2250486" style="width: 1407px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2250486" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2250486 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Avoma-Call-Notes-e1640120029953.png" alt="Avoma" width="1397" height="767" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Avoma-Call-Notes-e1640120029953.png 1397w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Avoma-Call-Notes-e1640120029953.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Avoma-Call-Notes-e1640120029953.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Avoma-Call-Notes-e1640120029953.png?resize=768,422 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Avoma-Call-Notes-e1640120029953.png?resize=680,373 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Avoma-Call-Notes-e1640120029953.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1397px) 100vw, 1397px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2250486" class="wp-caption-text">Avoma call notes. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Avoma</p></div></p>
<p>Workplace productivity tools are not new, and certainly gained adoption and attention as everyone worked from home during the global pandemic. However, Kothadiya believes that what sets Avoma apart is bringing meeting management, AI assistant and conversation intelligence into one tool, rather than continuing to purchase multiple tools.</p>
<p>It even integrates with a company’s CRM to add information. In addition, the technology enables the user to see who did most of the talking during the meeting and when. You also can search for keywords and listen to a snippet of video from there.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“AI does the first draft, but then you have notes and can go back and highlight notes and provide more context if you need to,” Kothadiya added.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the new funding in three pillars: AI, user interface and workflow integrations. It will continue to improve its machine learning and natural language understanding capabilities to automate note-taking and also other user cases across a meeting’s entire lifecycle.</p>
<p>It also will invest in product development so the tool provides a good user experience that has low friction. And, it will also continue developing its AI assistant and its integrations into a company’s existing systems.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;6 strategies for running more effective startup board meetings&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/6-strategies-for-running-effective-startup-board-meetings/embed/#?secret=vb0EA2I27L" data-secret="vb0EA2I27L" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The new funding comes at a time when Avoma is seeing some good growth. The company’s revenue has grown over 400% each year for the past three years, and it touts a customer list of more than 300.</p>
<p>The company has also been facilitating that growth with a fairly lean team. Employee growth doubled since last December to 15, but with the new funding, Kothadiya plans to pump that up by four times in the next 12 months across positions and in both North America and India.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jett Fein, partner at Headline, said he is particularly interested in products with “obsessed customers.” He saw that with both Gopuff and Avoma and believes Avoma will be the product of choice for mid-market companies and is the glue holding the sales process together in our new remote world. In fact, Avoma was a product Headline started using internally as an investment, “and loved it.”</p>
<p>“It helped in our own processes, and when we talked to their customers, they were obsessed, many of them saying they could not live without it,” Fein said. “They said it made their work that much more efficient. We heard that more consistently, and it piqued our interest in a huge way.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ocurate believes lifetime value is a better prediction of how much profit a customer will bring to the company. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.ocurate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ocurate</a>, a startup using artificial intelligence to predict customer lifetime value for e-commerce businesses, took in an oversubscribed seed round of $3.5 million.</p>
<p>Backers in the round include 8-Bit Capital, DCF Capital, Data Community Fund, AIX Ventures, Italmobiliare, Streamlined Ventures and some individual strategic angel investors like Adam Metzger and Mazen Al-Jubeir.</p>
<p>Tobi Konitzer, founder and CEO of Ocurate, founded the company in July to establish lifetime value as an organizing principle for business-to-consumer companies. Konitzer, who was previously co-founder and CEO of PredictWise, told TechCrunch the company’s “secret sauce” is a SaaS deep machine learning framework optimized over Ocurate’s proprietary database and customer data that exceeds 90% accuracy at predicting people’s behavior.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250457" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Currently, companies use metrics they evaluated themselves, and often look at cost per click or action and then retention. Konitzer believes lifetime value is a better prediction of how much profit a customer will bring to the company.</p>
<p>Ocurate’s database started with voter rolls and now has collected data from more than 300,000 Americans, he said. It also pulls data in from clients; for example, if you are a Netflix subscriber, the data might include login data, telemetry data and what was purchased in the past.</p>
<p>“Ocurate&#8217;s technology allows our clients to take actions on lifetime value confidently at all stages of the life cycle, which has a significant impact on our customer&#8217;s overall business with a potential increase of gross profit by over 15%,” Konitzer added. “Lifetime value should be the thing that governs everything.”</p>
<p>Though established five months ago, Ocurate is already working with four clients — with dozens in the pipeline — and has brought in over $400,000 in annual recurring revenue since launch.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;5 predictions for the future of e-commerce&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/5-predictions-for-the-future-of-e-commerce/embed/#?secret=GGjSxOmecw" data-secret="GGjSxOmecw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Two of its customers, Wild Earth and eSalon, say they are already getting good insights. Tamim Mourad, co-founder of eSalon, an e-commerce site for hair color, said that for years the company tried to build its own lifetime value model to be better at prediction, but didn’t have a data science team. With Ocurate, it can now build more accurate predictive models to better target and segment clients, and understand where the company sits historically.</p>
<p>Steve Simitzis, chief technology officer for pet food company Wild Earth, said he is focused on customer retention and reducing churn, but traditional methods of doing this often means chasing after customers, which is both annoying and expensive.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“What I liked about Ocurate is that they focused on giving a good sense of customers who were likely to churn so we could pinpoint our efforts,” he said. “For each customer, they give you two numbers, likely churn and how persuadable they are.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the new funding will enable Ocurate to get its product out to the public in 2022, double its team from seven employees to 14 and further invest in integrations, data science and machine learning capabilities.</p>
<p>Next up, the company intends to raise another round in the second quarter of 2023, and Konitzer said Ocurate is on target to have 20 customers by the end of next year.</p>
<p>“At the forefront of making lifetime value actionable, we have to demonstrate that we influence the way it works, but essentially, here is who you should reach out to at different points, and here is how much money to put into this,” Konitzer said. “We are building out a recommendation system.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary"><em>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/introducing-the-techcrunch-global-affairs-project/">TechCrunch Global Affairs Project</a> examines the increasingly intertwined relationship between the tech sector and global politics.</em></p>
<p>In the wake of its recent Democracy Summit, the U.S. has proposed that “like-minded democracies” should form a new “Alliance for the Future of the Internet” to uphold open, liberal values online. The latest in <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/how-digital-minilaterals-can-revive-international-cooperation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a long line of cooperation initiatives</a>, it is a promising candidate for delivering progress. But in its current guise, it risks falling short. Now, with disagreements between officials <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/white-house-alliance-future-internet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delaying</a> the launch, the U.S. must take this opportunity for a rethink.</p>
<p>The underlying logic behind the Alliance remains sound: Internet freedoms are increasingly under threat globally, governments are competing to assert their authority, and a decades-long governance system formed of voluntary bodies is now creaking. As Tim Wu, adviser to the Biden administration on tech policy, recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1q0_k7gVOQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>, “we are on the wrong trajectory.” Against this backdrop, a new initiative to promote and defend open, liberal values in the internet era is sorely needed.<br />

<p>In practice, however, the U.S. focus on “like-minded democracies” working together risks undermining its own objectives. That’s because the future of the open internet will not be secured either by a small club of democracies talking only to themselves or by employing coercion alone. Instead, any Alliance must be far more inclusive, focusing on setting the economic and security incentives right from day one to build a wide and sustainable coalition for the long term.</p>
<p>This would represent a much more internationalist approach to internet policy than the U.S. has usually needed to take. For decades, America’s outsized jurisdictional power has underwritten the open internet model: Despite only 7.1% of the world’s internet users being based in the U.S., <a href="https://institute.global/policy/open-internet-brink-origins-and-evolution#who-controls-the-internet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it is home to 61% of core infrastructure services for the global internet</a>. Its dominance has supported the model of permissionless innovation, interoperable networks and &#8220;dumb pipes&#8221; — infrastructure that can’t see what content it is transporting — which has generated such immense economic and social value. Only China, home to 19% of global internet users, has comparable geopolitical sway.</p>
<p>Yet U.S. hegemony can be relied upon no longer to maintain a free internet. Many countries are at a tipping point in how they govern the internet, with authoritarian internet models including censorship, surveillance and shutdowns quickly gaining ground. And today, 3.7 billion people still do not have internet access.</p>
<p>As connectivity improves, the developing countries that are home to most of this group will come to determine the future of the internet — and at present they are likelier to receive the necessary financing from China than anywhere else. The shift to a multipolar internet is a given, but its direction — open or closed, liberal or authoritarian — is not.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On these trends, focusing only on cooperation among today’s democracies amounts to overindexing on an ever-smaller section of the internet. Organizing solely around values also highlights those areas where traditional allies are not yet in agreement, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/digital-bridge/digital-bridge-what-internet-alliance-australian-esafety-extremists-on-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">such as the EU and U.S. on several areas of internet regulation</a>. For any alliance to succeed, therefore, it must move beyond the accepted cliché of &#8220;like-minded partners&#8221; and adopt a twin approach — prioritizing economic and security incentives alongside commitments on internet openness, such as a ban on internet shutdowns — to encourage a broader set of countries to join.</p>
<p>This strategy will be particularly important to convince those countries that are increasingly considering more restrictive internet policies. For example, since 2015, 31 of 54 African countries have blocked access to social media to some degree. Undoubtedly, some of these shutdowns have been due to overt repression and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/30/internet-shutdowns-are-a-political-weapon-its-time-to-disarm/">must be met with a strong international response</a>. Yet other interventions have been less ideological: When violent content online has left leaders worried about public safety, a combination of muddled policy, low state capacity and underinvestment in content moderation from major social media services has led to regrettable actions that might otherwise have been avoided with greater support.</p>
<p>It is not too late to arrest this trend and secure core internet freedoms. But such efforts will not succeed through coercion alone. While the fight against authoritarianism is crucial, allowing every debate to get wrapped up into polarized &#8220;democracies versus authoritarians&#8221; language can actually close off opportunities for cooperation, only accelerating greater restrictions and fragmentation. The effect of this corrosive discourse can already be seen in Africa, where the West <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/11/29/us-china-africa-focac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too often treats states as little more than sites for &#8220;proxy battles&#8221; in a larger U.S.-China &#8220;cold war.&#8221;</a> Neither of these conceptions are helpful.</p>
<p>China is not a monolith: It is a partner, competitor and adversary to the West all at once. The U.S., EU and others cannot force China out of the global internet infrastructure market, and nor should they want or need to. Africa, the U.S. and China would all be better served by a globally competitive market for internet infrastructure, with no one state either monopolizing provision or footing the entire bill.</p>
<p>Similarly, not only do African countries have their own political priorities and challenges, but it is often in the West’s own economic interests to offer support. Connecting all 3.7 billion people without internet access would, for example, cost just 0.02% of the gross national incomes for OECD states — a group of countries including the U.S., UK, Korea and Japan — while <a href="https://institute.global/policy/progressive-case-universal-internet-access-how-close-digital-divide-2030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generating a huge 25x return</a>.</p>
<p>Yet when the G7 launched its &#8220;Build Back Better World&#8221; project this year, designed to compete with China’s infrastructure offer, it came with no new money. Meanwhile there has been little effort to reform World Bank and IMF development programs, which the U.S. could influence, despite them being uncompetitively bureaucratic, risk averse and expensive for many African leaders facing fragile development pathways and urgent job-creation demands.</p>
<p>For years, we’ve lacked the necessary political leadership and ambition for a program of this kind. But the Alliance for the Future of the Internet has the potential to provide a reset. To succeed, it must show <a href="https://institute.global/policy/open-internet-brink-economic-and-social-costs-restrictions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is no pathway to prosperity that undermines core internet freedoms</a>, while also providing the right guidance and incentives to enable a different approach. While there will always be some countries who never sign up, these strong incentives could persuade many &#8220;swing states&#8221; — <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/how-should-democracies-confront-chinas-digital-rise-weighing-merits-t-10-alliance">such as Indonesia, Kenya or Brazil</a> — to join. Only by building wide, internationalist coalitions that are in everyone’s economic and security interests to sustain will the open, global internet truly be protected for the long term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German on-demand delivery giant Delivery Hero is pulling its food delivery service out of Germany <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/21/takeaway-delivery-hero-gobble-gobble/">again</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time it has <a href="https://www.deliveryhero.com/newsroom/delivery-hero-scales-down-foodpanda-germany-and-announces-the-planned-divestiture-of-foodpanda-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it will exit the Japanese market, by divesting Foodpanda Japan, starting in Q1 next year.</p>
<p>In a statement accompanying the pre-Christmas exit news, the company&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, Niklas Östberg, said: &#8220;Scaling down our operations in Germany and planning to divest our Japanese business have not been easy decisions. Facing a very different reality now than we did entering these markets, it is with a heavy heart that we need to pursue other growth opportunities with larger potential.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250590" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Despite having built up two fantastic foodpanda teams showing great progress, it has become increasingly difficult to create true value for our ecosystem in these countries. I have nothing but gratitude and admiration for the accomplishments both teams have achieved in the last months. Seeing the amazing service they built from scratch makes me genuinely proud, and we will do everything we can to support our fellow Heroes on their journey ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>The European on-demand delivery giant only fully returned to its home market &#8212; under its Foodpanda brand &#8212; in <a href="https://www.deliveryhero.com/newsroom/foodpanda-germany-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August</a>, following a few weeks of testing.</p>
<p>Back in May, when it trailed the Germany relaunch in an interview with the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6b52561c-63a9-4393-928b-c05a03ae6404" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Financial Times</a>, Ostberg had talked in terms of being in it for a decade-long haul, telling the newspaper: “We don’t see necessarily that we are going to go in and win the market in the next year or so. This is a 10-year game.”</p>
<p>And only last month Delivery Hero was still expanding Foodpanda&#8217;s footprint in Germany &#8212; <a href="https://www.gateo.de/foodpanda-delivery-hero-germany-gmbh-expandiert-in-deutschland-und-schafft-tausend-neue-arbeitspl-tze-foto-1941256.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcing</a> the service would be launching into another six cities, as the division&#8217;s CEO, Artur Schreiber, trumpeted &#8220;great&#8221; demand and an expansion he said would create &#8220;a thousand&#8221; jobs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Although that announcement also hinted that it might be having trouble getting customers to stick around &#8212; with Delivery Hero saying it would also be refreshing Foodpanda&#8217;s branding, launching a new app with a better user experience and expanding a loyalty program.</p>
<p>In the event it&#8217;s pulling the plug on a commercial delivery service in Germany &#8212; leaving only a Berlin-based R&amp;D hub where it says it will test new services and features, so sounds like it will continue to run some (trial) deliveries in Central Berlin for employees working on developing new products.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s notable it&#8217;s not selling the Foodpanda Germany unit to a rival &#8212; as it did <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/21/takeaway-delivery-hero-gobble-gobble/">back in 2018</a> when it last pulled the plug on the market.</p>
<p>Delivery Hero either wants to retain the possibility of a rapid return in future; or &#8212; perhaps more likely &#8212; the local food delivery is so competitively tapped out there was little to be gained by selling the unit (unlike a few years ago when it was able to bag a meaty payout of ~$1.1 billion when it sold its German ops to Dutch rival Takeaway.com; which, incidentally has<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/justeat-takeaway-7-6b-merger-approved-pair-pick-up-756m-in-new-funding/"> since merged with U.K. based Just Eat</a> and the combined entity is <a href="https://www.justeattakeaway.com/newsroom/en-WW/208302-just-eat-extends-grocery-delivery-in-uk-with-one-stop-partnership" target="_blank" rel="noopener">building out a grocery delivery biz</a> too).</p>
<p>How does Delivery Hero explain such a rapid rethink of its long-term strategy to win its home market?</p>
<p>&#8220;[S]ince launching the service, the landscape of the German market changed significantly. External factors, such as an increased number of players and a shortage of riders, provided a new reality towards the end of the year,&#8221; is the spin its PR puts on the reversal.</p>
<p>Its press release also seeks to strike an upbeat tone in a bid to reassure investors &#8212; saying it has identified &#8220;plenty of other growth opportunities&#8230; with a better expected return on investment, like other markets and new verticals, primarily in the area of quick commerce&#8221;.</p>
<p>Quick commerce typically refers to grocery-type deliveries via a new wave of on-demand platforms that offer consumers a selection of convenience products (bread, toothpaste, batteries etc.) &#8212; often served out of microfulfilment centers (aka dark stores) located in urban centers to ensure hyper speedy delivery times.</p>
<p>Europe has seen investor dollars pouring into the category since the pandemic struck, with a number of startups springing up across the region. And Östberg noted that it was seeing “a larger willingness” among its customers to have more than meals delivered when TechCrunch discussed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/delivery-hero-ceo-shares-what-hes-learned-about-managing-logistics-during-a-pandemic/">the potential of grocery deliveries</a> with the Delivery Hero CEO early on in the pandemic.</p>
<p>Germany, the EU&#8217;s biggest economy, has grabbed a major slice of this investor-heated q-commerce action &#8212; with homegrown startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/gorillas/">Gorillas</a> raising close to a billion dollars in Series C funding this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/gorillas-grabs-close-to-1bn-series-c-values-the-on-demand-grocery-delivery-biz-at-2-1bn/">October</a>, for example; while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/flink/">Flink</a>, another rapidly scaling rapid grocery delivery startup, nabbed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/flink-the-german-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-240m-after-launching-just-6-months-ago/">$240M in the summer</a>, a mere six months after launching.</p>
<p>Gorilla&#8217;s whopping Series C was &#8212; in fact &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/gorillas-grabs-close-to-1bn-series-c-values-the-on-demand-grocery-delivery-biz-at-2-1bn/">led by Delivery Hero</a> so the writing was perhaps already on the wall for its local Foodpanda division at that point.</p>
<p>And in another Q-commerce related announcement earlier this month, Delivery Hero <a href="https://www.deliveryhero.com/newsroom/delivery-hero-logistics-as-a-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trumpeted</a> an expansion of what it billed as a &#8220;logistics-a-service&#8221; play &#8212; suggesting it sees its future in serving delivery services to a growing sea of smaller (and more specialized) on-demand players.</p>
<p>&#8220;Partnering with e-commerce marketplaces and platforms, restaurants, as well as pharmaceutical and grocery companies, the company is changing the way that people buy and send goods,&#8221; was how it fleshed out the move, noting also that it has also recently opened its 1,000th &#8220;Dmart&#8221; (aka &#8220;small warehouses in strategic locations for delivery&#8221;).</p>
<p>Again, Germany is seeing on-demand action bubbling up on a variety of fronts &#8212; as homegrown startups seek to ride the Q-commerce boom via a strategy of divide and conquer.</p>
<p>This means launching app-based delivery services that target (more) specific niches and segments &#8212; such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/yababa-seed-funding/">Yababa</a> (multicultural groceries); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/iphone-inside-30-mins-germanys-arive-brings-consumer-brands-to-your-door-raises-e6m/">Arive</a> (high-end consumer goods); and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/berlins-mayd-bags-15m-seed-to-deliver-meds-fast/">Mayd</a> (meds, but starting with non-prescription products sold in pharmacies) &#8212; to name three German startups which all raised recently.</p>
<p>The mood music suggests there are indeed opportunities for growth in quick commerce beyond the tricky business of biking hot meals to hungry bellies &#8212; and that the evolution of the on-demand delivery category is well underway.</p>
<p>This is about diversifying beyond takeaways and instant food gratification &#8212; to serving all sorts of convenience and specialist requirements and the platforms that will be needed to deliver that big picture vision of anything arriving quickly via app order.</p>
<p>In Europe there is also the issue of labor rights for gig platform workers to consider too, which looks set to further steer market developments &#8212; and could accelerate the reconfiguration of a business model that some accuse of being inherently exploitative.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/eu-gig-economy-proposal/">Earlier this month</a> EU lawmakers presented their legislative proposal on platform work which &#8212; if adopted &#8212; could see millions of gig workers reclassified as employees.</p>
<p>Östberg does not appear to be a fulsome fan of the proposal. Nor, indeed, of current German labor laws &#8212; which he has suggested make it difficult for platforms to hire riders.</p>
<p>In a series of tweets earlier this month, as the EU unveiled the draft legislation, the Delivery Hero CEO chipped in to offer the usual platform rebuttal &#8212; which seeks to frame the issue as a choice between employment <em>or</em> flexibility &#8212; making a call for &#8220;better terms for riders and more flexibility&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let’s move forward with better terms for riders and more flexibility. Not backwards to where we came from. (4/4)</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>However the academic research project <a href="https://fair.work/en/fw/homepage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairwork</a>, which tracks conditions for workers in the gig economy, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/eu-gig-economy-proposal/">argues it&#8217;s false framing</a> to suggest it&#8217;s not possible for platforms to provide flexibility and fairness right now &#8212; although it has found only a minority do so currently.</p>
<p>Hence Fairwork accuses platforms of opting for &#8220;a ‘race to the bottom’ in labour standards&#8221; &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/uber-could-give-gig-workers-a-better-deal-but-its-lobbying-eu-to-lower-standards-says-fairwork/">instead of getting on and improving conditions</a> for workers.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s reform proposal could help enforce fairer working conditions across the gig economy by removing the risk of reclassification for platforms that provide workers with more rights and protections &#8212; and by creating a level playing field of basic standards that all platforms in the region must abide by.</p>
<p>Although the reform still needs the backing of the European Parliament and Member States governments to be adopted as EU law. But that prospect may be concentrating gig platform CEOs&#8217; minds &#8212; on how to evolve their models to account for fuller regional employment and higher costs.</p>
<p>Delivery Hero denied its exit from Germany has anything to do with the EU&#8217;s planned labor reform when TechCrunch asked &#8212; saying the decision purely relates to recent changes in the market, such as increased competition which it said has led to a knock-on shortage of riders, limiting its ability to scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite having built up a fantastic foodpanda team showing great progress in all cities, it has become increasingly difficult to create true value for our ecosystem in Germany,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it comes to the EU proposal, Delivery Hero fully supports the European Commission’s aim to improve the labor conditions of platform workers,&#8221; a Delivery Hero spokeswoman also told us. &#8220;The Commission’s proposal includes positive and much-needed elements. Even though we believe that the suggested criteria to trigger the proposed rebuttable presumption of employment and reversed burden of proof are too broad and would not contribute to that goal, this has not influenced our decision to scale down our German business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked for more detail on where it intends to focus its efforts as it shutters service in its home market, the company offered little, saying only: &#8220;We will focus our efforts on a variety of attractive growth opportunities across the group and specifically invest into scaling new verticals, and more prominently quick commerce globally.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also declined to confirm whether or not it&#8217;s eyeing quick-commerce opportunities beyond food-related deliveries, saying only: &#8220;We are always looking for new opportunities to drive the industry forward and make a positive impact on the ecosystem we operate in. We<span style="color: #000000;"> cannot comment more precisely on this at this stage.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Asked whether it will be offering any support to Foodpanda workers who did not have employment contracts and are &#8212; just a couple of days before Christmas &#8212; facing the prospect of no more work coming to them via its app, Delivery Hero&#8217;s spokeswoman said: <span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;All affected employees, riders, pickers, customers, and partners have been informed about the upcoming change. The company will do its best to support them in their journey ahead. Around 70% of employees from foodpanda Germany, including riders and pickers, will be offered new opportunities. Delivery Hero confirms that its riders will keep being employed by Delivery Hero Germany Logistics GmbH (“pandalogistics”). As of December 23, 2021, the pandalogistics entity will deliver orders on behalf of other industry players in Germany as a transitory measure.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>(And it&#8217;s another interesting sign that Delivery Hero is &#8212; at least temporarily &#8212; going to be experimenting with fulfilling delivery orders for rivals still operating in Germany&#8230; )</p>
<p>Delivery Hero&#8217;s PR also commits to the company doing &#8220;its best to transition employees from foodpanda Germany to positions within the Delivery Hero Group, or with partners from the company’s industry network,&#8221; adding: &#8220;Employees who do not stay within the Delivery Hero Group will receive a severance package.&#8221;</p>
<p>What about Japan? Another market Delivery Hero only entered recently &#8212; also via its Foodpanda brand &#8212; but in that case it launched last year (September 2020).</p>
<p>The company blamed &#8220;a very similar situation&#8221; to the competitive challenges limiting its ability to grow in Germany for its decision to divest the unit early next year.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to focus on other growth priorities within the group, Delivery Hero plans to divest its Japanese entity,&#8221; it said. &#8220;The divestiture process will be kicked off in Q1 2022. During this upcoming transition period, it is Delivery Hero’s utmost priority to support all Heroes and express gratitude for the dedication they have shown in the last 1.5 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Japan, Delivery Hero has faced some meaty competition &#8212; from the likes of South Korean e-commerce giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/after-entering-japan-coupang-continues-its-international-expansion-with-taiwan/">Coupang</a>; the (recently) <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-deals/Japanese-food-delivery-app-to-raise-726m-to-battle-Uber" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoftBank-backed</a> local veteran Demae-Can; the U.S. giant Uber Eats; and the now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/doordash-to-acquire-food-delivery-company-wolt/">DoorDash-owned Wolt</a>, to name a few.</p>
<p>In another recent move in Asia, Delivery Hero also <a href="https://www.deliveryhero.com/newsroom/delivery-hero-completes-sale-of-dh-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">completed the sale of its Korean business</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not all scaling back for Delivery Hero, though. Also recently: It picked up a <a href="https://www.deliveryhero.com/newsroom/delivery-hero-acquires-hungry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Danish food delivery biz called Hungry</a>; <a href="https://www.deliveryhero.com/newsroom/delivery-hero-launches-operations-in-slovakia/">expanded in Slovakia</a>; and <a href="https://www.deliveryhero.com/newsroom/delivery-hero-acquires-hugo-food-and-grocery-delivery-verticals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grabbed customers in Central American and the Caribbean via acquisition</a>.</p>
<p>Last year it also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/delivery-hero-picks-up-glovos-latam-ops-for-272m-in-latest-food-delivery-consolidation/">splurged $272 million to pick up Spanish rival Glovo&#8217;s LatAm business</a> &#8212; so Delivery Hero&#8217;s consolidation vs growth story continues to be a market-reflective pick &#8216;n&#8217; mix.</p>

<p>&#8220;Americans love to Zillow surf — most of them alongside someone else — and now they have a new way to do it,&#8221; according to Zillow. &#8220;Using the Zillow app on an iPhone or iPad, home shoppers are now able to search and browse for-sale home and rental listings in a seamless, synchronous experience together with family, friends or a real estate agent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zillow said that 86 percent of users browse homes with a partner, spouse or housemate, so the new feature makes sense if you can&#8217;t be together in person. It&#8217;s also a &#8220;great new way for real estate agents to connect with customers,&#8221; said Zillow CTO David Beitel.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250614" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To use the feature, each participant will need Zillow running on an iPhone or iPad with iOS/iPadOS 15.1 or later. Users can search for different locations on Zillow and browse through available listings with content synced up.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is seeking an Indian antitrust watchdog&#8217;s approval to buy Catamaran Ventures’ stake in Prione, which operates one of the largest sellers on the e-commerce platform, months after the two firms said they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/amazons-top-indian-seller-cloudtail-to-cease-operations-after-may-2022/">won’t renew their joint venture</a> after May next year.</p>
<p>The announcement comes as a surprise as Catamaran owns a 76% stake in Prione. Amazon earlier held a 49% stake in the company, but diluted it down to 24% to comply with the local laws that prohibit e-commerce firms from having a direct or indirect ownership in businesses that sell on their marketplaces.</p>
<p>In a joint statement Wednesday, the two firms said they are complying with the applicable laws “including all assets and liabilities” to close the deal and have sought the regulatory approval. Amazon has reached out to the Indian watchdog Competition Commission of India for the approval, a person familiar with the matter said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250597" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Billionaire N.R. Narayana Murthy’s Catamaran and Amazon launched the joint venture in the country in 2014. The joint venture restructured its ownership in 2019 following India’s regulatory changes. In August this year, the two said they were ending the relationship.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Who owns Cloudtail? Was it used to sidestep Indian laws.<br />media rarely investigated.<br />What makes us think that the same people are not at it even now?</p>
<p>&mdash; IQ wala Anand Lunia (@anandlunia) <a href="https://twitter.com/anandlunia/status/1424740069793959938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 9, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>That announcement came after news agency Reuters reported, citing Amazon documents, that the American e-commerce firm had given <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-operation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preferential treatment for years to a small group of sellers</a>, including Cloudtail, and had used them to bypass Indian laws. The Competition Commission of India, separately, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/india-orders-investigation-into-alleged-anti-competitive-practices-by-amazon-and-walmarts-flipkart/">ordered an investigation</a> into Amazon and Flipkart last year for allegedly promoting select sellers (those in which they own a stake) on their e-commerce platforms and using business practices that stifle competition. The two firms made an unsuccessful attempt to dismiss the investigation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The businesses of the joint venture shall continue under the leadership of the current management and on receipt of regulatory approvals, the board of Prione and Cloudtail will take steps to complete the transaction in compliance with applicable laws,” the joint statement from Amazon and Catamaran said today.</p>
<p>Cloudtail is one of the largest sellers on Amazon in India. It has enabled more than 300,000 sellers and entrepreneurs to go online and has provided 4 million merchants with digital payment capabilities, the two firms said earlier this year.</p>
<p>Long-standing laws in India have restricted Amazon and other e-commerce firms from holding inventory or selling items directly to consumers. To bypass this, firms have operated through a maze of joint ventures with local companies that operate as inventory-holding firms.</p>
<p>India got around to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/27/amazon-walmart-india-e-commerce-restrictions/">fixing this loophole</a> in late 2018 in a move that was widely seen as the biggest blowback to the American firm in the country at the time. Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart scrambled to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/01/amazon-flipkart-india-law/">delist hundreds of thousands of items</a> from their stores and made their investments in affiliated firms way more indirect.</p>
<p>In June this year, India <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/india-proposes-tougher-e-commerce-rules-following-widespread-cheating-and-unfair-trade-by-amazon-and-flipkart/">proposed even tougher e-commerce rules</a> that, among other things, prohibit Amazon, Flipkart and other e-commerce players from running their in-house / private labels. The new proposal asks e-commerce firms to ensure that none of their related and associated parties are listed on their platforms as sellers for selling to customers directly. (New Delhi has yet to follow up on the new rules.)</p>
<p>Amazon has stakes in a few more third-party sellers, including Appario Retail, which is its joint venture with Patni Group.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European startup and venture capital data company <a href="https://dealroom.co/">Dealroom</a> has raised a €6 million Series A, it told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s new capital comes nearly two years after it <a href="https://tech.eu/brief/dealroom-raises-2-75-million-to-continue-scaling-across-europe/">raised €2.75 million in early 2020</a>. Its database competes with a number of rivals in North America, including <a href="https://pitchbook.com/">PitchBook</a>, <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/">CB Insights</a>, and my former employer <a href="http://crunchbase.com">Crunchbase</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.beringea.com/">Beringea</a> led the Series A, which also saw participation from <a href="https://www.knight.capital/">Knight Venture Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/shoe-investments/about/">Shoe Investments</a>, firms that previously invested in the company. To better understand the round, TechCrunch put a number of questions to Dealroom founder and CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/yoramdw">Yoram Wijngaarde</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250283" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Dealroom&#8217;s business</h2>
<p>The startup collects data on private-market companies through public scraping and partnerships. Then, the resulting data is cleaned and run through the company&#8217;s software to &#8220;uncover actionable predictions,&#8221; as <a href="https://dealroom.co/about">Dealroom puts it</a>.</p>
<p>So Dealroom is three linked parts: data collection, cleaning and synthesis.</p>
<p>You can see why it might want more capital to handle the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">sheer influx of funding events that are swamping the globe</a>. Indeed, companies like Dealroom should be enjoying something akin to boom times themselves. Their core market remit, the private corporate landscape, is expanding quickly, and many participants in the startup game are flush. So, Dealroom has lots of work to do &#8212; and lots of folks to sell it to.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s business makes money in a few ways, including providing an API for both business and government customers and selling access to its platform on a SaaS basis. The company also does customer research. Per Wijngaarde, it has 50 government API customers that make up &#8220;about a third of [Dealroom] revenues.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More generally, the company&#8217;s &#8220;revenue mix is roughly equally three parts between investors, B2B companies and governments,&#8221; according to the CEO. So, there isn&#8217;t a single leg on Dealroom&#8217;s revenue stool; three different groups are buying what it has on offer.</p>
<p>Returning to our point about it feeling like a strong moment for Dealroom and its global rivals &#8212; <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccaszkutak/2021/12/07/known-for-its-startup-data-crunchbases-software-business-is-quietly-making-millions/?ss=venture-capital&amp;sh=253824983941">Crunchbase says that it will reach roughly $38 million ARR this year</a> &#8212; the fact that governments are such a large portion of Dealroom&#8217;s revenue feels notable, and bullish. Governments are paying attention to the startup game as it spreads more evenly around the world, and are willing to spend to better understand their local market and, we presume, those around them.</p>
<p>On the capital front, TechCrunch asked Wijngaarde why his company raised just €6 million. In today&#8217;s market, that&#8217;s a modest round!</p>
<p>The CEO said Dealroom &#8220;sized&#8221; its new round around both &#8220;business needs&#8221; and the fact that it &#8220;didn’t want to get too far ahead of [itself] based on the availability of capital.&#8221; The founder added that Dealroom is also &#8220;fortunate to have strong growing revenue, coupled with healthy capital efficiency,&#8221; two things that would lower a near-term need for more capital, and therefore dilution.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s next?</h2>
<p>Dealroom, Crunchbase and others in the data game are pretty good about data &#8212; having data, collecting data, you get the picture. What Dealroom wants to do with its data in the future is tinker with it more intelligently. When asked what&#8217;s ahead for his company, Wijngaarde said that it is &#8220;focused on expanding the predictive power of the platform, to help our clients discover promising companies at an ever earlier stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>If it can manage that, the company can add a zero to its pricing page, at least for investors. Mattermark, another company that I worked for, wanted to build something similar. It&#8217;s a big, hard problem, and one that will require oceans of accurate, to-the-minute data.</p>
<p>Before we go on too long, TechCrunch wanted to better understand a particular mechanic in the data collection business. So, we asked Dealroom if it counts data collection and curation as a cost of revenue or a marketing operating cost. Here&#8217;s what Wijngaarde wrote back:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We count data collection in part as cost of revenues and in part as product development in [operating expenses]. We also do a lot of human-led research, which is counted as cost of revenue, but also could be seen as cost of marketing, as this results in a lot of content marketing.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The answer is both, it turns out. I want to better understand that mix, and I am sure that we&#8217;ll get a better understanding when one of the companies in the private market data business files to go public.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">So your friend/sibling/neighbor just had a baby, or is having a baby soon. Huzzah!</p>
<p>Now you&#8217;re trying to figure out what to get them for the holidays … and, well, it can get a bit overwhelming. There&#8217;s <em>so</em> much stuff for babies and new parents, all marketed in a way that makes it all seem <em>absolutely crucial</em>. It is, of course, mostly not.</p>
<p>For this gift guide, I tried to focus on stuff that is truly useful, doesn&#8217;t exist solely to freak new parents out and is tough enough to last multiple years/kids.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250515" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Step one? Ask the parents what they need — everyone&#8217;s situation is different, and they&#8217;ll absolutely know best. If they&#8217;re running short on ideas, though, here are some things they&#8217;ll probably really appreciate.</p>

<h2>AirTags</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2142252" style="width: 4042px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2142252" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2142252 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0849.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0849.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0849.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0849.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0849.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0849.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0849.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0849.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0849.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2142252" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Matthew Panzarino</p></div></p>
<p>When you&#8217;ve suddenly got this precious thing in your life requiring 99.9% of your brain bandwidth, it can be hard to remember where <em>anything else</em> is. Particularly on the go, when — especially for those first few months — you&#8217;re probably toting around about 3x the amount of stuff as you were pre-kid. Your wallet … did you drop it, or just leave it at home? Did the diaper bag fall out of the bottom of the stroller, or is it back in the car? Wait, where did I even park the car?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple&#8217;s AirTags are only a few months old and didn&#8217;t exist when we first had our kid, but oh how I wish they did. These little puck-shaped discs can be tucked anywhere, allowing you to track an item&#8217;s (read: bags/strollers/etc., not the baby&#8217;s) location anywhere there&#8217;s an iPhone nearby — <em>any</em> iPhone, not just yours. The battery lasts a surprisingly long time and is easily user replaceable, and you can make an AirTag beep if you need help triangulating exactly where something is in the house.</p>
<p>One catch: These things are only for iOS users.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-airtag/airtag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 for $30, or 4 for $100</a></p>
<h2>Snoo</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_1761116" style="width: 1530px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1761116" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1761116 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/snoo.png" alt="" width="1520" height="1052" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/snoo.png 1520w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/snoo.png?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/snoo.png?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/snoo.png?resize=768,532 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/snoo.png?resize=680,471 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/snoo.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1520px) 100vw, 1520px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1761116" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snoo</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a $1,600 robo bassinet that detects when baby is crying and tries to automatically rock/shush them back to sleep.</p>
<p>Does that sound a little ridiculous? I agree! But it also <em>rules</em>, and I&#8217;m convinced it&#8217;s a big part of why my kid, now 3, is still a really, <em>really</em> good sleeper. It also helps you track your baby&#8217;s wake/sleep patterns, and uses special &#8220;Snoo Sacks&#8221; to ensure baby stays on their back while they sleep (as is <a href="https://safetosleep.nichd.nih.gov/research/science/backsleeping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommended by the NIH.</a>)</p>
<p>The Snoo will only work until a baby is about six months old — but it&#8217;s very, very easy to pass on to another kid. We split the purchase with friends because their kid would outgrow it right as ours needed it; it&#8217;s since been handed down <em>four more times</em>, with minimal maintenance required beyond a deep cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong><a href="https://www.happiestbaby.com/products/snoo-smart-bassinet" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $1,600 from HappiestBaby</a>. There&#8217;s also a <a href="https://www.happiestbaby.com/products/snoo-rental" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rental option</a> that works out to around $700 for that six months of use.</p>
<h2>Keekaroo Peanut</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_1761111" style="width: 1866px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1761111" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1761111 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/keekaroo.png" alt="" width="1856" height="844" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/keekaroo.png 1856w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/keekaroo.png?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/keekaroo.png?resize=300,136 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/keekaroo.png?resize=768,349 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/keekaroo.png?resize=680,309 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/keekaroo.png?resize=1536,698 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/keekaroo.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1856px) 100vw, 1856px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1761111" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Keekaroo</p></div></p>
<p>I fully did not understand why we&#8217;d spend $130 on a changing pad. A zillion diaper changes later&#8230; I get it. The Peanut is designed to keep baby from rolling off the table during a diaper change (though, of course, you still need to stay close), is <em>way</em> more comfy for baby than a hard wooden table and is, crucially, super stain resistant. When my kid finally did manage to stain it permanently (beets, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw2WsXIgO6A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it&#8217;s always beets</a>) the company had a replacement shipped out immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.buybuybaby.com/store/product/keekaroo-reg-peanut-changer/3272011?skuId=46261380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$130 from buybuyBaby</a></p>
<h2>Skip Hop Pronto</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2250516" style="width: 589px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2250516" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2250516 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pronto.jpg" alt="" width="579" height="396" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pronto.jpg 579w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pronto.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pronto.jpg?resize=300,205 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pronto.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 579px) 100vw, 579px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2250516" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Skip Hop</p></div></p>
<p>The downside of the Peanut? It&#8217;s not portable. Babies poop a lot, and they don&#8217;t care if there&#8217;s a convenient changing table nearby.</p>
<p>Skip Hop&#8217;s Pronto portable changing station folds up into a tiny little package, is super easy to keep clean, and has a storage pouch big enough for a backup diaper or two and a slim box of wipes. This thing saved the day more times than I can count, and it&#8217;s the first thing I check for when someone sends us their baby registry.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JT1Q3CV/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B09JT1Q3CV&amp;linkId=22c2f081ee25cbdf473568bea8374a2c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$28 from Amazon</a></p>
<h2>A really, really good phone case</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2250517" style="width: 791px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2250517" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2250517 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Otterbox.jpg" alt="" width="781" height="287" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Otterbox.jpg 781w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Otterbox.jpg?resize=150,55 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Otterbox.jpg?resize=300,110 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Otterbox.jpg?resize=768,282 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Otterbox.jpg?resize=680,250 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Otterbox.jpg?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 781px) 100vw, 781px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2250517" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Otterbox</p></div></p>
<p>Phones light up and make fun noises. Babies like things that light up and make fun noises. Babies also like to throw things.</p>
<p>Add those things together and you&#8217;ve got the recipe for a broken phone screen. If your new parent friend is the type that likes to forego the case in favor of a slim device, maaaaaybe try to convince them to pop a case on for at least a year or two. Otterbox&#8217;s commuter case saved our phones probably a dozen times, and is relatively slim for the amount of protection it provides.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong><a href="https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/commuter-series" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$40 from Otterbox</a></p>
<h2>Ubbi Diaper Pail</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2250519" style="width: 461px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2250519" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2250519 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ubbi.jpg" alt="" width="451" height="857" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ubbi.jpg 451w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ubbi.jpg?resize=79,150 79w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ubbi.jpg?resize=158,300 158w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ubbi.jpg?resize=358,680 358w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ubbi.jpg?resize=26,50 26w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2250519" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ubbi</p></div></p>
<p>Ubbi&#8217;s steel diaper pail does a damned good job of keeping the stink locked in, while a simple safety system keeps curious little ones out. It uses standard trashbags, instead of expensive bespoke &#8220;cartridges&#8221; or whatever. While our kid is potty trained now, this thing still hangs around his room as a way over-qualified trash can. It&#8217;s also had about a thousand toy trucks hurled at it from across the room and somehow still looks brand new.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00821FLT4/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00821FLT4&amp;linkId=0c3a26597300cf49ab61553cb7184673" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$70 from Amazon</a></p>
<h2>Hue bulbs</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2077777" style="width: 888px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077777" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2077777 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hue.jpg" alt="" width="878" height="439" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hue.jpg 878w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hue.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hue.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hue.jpg?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hue.jpg?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hue.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 878px) 100vw, 878px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077777" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Philips</p></div></p>
<p>As I noted in our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/gift-guide-10-really-good-gadgets-that-cost-less-than-100/">under-$100 gift guide</a>, smart light bulbs are slowly taking over my house. Nothing did a better job of convincing me to go all in on smart bulbs than having a kid.</p>
<p>Waking up every two hours and the light switch is across the room? Smart bulbs! Want red lighting instead of blue/white for those 2 a.m. wake-ups, so as to maybe not screw up everyone&#8217;s circadian rhythms? Smart bulbs! Working on teaching a toddler to stay in bed and want a &#8220;stoplight&#8221; that goes from red to green when it&#8217;s okay to get up? Smart bulbs!</p>
<p>There are lots of great smart bulb options out there, but I&#8217;m a big fan of the Philips Hue line. It&#8217;s not the cheapest option, but the interface is great, it works with your various Alexa/Google/Homekit ecosystems and I&#8217;ve had literally zero issues with them after years of use.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QWB3H1Q/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07QWB3H1Q&amp;linkId=feaab8aa9b0dce6d2cd4fc71c52cbc05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$30-$50 each on Amazon</a>, depending on quantity</p>
<h2>Smart Speakers</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1814552 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/google-home-mini-2.jpg" alt="" width="1390" height="1042" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/google-home-mini-2.jpg 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/google-home-mini-2.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/google-home-mini-2.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/google-home-mini-2.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/google-home-mini-2.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/google-home-mini-2.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1390px) 100vw, 1390px" /></p>
<p>Pairing well with the smart bulbs, but also good for plenty of their own reasons, are smart speakers.</p>
<p>When my son was tiny and spent more time in my arms than not, I&#8217;d use my voice to start up songs without having to fiddle with my phone. We use it to control those aforementioned smart bulbs, and for white noise (&#8220;Hey Google, play rain sounds&#8221;) when he&#8217;s having a tough time sleeping. He recently figured out how to ask Google to make fart sounds, which consistently makes him laugh so hard he falls over.</p>
<p>Amazon/Google/Apple all have their own contenders that each have their pros/cons, so the best one is really whichever one is built for the ecosystem your friend uses most — Echo for Amazon, Nest Mini or Nest Hub for Google or Homepod for Apple.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>Varies, but generally $25-$100. Nest Mini, pictured above, is <a href="https://store.google.com/us/magazine/compare_nest_speakers_displays?hl=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$25 from Google</a></p>
<h2>Collapsible Radio Flyer Wagon</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2250520" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2250520" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2250520 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Radio-Flyer.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="514" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Radio-Flyer.jpg 550w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Radio-Flyer.jpg?resize=150,140 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Radio-Flyer.jpg?resize=300,280 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Radio-Flyer.jpg?resize=50,47 50w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2250520" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Radio Flyer</p></div></p>
<p>Someone bought us one of these for his first birthday, and I honestly can&#8217;t believe how much use it&#8217;s gotten. When he was still in a stroller, we&#8217;d use it to lug everything out onto the beach. Now that he&#8217;s far too big for a stroller, he&#8217;ll gladly hop in this for long rides around the neighborhood or trips to the zoo.</p>
<p>It folds up enough to fit in the trunk, and two zipper pulls convert it into a bench for snack time anywhere. Radio Flyer&#8217;s warranty is also pretty great; when I busted one of the wheels at no one&#8217;s fault but my own, they had a new one out to me within days.</p>

<p>Most restaurants have one or two high chairs. Sometimes more than one or two babies show up. Or they only have one highchair and it has no buckles and wobbles when you look at it funny.</p>
<p>We bought one of these in a pinch while visiting friends, and it traveled with us for ages thereafter. Unfold it, clamp it in place, twist the locks, and bam — anywhere you&#8217;ve got an appropriately sturdy table (be sure to read the instructions, there), you&#8217;ve got a highchair. Done? Unclamp, fold it up, toss it in the trunk. Got a messy eater? The cover slips off easily and washes up well. My kid has outgrown it now, but it still gets regular use when our friends bring their littlest ones over.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/bitcoin-is-religion-web3-is-greed/"><strong>Bitcoin is religion; web3 is greed:</strong></a><strong> </strong>After Jack Dorsey kicked up a firestorm by inveighing against web3 and the current wave of crypto projects, TechCrunch dug into the debate because how could we not. Whether you are a bitcoin maximalist or a big NFT stan, we have something that will annoy you!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/eu-clears-microsoft-nuance/"><strong>EU clears the Microsoft-Nuance deal:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The $19.7 billion deal in which the Redmond tech giant will buy the medical transcription company has a green light from the European market. See, not <em>all</em> major tech deals are getting cut down to the nubbin with regulatory concerns and then canceled!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/via-files-confidentially-to-go-public/"><strong>Via shuttles toward the public markets:</strong></a> Public transit software and shuttle company Via is going public in early 2022. The company announced today that it has filed privately for its IPO. We’ll know a lot more when we actually get the S-1 document, but the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/a-few-questions-about-the-impending-reddit-ipo/">joins Reddit</a> on our list of public debuts that we anticipate in Q1 of next year.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>But wait, there’s <em>even more</em> public market news! Yes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/snapdeal-ipo/">Snapdeal filed to go public</a>, and our own <a href="https://twitter.com/refsrc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manish Singh</a> (follow him; he’s amazing!) has the details. SoftBank is a backer of the New Delhi-based startup. Per its prospectus, the company anticipates raising around $165 million in its public-market debut. Recall that Snapdeal “once competed with Amazon and Flipkart in India [but] has lost considerable market share in recent years,” we wrote.</p>
<p>And speaking of companies going public, remember the Better.com fiasco in which the company’s CEO went viral for firing a bunch of staff on Zoom? And then a bunch of whacko stuff from the company came out? Well, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/how-does-former-better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-still-have-a-job/">we’re curious why Vishal Garg still has a job</a>, so we did a little digging.

<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/venture-firm-chapter-one-focused-on-all-things-web3-draws-backing-from-big-name-vc-firms/">Chapter One raises capital to invest in web3:</a> </strong>Don’t tell Jack, but there’s even more money on tap for web3 projects. The $40 million fund will be joined by a $20 million “opportunity” fund, provided that that latter vehicle closes on target. Notably, Chapter One’s Jeff Morris Jr. is a solo investor.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year’s Essential implosion marked one of the most high-profile consumer electronics startup failures in recent memory. Launched in 2017 with $330 million, a killer pedigree and some truly grand ambitions, the company sputtered through a combination of industry issues, disappointment and troubling allegations against founder Andy Rubin.</p>
<p>The brand was eventually purchased by Carl Pei for his new company. But the executive eventually bucked the name in favor of &#8220;Nothing.&#8221; “[B]efore we were called Nothing, ‘Essential’ was one of the names we were brainstorming, internally,” he told me earlier this year “So that’s why we’ve acquired the trademark. We don’t have any plans to do anything with Essential.”</p>
<p>Something far closer to a spiritual successor arrives in the form of OSOM. The company, founded by ex-Essential employees, has had a smattering of press coverage over the past several months, but has largely kept quiet. Today, however, the Cupertino, California-based firm <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/osom-ov1-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed what many long suspected:</a> OSOM (pronounced “awesome”) is working on a phone.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250521" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Its planned OV1 device is, at least aesthetically, very clearly the work of the same team that gave the world the Essential PH1. But rather than features like modularity, the product is designed with one core thing in mind: Privacy. Specifically, it’s designed to give users greater control over data privacy.</p>
<p>Beyond that, details are scarce, ahead of its planned MWC 2022 launch. We sat down with co-founder and CEO Jason Keats for more information on OSOM and its upcoming handset.</p>
<p><strong>TC: We’re about two months out from the announcement?</strong></p>
<p>JK: Yeah, we’re a couple of months out from sharing the fine details. We’re planning the give the full announcement at MWC, and then shipping summer 2022. Right now we’re ready to announce that we are building a phone. People are really excited. We wanted to give our fans something this year, and we’re coming in under the wire.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>What constitutes a fan at this point, given that the company has been under lock and key?</strong></p>
<p>It’s been really surprising. Essential fans were very, very supportive early on, and they’ve continued to be supportive and excited about what we’re building for the future. I think we’re going to pick up quite a few traditional Android fans. Right now there aren’t a lot of flagship phones outside of Pixel that are vanilla Android. We’re going to continue that, and we’ve already built and are continuing to refine some privacy-centric software.</p>
<p><strong>How many of the existing team have come over from Essential?</strong></p>
<p>When we built PH1 at Essential, we were maybe 30 people total. We have maybe 15 people from that team. It’s really the core group of people; design, engineer, product design and software engineering.</p>
<p><strong>How large is the team in total?</strong></p>
<p>Around 30 people […] We’re more than two-thirds engineering.</p>
<p><strong>How did you begin the process of building up one company from, effectively, the ashes of another?</strong></p>
<p>For all of the shortcomings and incidences that happened at Essential, one thing that I will praise [Rubin] forever for is his ability to recruit. He brought on some incredible talent. When he told me that the company was going under, I said, what I am going to do next? I don’t want to work for Google or Apple or go to Amazon, but there’s this incredible team there that has built stuff and worked together so closely. It’s been through the trenches together[…]</p>
<p>We realized that probably the biggest issue [with Essential] was a lack of focus. We realized we needed to have a purpose. What are we trying to solve for? It became obvious to us that privacy really wasn’t being addressed coherently, particularly in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Does the world need another phone company?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, absolutely I think they do. One that’s actually focused on protecting privacy. And there’s a big reason for that. If we were just a software company building privacy software, we could trhow it on the Play Store, people could install it, whatever. But if it’s just an app sitting on someone’s phone, it’s easily bypassed, it’s easily turned off, because it’s not built into the system. It’s not integrated into the device. That’s what we’re doing. Because we’re an OEM, because we have access to Qualcomm’s TrustZone, because we have access to the system software, we can build some real privacy-centric software that the user can use or not use, if they chose. But it’s all about giving them a choice.</p>
<p><strong>How difficult will it be to get someone to jump over to this phone with privacy as a main selling point?</strong></p>
<p>In the U.S., I’m not trying to go after Apple users. We’re going after Android users. And in that scenario, there isn’t a tremendous amount of brand loyalty within the Android space. People are willing to take a lot more shots. For privacy, we’ve already lined up quite a few partners that have shared some high-level demgraphic data about who is using their software or hardware for privacy. The numbers are astonishing to us. They really indicate that there is a demand for privacy and that people are currently spending their money today on privacy.</p>
<p><strong>What’s a realistic expectation in terms of units? You’re casting a wide net [to the U.S., Canada and throughout Europe]. It seems ultimately the Essential numbers weren’t what people were hoping for.</strong></p>
<p>It’s funny. When we started Essential, the goal was 100,000 units in the first year. We sold just shy of 300,000 units to end users the first year. The biggest issue is because [Rubin] raised so much money, the expectation was to ship two million units. When you go into expecting 100,000 units and sell 300,000 units, that’s a huge success. It all depends on what metric you’re using. For [OSOM], I would be absolutely thrilled with 200,000 units in the first year. We would be here for a very, very long time.</p>
<p><strong>Were the external expectations so intense as to cause things to fall apart [at Essential]?</strong></p>
<p>I can fill up a book on what went wrong. And there were a bunch of little things.</p>
<p><strong>Give me the CliffsNotes.</strong></p>
<p>Some decisions made at the very top were counterintuitive to us being successful.</p>
<p><strong>On the note of capital, it was reported that the company raised $5.6 million. What has the fundraising been so far.</strong></p>
<p>So, we secured $20 million. Some of it investor, and a chunk of it was pre-order from a channel partner. We’ve already got orders that are close to the number that we can support in the first year. We did have the bulk of our investors come from myself and my co-founder Wolfgang and our external VCs were all primarily Canadian companies.</p>
<p><strong>Has there been a Series A on top of the initial seed funding?</strong></p>
<p>We are currently in the middle of a Series A.</p>
<p><strong>Was Playground involved?</strong></p>
<p>No. We had a nice long chat with them. The team over there &#8212; Bruce, Matt and Peter &#8212; are still very good friends. I still use them as sounding boards for ideas.</p>
<p><strong>When was the company officially launched?</strong></p>
<p>The articles of incorporation were officially filed on 4 20 2020.</p>
<p><strong>The name is pronounced “awesome?” Which was first, the name or the acronym?</strong></p>
<p>Twenty minutes after [Rubin] told me that Essential was going under, I&#8217;m like, “Alright, I&#8217;m gonna do my own thing.” I hate stuff that’s super overt. I hate all the wires and plugs and this and that all over your house, and it drives me nuts. And I had this idea for a different product, which we may or may not eventually build. It has nothing to do with the phone, but just some crazy idea. But the idea was out of sight, out of mind. I think what the people, what the average consumer really pictures when we talk about the future technology in Star Trek, and the sense of speaking and something answers out of the ether. It’s not a thing sitting on my desk that has a cable that&#8217;s nine feet long, but it&#8217;s only eight inches from the wall. The idea was this thing that comes out of ether, and the idea was &#8220;out of sight out of mind. Oh, OSOM, we&#8217;ll just call it awesome.&#8221; I registered it from the hotel in Hong Kong.</p>
<p><strong>Any of those initial ideas being applied here? Obviously, privacy is the thing.</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s certainly the mentality, because of the way we&#8217;re building our software. The idea is that, again, it maintains an out of sight, out of mind; you should just trust that your devices are keeping you safe when you want to be safe.</p>
<p><strong>For the time being it&#8217;s an American company?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We’re a Delaware C Corp. Like every other tech company, probably all registered at the exact same address.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve talked to the Canadian government about incentives&#8230; but you&#8217;re going to continue to be headquartered in Cupertino?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, that&#8217;s up in the air. OSOM Products, the U.S. company, will continue to exist. But we may move our headquarters up to Canada.</p>
<p><strong>What are the common threads between Essential and OSOM? Philosophical? Aesthetic?</strong></p>
<p>Aesthetically, 100%. Even though it&#8217;s the same designer, Dave Evans and myself doing the industrial design, we didn&#8217;t really think about it as an obvious successor to the PH1, until we had the first prototype it was like, “this was clearly designed by the same team”. Both in a material standpoint and an appearance standpoint it&#8217;s a continuation of the same crew. Our software team, particularly when it comes to Android and security updates, the team that was responsible for the super, super-fast updates at Essential are here at OSOM.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s talk about advertising. How will you differentiate the brand from 800 other phone makers?</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to give anything away, because I&#8217;m super excited about it. I will put it this way: When we show the broader team the campaign ideas and the first drafts, people who have been at Essential from the very beginning, they’re like, &#8220;why didn&#8217;t we do that before?&#8221; We have to spend on marketing to differentiate. A big chunk of that money that we raised is going towards marketing.</p>
<p><strong>What can we expect on the spec-side?</strong></p>
<p>This is a flagship device, both in terms of hardware and software.</p>
<p><strong>Is it difficult keeping the price down for a first piece of hardware?</strong></p>
<p>Not really. The team that I brought over from Essential, when it comes to supply chain, is some of the best in the world. Our partners have been astonishingly supportive. We&#8217;ve gotten some amazing rates. Literally going into a couple of meetings like, &#8220;I just want the same price to give Apple and Google.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>So, comparably priced with other flagships.</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re gonna be well under $1,000.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Union&#8217;s competition regulator has given the all-clear to Microsoft&#8217;s $19.7 billion purchase of transcription tech firm Nuance, which was announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>The EU <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_7067" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said today</a> it has concluded there are no competition concerns for the region if the acquisition goes ahead, clearing it without conditions.</p>
<p>The deal was notified to the Commission&#8217;s regulators on November 16.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250340" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Microsoft is acquiring Nuance Communications for $19.7B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/embed/#?secret=84TmvMnhDe" data-secret="84TmvMnhDe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While Microsoft-Nuance has gotten a green light from the bloc, the U.K.&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority has<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/cma-microsoft-nuance/"> just opened its own preliminary investigation</a> &#8212; so some regional scrutiny continues.</p>
<p>On the EU side, the Commission&#8217;s investigation looked at horizontal overlaps between Nuance and Microsoft in the markets for transcription software &#8212; finding the two provide very different products (out-of-the-box software for end-users versus APIs targeted at devs wanting to add speech recognition tech to their apps, respectively).</p>
<p>It also determined that the combined entity will continue to face &#8220;strong&#8221; competition from other players.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The EU looked at the vertical link between Microsoft&#8217;s cloud computing services and Nuance&#8217;s downstream transcription software for healthcare, too &#8212; but found competing transcription service providers in the sector do not depend on Microsoft for cloud computing.</p>
<p>Nor are these type of transcription service providers particularly key users of cloud computing, per the Commission.</p>
<p>Its investigation considered conglomerate links between Nuance&#8217;s software (which is only available for Windows) and a number of Microsoft products as well &#8212; but took the view that the combined entity would not have the ability and/or incentive to foreclose competitors in the markets for (healthcare) transcription software; enterprise communication services; CRM software; productivity software; and PC operating systems.</p>
<p>And, there again, the EU decided the combined entity will still face strong competition.</p>
<p>Perhaps most interestingly, the Commission looked at the use of data transcribed by Nuance&#8217;s software.</p>
<p>This is interesting because healthcare data is highly sensitive and Microsoft &#8212; while not a massive player in adtech &#8212; does have ambitions to grow that side of its business. Just today it <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/att-sells-adtech-firm-xandr-to-microsoft-2021-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the purchase of adtech firm Xandr (formerly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/25/att-appnexus/">AppNexus</a>), from AT&amp;T, to beef up its digital advertising biz, for example.</p>
<p>Add to that, in recent days, Oracle &#8212; a tech giant with an already massive digital marketing biz &#8212; has signalled its own grand designs on health &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/oracle-snags-cerner-in-28b-mega-deal-to-make-a-big-move-into-healthcare/">announcing the acquisition of Cerner</a>, a U.S. provider of electronic health record (EHR) systems.</p>
<p>And, well, the prospect of adtech companies harvesting health data makes plenty of people <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/europe-urged-to-block-google-fitbit-ahead-of-major-digital-policy-overhaul/">queasy about privacy</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="3jbWQ27awe"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/oracle-joins-microsoft-in-spending-big-to-dominate-healthcare-vertical/">Oracle joins Microsoft in spending big to dominate healthcare vertical</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Nonetheless, the Commission&#8217;s assessment of the data side of the Microsoft-Nuance gave it a clean bill of health &#8212; owing to existing &#8220;contractual restrictions&#8221; and regional data protection regulations.</p>
<p>While this analysis is largely coming from a competition perspective, it&#8217;s notable that data protection got (another) shout-out in an EU antitrust assessment. (The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-is-now-investigating-googles-adtech-over-antitrust-concerns/">earlier instance</a> relates to the EU&#8217;s [ongoing] scrutiny of Google&#8217;s adtech; which followed much criticism from privacy advocates after the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/europe-clears-google-fitbit-with-a-ten-year-ban-on-using-health-data-for-ads/">Commission cleared Google&#8217;s purchase of Fitbit last year</a>, albeit &#8212; in that case &#8212; with conditions that included limits on Google using Fitbit health data for ads.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The Commission concluded that Nuance can use this data only to provide its services,&#8221; the EU writes in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_7067" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> on the clearance of Microsoft-Nuance. &#8220;It is not used by any other company and cannot be used for any other purpose due to contractual restrictions and data protection legislation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s antitrust division also concluded that access to Nuance&#8217;s data will not provide Microsoft with an advantage that would enable it to shut out competing healthcare software providers &#8212; given &#8220;important transcribed information is typically stored in third-party applications like electronic health record (EHR) systems that combine data from several sources, as opposed to Nuance&#8217;s fragmented speech data&#8221;.</p>
<p>That tidbit raises questions about whether Oracle&#8217;s acquisition of Cerner, a provider of EHR systems, may face more probing questions from EU competition regulators &#8212; if/when they come to consider that Big Tech healthcare sector deal.</p>
<p>Although Cerner&#8217;s relative lack of regional customers &#8212; it <a href="https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/finance-revenue-cycle/health-it-market/news/21124817/cerner-sells-off-some-of-its-european-portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold off some of its European portfolio last year</a> &#8212; may serve to reduce or limit the scope of any EU concerns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On-demand shuttle service and software company <a href="https://ridewithvia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Via</a> has confidentially filed to go public, the company <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/via-announces-confidential-submission-of-draft-registration-statement-related-to-proposed-public-offering-301449178.html?tc=eml_cleartime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in a statement.</a> The company has not yet determined how many shares will be offered or what the price range for the proposed offering will look like, as is typical for this sort of release.</p>
<p>Via follows Reddit in filing privately for a public listing before the end-of-year market freeze. Both companies should debut in early 2022</p>
<p>Why file now given the impending holiday period? Via has posted impressive results in recent quarters, so getting its ducks in a row – shuttles in a line? – for an early-early IPO is far from aggressive. It’s reasonable, frankly, given that tech valuations are still strong despite recent declines. And companies that can go public may want to take advantage of the IPO window while it’s open.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250384" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/via-transportation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Per Crunchbase,</a> Via has raised $777.1 million in known funding to date, from investors including Macquarie Capital, Mori Building, Shell, 83North, Broadscale Group, Ervington Investments, Hearst Ventures, Planven Ventures, Pitango and RiverPark Ventures.</p>
<p>Last month Via announced a $130 million round that pushed the on-demand shuttle and software company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/via-raises-130m-to-expand-on-demand-shuttle-software-business/">to a $3.3 billion valuation</a>. We suppose that that was a pre-IPO round, in retrospect. The capital event came on the heels of TransitTech, Via’s software platform, doubling year over year to exceed an annual run rate of $100 million.</p>
<p>More simply, Via has reached the threshold of IPO scale in revenue terms, not taking into account other possible income streams at the company. So its IPO timing once again makes sense.</p>
<p>Past the software revenue result, after originally taking five years to land its first city partnership, the company today has over 500 partners, including Los Angeles Metro, Jersey City and Miami.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Life has not proved pothole free for Via. The company saw mixed demand for its business amidst the pandemic. While ridership <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/on-demand-shuttle-startup-via-hits-2-25-billion-valuation-on-latest-funding-round-led-by-exor/">initially dropped due to the disease</a>, cities focused more on emergency services &#8212; helping generate demand for Via’s software platform. From a business perspective, that’s good news considering the stickiness of a city contract.</p>
<p>Via has beefed up its operations over the past few years, perhaps hinting at plans to make a pitch for a public debut. In March, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/via-buys-mapping-startup-remix-for-100-million/">the company bought Remix</a>, which created software for cities to use for transportation planning and street design, for $100 million. It also acquired<a href="https://www.fleetonomy.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Fleetonomy.</a></p>
<p>Via won’t be the only mobility startup racing toward a 2022 public debut. This month, Voi Scooters <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/2250109/">raised a $115 million Series D in preparation for an IPO</a> and Kakao Mobility picked up a $4.2 billion valuation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/kakao-mobility-picks-up-additional-55m-funding-at-over-4-2b-valuation/">ahead of its rumored listing. </a></p>
<p>TechCrunch has a series of questions for the filing, once we get our hands on it. For example, we’re curious whether the company is able to generate traditional SaaS gross margins while selling to governments. And how long are its sales cycles? Even more, how deeply penetrated is its core market? And where did all that capital raised get spent? Will I see it in investing cash flow or operating losses?</p>
<p>All told, the 2022 IPO cycle is shaping up to start off with a number of very, <em>very </em>interesting debuts.</p>
