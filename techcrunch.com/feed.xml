										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Kleiner Perkins led Stord’s $12.4 million Series A in 2019, its founders were in their early 20s and so passionate about their startup that they each dropped out of their respective schools to focus on growing the business.</p>
<p>Fast-forward two years and <a href="http://www.stord.com">Stord</a> &#8212; an Atlanta-based company that has developed a cloud supply chain &#8212; is raising more capital in a round again led by Kleiner Perkins.</p>
<p>This time, Stord has raised $90 million in a Series D round of funding at a post-money valuation of $1.125 billion &#8212; more than double the $510 million that the company was valued at when raising $65 million in a Series C financing just six months ago.</p>
<p>In fact, today’s funding marks Stord’s third since early December of 2020, when it raised its Series B led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, and brings the company’s total raised since its 2015 inception to $205 million.</p>
<p>Besides Kleiner Perkins, Lux Capital, D1 Capital, Palm Tree Crew, BOND, Dynamo Ventures, Founders Fund, Lineage Logistics and Susa Ventures also participated in the Series D financing. In addition, Michael Rubin, Fanatics founder and founder of GSI Commerce; Carlos Cashman, CEO of Thrasio; Max Mullen, co-founder of Instacart; and Will Gaybrick, CPO at Stripe, put money in the round.</p>
<p>Founders Sean Henry, 24, and Jacob Boudreau, 23, met while Henry was at Georgia Tech and Boudreau was in online classes at Arizona State (ASU) but running his own business, a software development firm, in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Over time, Stord has evolved into a cloud supply chain that can give companies a way to compete and grow with logistics, and provides an integrated platform “that’s available exactly when and where they need it,” Henry said. Stord combines physical logistics services such as freight, warehousing and fulfillment in that platform, which aims to provide “complete visibility, rapid optimization and elastic scale” for its users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>About two months ago, Stord announced the opening of its first fulfillment center, a 386,000-square-foot facility, in Atlanta, which features warehouse robotics and automation technologies. “It was the first time we were in a building ourselves running it end to end,” Henry said.</p>
<p>And today, the company is announcing it has acquired Connecticut-based Fulfillment Works, a 22-year-old company with direct-to-consumer (DTC) experience and warehouses in Nevada and in its home state.</p>
<p>With FulfillmentWorks, the company says it has increased its first-party warehouses, coupled with its network of over 400 warehouse partners and 15,000 carriers.</p>
<p>While Stord would not disclose the amount it paid for Fulfillment Works, Henry did share some of Stord’s impressive financial metrics. The company, he said, in 2020 delivered its third consecutive year of 300+% growth, and is on track to do so again in 2021. Stord also achieved more than $100 million in revenue in the first two quarters of 2021, according to Henry, and grew its headcount from 160 people last year to over 450 so far in 2021 (including about 150 Fulfillment Works employees). And since the fourth quarter is often when people do the most online shopping, Henry expects the three-month period to be Stord’s heaviest revenue quarter.</p>
<p>For some context, Stord’s new sales were up “7x” in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same period last year. So far in the third quarter, sales are up almost 10x, according to Henry.</p>
<p>Put simply, Stord aims to give brands a way to compete with the likes of Amazon, which has set expectations of fast fulfillment and delivery. The company guarantees two-day shipping to anywhere in the country.</p>
<p>“The supply chain is the new competitive battleground,” Henry said. “Today’s buying expectations set by Amazon and the rise of the omni-channel shopper have placed immense pressure on companies to maintain more nimble and efficient supply chains… We want every company to have world-class, Prime-like supply chains.”</p>
<p>What makes Stord unique, according to Henry, is the fact that it has built what it believes to be the only end-to-end logistics network that combines the physical infrastructure with software.</p>
<p>That too is one of the reasons that Kleiner Perkins doubled down on its investment in the company.</p>
<p>Ilya Fushman, Stord board director and partner at Kleiner Perkins, said even at the time of his firm’s investment in 2019, that Henry displayed “amazing maturity and vision.”</p>
<p>At a high level, the firm was also just drawn to what he described as the “incredibly large market opportunity.”</p>
<p>“It’s trillions of dollars of products moving around with consumer expectation that these products will get to them the same day or next day, wherever they are,” Fushman told TechCrunch. “And while companies like Amazon have built amazing infrastructure to do that themselves, the rest of the world hasn&#8217;t really caught up&#8230; So there’s just amazing opportunity to build software and services to modernize this multitrillion-dollar market.”</p>
<p>In other words, Fushman explained, Stord is serving as a “plug and play” or “one stop shop” for retailers and merchants so they don’t have to spend resources on their own warehouses or building their own logistics platforms.</p>
<p>Stord launched the software part of its business in January 2020, and it grew 900% during the year, and is today one of the fastest-growing parts of its business.</p>
<p>“We built software to run our logistics and network of hundreds of warehouses,” Henry told TechCrunch. “But if companies want to use the same system for existing logistics, they can buy our software to get that kind of visibility.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">2021 has been a good year to be an ad tech investor. Valuations are <a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/the-trade-desk-doubles-revenue-in-a-weird-year-and-bets-the-farm-on-ctv/">surging</a>, Wall Street is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/digital-ad-opportunities-and-capital-spur-investor-interest-in-ad-tech-11625220000">happy</a> and exits are <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/triplelift-to-sell-majority-stake-to-vista-equity-partners-for-1-4-billion/">frequent</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/integral-ad-science-buys-ad-tech-company-publica-for-220-million-11628591400">satisfying</a>. It’s the perfect time to double down and invest in an area that has been largely ignored but is poised for major upside in the next few years: Digital creative ad technology.</p>
<p>Think about it. When was the last time we saw a major ad tech funding round that was directed at the actual ads themselves — the messages people actually see everyday? I’d argue that now is the perfect time.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The adtech startups that can figure out how to adapt ads that can interact with the remote control, a synced smartphone or voice commands — maybe even make them shoppable — can theoretically produce a game-changer.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Here are five reasons why VCs should consider ratcheting up their investment into ad tech startups building the next generation of creative tools:</p>
<h2>Creative tech is far from being saturated</h2>
<p>Consider how much has been spent over the 15 years on digital advertising mechanics such as targeting, serving, measuring and verification. Not to mention the trillions that have gone toward helping brands keep track of customer data and interactions — the marketing clouds, DMPs and CDPs.</p>
<p>Yet you can count the number of creative-centric ad tech companies on one hand. This means there is a lot of room for innovation and early leaders. VideoAmp, which helps brands make ads for various social platforms, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2021-05-18/videoamp-raises-75m-in-committed-financing-from-capital-ip">pulled in $75 million earlier this year</a>. Given how fast platforms like TikTok and Snap are growing, it won’t be the last.</p>
<h2>Digital ad targeting is being squeezed</h2>
<p>Ads need to do more work today. Between regulation, cookies going away and Apple locking down data collection, we’ve seen a renewed interest in contextual advertising, including funding for the likes of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gumgum-raises-75-million-from-goldman-sachs-11618311629">GumGum</a>, as well as identity resolution firms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/infosum-raises-65m-series-b-as-organizations-embrace-secure-data-sharing/">InfoSum</a>.</p>
<p>But the digital ad ecosystem can’t get by only using broader data-crunching techniques to replace &#8220;retargeting.&#8221; The medium is practically crying out for a creative revival that can only be sparked by scalable tech. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/marpipe-raises-series-a-funding-venture-capital-samsung-2021-9">recent funding</a> for creative testing startup Marpipe is a start, but more focus is needed on actual tech-driven ideation and automation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-176">has charged App Annie</a>, a leading mobile data and analytics firm, as well as its co-founder and former CEO and Chairman Bertrand Schmitt, with securities fraud. App Annie and Schmitt have agreed to pay over $10 million to settle the fraud charges which are related to &#8220;deceptive practices and making material misrepresentations about how App Annie&#8217;s alternative data was derived,&#8221; the SEC said.</p>
<p>App Annie is one of the largest sellers of mobile app performance data, offering details that are useful to developers, publishers, advertisers, and marketers &#8212; like how many times an app is downloaded, how often it&#8217;s used, the revenue it generates, and other competitive analysis and insights. This is what trading firms call &#8220;alternative data,&#8221; because it&#8217;s not detailed in their financial statements or other traditional data sources, the SEC explains. App Annie told app makers it would not disclose their data to third parties directly, but would rather use the data in an aggregated and anonymized way to provide app insights. Specifically, companies were told the data would be used to build a statistical model to generate estimates of app performance.</p>
<p>However, the SEC says from late 2014 through mid-2018, App Annie used non-aggregated and non-anonymized data to alter its model-generated estimates in order to make them more valuable to sell to trading firms. It also says that the company and Schmitt then misrepresented to its customers how it was able to generate the data, saying it did so with the appropriate consent from customers, and that it had effective internal controls to prevent the misuse of confidential data, ensuring it was in compliance with federal securities laws. Trading firms were making investment decisions based on this data and App Annie had even shared ideas as to how they could use the estimates to trading ahead of earnings announcements.</p>
<p>In the full complaint, the SEC further explains Schmitt had agreed to an internal policy where certain public company &#8220;Connect Data&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;Connect&#8221; being App Annies&#8217; analytics product &#8212; would be excluded from its statistical model in late 2014. But he didn&#8217;t actually direct anyone at App Annie to document this policy until April 2017. And then when it was documented, it only said to exclude app revenue data from public companies whose app revenue exceeded 5% of the company&#8217;s total revenue. It never said to exclude app download or usage data.</p>
<p>The SEC says the documented policy was never properly enforced. It wasn&#8217;t until after App Annie learned of the SEC investigation in June 2018 that it amended the policy to exclude public company Connect Data from its estimate generation process, and began to fully implement the policy.</p>
<p>The investigation also discovered that App Annie engineers in Beijing, China were directed by Schmitt to manually alter estimates that would be of most interest to the company&#8217;s highest-paying customers. It did so by looking at the confidential Connect Data, which is one of the ways its estimates were able to be more accurate than rivals. Later, in 2016, it implemented a more automated way of adjusting its model-generated estimates to match up with the actual (and confidential) revenue and download numbers. When App Annie&#8217;s Chief Data Scientist refused to implement the method, believing adjustments should only be made to the statistical model itself, Schmitt had the Beijing engineers make the changes without informing other company executives, subscribers, users, or employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;The federal securities laws prohibit deceptive conduct and material misrepresentations in connection with the purchase or sale of securities,&#8221; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&#8217;s Enforcement Division, in a statement. &#8220;Here, App Annie and Schmitt lied to companies about how their confidential data was being used and then not only sold the manipulated estimates to their trading firm customers, but also encouraged them to trade on those estimates—often touting how closely they correlated with the companies&#8217; true performance and stock prices,&#8221; Grewal added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The SEC says App Annie and Schmitt violated the anti-fraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. App Annie, without either admitting or denying the findings, consented to a cease-and-desist order and is paying a penalty. App Annie agreed to pay a penalty of $10 million. Meanwhile, Schmitt is ordered to pay a penalty of $300,000 and is prohibited from serving as an officer or director of a public company for three years.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, App Annie&#8217;s current CEO provided a statement:</p>
<p>“Since I have taken over as CEO, we have established a new standard of trust and transparency for the newly created alternative data market. App Annie is uniquely positioned to be the first to deliver on a unified data AI vision,” said Theodore Krantz, CEO at App Annie. “Many businesses may be unknowingly leveraging data reliant on confidential public company information without explicit consent which we believe puts companies using digital/mobile market data at significant risk. It is our opinion that the entire alternative data space needs to be regulated.”</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/about/press/releases/app-annie-issues-statement-on-sec-settlement/">a newsroom post</a>, the company also pointed out that the SEC investigation does not relate to its &#8220;current products,&#8221; nor did it relate to &#8220;our current relationships with customers.&#8221; And it says in the three years since the violating practices, it has appointed a new CEO and executive team, changed how it built its data estimates, and established a company-wide &#8220;culture of compliance,&#8221; which included the appointment of a Head of Global Compliance. It also documented its procedures for ensuring confidential data is excluded from its process of generating market estimates.</p>
<p>App Annie&#8217;s mobile market data solution was one of the first to serve the growing app ecosystem when it launched in 2010. Today, its firm counts more than 1,100 enterprise clients and over a million registered users, <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/about/press/">according</a> to its corporate website.</p>
<p>The details of the complaint and settlement are below.</p>

<p>The awards include $26.5 million to Blue Origin; $40.8 million to Dynetics; $35.2 million to Lockheed Martin; $34.8 million to Northrop Grumman; and $9.4 million to SpaceX. Only two companies that submitted proposals, Blue Ridge Nebula Starlines and Cook &amp; Chevalier Enterprises, did not receive contracts.</p>
<p>The contracts were awarded under NextSTEP-2 (Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships) Appendix N: Sustainable Human Landing System Studies and Risk Reduction. The solicitation, released at the beginning of July, says the objective of the contract is “to engage with potential commercial partners for concept studies, sustaining HLS concept of operations (ground and flight) development, and risk reduction activities.”</p>
<p>What that means in practice is that the selected companies will develop lander design concepts, including conducting component tests, and evaluate them for things like performance and safety.</p>
<p>These awards are separate from the Human Landing System contract that was given to SpaceX earlier this year – the one that both Blue Origin and Dynetics <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/government-watchdog-rejects-blue-origins-protest-over-lunar-lander-contract/">disputed</a> to a government watchdog, and that Blue Origin later opposed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-goes-toe-to-toe-with-nasa-in-federal-court-over-award-to-spacex/">in a lawsuit against NASA</a> that’s still ongoing.</p>

<p>However, the outcome of this batch of awards will likely inform future lander development contracts through the rest of the decade.  “The work from these companies will ultimately help shape the strategy and requirements for a future NASA’s solicitation to provide regular astronaut transportation from lunar orbit to the surface of the Moon,” the agency said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Artemis program was established in 2020 with a number of objectives, not only to return humans to the moon for the first time since the days of Apollo but to make such travel routine by the late 2020s. NASA isn’t just stopping at the moon; the agency also wants to expand into inter-planetary exploration, including human missions to Mars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At first blush, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/intuit-confirms-12b-deal-to-buy-mailchimp/">the $12 billion Intuit-Mailchimp deal</a> might not make a heck of a lot of sense. But people tend to pigeonhole companies, and in this case they might see Intuit as purely a financial software company and Mailchimp as an email marketing firm and nothing more. If that&#8217;s as far as your perspective goes, the deal is confusing. From a wider lens, however, there’s more to both companies than you might think.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with Intuit. If you go to the company website and<a href="https://www.intuit.com/products/"> scan the product set</a>, it&#8217;s clearly all about managing finances for consumer and small businesses alike. The latter category appears to be what the company wants to exploit and expand upon with this deal.</p>
<p>Prior to yesterday&#8217;s news, Intuit&#8217;s biggest acquisition had been on the consumer side <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/intuit-credit-karma/">buying Credit Karma for $7.1 billion</a> last year. That deal gave the company&#8217;s customers a way to access their credit scores outside of the big three reporting companies: Experian, Equifax and TransUnion. Apparently not content with only that transaction, it set its sights on Mailchimp to throw some money at the business side of the house.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gaming in general is moving towards accessibility, but that&#8217;s not as much the case in esports, which like other sports are competitive and by nature somewhat exclusive. Xbox and the Special Olympics are working together on a new event that combines competition with inclusion, and it&#8217;s going on right now.</p>
<p>This week, Special Olympics athletes will be competing against each other in tournaments of <em>Rocket League</em>, <em>Madden NFL 22</em>, and <em>Forza Motorsports 7</em>. The prize, other than prestige and pride, is playing with one of the Special Olympics&#8217; celebrity supporters: &#8220;NBA superstar Jayson Tatum, NFL legend Jamaal Charles, and WWE Superstars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This tournament is a meaningful and important step in making esports more accessible and it empowers Special Olympics athletes with a new way to compete,&#8221; said Jenn Panattoni, Head of Xbox Social Impact. &#8220;Xbox has invested in numerous accessibility features and products, like the Xbox Adaptive Controller and features like copilot or speech to text. The purpose of all this continued work is to ensure that players feel welcome and that they belong on the Xbox platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tournaments are being recorded right now, and will be broadcast over the rest of the week, along with the &#8220;celebrity showcase&#8221; coming Saturday with recaps. You can check out a schedule at the bottom of <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/08/10/xbox-and-the-special-olympics-gaming-for-inclusion-event/">this post</a>, but generally just keep an eye on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/XBOX">Xbox Twitch channel</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbgL_cannhXClCH6OKNpbJg">Special Olympics YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<p>I like to highlight these events because accessibility has been on the back burner for so long in the gaming world, and now we&#8217;re seeing big moves by developers, publishers, and partners to make things better. Microsoft&#8217;s XAC is a great example, as is the panoply of visual, audio, and difficulty options in the latest <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em> game. Esports is definitely one of the areas that needs more diversity, though, and the participating players were glad to take part. I asked Special Olympics Jose Moreno and Colton Rice for their thoughts on the matter.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think competitive gaming is getting more accessible?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rice</strong>: Competitive gaming is definitely getting more accessible. Not only are the games becoming more accessible, accessibility allows people with disabilities to become more competitive players. People with intellectual disabilities are always trying to compete at their best. We want to do what everyone else is doing, and sometimes just need a little help to make that happen.</p>
<p><strong>Moreno</strong>: I do think that competitive gaming is getting more accessible because Microsoft has started bringing out video game controllers that are accessible for people with intellectual disabilities, physical disabilities – accessible to everybody. I’m a lifelong gamer, and accessibility in esports has been game-changing. Accessible gaming wasn’t available when I was growing up. Today, it’s so much more fun to play when you can play with friends of all abilities and everybody can participate.</p>

<p><strong>How are you experiencing that change?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Moreno</strong>: In my opinion, the more the video games industry include people with intellectual disabilities, the better the video game community is going to get to know how we love playing video games just like everybody else. And through events like Gaming for Inclusion, I’m not just able to compete – I’m included as a part of a community of gamers where I am welcomed and included.</p>
<p><strong>Rice</strong>: People with intellectual disabilities have skills and pay attention to details; when we set our minds to do something, we practice until we are the best we can be especially when we enjoy doing it – and that includes gaming. People with disabilities just need more time to learn, but when you’re dedicated to something that you’re passionate about, you won’t stop until you succeed.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s something you&#8217;d like to see more of, from developers, publishers etc?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Moreno</strong>: I would like to see more from developers or makers or publishers of video games in general or computer games to include more people with intellectual disabilities in the video game workforce. People with intellectual disabilities can play a variety of roles and provide unique perspectives on how to improve the gaming experience. Publishers and developers can get a different perspective from people with disabilities; whether that’s featuring people with intellectual disabilities represented in their storylines or seeing them in the games themselves. We’re eager to be a part of this process, and there are lots of passionate gamers with intellectual disabilities who would like to participate in focus groups or in actual jobs as creators within the industry.</p>
<p><strong>Rice</strong>: The companies who make these games are trying to make high quality games that are enjoyable for everybody. There is still a lot that can be done to make games more accessible. For example, it can be frustrating when gamers with intellectual disabilities are learning a new game with instructions that are hard to read. It can take hours to learn how to play the new version of a game you’ve played for years. That doesn’t mean people with intellectual disabilities aren’t capable of playing or competing – it just means we need better accessibility tools to help us learn.</p>
<p>If gaming companies want to create accessible, inclusive games, they could benefit from including gamers with intellectual disabilities in the creative process to help make or test &#8220;easy read&#8221; or beginner’s instructions, or find ways to simplify navigation between different levels of a game. Gaming can build a community and reach people who feel left out. Accessibility allows everybody to have fun.</p>
<hr />
<p>This competition and other events in online gaming have been essential to keeping the Special Olympics community connected and active over a difficult couple years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Special Olympics has a long-standing partnership with Microsoft that has been incredibly valuable for the athletes and families of the Special Olympics movement,&#8221; said the organization&#8217;s Chief Information and Technology Officer, Prianka Nandy. &#8220;With the COVID-19 pandemic, our main concern has been the safety and health of our athletes, who are amongst the most vulnerable population to have an adverse or catastrophic outcome from the virus. This led to the cancellation and postponement of thousands of annual in-person events and competitions – which meant our athletes have missed out on the connections and opportunities to experience the joy of being with their teammates, coaches, and friends. At this time, our goals remain to raise awareness of the Special Olympics movement and the accomplishments, hopes, and dreams of our incredible athletes, and to change attitudes towards people with intellectual disabilities within the gaming community, all while remembering that gaming can be fun and inclusive for all.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple continues its tradition of improving the photography capabilities of consumer devices with today&#8217;s announcement of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/this-is-the-iphone-13/">iPhone 13 and 13 Pro</a>, available on September 24.</p>
<p>Last year&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/review-iphone-12-and-iphone-12-pro-two-gems-one-jewel/"> iPhone 12</a> had two rear camera lenses, while the iPhone 12 Pro had three; the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro follow suit. The iPhone 13 features a wide (f/1.6 aperture) and an ultra wide (f/2.4 aperture) lens, which are the same specs as the iPhone 12. But the iPhone 13 Pro unveils an entirely new camera system.</p>
<p>Compared to the iPhone 12 Pro, the iPhone 13 Pro improves low-light performance by allowing for apertures as wide as f/1.5 on the main lens, compared to f/1.6 on the previous model. The ultra wide lens follows the same trend, boasting f/1.8, improved from f/2.4 on the iPhone 12 Pro. These wide apertures should collect more light in darker settings like bars and concerts, hopefully leading to improved image quality. Apple claims that the ultra wide lens will have &#8220;up to 92% improvement in low light,&#8221; but&#8230; we&#8217;ll just have to test that ourselves.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2202611" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202611" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2202611" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cameras-iphone-13-pro.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="379" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cameras-iphone-13-pro.jpeg 2974w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cameras-iphone-13-pro.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cameras-iphone-13-pro.jpeg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cameras-iphone-13-pro.jpeg?resize=768,428 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cameras-iphone-13-pro.jpeg?resize=680,379 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cameras-iphone-13-pro.jpeg?resize=1536,855 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cameras-iphone-13-pro.jpeg?resize=2048,1140 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cameras-iphone-13-pro.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202611" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Perhaps the most notable lens upgrade is the improvement to the telephoto lens. Though this lens has a smaller aperture than its predecessor (f/2.8 compared to f/2.0), the new telephoto lens is 77mm-equivalent, while the iPhone 12 Pro&#8217;s telephoto was 52mm. This allows users to zoom closer in on far-away scenes without sacrificing image quality. The telephoto lens also now supports night mode, which it didn&#8217;t previously.</p>
<p>Apple also announced Macro mode, which will be available on the iPhone 13 Pro. The ultra wide lens and autofocus system work together to magnify subjects as close as 2 centimeters away. These shots are challenging to pull off even on professional, non-phone cameras. Users can also record video and even slow-mo at this scale, which should open up some interesting options.</p>

<p>Apple also announced Photographic Styles and Cinematic Mode, new features available on both the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro.</p>
<p>Photographic Styles applies local edits to an image in real time as the photo is rendered, so photographers can compose their shots using one of four presets and see what their end product will look like before they click the shutter button. Of course even point-and-shoots have had real-time filters for a decade, but Apple claims these Photographic Styles are more technologically sophisticated than those, using machine learning to understand how to intelligently apply edits without compromising a subject&#8217;s skin tone.</p>

<p>Cinematic Mode allows users to shoot video, but then change the background blur and virtual focus of the clip later. This feature seems more catered toward professional filmmakers &#8212; Apple brought in Kathryn Bigelow and Greig Fraizer to demonstrate the functionality. Still, Canon and Nikon need not worry &#8212; there will always be advantages of a camera that&#8217;s a camera, as opposed to a camera that&#8217;s a phone &#8212; but hey, it&#8217;s not as though smartphone films have never <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2017/12/iphone-sean-baker-tangerine-academy-museum-oscars-1201908946/">made a splash in the Academy</a>.</p>
<p>The iPhone 13 will start at $799 (which, for the record, is more expensive than an entry-level DSLR camera and a decent lens). The iPhone 13 Pro &#8212; telephoto lens, macro photography and all &#8212; starts at $999.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Space rideshare service provider Spaceflight Inc. is going to be shuttling customers on a lunar flyby mission next year, part of its long-term vision of giving companies easy access to lunar orbits and beyond.</p>
<p>The Seattle-based company will be delivering payload using its propulsive transfer vehicle, Sherpa EScape, or Sherpa-ES, the latest iteration of Sherpa vehicles that the company has been testing for the past few years. The Sherpa essentially acts as last-mile space transportation, deploying payload to customers&#8217; desired orbits after reaching outer space.</p>
<p>Spaceflight’s electric propulsive Sherpa-LTE flew on the SpaceX <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/spacex-delivers-88-satellites-to-orbit-lands-first-stage-onshore-for-first-time-in-2021/">Transporter-2 mission</a> in June, while Sherpa-LTC with chemical propulsion will launch later this year on Transporter-3. The company has successfully deployed 50 customer spacecraft to date.</p>
<p>The Sherpa-ES will be delivering payloads for in-orbit refueling company Orbit Fab, which just closed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/aerospace-primes-northrup-lockheed-join-in-orbit-fabs-over-10m-funding-round/">$10 million</a> in funding from two major aerospace primes, and new company GeoJump. It looks like GeoJump is also looking to get into the ridesharing business; its website bills it as <a href="https://geojump.space/">offering</a> “a new route to [geostationary orbit]” for small satellites. The mission will launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.</p>

<p>The rideshare is part of a robotic lunar landing mission being undertaken by Intuitive Machines, one of a handful of companies selected by NASA to be part of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/nasa-reveals-the-payloads-for-the-first-commercial-moon-cargo-deliveries/">Commercial Lunar Payload Services Program</a>. Intuitive Machines will be sending its nearly 2,000-kilogram Nova-C lander to the lunar surface for a 14-day mission. The IM-1 lander will ferry around 130 kilograms of cargo.</p>
<p>Intuitive Machines also tapped SpaceX for its second lander mission, also for 2022. The company says this will be the first object to land at the moon’s south pole, and the first object to drill on lunar ice.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a> is now valued at $40 billion following a fresh capital injection of $200 million (USD) in a round led by T. Rowe Price. New and existing investors participated in the round, including Franklin Templeton, Sequoia Capital Global Equities, Bessemer Venture Partners, Greenoaks Capital, Dragoneer Investments, Blackbird, Felicis and AirTree Ventures.</p>
<p>This round solidifies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/canva/">Canva</a> as one of the most valuable private software companies out there, and it also propels the Australian tech scene forward.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Melanie Perkins and her team started working on Canva in 2012, and launched the product in 2013. The premise behind it was relatively simple, but the technology itself&#8230; not so much.</p>
<p>Canva allows anyone to design. Presentations, t-shirts, brochures, flyers&#8230; you name it. The first step in this is creating a truly simple user interface, where folks can simply drag and drop components into their designs, complete with hundreds of thousands of templates, without doing a lot of fine tuning. The second step is creating a massive library of content, from fonts to templates to imagery, gifs and videos. The third step is to make that product accessible to everyone, whether it&#8217;s a platform or device or language or price.</p>
<p>Going after everyone, instead of just designers, has proved incredibly fruitful for the company. To be clear, designers still use Canva to lay out components they&#8217;ve designed in other products, such as Figma and Sketch, and Canva actually plays nicely with a variety of design software products. But Canva has no intention of going head to head with Figma, Adobe or Sketch.</p>
<p>Perkins described it with the example of a business card. Designers will create the components of a business card in their design platform of choice, and then lay out the template for business cards in Canva, sharing that template with the entire organization. That way, when someone gets a title change or a new employee comes on, they can actually edit the card themselves without the help of a designer and send it to print.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Perkins why Canva hasn&#8217;t extended the platform more aggressively into the workflow of professional designers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We would like to replace PDF,&#8221; said Perkins. &#8220;Rather than people sending PDFs backwards and forwards between the designer and the client, designers can just create a template for organization use. It&#8217;s less important for us to absolutely excel at things like vector design because there are amazing programs on the market that may be there. We really want to focus on that collaboration piece.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though a bottoms-up enterprise strategy is relatively popular these days, Canva was an early master of the model. Canva launched as a free product, and over time the company introduced enterprise layers into the mix.</p>
<p>As of now, Canva has more than 60 million monthly active users across 190 countries, with big-name companies on the enterprise plan. This includes Salesforce, Marriott International, PayPal and American Airlines. Canva expects to exceed $1 billion in annualized revenue by the end of 2021. More than 500,000 teams are paying for the product in some capacity.</p>
<p>With a 2,000-person team, Canva will use the fresh funding to double its workforce in the next year.</p>
<p>Canva also shared its DEI numbers, with females representing 42% of the workforce. The company did not share any stats around people of color on the team.</p>
<p>Perkins explained to TechCrunch that a huge part of the company&#8217;s growth has to do with an obsession over creating a highly valuable free product.</p>
<p>&#8220;We intentionally make our free product extremely generous for a number of reasons,&#8221; said Perkins. &#8220;It&#8217;s critical both for our marketing and towards our mission of empowering people to design. But, as part of our marketing, it means that people are able to love the product, share it with their friends and family, and promote it on social media. And then that virality really rapidly fuels our growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside growing the team, Canva also has plans to further build out the product in the next year, launching website design soon. This will allow users to turn existing and new presentations and designs into a website, and even search for and buy a domain for that site.</p>
<p>Canva is also working on a new video editor and an offline mode.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Canva CEO Melanie Perkins will tell us about the journey to a $15B valuation at Disrupt&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/canva-ceo-melanie-perkins-will-tell-us-about-the-journey-to-a-15b-valuation-at-disrupt/embed/#?secret=ulDy54yxGQ" data-secret="ulDy54yxGQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Perkins says that Canva has two goals, and that each fuels the other. The first is to become one of the world&#8217;s most valuable companies, and the other is to do the most good that it can do.</p>
<p>The company has already joined the 1% pledge and has several efforts around being a force for good, including giving the premium product to more than 130,000 nonprofits, allocating more than 45,000 volunteering hours each year and launching Print One, Plant One, which is a project that plants a tree for every single print order placed through Canva.</p>
<p>With today&#8217;s funding announcement, cofounders Perkins and Cliff Obrecht are committing the vast majority of their own equity in the company (around 30%) to doing good in the world, with plans to do this through the Canva Foundation.</p>
<p>Perkins will be joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=rightrail">Disrupt</a> to talk about the new funding, valuation, what&#8217;s in store for Canva, and share her broader thoughts on design as a category.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The TechCrunch crew is hard at work writing up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/apple-fall-event-2021/">the latest</a> from Apple&#8217;s iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch event. They have good notes on the megacorp&#8217;s hardware updates. But what are the markets saying about the same array of products?</p>
<p>For those of us more concerned with effective S&amp;P dividend yields than screen nit levels, events like Apple&#8217;s confab are more interesting for what they might mean for the value of the hosting company than how many GPUs a particular smartphone model has. And, for once, Apple&#8217;s stock may have done something a little interesting during the event!</p>
<p>Observe the following chart:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2202582" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202582" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2202582 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AAPL_^SPXTR_^IXIC_chart.png" alt="" width="2000" height="1291" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AAPL_^SPXTR_^IXIC_chart.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AAPL_^SPXTR_^IXIC_chart.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AAPL_^SPXTR_^IXIC_chart.png?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AAPL_^SPXTR_^IXIC_chart.png?resize=768,496 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AAPL_^SPXTR_^IXIC_chart.png?resize=680,439 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AAPL_^SPXTR_^IXIC_chart.png?resize=1536,991 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AAPL_^SPXTR_^IXIC_chart.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202582" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch/Y Charts</p></div></p>
<p>This is a one-day chart, mind, so we&#8217;re looking at intraday changes. We&#8217;re zoomed in. And Apple kinda took a bit of a dive during its event that kicked off at 1 p.m. in the above chart.</p>
<p>Normally <em>nothing</em> of import happens to Apple&#8217;s shares during its presentations. Which feels weird, frankly, as Apple events detail the product mix that will generate hundreds of billions in revenue. You&#8217;d think that they would have more impact than their usual zero.</p>
<p>But today, we had real share price movement when the event wrapped around 2 p.m. ET. Perhaps investors were hoping for more pricey devices? Or were hoping Apple had more up its sleeve? How you rate that holiday Apple product lineup is a matter of personal preference, but investors appear to have weighed in slightly to the negative.</p>
<p>Worth around $2.5 trillion, each 1% that Apple&#8217;s stock moves is worth $10 billion. Apple&#8217;s loss of 1.5% today &#8212; more or less; trading continues as I write this &#8212; is worth more than Mailchimp. It&#8217;s a lot of money.</p>
<p>You can read the rest of our coverage from the Apple event <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/apple-fall-event-2021/">here. </a>Enjoy!</p>

Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JoeBiden</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/linakhanFTC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@linakhanFTC</a>, thank you Sima, my love, mom, dad, Pablo, our families. Vamos.</p>
<p>&mdash; Alvaro Bedoya (@alvarombedoya) <a href="https://twitter.com/alvarombedoya/status/1437509709251190797?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 13, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In 2016, Bedoya co-authored a report titled &#8220;<a href="https://www.perpetuallineup.org/">The Perpetual Line-Up: Unregulated Police Face Recognition in America</a>,&#8221; a year-long investigation that dove deeply into the police use of facial recognition systems in the U.S. The 2016 report examined law enforcement&#8217;s reliance on facial recognition systems and biometric databases on a state level. It argued that regulations are desperately needed to curtail potential abuses and algorithmic failures before the technology inevitably becomes even more commonplace.</p>
<p>Bedoya also isn&#8217;t shy about calling out Big Tech. In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/opinion/silicon-valley-lobbyists-privacy.html">New York Times op-ed a few years ago</a>, he took aim at Silicon Valley companies giving user privacy lip service in public while quietly funneling millions toward lobbyists to undermine consumer privacy. The new FTC nominee singled out Facebook specifically, pointing to the company&#8217;s efforts to undermine the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, a state law that serves as one of the only meaningful checks on invasive privacy practices in the U.S.</p>
<p>Bedoya argued that the tech industry would have an easier time shaping a single, sweeping piece of privacy regulation with its lobbying efforts rather than a flurry of targeted, smaller bills. Antitrust advocates in Congress taking aim at tech today seem<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/09/house-democrats-announce-tech-bills-492703"> to have learned that same lesson as well</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We cannot underestimate the tech sector’s power in Congress and in state legislatures,&#8221; Bedoya wrote. &#8220;If the United States tries to pass broad rules for personal data, that effort may well be co-opted by Silicon Valley, and we’ll miss our best shot at meaningful privacy protections.&#8221;</p>
<p>If confirmed, Bedoya would join <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lina-khan-ftc-confirmed/">Big Tech critic Lina Khan</a>, a recent Biden FTC nominee who now chairs the agency. Khan&#8217;s focus on antitrust and Amazon in particular would dovetail with Bedoya&#8217;s focus on adjacent privacy concerns, making the pair a formidable regulatory presence as the Biden administration seeks to rein in some of the tech industry&#8217;s most damaging excesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s that time again!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s September, which generally means two things: We&#8217;re blasting Earth, Wind, and Fire on repeat, and Apple will announce a new iPhone (or four).</p>
<p>Right on schedule, Apple held a remote event this morning, streaming kinda-sorta-live from its Cupertino campus. Whether you didn&#8217;t have time to watch the entire hour-long stream or just want the highlights, we&#8217;ve got you — as usual, we&#8217;ve boiled the whole thing down to the bullet points.</p>
<h2>New iPads</h2>
<p>Both the standard iPad and the iPad mini have gotten the update treatment — here&#8217;s whats new for each:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2202383" style="width: 1690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202383" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2202383 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-new-ipad-price.jpg" alt="" width="1680" height="945" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-new-ipad-price.jpg 1680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-new-ipad-price.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-new-ipad-price.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-new-ipad-price.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-new-ipad-price.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-new-ipad-price.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-new-ipad-price.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202383" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>

</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/apple-refreshes-ipad-mini-with-a-new-design-5g-and-an-8-3-inch-display/">New iPad mini</a>:</strong></p>

<li>The CPU is 40% faster, while the GPU is 80% faster.</li>
<li>USB-C!</li>
<li>There will be a 5G model.</li>
<li>The back camera has a much-improved 12 MP camera with True Tone flash, and, as with the standard iPad, the front camera is getting 12 MP ultrawide lens and Center Stage support.</li>
<li>It&#8217;ll support the second-gen Apple Pencil.</li>
<li>Starts at $499. Orders start today, shipping next week.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Apple Watch</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2202438" style="width: 1690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202438" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2202438 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-series-7-overview.jpg" alt="" width="1680" height="945" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-series-7-overview.jpg 1680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-series-7-overview.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-series-7-overview.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-series-7-overview.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-series-7-overview.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-series-7-overview.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-watch-series-7-overview.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202438" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Apple</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple kicked off the Watch segment with a few new features coming to iOS 8 (like fall detection for cyclists and better algorithms for detecting calories burned when you&#8217;re on an e-bike) before announcing a new Watch — Series 7, they&#8217;re calling it.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/apple-watch-series-7-arrives-with-a-larger-more-rugged-display/">Apple Watch Series 7</a>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>By reducing the screen&#8217;s borders, they were able to squeeze in a display that is 20% bigger.</li>
<li>To take advantage of that bigger screen, buttons are bigger across the UI.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s got a swipe-style prediction keyboard, for easier text input on the go.</li>
<li>Apple says it&#8217;s got the strongest (most crack-resistant) display to dat, and is the first Apple Watch to be IP6X certified against dust.</li>
<li>An &#8220;updated charging architecture&#8221; and a new USB-C charger allow it to charge 33% faster.</li>
<li>Series 7 will start at $399 and start shipping &#8220;later this fall.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h2>New iPhones</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2202557" style="width: 1230px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202557" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2202557 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/new-iphones.jpg" alt="" width="1220" height="679" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/new-iphones.jpg 1220w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/new-iphones.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/new-iphones.jpg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/new-iphones.jpg?resize=768,427 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/new-iphones.jpg?resize=680,378 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/new-iphones.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1220px) 100vw, 1220px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202557" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Not one, not two, but <em>four</em> new iPhones — iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro max. Faster chips, better cameras, better battery life.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2202470 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg" alt="" width="1680" height="945" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg 1680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px" /></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/this-is-the-iphone-13/">iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini</a>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both run Apple&#8217;s new A15 Bionic chip. It&#8217;s got a six-core CPU (two high-performance cores, four high efficiency), a four-core GPU and big improvements to the neural engine that Apple taps for on-device machine learning.</li>
<li>A &#8220;ceramic shield front,&#8221; which Apple says is tougher than any other smartphone&#8217;s glass.</li>
<li>IP68 water resistance.</li>
<li>28% brighter display.</li>
<li>iPhone 13 comes in at 6.1&#8243;, while iPhone 13 mini will be 5.4&#8243;.</li>
<li>A wild new &#8220;Cinematic&#8221; mode that uses machine learning for tricks like auto-shifting the camera&#8217;s focus when one on-screen speaker looks at someone behind them.</li>
<li>The 64 GB model has finally been retired, with the base models coming with 128 GB of storage.</li>
<li>Apple says the iPhone 13 mini&#8217;s battery life has been improved by an hour and a half, while most iPhone 13 users will get two and half more hours per charge.</li>
<li>iPhone 13 will start at $799, while iPhone 13 mini starts at $699.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/the-iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-features-120hz-display-better-cameras/">iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max</a>:</strong></p>

<li>As rumored, it&#8217;ll get a display that can adjust its refresh rate up to 120 hz for super smooth movement/scrolling.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s got three cameras on the back: a telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom, an ultrawide and a wide angle. Night Mode will now play friendly with all three cameras (including the telephoto lens, which previously didn&#8217;t support it).</li>

</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shortly after today’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/apple-fall-event-2021">virtual conference</a>, Apple announced that the next major version of iOS will be ready for prime time very soon: iPhone users will be able to update to iOS 15 on September 20. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-unveils-ios-15-with-new-features-for-facetime-and-better-notifications/">first unveiled</a> iOS 15 earlier this year at its Worldwide Developers Conference.</p>
<p>The biggest change of iOS 15 is a new Focus mode. In addition to “Do not disturb,” you can configure various modes — you can choose apps and people you want notifications from and change your focus depending on what you’re doing. For instance, you can create a Work mode, a Sleep mode, a Workout mode, etc.</p>
<p>There are many new features across the board, such as a new Weather app, updated maps in Apple Maps, an improved version of FaceTime, and more. Safari also has a brand-new look. At first, it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/apple-tweaks-controversial-ios-15-safari-changes-in-latest-beta/">a bit controversial</a>. Since then, Apple has listened to feedback and improved its new take on Safari.</p>
<p>The new version of iOS also scans your photos for text. Called Live Text, this feature lets you highlight, copy and paste text in photos. It could be a nice accessibility feature as well; iOS is going to leverage that info for Spotlight. You can search for text in your photos directly in Spotlight and it&#8217;ll pull out relevant photos. These features are handled on-device directly.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to update to iOS 15 if you have an iPhone 6s and later, any model of iPhone SE or the most recent iPod touch model. It’ll be available as a free download.</p>
<p>For users running the iOS 15 beta, the release candidate is rolling out now, ahead of Monday&#8217;s public launch.</p>
<p>If you like your iPhone the way it is, Apple has also said that you don’t have to update to iOS 15. For the foreseeable future, the company will still update iOS 14 with security patches.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has announced its new lineup of phones at its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/apple-fall-event-2021">virtual conference</a>. In addition to the <a title="This is the iPhone 13" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/this-is-the-iphone-13/">regular iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini</a>, the company has two Pro models with some premium features that you won’t find in the regular iPhone 13.</p>
<p>Of course, the Pro models are also more expensive. For reference, the iPhone 13 Mini starts at $699 and the iPhone 13 starts at $799. As for the Pro models, the iPhone 13 Pro starts at $999 and the iPhone 13 Pro Max starts at $1,099. The iPhone 13 Pro has a 6.1-inch display while the iPhone 13 Pro Max has a 6.7-inch display.</p>
<p>“Our Pro lineup pushes the limits with our most advanced technologies for users who want the very best iPhone,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said.</p>
<p>Here’s what you’ll get if you decide to buy the iPhone 13 Pro instead of the iPhone 13. The design is slightly different, as the Pro models get shiny stainless steel bands around the case of the phone. There are also three stainless steel rings around the three camera sensors. The back of the device is made of matte glass.</p>
<p>There are three different camera sensors at the back of the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max instead of two. In addition to the ultra-wide and wide camera, you get a 3x camera. It seems like the wide and ultra wide cameras aren’t identical in the Pro models versus the regular models either.</p>
<p>Last year, only the iPhone 12 Pro Max featured sensor shift optical image stabilization. This time, the entire iPhone 13 lineup gets sensor shift optical image stabilization. Basically, the regular iPhone 13 is getting many of the advanced camera features that was restricted to Pro models.</p>
<p>In particular, there’s a new cinematic mode with rack focus. You can track a subject and lock focus on that subject in real time. Cinematic mode shoots in Dolby Vision HDR. Later this year, you&#8217;ll be able to shoot ProRes videos with the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So here’s what you get in the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro Max:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 77mm telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom.</li>
<li>An ultra-wide camera with ƒ/1.8 aperture and &#8220;up to 92% improvement in low-light performance,&#8221; according to Apple.</li>
<li>A wide camera with ƒ/1.5 aperture and &#8220;up to 2.2x improvement in low-light performance,&#8221; according to Apple.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first time, you can use Night mode with all three cameras. This way, you don’t have to remember which camera will give you the best result.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2202548" style="width: 1690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202548" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2202548 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-pro-overview.jpg" alt="" width="1680" height="945" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-pro-overview.jpg 1680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-pro-overview.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-pro-overview.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-pro-overview.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-pro-overview.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-pro-overview.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-pro-overview.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202548" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max come with a Pro Motion display with P3 color range. Like on high-end iPad models, these iPhone models have an adaptive framerate. If you need it, your iPhone display can run at 120Hz. If you’re watching a movie, the iPhone can use a lower framerate to save battery life.</p>
<p>As the iPhone 13 Max is the largest smartphone in the lineup, you get more battery life. Apple promises a battery that lasts 2.5 hours longer for the iPhone 13 Pro Max compared to the iPhone 12 Pro Max.</p>
<p>Like the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini, the Pro models come with Apple’s A15 Bionic chip. It’s a 5-mm design with 15 billion transistors. There are two high-performance cores and four energy-efficient cores. You should get nearly the same performances across the lineup, but there&#8217;s a new 5-core GPU in the Pro lineup.</p>
<p>Preorders start on Friday and they will be available on September 24. There are four models, with 128GB, 256GB, 512GB or 1TB of storage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alongside the introduction of the new iPhone 13, Apple introduced a few new accessories to complement its upgraded flagship devices. One of the more interesting additions in the accessories in the lineup is a new MagSafe wallet that works with Apple &#8220;Find My&#8221; service. That means if you accidentally lose your wallet when it becomes unattached from your iPhone, you can launch the Find My app to locate it as you can with other Apple devices or items attached to your Apple AirTags.</p>
<p>In this case, the MagSafe leather wallet will notify users of the last known location where the wallet was separated from the phone. It will not, however, provide real-time tracking.</p>
<p>This is a small, but clever addition for those who use Apple&#8217;s MagSafe products. The technology<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/apple-launches-new-ecosystem-of-accessories-and-wireless-chargers-with-magsafe/"> was first introduced last fall</a> to allow iPhone users to attach all sorts of products to the back of their iPhone, like cases, wallets, tripods and car mounts, as well as Apple&#8217;s own accessories for charging, like the MagSafe battery pack &#8212; which is coming to iPhone 13. MagSafe works by layering on a magnetometer, a copper-graphite shield, two shields, multiple layers of magnets, an NFC antenna and more on the back of the iPhone, to make the accessories attach.</p>
<p>But it had not yet combined the power of MagSafe with the capabilities of &#8220;Find My&#8221; until now.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2202518" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202518" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2202518" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-14-at-1.54.49-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="376" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-14-at-1.54.49-PM.jpg 1085w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-14-at-1.54.49-PM.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-14-at-1.54.49-PM.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-14-at-1.54.49-PM.jpg?resize=768,425 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-14-at-1.54.49-PM.jpg?resize=680,376 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-14-at-1.54.49-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202518" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Along with the launch of the &#8220;Find My&#8221;-connected wallet, aka the iPhone Leather Wallet with MagSafe, the company is also introducing a range of new cases and colors for iPhone, designed to work with MagSafe. This includes MagSafe cases in leather and silicone, as well as a clear case with MagSafe. All are available to order today.</p>

<p>Currently, the $9.99/month service is available in six countries, like the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. But at its press event today, Apple announced that the service will become available in many more countries this fall, including Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, France, Italy, Russia and more. Content will be subtitled in six languages.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Apple also announced that it will add new Pilates and guided meditation content for Fitness+ subscribers starting in the fall. Every day, Fitness+ will add guided meditations that focus on gratitude, mindfulness and calming. These experiences will be available in both video and audio form, and could pose competition to apps like Headspace and Calm.</p>
<p>Also in the fall, Fitness+ will roll out Group Workouts, powered by Share Play. This enables subscribers to exercise alongside their friends via FaceTime or a group message thread, no matter where they are in the world. Up to 32 people can exercise together at once.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Are founders in fundraising mode short-sighted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/is-it-so-bad-to-take-money-from-chinese-venture-funds/">when it comes to working with Chinese venture funds</a>?</p>
<p>Runa Capital&#8217;s Asia business development manager Denis Kalinin studied data from iTjuzi, a database of Chinese venture capitalists, and found:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;Chinese funds invested around $250 billion in 2020 (three times higher than the figure reported in Crunchbase). This figure puts Chinese VC investments only 30% lower than investments by U.S. funds, but three times that of U.K. funds and 12.5 times more than German funds.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The pandemic, geopolitical tensions and other factors led many Chinese venture funds to pare back their international investments, but that&#8217;s largely &#8220;because during COVID, China’s economy recovered much faster than other countries’,&#8221; writes Kalinin.</p>
<p>His analysis covers multiple angles: Chinese investments in Europe are catching up with those in Asia and the United States, half of China&#8217;s top cross-border investors are CVCs, and investors are particularly interested in fintech, deep tech and digital health at the moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chinese investors can bring value to foreign startups, but you need to study their expertise and how it can be useful for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every founder who launches an enterprise software startup has to figure out the &#8220;right&#8221; pricing model for their products.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a consequential decision: Per-seat licenses are easy to manage, but what if customers prefer a concurrent licensing model?</p>
<p>&#8220;Early pricing discussions should center around the buyer’s perspective and the value the product creates for them,&#8221; says Ridge Ventures partner Yousuf Khan, who previously worked as a CIO.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he notes, &#8220;self-evaluation is hard, especially when you’re asking someone else to pay you for something you’ve created.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The rumors were right. The centerpiece of today&#8217;s big Apple event is the latest iPhone. The latest device lands less than a year after its predecessor, now that things have settled down somewhat on the supply chain side for Apple. Last year&#8217;s iPhone 12 was a massive seller, bucking the trend of stagnating smartphones sales, in part due to a bottleneck in sales from the unplanned delay, but also because it finally brought 5G connectivity to Apple&#8217;s mobile line.</p>

<p>Lucky number iPhone 13 (no skipping for superstition&#8217;s sake, mind) features a familiar design. The front notch has finally been shrunken &#8212; now 20% smaller than its predecessor &#8212; while the rear-facing camera system has also gotten a redesign. The screen is now 28% brighter Super Retina XDR display on both the iPhone 13 and 13 mini at 1200 nits.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2202470" style="width: 1690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202470" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2202470 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg" alt="" width="1680" height="945" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg 1680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202470" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Apple</p></div></p>
<p>The 13 sports a 6.1-inch screen, while the mini&#8217;s is 5.4 inches &#8212; same as last year. The display is protected by a ceramic shield coating, and the handset rates IP68 dust/waterproofing.</p>
<p>The phone is powered by Apple’s new A15 Bionic chip, built with a 5nm processor. The CPU is 6-core that the company is calling “the fastest CPU on any smartphone.” The new 4-core GPU, meanwhile, brings advanced graphics to the handset.</p>

<p>The rear dual-camera system features a 12MP wide-angle camera that’s capable of pulling in up to 47% more light. The new Cinematic Mode, meanwhile, brings rack focus-style shooting capable of adjusting the focus on subjects, using machine learning (you can also tap to adjust manual or switch between subjects). All models in the iPhone 13 also support Night Mode shooting, as well as the ProRes codec for a more pro-level of video.</p>

<p>Following last year&#8217;s introduction of 5G, the company has added more advanced antennae. Through the combination of a larger battery and energy saving software, the company says it&#8217;s been able to eke out an additional 2.5 hours of life on the 13 and 1.5 hours on the mini.</p>

<p>iPhone 13 mini starts at $699, while the 13 starts at $799. It comes in b<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">lack, gold, silver and a new, lighter blue. Storage options start at</span>128GB.</p>

<p>Not a massive update, all told &#8212; Apple seemingly saved a lot of that for the iPhone 13 Pro, which brings a 120Hz display (a feature that was rumored across the line) and a number of key updates to the imaging system. The Pro and Pro Max feature similar battery upgrades as the 13. The devices go up for preorder on September 17 and will be available at retail locations on September 24.</p>
<p>The company is also launching a number of accessories, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/apples-new-magsafe-wallet-can-be-located-with-the-find-my-app-if-it-goes-missing/">a new MagSafe Wallet</a> that works with the Find My feature.</p>

		<a href="https://www.ericschwartzman.com/about/">Eric Schwartzman</a> is a digital marketing consultant with structured programs for helping individuals and organizations pivot to digital marketing and is the author of “<a href="https://www.ericschwartzman.com/the-digital-pivot-book/">The Digital Pivot: Secrets of Online Marketing</a>.”	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">A U.S. federal judge last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">struck down</a> Apple rules restricting app developers from selling directly to customers outside the App Store.</p>
<p>Apple’s stock <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-10/apple-erases-nearly-85-billion-in-value-after-app-store-ruling">fell 3%</a> on the news, which is being regarded as a win for small and midsize app developers because they’ll be able to build direct billing relationships with their customers. But Apple is just one of many Big Tech companies that dominate their sector.</p>
<p>The larger issue is how this development will impact Amazon, Facebook, Grubhub and other tech giants with online marketplaces that use draconian terms of service to keep their resellers subservient. The skirmish between Apple and small and midsize app developers is just a smaller battle in a much larger war.</p>
<p>App makers pay up to 30% on every sale they make on the Apple App Store. Resellers on Amazon pay a monthly subscription fee, a sales commission of 8% to 15%, fulfillment fees and other miscellaneous charges. Grubhub charges restaurants 15% of every order, a credit card processing fee, an order processing fee and a 10% delivery commission.</p>
<p>Like app developers, online resellers and social media influencers are all falling for the same big lie: that they can build a sustainable business with healthy margins on someone else’s platform. The reality is the App Store, online marketplaces and even social networks that dominate their sectors have the unilateral power to selectively deplatform and squeeze their users, and there’s not much anyone can do about it.</p>
<p>Healthy competition exists inside the App Store and among marketplace resellers and aspiring social media influencers. But no one seems to be talking about the real elephants in the room, which are the social networks and online marketplace providers themselves. In some respects, they’ve become almost like digital dictators with complete control over their territories.</p>
<p>It’s something every small and midsize business that gets excited about some new online service catering to their industry should be aware of because it directly impacts their ability to grow a stable business. The federal judge’s decision suggests the real goal in digital business is a direct billing relationship with the end user.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the internet, those who are able to lead a horse to water and make them drink — outside the walled gardens of digital marketplace operators like Uber, Airbnb and Udemy — are the true contenders. In content and e-commerce, this is what most small and midsize companies don’t realize. Your own website or <em>owned medi</em>a, at a top-level domain that you control, is the only unfettered way to sell direct to end users.</p>
<p>Mobile app makers on Apple’s App Store, resellers on Amazon and aspiring content creators on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok are all subject to the absolute control of digital titans who are free to govern by their own rules with unchecked power.</p>
<p>For access to online marketplaces and social networks, we got a raw deal. We’re basically plowing their fields like digital sharecroppers. Resellers on Amazon are forced to split their harvest with a landlord who takes a gross percentage with no caps. Amassing followers on TikTok is building an audience that’s locked inside their venue.</p>
<p>These tech giants — all former startups that built their audiences from scratch — are free to impose and selectively enforce oppressive rules. If you’re a small fry, they can prohibit you from asking for your customer’s email address and deplatform you for skimming, but look the other way when Spotify and The New York Times do the same thing. Both were already selling direct and through the App Store prior to Friday’s ruling.</p>
<p>How is that competitive? Even after the ruling, Big Tech still gets to decide who they let violate their terms of service and who they deplatform. It’s not just their audience. It’s their universe, their governance, their rules and their enforcement.</p>
<p>In the 1948 court case United States v. Paramount Pictures, the Supreme Court ruled that film studios couldn’t own their own theaters because that meant they could exclusively control what movies were screened. They stifled competition by controlling what films made it to the marquee, so SCOTUS broke them up.</p>
<p>Today, social networks control what gets seen on their platforms, and with the push of a button, they can give the hook to whoever they want, whenever they want. The big challenge that the internet poses to capitalism is that the network effect is fundamentally anti-competitive. Winner-take-all markets dominated by tech giants look more like government-controlled than free-market economies.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the web gives us access to a global marketplace of buyers and sellers. On the other, a few major providers control the services that most people use to do business, because they don’t have the knowledge or resources to stand up a competitive website. But unless you have your own domain and good search visibility, you’re always in danger of being deplatformed and losing access to your customers or audience members with no practical recourse.</p>
<p>The network effect is such that once an online marketplace becomes dominant, it neutralizes the competitive market, because everyone gravitates to the dominant service to get the best deal. There’s an inherent conflict between the goals of a winner-takes-all tech company and the goals of a free market.</p>
<p>Dominant online marketplaces are only competitive for users. Meanwhile, marketplace providers operate with impunity. If they decide they want to use half-baked AI or offshore contractors to police their terms of service and shore up false positives, there’s no practical way for users to contest. How can Facebook possibly govern nearly 3 billion users judiciously with around 60,000 employees? As we’ve seen, it can’t.</p>
<p>For app makers, online resellers and creators, the only smart option is open source on the open web. Instead of relying on someone else’s audience (or software for that matter), you own your online destination powered by software like WordPress or Discord, and you never have to worry about getting squeezed when the founders go public or their platform gets bought by profit-hungry investment bankers. Only then can you protect your profit margins. And only then are the terms of service the laws of the land.</p>
<p>Politics aside, as former President Donald Trump’s deplatforming demonstrated, if you get kicked off Facebook and Twitter, there’s really nowhere else to go. If they want you out, it’s game over. It’s no coincidence Trump lost his Facebook and Twitter accounts on the same day the Republicans lost the Senate. If the GOP takes back the Senate, watch Trump get his social media accounts back. Social networks ward off regulators by appeasing the legislative majority.</p>
<p>So don’t get too excited about the new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/info">Amazon Influencer Program</a>. If you want to build a sustainable digital business, you need an owned media presence powered by software that doesn’t rake commissions, have access to your customer contact information and has an audience that can’t be commandeered with an algorithm tweak.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple Watch users who ride bikes will get a handful of new features designed just for them. Announced during today&#8217;s Apple iPhone press event, the company says that Apple Watch will now begin to detect when users begin a bike ride to remind you to start a workout. And similar to other workouts, Apple Watch will also automatically pause and resume as you take breaks during your ride. And, perhaps most importantly, it will gain a new fall-detection feature, as well.</p>
<p>While Apple Watch can <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208944">already detect a fall on Series 4 or later devices</a>, allowing users to contact emergency services if needed, Apple says that it will now add fall detection to cycling. In this case, it&#8217;s able to sense the unique motion and impact that occurs when someone falls when riding a bike &#8212; which is a different type of movement than someone who falls when standing.</p>

<p>For indoor cyclists such as Peleton enthusiasts, Apple Watch will also now better support e-bikes with an improved workout algorithm that more accurately calculates calories burned.</p>
<p>These features will join others Apple has added, like the reimagined Breathe app, new watch faces and updates to Messages and Photos that roll out with watchOS 8. Apple additionally announced a new Watch product, as well, with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/apple-watch-series-7-arrives-with-a-larger-more-rugged-display/">Apple Watch Series 7,</a> offering a larger Retina display, interface redesigns, new watch faces and colors, better charging and more.</p>
<p>Related to workouts, Apple also announced an update to its subscription service, Fitness+, which will be available in 15 new countries in addition to the original six, and which is adding Pilates workouts, guided meditations and workouts designed for skiers and snowboarders.</p>
