										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As financial troubles escalate at Danke, China&#8217;s authorities are stepping in to hold the once-promising apartment rental and sharing company accountable.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, landlords who did not receive payments from Danke, which functions as a sublessor, began to evict tenants. After a flurry of local reports exposing the firm&#8217;s massive debt, which is reported to be as high as<a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-12-07/cover-story-how-chinese-apartment-rental-giants-business-fell-apart-101636345.html"> $520 million</a>, a district court in Shanghai <a href="http://zxgk.court.gov.cn/shixin/">placed</a> Ziwutong Beijing Asset Management, the parent organization behind Danke, on the country&#8217;s &#8220;social credit&#8221; blacklist.</p>
<p>The Chinese government&#8217;s social credit system is a <a href="https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/china-social-credit-score/">set of mechanisms</a> aimed at improving the enforcement of existing laws and offenders can face restrictions in their daily activity. In Danke&#8217;s case, founder and chief executive officer Gao Jing has been barred from &#8220;heavy spending,&#8221; which includes everything from flying first-class, taking a high-speed train, buying property, going on vacation, to enrolling children in &#8220;expensive&#8221; private schools, according to a <a href="https://www.tianyancha.com/restrict/detail/vmz777e1b5c68354b0d3fd1d6la97f28?cgid=80725858&amp;type=zhixinginfo_restrict">court notice</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The move came after a senior judge from China&#8217;s Supreme People&#8217;s Court <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/2020-12/04/c_1126823099.htm">told the press</a> that Danke was under investigation by relevant authorities over its cash-flow problems.</p>
<p>Danke, founded in 2015 and backed by high-profile investors like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/danke-raise-500-million/">Ant Financial, Tiger Global</a>, and LinkedIn&#8217;s former China head Derek Shen, pledged to make urban housing affordable and pleasant for China&#8217;s white-collar workers. The catch is it&#8217;s advancing through aggressive debt-fueled expansion.</p>
<p>Instead of the traditional rental model, Danke relies on an elaborate financing scheme to maintain cash flows. Tenants are offered price incentives to pay upfront for a year and induced to cover the sums by taking out loans, which are provided by Danke&#8217;s partner banks. Renters who refuse to sign up for the loans are asked to pay more.</p>
<p>With capital funded by the loans, Danke then pays the homeowners &#8212; but only on a monthly or quarterly basis. This gives the startup much financial flexibility to rent from landlords and spend on renovating apartments, which are then sublet to tenants at a markup.</p>
<p>Danke&#8217;s model epitomizes the promises of internet platforms or so-called sharing economy &#8212; light asset, rapid scaling, but it also creates enormous risks for the suppliers and consumers it vows to serve. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, China&#8217;s rental market cooled, putting stress on Danke&#8217;s funding vehicle.</p>
<p>When TechCrunch spoke to Danke&#8217;s angel investor and chairman Derek Shen last year about the firm&#8217;s financial risks, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/danke-raise-500-million/">he had this to say</a>: &#8220;There’s nothing wrong with the financial instrument itself. The real issue is when the housing operator struggles to repay, so the key is to make sure the business is well-functioning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is needed is stricter market supervision to prevent such cases from recurring,&#8221; said an <a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202011/25/WS5fbd9096a31024ad0ba9632a.html">opinion piece</a> published in state-backed paper China Daily. &#8220;The involvement of banks and loans have made the risks even higher. Given how unsustainable Danke&#8217;s business model is, it is time financial supervision departments consider making stricter financial rules forbidding such risky practices.&#8221;</p>
<p>Listed in New York, Danke saw its shares plunge to $2 last month from a high of $13.5 when it went public in January. Year to date the company has only released its Q1 earnings report, which recorded a net loss of $174.3 million.</p>
<p>The financial turmoil also puts <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/webank" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="webank">WeBank, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Danke&#8217;s major partner bank, under the spotlight for its participation in a highly leveraged rental business in return for handsome interests. The Tencent-backed internet bank <a href="https://weibo.com/5476981955/JwU885TA5?from=page_1006065476981955_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime&amp;type=comment#_rnd1607516313259">announced</a> on social media that it would transfer loan obligations from tenants to Danke, which has been subsidizing renters&#8217; loan interests to WeBank already. In the <a href="file:///Users/ritaliao/Downloads/DNK%201Q20%20Earnings%20Release_20200610_vFinal.pdf">three months ended March</a>, Danke paid a total of $7.9 million in interests related to &#8220;rent financing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danke cannot be immediately reached for comment on the story.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">EU lawmakers have just unveiled a wide-ranging <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2326">counter terrorism agenda</a> as they set out plans to beef up regional security.</p>
<p>The plan touches on some key tech topics &#8212; the most keenly watched of which is encryption.</p>
<p>Here, concerns have been mounting that the bloc could be moving toward legislating against end-to-end encryption &#8212; in response to pressure from some Member States over law enforcement and security services&#8217; access to encrypted data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the same time such pressure isn&#8217;t <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/24/encryption-under-fire-in-europe-as-france-and-germany-call-for-decrypt-law/">exactly new</a>. Albeit, the rule of crypto wars history is the access issue must roll around afresh again and again. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/whats-all-this-about-europe-wanting-crypto-backdoors/">last month</a> a <a href="https://files.orf.at/vietnam2/files/fm4/202045/783284_fh_st12143-re01en20_783284.pdf">draft resolution</a> from the Council of the European Union triggered a fresh wave of anxiety that an EU ban on e2e encryption might be in the works.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s Commission agenda is unlikely to lay such fears to rest entirely.</p>
<p>Perhaps mostly for its tortured language &#8212; with <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_2325">oxymoronical talk</a> of &#8216;improved access&#8217; to encrypted information in a text that&#8217;s simultaneously peppered with caveats about &#8220;respecting the right to privacy&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the Commission answers its own impossible question [emphasis its]:</p>
<blockquote><p>Encryption technology is one of the main building blocks in setting up and maintaining the Digital Single Market and in safeguarding fundamental rights, privacy and data protection of citizens. However, when used for criminal purposes, it masks the identity of criminals and hides the content of their communications. Today, a substantial part of investigations against all forms of crime and terrorism involve encrypted information. The Commission will work with Member States to <strong>identify possible legal, operational, and technical solutions for lawful access</strong> and promote an approach which both maintains the effectiveness of encryption in protecting privacy and security of communications, while providing an effective response to crime and terrorism.</p></blockquote>
<p>Talk of EU lawmakers helping in a search for possible &#8220;technical solutions&#8221; for &#8220;lawful access&#8221; to encrypted data probably won&#8217;t reassure those worried the EU is headed on a dangerous path toward mandatory backdoors.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s worth emphasizing that &#8216;lawful access&#8217; under EU law has been shown time and again to mean <em>targeted</em> access. (To wit: In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/europes-top-court-confirms-no-mass-surveillance-without-legal-limits/">October</a> the CJEU made it clear that national security concerns do not exclude EU Member States from the need to comply with general legal principles &#8212; such as proportionality and respect for fundamental rights to privacy, data protection and freedom of expression.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="txHmBL6Cez"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/europes-top-court-confirms-no-mass-surveillance-without-legal-limits/">Europe&#8217;s top court confirms no mass surveillance without limits</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe&#8217;s top court confirms no mass surveillance without limits&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/europes-top-court-confirms-no-mass-surveillance-without-legal-limits/embed/#?secret=txHmBL6Cez" data-secret="txHmBL6Cez" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Simply put: There&#8217;s no such thing as a targeted backdoor.</p>
<p>A backdoor is naturally a bulk intervention. It&#8217;s inherently disproportionate. There&#8217;s no one-time, single-user &#8216;backdoor&#8217;*. At that point you&#8217;re basically talking about legally sanctioned hacking of a target suspect. Which is a whole other kettle of security fish.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting the Commission agenda commits EU lawmakers to maintaining &#8220;the effectiveness of encryption in protecting privacy and security of communications&#8221;.</p>
<p>Though, again, their tortuous need to display balance over seemingly opposing objectives, by giving a simultaneously pledge of &#8220;providing an effective response to crime and terrorism&#8221;, might slightly haze the quality of the reassurance. Except of course an effective response to crime and terrorism can be achieved in myriad ways &#8212; proper resourcing and training of agents, say, better knowledge sharing across EU borders and so on &#8212; all of which have nothing at all to do with breaking encryption.</p>
<p>And, indeed, the Commission&#8217;s agenda offers plenty such (non-encryption breaking) ideas for beefing up the bloc&#8217;s counter terrorism response &#8212; such as an &#8220;EU police cooperation code&#8221; to enhance cooperation between law enforcement authorities; strengthening Europol; and stepping up engagement with international organizations, to name a few.</p>
<p>Encryption is often a handy scapegoat for governments&#8217; security failures. The Commission&#8217;s agenda looks alive to that risk &#8212; just without wanting to give a too-direct slap-down to any culpable Member States. Ergo &#8216;we&#8217;ll work to identify possibilities&#8217; looks like a diplomatically way of saying &#8216;we won&#8217;t achieve the impossible&#8217;.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the tech front, the Commission agenda is very keen that its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/12/europe-to-push-for-one-hour-takedown-law-for-terrorist-content/">2018 legislative proposal</a> to accelerate terrorism content takedowns is swiftly taken up by the other EU institutions so it can start being applied to platforms.</p>
<p>The proposal has attracted some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/one-hour-terrorist-takedowns-backed-by-eu-parliaments-civil-liberties-committee/">controversy and concern</a> &#8212; such as over its impact on smaller websites, and how terrorism content will be defined.</p>
<p>&#8220;To counter the spread of extremist ideologies online, it is important that the European Parliament and the Council adopt the rules on removing terrorist content online as a matter of urgency,&#8221; the Commission writes on this.</p>
<p>The EU Internet Forum will be tasked with developing &#8220;guidance on moderation for publicly available content for extremist material online&#8221;, it adds.</p>
<p>*Setting aside theoretical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOBUS">NOBUS</a> security vulnerabilities</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Quantum computing startup <a href="https://ionq.com/">IonQ</a> today announced its road map for the next few years &#8212; following a similar <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/ibm-publishes-its-quantum-roadmap-says-it-will-have-a-1000-qubit-machine-in-2023/">move from IBM in September</a> &#8212; and it&#8217;s quite ambitious, to say the least.</p>
<p>At our Disrupt event earlier this year, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ionq-inc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ionq-inc">IonQ <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO and president Peter Chapman <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/quantum-startup-ceo-suggests-we-are-only-five-years-away-from-a-quantum-desktop-computer/">suggested</a> that we were only five years away from having desktop quantum computers. That&#8217;s not something you&#8217;ll likely hear from the company&#8217;s competitors &#8212; who also often use a very different kind of quantum technology &#8212; but IonQ now says that it will be able to sell modular, rack-mounted quantum computers for the data center in 2023 and that by 2025, its systems will be powerful enough to achieve broad quantum advantage across a wide variety of use cases.</p>
<p>In an interview ahead of today&#8217;s announcement, Chapman showed me a prototype of the hardware the company is working on for 2021, which fits on a workbench. The actual quantum chip is currently the size of a half-dollar and the company is now working on essentially putting the core of its technology on a single chip, with all of the optics that make its system work integrated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2084610" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IonQ-roadmap-graph.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084610" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2084610" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IonQ-roadmap-graph.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="462" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IonQ-roadmap-graph.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IonQ-roadmap-graph.jpg?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IonQ-roadmap-graph.jpg?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IonQ-roadmap-graph.jpg?resize=768,346 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IonQ-roadmap-graph.jpg?resize=680,307 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IonQ-roadmap-graph.jpg?resize=1536,693 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IonQ-roadmap-graph.jpg?resize=2048,924 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IonQ-roadmap-graph.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2084610" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> IonQ</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the goal,&#8221; he said about the chip. &#8220;As soon as you get to 2023, then you get to go to scale in a different way, which is, I just tell somebody in Taiwan to start and give me 10,000 of those things. And you get to scale through manufacturing, as well. There&#8217;s nothing quantum in any of the things that in any of the hardware we&#8217;re doing,&#8221; he said, though IonQ co-founder and chief scientist Chris Monroe quickly jumped in and noted that that&#8217;s true, &#8220;except for the atoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s an important point, because thanks to betting on trapped ion quantum computing as the core technology for its machines, IonQ doesn&#8217;t have to contend with the low-temperatures that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ibm" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ibm">IBM <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and others need to run their machines. Some sceptics have argued that IonQ&#8217;s technology will be hard to scale, but that&#8217;s something Chapman and Monroe easily dismiss, and IonQ&#8217;s new road map points at systems with thousands of algorithmic qubits (which are made out of a factor of 10 or 20 more physical qubits for handling error corrections) by 2028.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as you hit about 40 qubits &#8212; algorithmic qubits &#8212; in the beginning of 2024, then you&#8217;ll start to see quantum advantage probably in machine learning,&#8221; Chapman explained. &#8220;And then, I think it&#8217;s pretty well accepted that at 72 qubits is roughly when you start to do quantum advantage fairly broadly. So that would be in 2025. When you start to get into 2027, you&#8217;re now getting into hundreds of qubits if not early 1000s of qubits in [2028]. And now you&#8217;re starting to get into full-scale fault tolerance.&#8221;</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll see slow growth in the number of additional algorithmic qubits &#8212; which is what IonQ calls a qubit that can be used in running a quantum algorithm. Others in the industry tend to talk about &#8220;logical qubits,&#8221; but IonQ&#8217;s definition is slightly different.</p>
<p>Talking about how to compare different quantum systems, Chapman noted that &#8220;fidelity is not good enough.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t matter if you have 72 or 72 million qubits, he said, if only three of those are usable. &#8220;When you see a road map that says, &#8216;I&#8217;m going to have umpteen 1000 qubits, it&#8217;s kind of like, &#8216;I don&#8217;t care, right?&#8217; On our side, since we&#8217;re using individual atoms, I could show you a little vial of gas and say, &#8216;look, I&#8217;ve got a trillion qubits, all ready to be do computation!&#8217; But they&#8217;re not particularly useful. So what we tried to do in the road map, was to talk about useful qubits.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also argued that quantum volume, a measurement championed by IBM and others in the quantum ecosystem, isn&#8217;t particularly useful because at some point, the numbers just get far too high.&#8221; But essentially, IonQ is still using quantum volume, but it defines its algorithmic qubits as the <img class="_3vyrn" src="https://www4f.wolframalpha.com/Calculate/MSP/MSP44471960683cb1a1gid6000035gfa03i8480a62b?MSPStoreType=image/gif&amp;s=12" alt="log(2, x)" /> of the quantum volume of a given system.</p>
<p>Once IonQ is able to get to 32 of these algorithmic qubits &#8212; its current systems have 22 &#8212; it&#8217;ll be able to achieve a quantum volume of 4.2 billion instead of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/ionq-claims-it-has-built-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-yet/">4 million it claims for its current system</a>.</p>
<p>As Monroe noted, the company&#8217;s definition of algorithmic qubits also takes variable error correction into account. Error correction remains a major research area in quantum computing, but for the time being, IonQ argues that its ability to keep gate fidelity high means it doesn&#8217;t yet have to worry about it and it has already demonstrated the first fault-tolerant error-corrected operations with an overhead of 13:1.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because our native errors are so low, we don&#8217;t need to do error correction today, with these 22 algorithmic qubits. But to get that [99.99%] of fidelity, we&#8217;re going to leak in a little bit of error correction &#8212; and we can sort of do it on the fly. It&#8217;s almost like a little bit of an adjustment. How much error correction do you want? It&#8217;s not all or nothing,&#8221; Monroe explained.</p>
<p>IonQ isn&#8217;t afraid to say that it believes that &#8220;other technologies, because of their poor gate fidelity and qubit connectivity, might need 1,000, 10,000 or even 1,000,000 qubits to create a single error-corrected qubit.&#8221;</p>
<p>To put all of this into practice, IonQ today launched an Algorithmic <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/qubit" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="qubit">Qubit <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Calculator that it argues will make it easier to compare system.</p>
<p>For the near future, IonQ expects to use a 16:1 overhead for error correction &#8212; that is, it expects to use 16 physical qubits to create a high-fidelity algorithmic qubit. Once it hits about 1,000 logical qubits, it expects to use a 32:1 overhead. &#8220;As you add qubits, you need to increase your fidelity,&#8221; Chapman explained, and so for its 1,000-qubit machine in 2028, IonQ will need to control 32,000 physical qubits.</p>
<p>IonQ has long argued that scaling its technology doesn&#8217;t necessitate any technological breakthroughs. And indeed, the company argues that by packing a lot of its technology on a single chip, its system will become more stable by default (noise, after all, is the archenemy of qubits), in part because the laser beams won&#8217;t have to travel very far.</p>
<p>Chapman, who has never been afraid to push for a bit of publicity, even noted that the company wants to fly one of its quantum computers in a small plane one of these days to show how stable it is. It&#8217;s worth noting, though, that IonQ is far more bullish about scaling up its systems in the short term than any of its competitors. Monroe acknowledged as much, but argues that it&#8217;s basic physics at this point.</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially in the solid-state platforms, they&#8217;re doing wonderful physics,&#8221; Monroe said. &#8220;They&#8217;re making a little bit of progress every year, but a roadmap in 10 years, based on a solid-state qubit, relies on breakthroughs in material science. And maybe they&#8217;ll get there, it&#8217;s not clear. But, you know, the physics of the atom is all sewn up and we&#8217;re very confident on the engineering path forward because it&#8217;s engineering based on proven protocols and proven devices.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have a manufacturing problem. You want a million qubits? No problem. That&#8217;s easy,&#8221; Chapman quipped.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Creating a resume is one of the most frustrating parts of job hunting. Though ubiquitous on social media, videos are still rare on job platforms, even though it&#8217;s difficult to capture your personality in a resume. Sydney, Australia-based <a href="https://www.myinterview.com/">myInterview</a> wants to turn videos into an integral part of recruitment, with a platform that allows candidates to upload video responses to questions. Recruiters also have the option of using myInterview Intelligence, or machine learning-based tools that create shortlists for competitive openings.</p>
<p>The startup announced today that it has raised a $5 million seed round led by Israeli early-stage venture firm Aleph, with participation from returning investors Entrée Capital and SeedIL Ventures. MyInterview previously raised $1.6 million in pre-seed funding, including from Cliff Rosenberg, the former managing director of LinkedIn’s Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand operations.</p>
<p>MyInterview has been used by more than 2,000 companies, mostly in the United States and United Kingdom. Some of its best-known clients include online supermarket Ocado, retailer B&amp;M and P&amp;O Ferries. It has also worked with Facebook Career Connections and has a strategic partnership with reed.co.uk, the largest job search site in the U.K. So far, more than two million candidates have used myInterview, and the company’s goal is to reach tens of millions of job seekers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funding will be used to expand its sales, product and research and development teams.</p>
<p>MyInterview was founded in 2016 by Guy Abelsohn and Ben Gillman, after they became frustrated by how difficult it was to make their resumes stand out while job hunting. MyInterview started out by offering products for companies to integrate into their existing recruitment systems, but launched a standalone platform at the beginning of 2019, well before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We already had very nice traction over 2019 and into the beginning of 2020,&#8221; Gillman told TechCrunch. &#8220;I like to say that the success we’ve been seeing is independent of COVID, but there’s definitely been an impact in people who are still hiring needing to adopt technology such as myInterview in order to do that more effectively and efficiently with social distancing and the number of applicants coming through because of the market, and the more general adoption of video across the space.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CmJbQZjHEw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/what-recruiters-are-saying-about-the-tech-job-market-right-now/">What recruiters are saying about the tech job market right now</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What recruiters are saying about the tech job market right now&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/what-recruiters-are-saying-about-the-tech-job-market-right-now/embed/#?secret=CmJbQZjHEw" data-secret="CmJbQZjHEw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Gillman said myInterview’s platform can be used to fill almost any kind of job, but it’s generally used for roles, like entry-level positions, that can get hundreds to thousands of applications.</p>
<p>To use myInterview, companies set up a portal with a list of questions and prompts for applicants to answer on video. Applicants have the option of playing back and re-recording their responses several times before they hit submit. Once submitted, myInterview generates a transcript with tags for recruiters to sort through.</p>
<p>Other startups that have recently raised funding to integrate video into the recruitment process <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/23/the-robot-recruiter-is-coming-vcvs-ai-will-read-your-face-in-a-job-interview/">include VCV.AI</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/jobufo/">JobUFO</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/willo-a-freemium-video-interview-saas-scores-320k-during-the-remote-work-boom/">Willo</a>.</p>
<p>One of the main ways myInterview competes with its rival is myInterview Intelligence. If a recruiter uses myInterview Intelligence, the platform analyzes responses for key words, phrases and tone.</p>

<p>MyInterview’s AI tools are based on the Big Five Personality Model, one of the main frameworks used by personality researchers. Personality tests, especially ones based on the &#8220;Big 5,&#8221; have <a href="https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/pages/0615-personality-tests.aspx">been used by recruiters for years</a>; what myInterview does is automate the process based on video transcripts instead of making candidates to fill out traditional assessments.</p>
<p>By automatically creating candidate shortlists focused on workplace culture compatibility, myInterview’s founders say its machine learning-based tools can help recruiters surface applicants who might otherwise be overlooked. Gillman said the platform also tries to mitigate bias in the hiring process by using a diverse set of data to train its algorithms and working with behavioral psychologists to audit videos. (Other startups using AI to help overcome bias in hiring include RippleMatch, which also recently received funding).</p>
<p>Of course, what makes a group of coworkers click can be hard to define, as with any other kind of relationship. Gillman said myInterview’s team includes behavioral psychologists, machine learning engineers and general engineers, working together to crack the code of building a good team.</p>
<p>For example, some candidates might flourish in a large corporation, where there is a lot of hierarchy and structure, while others might work better in small companies with a family-like environment, he said. &#8220;These things are quite tangible, and these are the elements we help to identify, both to the candidate and the employer.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remote learning and training have become a large priority this year for organizations looking to keep employees engaged and up to date on work practices at a time when many of them are not working in an office &#8212; and, in the case of those who have joined in 2020, may have never met any of their work colleagues in person, ever. Today one of the startups that&#8217;s built a new, more user-friendly approach to creating and provisioning those learning materials is announcing some funding as it experiences a boost in its growth.</p>
<p><a href="http://workramp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WorkRamp</a>, which has built a platform that helps organizations build their own training materials, and then distribute them both to their workforce and to partners, has raised $17 million, a Series B round of funding that&#8217;s being led by Omers Ventures with Bow Capital also participating.</p>
<p>Its big pitch is that it has built the tools to make it easy for companies to build their own training and learning materials, incorporating tests, videos, slide shows and more, and by making it easier for companies to build these themselves, the materials themselves become more engaging and less stiff.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We’re disrupting the legacy <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lms" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lms">LMS <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> [learning management system] providers, the Cornerstones of the world, with our bite-size training platform,&#8221; said CEO and founder Ted Blosser in an interview. &#8220;We want to do what Peloton did for the exercise market, but with corporate training. We are aiming for a consumer-grade experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company, originally incubated in Y Combinator, has now raised $27 million.</p>
<p>The funding comes on the back of strong growth for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/workramp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="workramp">WorkRamp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. Blosser said that it now has around 250 customers, with 1 million courses collectively created on its platform. That list includes fast-growing tech companies like Zoom, Box, Reddit and Intercom, as well as Disney, GlobalData and PayPal. As it continues to expand, it will be interesting to see how and if it can also snag more legacy, late adopters who are not as focused on tech in their own DNA.</p>
<p>WorkRamp estimates that there is some $20 billion spent annually by organizations on corporate training. Unsurprisingly, that has meant the proliferation of a number of companies building tools to address that market.</p>
<p>Just Google WorkRamp and you&#8217;re likely to encounter a number of its competitors who have bought its name as a keyword to snag a little more attention, . There are both big and small players in the space, including Leapsome, Capterra, Lessonly, LearnUpon (which itself recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/dublins-learnupon-raises-56m-for-its-online-learning-management-system-for-enterprises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised a big round</a>), SuccessFactors and TalentLMS.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about what WorkRamp has built is that it plays on the idea of the &#8220;creator&#8221; which really has been a huge development in our digital world. YouTube may have kicked things off with the concept of &#8220;user-generated content&#8221; but today we have TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, and so many more platforms &#8212; not to mention smartphones themselves, with their easy facilities to shoot videos and photos of others, or of yourself, and then share with others &#8212; which have made the idea of building your own work, and looking at that of others, extremely accessible.</p>
<p>That has effectively laid the groundwork for a new way of conceiving of even more prosaic things, like corporate training. (Can there really be anything more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkIuRa-6b4U" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comedically</a> prosaic than that?) Other startups like Kahoot have also played on this idea, by making it easy for enterprises to build their own games to help train their staff.</p>
<p>This is what WorkRamp has aimed to tap into with its own take on the learning market, to help its customers eschew the idea of hiring outside production companies to make training materials, or expect WorkRamp to build those materials for them: instead, the people who are going to use the training now have the control.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it’s critical to be able to build your own customer education,&#8221; Blosser said. &#8220;That’s a big trend for clients that want both to rapidly onboard people but also reduce costs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s platform includes user-friendly drag-and-drop functionality, which also lets people build slide shows, flip cards and questions that viewers can answer. The plan is to bring on more &#8220;Accenture&#8221; style consultants, Blosser said, for bigger customers who may not be as tech savvy to help them take better advantage of the tools. It also integrates with third-party packages like Salesforce.com, Workday, and Zoom both to build out training as well as to distribute it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since 2000, we have seen three major technology shifts in the enterprise: the transition from on-premise to SaaS, the growth of mobile, and the most recent &#8211; sweeping digital transformation across almost every part of every business,” said Eugene Lee of OMERS Ventures, in a statement. “The pandemic has forced adoption of a digital-first approach towards customers and employees across virtually all industries. WorkRamp’s platform is foundational to empowering both of these important audiences today and in the future. We are bullish on the massive opportunity in front of the company and are excited to get involved.&#8221; Lee is joining the board with this round.</p>

The startup is bringing a pick-and-shovel play to the coding bootcamp world: instead of creating its own up-skilling curriculum, the startup empowers students to find the best bootcamps for their price point and career goals.</p>
<p>In plain words: <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/career-karma" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="career-karma">Career Karma <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is not competing with Lambda School, but instead it&#8217;s serving as a top of funnel student matchmaker to Lambda School and other bootcamps.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For as remote education drags on, students are unenrolling from school held on video conferencing software and opting for alternative programs. General Assembly, for example, saw enrollment in career-changing immersive programs is up 20% in the first half of 2020 versus the first half of 2019, as well as 330% growth in live online classes between Q2 2019 and Q2 2020.</p>
<p>Harris sees the shift toward short-term credentialing as positive news for the startup, since its customer base &#8212; coding bootcamps &#8212; are enjoying positive tailwinds. Despite early COVID-19 layoffs, Lambda School <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/lambda-school-raises-74m-for-its-virtual-coding-school-where-you-pay-tuition-only-after-you-get-a-job/">raised $74 million</a>. Coursera, a massive open online course provider, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/edtech-startups-flirt-with-unicorn-style-growth/">raised $130 million </a>for its short-term credentialing product. Other bootcamps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/henry-picks-up-cash-to-be-a-lambda-school-for-latin-america/">Henry</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/strive-school-wants-to-increase-the-number-of-job-ready-software-engineers-in-europe/">Strive School </a>launched and successfully raised seed rounds.</p>

<p>Career Karma’s next iteration will focus on becoming a “core habit that people use on a daily basis.” The roots are already in motion: Career Karma has been growing from a matching tool into a wraparound service over the past year.</p>
<p>After a student gets into a coding school, Career Karma puts coders into small peer mentorship groups, called Squads, to give students support during the program and into the job search process. Instead of acting as a teacher, it wants to be the upperclassmen that helps the younger students understand the right resources and paths to take.</p>
<p>Career Karma is working in one of coding bootcamps’ blind spots. A common critique of coding bootcamps is that while they help students get their first job, the credential might not do as good of a job as a degree in future career mobility. To offset this dynamic, coding bootcamps can invest in alumni programs or community features, such as Career Karma, to strengthen their pool.</p>
<p>Currently, Career Karma only makes money one way: it charges a fee to bootcamps when it successfully places a student in one of their programs. The fee is usually 10% of a placed-student’s tuition, which could range from $10,000 to $50,000, Harris says. It’s worth noting that a school pays Career Karma up front no matter what financing option the student chooses, taking money out of their marketing or admissions budgets.</p>
<p>The biggest hurdle for Career Karma was stress-tested in the early innings of the pandemic: Because the startup is so closely dependent on coding bootcamps doing well, what happens to coding bootcamps in a bear market? When unemployment was high, coding bootcamps were threatened because it took away their ability to successfully place graduates into jobs.</p>
<p>“It did affect us,” Harris said. “But now everybody is back to rapidly skilling their workforce,” given the nature of venture-backed startups. Career Karma’s customers have placed coders into jobs at Stitch Fix, Tesla and Gemini.</p>
<p>Despite only one way to monetize, Career Karma has been profitable for the past five months, and has grown revenue 20% monthly. While Harris declined to disclose specific figures, he did say that over the past year, Career Karma has placed more than 3,000 people into job-training programs. If I’m doing my math correctly, it means that Career Karma could have brought in between $3 million and $15 million in top-line revenue this year alone.</p>

<p>“Once we create a platform where workers regularly receive career advice to advance their career, no matter what skill set they want,” he said, “we’re able to charge more.”</p>

Other investors include Lattice’s Jack Altman, Collab Capital’s Jewel Burks and Moz’s Amira Yahyaoui.</p>
<p>“Now we’re able to not just be a player that matches people to bootcamps, but also to trade schools, colleges, universities, and really build a community that goes beyond just a matching platform,” Harris tells TechCrunch.</p>

<p>Terms of the deal aren&#8217;t being disclosed, although I understand this is mostly an acqui-hire, albeit one where the founders &#8212; both ex-Googlers prior to founding Dataform &#8212; have done well out of. However, it isn&#8217;t <em>just</em> about talent; Google is said to have been very interested in the company&#8217;s product, too &#8212; in fact, &#8220;Dataform web&#8221; is now being offered for free going forward.</p>
<p>One source with knowledge of the deal described it as a very decent outcome for Dataform&#8217;s founders, Lewis Hemens and Guillaume-Henri Huon. I also understand that Dataform was well on its way to raising a Series A, so there were definitely other options.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/dataform/">An alumni of Silicon Valley accelerator Y Combinator and backed by LocalGlobe</a>, Dataform  had set out to help data-rich companies draw insights from the data stored in their data warehouses. Mining data for insights and business intelligence typically requires a team of data engineers and analysts. Dataform wanted to simplify this task and in turn make it faster and cheaper for organisations to take full advantage of their data assets.</p>
<p>Joining Google Cloud should enable the team to continue that mission. More broadly, the space is hot right now, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/19/was-snowflakes-ipo-mispriced-or-just-misunderstood/">Snowflake&#8217;s successful IPO</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;After several conversations with the Google Cloud team it became clear that we are deeply aligned on the importance of serving analysts with the right tools and technology in order to fill what we all perceive as a missed opportunity in existing solutions,&#8221; <a href="https://dataform.co/blog/dataform-is-joining-google-cloud">writes</a> Guillaume-Henri Huon on Dataform&#8217;s website.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the same time, as a team of just 7, in a complex, competitive and rapidly changing market, we had more ideas than we had people or resources to accomplish. There has always been so much more we wanted to do each quarter than we could achieve. With the support of the BigQuery and Cloud Analytics teams and our combined thought leadership and efforts, we felt that together we could achieve something bigger than we could separately&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For many organizations, the shift to cloud computing has played out more realistically as a shift to hybrid architectures, where a company&#8217;s data is just as likely to reside in one of a number of clouds, as it might in an on-premise deployment, in a data warehouse, or in a data lake. Today, a startup that has built a more comprehensive way to assess, analyse and use that data is announcing funding as it looks to take on Snowflake, Amazon, Google and others in the area of enterprise data analytics.</p>
<p><a href="http://firebolt.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firebolt</a>, which has redesigned the concept of a data warehouse to work more efficiently and at a lower cost, is today announcing that it has raised $37 million from Zeev Ventures, TLV Partners, Bessemer Venture Partners and Angular Ventures. It plans to use the funding to continue developing its product and bring on more customers.</p>
<p>The company is officially &#8220;launching&#8221; today but &#8212; as is the case with so many enterprise startups these days operating in stealth &#8212; it has been around for two years already building its platform and signing commercial deals. It now has some 12 large enterprise customers and is &#8220;really busy&#8221; with new business, said CEO is Eldad Farkash in an interview.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding may sound like a large amount for a company that has not really been out in the open, but part of the reason is because of the track record of the founders. Farkash, was one of the founders of SiSense, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/09/sisense-nabs-another-100m-at-a-1b-valuation-for-its-big-data-business-analytics-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">successful</a> business intelligence startup, and he has co-founded Firebolt with two others who were on SiSense&#8217;s founding team, Saar Bitner as COO and Ariel Yaroshevich as CTO.</p>
<p>At SiSense, these three were coming up against an issue: when you are dealing in terabytes of data, cloud data warehouses were straining to deliver good performance to power its analytics and other tools, and the only way to potentially continue to mitigate that was by piling on more cloud capacity.</p>
<p>Farkash is something of a technical savant and said that he decided to move on and build Firebolt to see if he could tackle this, which he described as a new, difficult, and &#8220;meaningful&#8221; problem. &#8220;The only thing I know how to do is build startups,&#8221; he joked.</p>
<p>In his opinion, while data warehousing has been a big breakthrough in how to handle the mass of data that companies now amass and want to use better, it has started to feel like a dated solution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Data warehouses are solving yesterday’s problem, which was, &#8216;How do I migrate to the cloud and deal with scale?'&#8221; he said, citing Google&#8217;s BigQuery, Amazon&#8217;s RedShift and Snowflake as fitting answers for that issue. &#8220;We see Firebolt as the new entrant in that space, with a new take on design on technology. We change the discussion from one of scale to one of speed and efficiency.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup claims that its performance is up to 182 times faster than that of other data warehouses. It&#8217;s a SQL-based system that works on principles that Farkash said came out of academic research that had yet to be applied anywhere, around how to handle data in a lighter way, using new techniques in compression and how data is parsed. Data lakes in turn can be connected up with a wider data ecosystem, and what it translates to is a much smaller requirement for cloud capacity.</p>
<p>This is not just a problem at SiSense. With enterprise data continuing to grow exponentially, cloud analytics is growing with it, and is estimated by 2025 to be a $65 billion market, Firebolt estimates.</p>
<p>Still, Farkash said the Firebolt concept was initially a challenging sell even to the engineers that it eventually hired to build out the business: it required building completely new warehouses from the ground up to run the platform, five of which exist today and will be augmented with more, on the back of this funding, he said.</p>
<p>And it should be pointed out that its competitors are not exactly sitting still either. Just yesterday, <a href="https://dataform.co/blog/dataform-is-joining-google-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dataform announced that it had been acquired by Google</a> to help it build out and run better performance at BigQuery.</p>
<p>“Firebolt created a SaaS product that changes the analytics experience over big data sets” Oren Zeev of Zeev Ventures said in a statement. “The pace of innovation in the big data space has lagged the explosion in data growth rendering most data warehousing solutions too slow, too expensive, or too complex to scale. Firebolt takes cloud data warehousing to the next level by offering the world’s most powerful analytical engine. This means companies can now analyze multi Terabyte / Petabyte data sets easily at significantly lower costs and provide a truly interactive user experience to their employees, customers or anyone who needs to access the data.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Karl Marx famously argued in &#8216;Das Kapital&#8217; that to achieve freedom from the slavery of capitalism, the worker must own the means of production. Perhaps that day is edging closer. Today <a href="https://wikifactory.com/">Wikifactory</a>, billing itself as a &#8216;Github for hardware’, announces it has closed a $3 million funding round taking it to a total of $4.5m, pre-series A. The investors are unnamed, but characterized as “impact investors”. The collaboration platform claims it allows someone to make almost anything remotely.</p>
<p>The ‘impact&#8217; aspect of Wikifactory’s playbook is that it involves less shipping and less costly inventories being required.</p>
<p>With the investment, the company will build a &#8216;quality-assured&#8217; manufacturing marketplace, as well as mirrored servers in China to open up access to its hardware capital, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/shenzhen-eb7c" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="shenzhen-eb7c">Shenzhen <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. Wikifactory is available in four languages right now and is set to expand to 20 after it raised a Series A funding round next year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition, its new Collaborative CAD Tool with in-built chat means designers, engineers, manufacturers and enterprises can collaborate remotely on virtually any CAD model, from concept through to finished prototype.</p>
<p>This allows product developers to review and discuss 3D models in over thirty file formats in real-time. The idea is to democratize access to normally expensive product lifecycle management (PLM) software.</p>
<p>The startup says that since May 2019 some 70,000 product developers in 190 countries have been using Wikifactory build robotics, electric vehicles and drones, agri-tech and sustainable energy appliances, lab equipment and 3D printers, smart furniture and biotech fashion materials as well as medical supplies including vital PPE and ventilators when there were global supply shortages.</p>
<p>Nicolai Peitersen, co-founder and executive chairman of Wikifactory said: &#8220;Wide-scale global collaboration to make physical things is happening both for open-source and for proprietary product development. The global manufacturing industry output, worth USD 35 trillion, is finally having its web moment. Online collaboration and distributed production is becoming mainstream. We’re calling it the internet of production.”</p>
<p>He added that with global supply chains stretched because of the pandemic, the need for a viable, alternative online infrastructure to prototype and produce products locally, to a high standard, and sustainably &#8220;has never been more relevant and necessary.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/carl-pei" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="carl-pei">Carl Pei, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the co-founder of OnePlus who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/oneplus-co-founder-carl-pei-confirms-he-has-left-the-company/">left the company two months ago</a>, has raised $7 million from a roster of high-profile investors for his new hardware venture.</p>
<p>The Swedish tech entrepreneur said on Wednesday he had secured $7 million in Seed financing round from friends and private investors including Tony Fadell (Principal at Future Shape and inventor of the iPod), well known YouTuber Casey Neistat, Kevin Lin (co-founder of Twitch), Steve Huffman (chief executive of Reddit), Liam Casey (founder and chief executive of PCH), Paddy Cosgrave (founder of Web Summit) Josh Buckley (chief executive of Product Hunt), and a group of former and current Stockholm-headquartered Truecaller employees Kim Fai Kok, Nick Dahl, and Zakaria Hersi.</p>
<p>Pei remains tight lipped on what this new venture would be about, or what it is even called, but said he would talk more about it early next year. A source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that the venture will focus on audio-related hardware &#8212; at least to begin with. Pei said he plans to use the fresh capital to set up an office in London, hire talent and fund product research and development.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I am deeply grateful and tremendously excited to have friends of this caliber supporting us in building what’s next,” said Carl Pei in a statement. “We plan on moving aggressively against our vision, and can’t wait to see how the market will react.”</p>
<p>Pei, who served as the public face of the Chinese smartphone maker <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/oneplus" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="oneplus">OnePlus <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> for years, surprised many when he announced in October that he would be leaving the company. He played an instrumental role in designing the OnePlus smartphone lineup over the years, and also how the company marketed them and itself.</p>
<p>News outlet Android Central <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/confirmed-oneplus-co-founder-carl-pei-has-left-company">reported </a>earlier that Pei, 31, had left the firm because of an “internal power struggle” between him and Pete Lau, the other co-founder of OnePlus. Lau, 45, took an additional role of SVP at Oppo. BBK Group owns OnePlus, Realme, Oppo and Vivo. OnePlus has always avoided questions about its ownership structure. Reached for comment in October, OnePlus has yet to respond.</p>
<p>“Carl spent the last decade making products that millions of people love. He deeply understands what consumers want, and I can&#8217;t wait for the world to see what he has in store next,” said Josh Buckley, chief executive of Product Hunt, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) <a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/2020-12/08/c_1608994395220033.htm">announced</a> it has banned 105 mobile apps for violating Chinese internet regulations. While almost all of the apps are made by Chinese developers, American travel booking and review site TripAdvisor is also on the list.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tripadvisor" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tripadvisor">TripAdvisor <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TRIP/">shares dipped on Nasdaq</a> after the CAC’s announcement, but began recovering in after-hours trading.</p>
<p>While TripAdvisor is based in the United States, like other foreign tech companies, it struck a partnership with a local tech company for its Chinese operations. In TripAdvisor’s case, it <a href="https://tripadvisor.mediaroom.com/2019-11-06-TripAdvisor-and-Trip-com-Group-Announce-Strategic-Partnership">entered into an agreement with Trip.com</a> &#8212; the Nasdaq-listed Chinese travel titan formerly known as Ctrip &#8212; in November 2019 to operate a joint venture called TripAdvisor China. The deal made Trip.com subsidiary Ctrip Investment a majority shareholder in the JV, with TripAdvisor owning 40%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of the deal, TripAdvisor agreed to share content with Trip.com brands, including Chinese travel platforms Ctrip and Qunar, which gained access to the American firm&#8217;s abundant overseas travel reviews. That put TripAdvisor in a race with regional players, including <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324348504578609602665397308">Alibaba-backed Qyer</a> and Hong Kong-based Klook, to capture China&#8217;s increasingly affluent and savvy outbound tourists.</p>
<p>The CAC is the government agency in charge of overseeing internet regulations and censorship. In a brief statement, the bureau said it began taking action on November 5 to &#8220;clean up&#8221; China’s internet by removing apps that broke regulations. The 105 apps constituted the first group to be banned, and were targeted after users reported illegal activity or content, the agency said.</p>
<p>Though the CAC did not specify exactly what each app was banned for, the list of illegal activities included spreading pornography, incitements to violence or terrorism, fraud or gambling and prostitution.</p>
<p>In addition, eight app stores were taken down for not complying with review regulations or allowing the download of illegal content.</p>
<p>Such &#8220;app cleansing&#8221; takes place periodically in China where the government has a stranglehold on information flows. Internet services in China, especially those involving user-generated content, normally rely on armies of censors or filtering software to ensure their content is in line with government guidelines.</p>
<p>The Chinese internet is evolving so rapidly that regulations sometimes fall behind the development of industry players, so the authorities are constantly closing gaps. Apps and services could be pulled because regulators realize they are lacking essential government permits, or they might have published illegal or politically sensitive information.</p>
<p>Foreign tech firms operating in China often find themselves walking a fine line between the &#8220;internet freedom&#8221; celebrated in the West and adherence to Beijing&#8217;s requirements. The likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/microsoft-confirms-bing-is-down-in-china/">Bing.com</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/26/linkedins-head-of-china-is-leaving-the-company/">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/apple-removes-two-rss-feed-readers-from-china-app-store/">Apple</a> &#8212; the few remaining Western tech giants in China &#8212; have all drawn criticism for caving to China&#8217;s censorship pressure in the past.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Inspiration to launch a lawn-care company struck Coulter Lewis when he was shopping for lawn-care products one day. The entrepreneur, who previously worked as a designer and co-founder of a snack company, says the stench of pesticides and herbicides piled high was too strong to ignore.</p>
<p>Lewis began researching safer alternatives to fertilize his backyard. His research showed him that he wasn’t alone: a typical managed lawn in the United States gets five times more pesticides per acre than the average industrial farm. A lack of options on the market inspired him to create his own.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019, <a href="https://www.getsunday.com/">Sunday</a> is a direct-to-consumer company that wants to sell customized, eco-friendly lawn care to the approximately 90 million Americans who have lawns. To date, it has fertilized more than 10,000 acres of lawn.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We’re selling agtech for your backyard,” Lewis said. It’s a catchy way to describe the more complicated process of creating custom lawn plans. The company brought on chief science officer Frank Rossi, who has a PhD at Cornell, to create its core product, which requires a mix of tech and science to work.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sunday-com" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sunday-com">Sunday <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> starts by taking a customer’s home address and, based on the location, can begin gleaning what types of soil it will be working with. By using machine learning, satellite imagery and property data, Sunday creates a custom plan with nutrients to address problem areas, such as grass health in different bio-environmental situations. The end-product includes ingredients that are hard to find in on-shelf solutions, like seaweed extract and soy protein.</p>
<p>Kits include instructions, a pouch of pre-measured nutrients to attach to a hose and spray, and soil test. While each kit is customized, lawn-care products are highly regulated and need state approval. Sunday has 24 iterations of its core product now out that meet this approval.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2084477" style="width: 869px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084477" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2084477" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DSC03143.jpg" alt="" width="859" height="573" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DSC03143.jpg 7360w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DSC03143.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DSC03143.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DSC03143.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DSC03143.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DSC03143.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DSC03143.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DSC03143.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 859px) 100vw, 859px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2084477" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sunday</p></div></p>
<p>Once the solution is created, customers have to pay for a full season or full year to get installments shipped to their homes. As customers use Sunday&#8217;s lawn-care products, the startup also uses aerial imagery to check on the status of users&#8217; lawns throughout the experience.</p>
<p>Sunday sells at a variety of price points, and is dependent on lawn size, but Lewis does claim it’s “much cheaper” than hiring a professional to come and fertilize your lawn. “When you look at a lot of more modern, [consumer] businesses, there’s kind of more of a coastal millennial focus,” he said. “Whereas we&#8217;re thinking more about 90 million Americans, where the&#8230;median American income is $65,000 per household.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, Sunday says that its customers skew younger, between 30 and 40 years old, and concentrate in Middle America states (where lawns are more of a reality). The age range makes sense because it encapsulates new families moving to the suburbs and first-time homeowners. Most of its customers have smaller suburban lawns.</p>
<p>When asked why they aren’t selling to golf courses or going the B2B route, Lewis said that “it&#8217;s certainly something that we think about a lot.” The company is currently working to partner with parks to help remove toxic pesticides from public spaces, but talks are in the early stages.</p>
<p>The lack of innovation around lawn care might also signal a lack of demand from consumers. One of Sunday’s biggest hurdles when launching in 2019 was if it could convince consumers to care about one of the biggest crops in the backyard &#8212; their backyards.</p>
<p>The coronavirus has also accelerated the migration of new families from cities to suburbs, Lewis says. According to the Census, home ownership has<a href="https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/currenthvspress.pdf"> hit a 12-year high</a>. This year, Sunday is set to do 8X in revenue as it did in 2019, where it was making “millions in revenue.” Lewis declined to share profitability metrics or answer if Sunday was profitable.</p>
<p>Despite this, venture capitalists seem bullish on a startup serving up an alternative to lawn care.</p>
<p>Today, Sunday announced that it has raised $19 million in Series B financing led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sequoia-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sequoia-capital">Sequoia Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from Tusk Ventures and Forerunner Ventures. The raise brings Stephanie Zhan, partner at Sequoia Capital, to the board.</p>
<p>In an email to TechCrunch, Zhan likened Sunday to other Sequoia portfolio companies such as Glossier, DoorDash, Instacart and Noom, saying that she thinks that “Sunday has a similar opportunity to build a compounding consumer subscription business and a defining brand for outdoor homecare.”</p>
<p>The new money will allow Sunday to grow its 40-person staff with 30 new hires. Currently, there is only <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsey-comeau-7a11084b/">one female executive</a> on Sunday’s team, although Lewis says they are committed to hiring a more diverse team.</p>
<p>It takes capital to serve the average American household, and with the new financing, Sunday has a total of $28 million in known venture financing to help, at the very least, with your backyard.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amy Yin doesn&#8217;t foresee startups resuming a five-day-a-week in-office work schedule, even after COVID-19 has been battled back.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably a safe bet. Many companies have learned this year that employees can be just as productive, working from home. More, employees &#8212; much as they might miss their own desks &#8212; no longer want to sit in a traditional office all the time. According a survey of 2,300 tech employees conducted this past summer, just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/a-look-at-tech-salaries-and-how-they-could-change-as-more-employees-go-remote/">7% of respondents</a> said they wanted to head into work every day.</p>
<p>Yin experienced the shift to remote work firsthand as a senior engineer at Coinbase, the cryptocurrency exchange, which was early to send its employees home as the pandemic took hold in the U.S. Working from home for the first time in her career &#8212; she&#8217;d previously been a software engineer with the recruitment platform Hired and, before that, a growth engineer at Facebook &#8212; she found herself working on her own schedule entirely and loving the flexibility.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By August, she says, she decided she could help Coinbase &#8212; and the growing number of other companies to adopt a remote-first organizational strategy &#8212; by starting up <a href="https://officetogether.com/">OfficeTogether</a>, her now five-month-old, San Francisco-based, software-as-a-service company.</p>
<p>Its proposition is simple. With software that integrates with Slack, Google Calendar, and Okta (and soon to be Workday), OfficeTogether helps employees plan time in the office, see their teammates&#8217; schedules, and also to take an automated health and symptom questionnaire that ensures that no one has a fever or has traveled in last 14 days.</p>
<p>The idea is largely to prevent employees from showing up to an office that is already at capacity, or stumbling into a sales team meeting when what&#8217;s really needed is quiet.</p>
<p>The company already has paid annual contracts in the U.S., Europe and Canada, says Yin, who wasn&#8217;t comfortable discussing pricing in a call earlier today but who says that OfficeTogether isn&#8217;t competing on price with other competitors, like the workplace management software companies <a href="https://spaceiq.com/">SpaceIQ</a> and <a href="https://www.officespacesoftware.com/">OfficeSpace</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, she says, while rivals are more focused on work space utilization and using occupancy data to forecast capacity limits, OfficeTogether is focused around employees and, as a result, not wedded to a particular space so much as on ensuring that teams can come together when they want, whether that&#8217;s helping them organize a week at a co-working space or several days at a hotel.</p>
<p>&#8220;At some point,&#8221; she notes, &#8220;some companies might decide it’s cheaper to rent out hotel rooms than rent office space, which is expensive to manage.&#8221; She predicts that &#8220;flexible spaces for people to meet will be a big part of every company&#8217;s strategy. If you&#8217;re only meeting once a month for a week,&#8221; you can make do with less, she suggests.</p>
<p>Investors certainly seem to agree. A growing number of startups has been receiving funding that turn all kinds of locations into work spaces. Among them is <a href="https://www.codi.com/">Codi</a>, a San Francisco-based startup that connects people with daytime workspaces in private homes and just today announced $7 million in funding.</p>
<p>In the meantime, OfficeTogether &#8212; which is run by Yin, a designer in San Francisco, and a handful of engineers in Romania &#8212; has just raised its own first institutional round: $2.2 million in seed funding. Defy led the round, joined by Neo, MGV and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/jane-vc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="jane-vc">January Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> along with numerous angel investors who&#8217;ve met Yin through Coinbase; through her alma mater, Harvard; or through other connections.</p>
<p>Among those angels is former Sequoia partner <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/amy-sun" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="amy-sun">Amy Sun, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> who is right now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/former-sequoia-partner-amy-sun-has-already-raised-millions-for-her-stealthy-startup/">launching her own startup</a> in Austin, Texas. Says Yin of Sun and some of the other individuals who&#8217;ve written her a check: &#8220;A lot of my friends are starting companies and it&#8217;s really fun to have people who are launching things&#8221; involved with one&#8217;s own startup. &#8220;We&#8217;re all invest in each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for where that new capital will be spent, Yin says it will go almost entirely to adding to the number of engineers on staff. As for possible marketing spend to spread the word about OfficeTogether, Yin says that her focus instead is on &#8220;enterprise B2B sales &#8212; running a sales process and ensuring the right people hear about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does she have a salesperson yet, we wonder? She laughs. For now, she says, &#8220;You&#8217;re talking to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can learn more about the company <a href="https://t.co/5lKlvYlRdQ">here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a young age, Will Bruey, the co-founder and chief executive of <a href="https://blog.varda.com/">Varda Space Industries</a>, was fascinated with space and running his own business.<br />
</span></p>
<p>So when the former <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> engineer was tapped by Delian Asparouhov and Trae Stephens of Founders Fund to work on Varda he didn&#8217;t think twice.</p>
<p>Bruey spent six years at SpaceX. First working on the Falcon and Dragon video systems and then the bulk of the systems actuators and controllers used in the avionics for the crewed Dragon capsule (which recently docked at the International Space Station). `</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to Asparouhov, that background, and the time that Bruey spent running his own angel syndicate and working at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bank-of-america" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bank-of-america">Bank of America <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> getting a grounding in finance and startups, made him an ideal candidate to run the next startup to be spun out of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/founders-fund" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="founders-fund">Founders Fund <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Like other <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/founders-fund" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="founders-fund">Founders Fund <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> companies, Palantir and Anduril, Varda takes its name from the novels of J.R.R. Tolkien. Named for the Elf queen who created constellations, the company has set itself no less lofty a task than bringing manufacturing to space.</p>
<p>News of the funding <a href="https://www.axios.com/varda-space-9-million-manufacturing-space-0b9970c4-4394-4e61-a0a1-c4980e12acf9.html">was first reported by Axios</a>.</p>
<p>While companies like <a href="https://spacetango.com/">Space Tango</a> and <a href="https://madeinspace.us/">Made In Space</a> already are attempting to make a viable business out of space manufacturing, they focus on small scale pilots and experimental projects. Varda separates itself by its loftier ambition &#8212; to manufacture commercially viable products at scale in space.</p>
<p>To be economically viable, these products have to be very very high value, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/space-flight/4-products-that-make-sense-to-manufacture-in-orbit">and according to the IEEE</a> there are already some goods that fit the bill. Things like carbon nanotubes and fiber optic cables, organs, and novel materials are all potential targets for a space manufacturing company, because they can conceivably justify the high cost of material transportation.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Manufacturing is the next step for commercialization in space,&#8221; said Bruey. &#8220;The primary driver that makes us economical is success in the launch business.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>With now-established companies like SpaceX, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/rocket-lab" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="rocket-lab">Rocket Lab <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/blue-origin" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="blue-origin">Blue Origin, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and upstarts like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/relativity-space" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="relativity-space">Relativity Space, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Spinlaunch, and the newly launched Aevum Space all driving down the cost of launching objects into space, the next wave of commercialization is coming.</p>
<p>Varda&#8217;s backers, which put $9 million into the company, were led by Founders Fund and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lux-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lux-capital">Lux Capital <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. Additional participation came from Fifty Years, Also Capital, Raymond Tonsing, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/justin-mateen" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="justin-mateen">Justin Mateen, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Naval Ravikant.</p>
<p>These investors are all placing a bet that the biggest returns could be in manufacturing. As a result of their investments, Founders Fund partner Trae Stephens and Lux Capital co-founder Josh Wolfe are both taking seats on the company&#8217;s board.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The first things we will manufacture are things with high dollar per-unit-mass value,&#8221; said Bruey. &#8220;As we establish our manufacturing platform that will ramp into the longer term vision of offloading manufacturing for all space operations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>There are two categories of space manufacturing in the industry to come, according to Bruey and Asparouhov and those are additive manufacturing for making products to be used in space, and manufacturing in space for terrestrial applications. It&#8217;s the second of these that Varda focuses on. &#8220;Nothing we will be doing will be 3D printing,&#8221; said Asparouhov. &#8220;We will be focused on making things in space that we can bring back to earth.</p>
<p>The company may not be working on 3D printing, but its manufacturing facilities won&#8217;t look like anything on Earth. Initially, they&#8217;ll be unmanned, according to <a href="https://fiftyyears.substack.com/p/varda-space-industries">a blog post published by Fifty Years</a>. Then they&#8217;ll manufacture things in space that benefit from low gravity. Finally, the company intends to build the first inrastructure that can harvest source materials for new products in-space via asteroid mining.</p>
<p>&#8220;Varda can make manufacturing sustainable by eliminating the need to destructively extract earth&#8217;s resources, help cure chronic diseases, deepen our understanding of biology, help connect more people to the Internet, and usher in higher-throughput and lower energy methods of computation,&#8221; Fifty Years co-founder <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/seth-bannon" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="seth-bannon">Seth Bannon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> wrote in a direct message. &#8220;Bringing human industry into the stars &#8212; this is entrepreneurship at its boldest! Varda is the sort of big swing ambition venture capital was invented for.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Federal Trade Commission has sued to block Procter &amp; Gamble’s acquisition of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/billie" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="billie">Billie, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a NY-based startup that sells razors and body wash.</p>
<p>In the notice, the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/federal-trade-commission" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="federal-trade-commission">FTC <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> alleged that the merger would “eliminate innovative nascent competitors for wet shave razors” to the loss of consumers.</p>
<p>Billie was founded in 2017 with the goal of fighting the “pink tax” on goods marketed to women, including razors and body wash. It went up against companies like P&amp;G and Edgewell Personal Care by offering high-quality and cheap razors. The company announced its intent to be acquired by P&amp;G after raising just $35 million in venture capital in June.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Billie, which wants to eliminate the &#8220;pink tax,&#8221; closes a $6M seed round for its razor subscription service&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/12/billie-which-wants-to-destroy-the-pink-tax-closes-a-6m-seed-round-for-its-razor-subscription-service/embed/#?secret=41S5OEkPTV" data-secret="41S5OEkPTV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“As its sales grew, Billie was likely to expand into brick-and-mortar stores, posing a serious threat to P&amp;G. If P&amp;G can snuff out Billie’s rapid competitive growth, consumers will likely face higher prices,” Ian Conner, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition said in a statement.</p>
<p>P&amp;G has been on a buying spree as of late. Along with the Billie news, Procter &amp; Gamble acquired Walker &amp; Company, which created Bevel, a grooming line for men of color, and Form, a hair-care line for women of color. In February 2019, P&amp;G announced plans to acquire This is L, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190205005592/en/PG-Acquires-This-Is-L.-One-of-the-Fastest-Growing-Feminine-Care-Brands-in-the-U.S.">a feminine-care brand </a>that sells tampons, pads and wipes.</p>
<p>If the FTC wins, this is another blow for direct-to-consumer brands on the base of competition dynamics. In May 2019, Edgewell Personal Care announced it intended to buy Harry&#8217;s, another direct-to-consumer shaving brand. In February 2020, the FTC filed a lawsuit to block the deal from happening, similarly citing how the deal would limit competition and innovation in the razor market.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GWBVf7ZARU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/09/edgewell-acquires-harrys/">Razor startup Harry&#8217;s will be acquired by Edgewell Personal Care for $1.37B</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Razor startup Harry&#8217;s will be acquired by Edgewell Personal Care for $1.37B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/09/edgewell-acquires-harrys/embed/#?secret=GWBVf7ZARU" data-secret="GWBVf7ZARU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Unlike Harry&#8217;s, Billie was bought before it broke into brick-and-mortar retail stores. If the deal doesn’t close, Billie lost precious time it could have used to expand into new locations and markets &#8212; and P&amp;G will lose some of its competitive advantage in the women’s shaving world.</p>
<p>Harry&#8217;s and Billie’s blocks could negatively trickle down to hurt direct-to-consumer products looking at health and wellness more broadly.</p>
<p>Note that exit market isn’t as dull for all companies in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) world. We&#8217;ve seen deals close like Blue Bunny&#8217;s buy of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-09-16/halo-top-ice-cream-company-is-sold-to-blue-bunny">Halo Top</a>, Mars&#8217; acquisition of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/business/dealbook/kind-bars-acquired-mars-snickers.html">Kind Bars</a> and, of course, Unilever&#8217;s $1 billion acquisition of Dollar Shave Club.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="3Yz6EYyXgE"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/22/why-did-unilever-pay-1b-for-dollar-shave-club/">Why did Unilever pay $1B for Dollar Shave Club?  </a></p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/iiiitsandrea">Andrea Hernández</a>, a founder and <a href="http://snaxshot.com">consultant on food and beverage CPG</a>, says that DTC companies often need to partner with mega-businesses to get the distribution scale they need, focusing more on omni-channel presence versus a single seller point.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s very limited for these companies to scale at the same level and grow without incurring debt or needing constant injections of [money],&#8221; she said. &#8220;Or [you can go] the preferred route which is having BigDaddyCorp come whisk you away. You get a success story and the resources to continue your journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>That said, the coronavirus has even impacted food CPG companies by forcing them to <a href="https://twitter.com/gooderdle/status/1336414556873224194?s=20">slash SKUs</a> (or stock keeping units) and prioritize essential goods. Whereas before, CPG companies might stock a variety of goods for a variety of customer needs, they&#8217;re now prioritizing a smaller slice of the pie to manage uncertainty among consumer behavior. Long-term, this means that CPGs might be buying fewer of the Billies and Harry&#8217;s of the world and just focusing on what&#8217;s working now.</p>
<p>Selene Cruz, the founder of Restore which gives DTC brands an offline presence, said that she&#8217;s a&#8221;bit surprised to see the FTC claiming the acquisition kills competition. Billie going into brick &amp; mortar doesn&#8217;t mean instant success enough to take on a major conglomerate.&#8221;</p>
<div>&#8220;If the FTC&#8217;s goal is to not kill competition then I&#8217;d advise them not to diminish exit prospects for investors and founders,&#8221; Cruz added. &#8220;This would hurt investment in the space and that&#8217;s the real fear for innovators.&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Additionally, Clearbanc founder Michele Romanow said that  &#8220;while this isn&#8217;t at all ideal for Billie, it means other growing D2C brands have a better chance to build a strong brand and gives consumers more options.&#8221;</div>
<p>Regardless of how this plays out, today&#8217;s news shows that the FTC is paying more attention than ever to consumer and tech.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We already knew that Halo Infinite was delayed until next year. Initially intended to launch alongside the new Xboxes, Microsoft announced back in August that it would instead ship in 2021.</p>
<p>Exactly <em>when</em> in 2021, though, was still anyone&#8217;s guess. A <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/inside-infinite-december-2020">new blog post</a> from 343 Industries narrows it down a bit: it&#8217;ll be released in Fall.</p>
<p>Assuming they mean Fall in the Northern Hemisphere (which, well, they probably do,) this narrows the launch window to sometime between the end of September and the end of December. So it&#8217;ll be a while&#8230; but a late game is better than a bad game, right?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>343 <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/inside-infinite-december-2020">has a blog post and interview</a> outlining the team&#8217;s thinking on the timing (and a bit about what they&#8217;re still working on) but it really all boils down to one point: they &#8220;needed more time to do things right.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/10/ada-ventures-launches-with-a-34m-fund-aimed-at-super-charging-diverse-global-founders/">A year ago</a> this week <a href="https://www.adaventures.com/">Ada Ventures</a> — a UK/Europe focused VC with an ‘impact twist&#8217; aiming to invest in diverse founders tacking societal problems — launched on stage at Techcrunch Disrupt. (You can watch the video of that launch below).</p>
<p>Today Ada announces that it has closed its first fund at $50 million. Cornerstone LPs in the fund include <a href="https://bigsocietycapital.com/">Big Society Capital</a>, an entity owned by the UK government, as well as the the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Business_Bank">British Business Bank</a>.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/check-warner" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="check-warner">Check Warner, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a co-founding partner, said the raise was oversubscribed: &#8220;We weren&#8217;t even sure we&#8217;d be able to raise $30 million. And then to actually get to 38 million pounds then $50 million, which was over our initial hard cap of 35 is, is really, really big.” All of the fund was raised on video calls during the 2020 pandemic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Geared as a &#8216;first-cheque&#8217; seed fund, Ada is trying to tackle that thorny problem that to a large extent the VC industry itself created: the &#8216;mirroring&#8217; that goes on when white male investors invest in other white men, thus ignoring huge swathes of society. Instead, it’s aiming to invest in the best <em>talent</em> in the UK and Europe, regardless of race, gender or background, with the specific aim of &#8220;creating the most diverse pipeline, and portfolio, on the continent&#8221;, while tackling issues including mental health, obesity, workers rights and affordable childcare.</p>
<p>It appears to be well on its way. In 2020, Ada invested in eight seed-stage companies tackling the above issues. Four of the eight companies have female CEOs. This brings the total portfolio size to 17, including the ‘pre-fund’ portfolio.</p>
<p>In terms of portfolio progress: Huboo Technologies raised a £14m Series A, which was led by Stride VC and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hearst-interactive-media" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hearst-interactive-media">Hearst Ventures; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Bubble delivered tens of thousands of hours of free childcare to NHS staff; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/organise/">Organise</a> grew their members from 70,000 to more than 900,000, and campaigned for the government to provide support for the self-employed during Covid-19.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://findingada.com/">Ada Lovelace Day</a> this October, Ada launched its own Angel program, enabling five new Angel investors to write their first cheques. This is not dissimilar to similar Angel programs run by other VCs. It also has a network of 58 &#8216;Ada Scouts’  resulting in around 20% of deal flow, with two investments now made across the portfolio that were scout-sourced.</p>
<p>This is no ordinary scout network, however. Ada&#8217;s Scout community includes the leaders of Hustle Crew, a for-profit working to make the tech industry more inclusive, and Muslamic Makers, a community of Muslims in tech.</p>
<p>In 2021, Ada says it will continue to grow its network of Ada Scouts across the UK, with a focus on the LGBTQ+ community, disabled entrepreneurs, and regions outside of London.</p>
<p>And Scout network is not just ‘for show’, as Warner told me: “We have spoken to the Iranian Women&#8217;s Association and Islamic makers and all these groups that are underrepresented within tech and VC. And they bring us companies. And if we end up investing in these companies, we pay them both an upfront cash fee and also a carried interest share. So there are quite a few things that make it distinct from other scout programs. Many other scout programs just take existing investors like existing angels, and give them more capital and double up their investments. We&#8217;re actually enabling a whole new group of people who wouldn&#8217;t otherwise be able to get access to VC. We involve them in our due diligence process, we get their insight into markets that we wouldn&#8217;t necessarily understand, like the Shariya finance market, for example. So there are quite a few things that we&#8217;re doing differently. And we now have 58 of these scouts, who drive between 10 and 20% of our deal flow on any given month.&#8221;</p>
<p>Warner continued: &#8220;When we launched we couldn’t have predicted the seismic changes and tragedy brought on by Covid-19, or the social dislocation precipitated by the killing of George Floyd. These events have provided the backdrop of the first year of deployment from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ada-vemtires" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ada-vemtires">Ada Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Fund I. In light of these events, the Ada Ventures strategy feels more poignant — and urgent — than it has perhaps ever been.”</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with TechCrunch, Warner and co-founder Matt Penneycard admitted the fund is not ‘labeled; as an ‘Impact fund’ but that it shares a similar orientation.</p>
<p>Penneycard said: “The difference, the difference is often in the eye of the beholder. In that, it&#8217;s the way the investor wants to bucket it. Some investors might see us as an impact fund if they want to, and that&#8217;s fine. Other investors see the massive financial arbitrage that you get with a fund like ours, just because you&#8217;re looking in very different places to other funds. So, you&#8217;ve got more coming in the top of the funnel, if you&#8217;ve got a decent process, you should get a better outcome. And so with some of our investors, that&#8217;s kind of one of the primary reasons they&#8217;re investing, they think we&#8217;re going to generate superior returns to other funds, because of where were are looking. It isn&#8217;t pure impact. It&#8217;s a real fund, it just happens to have the byproduct of quite deep, meaningful social impact.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has used a speech to European lawmakers and privacy regulators today to come out jabbing at what SVP Craig Federighi described as dramatic, &#8220;outlandish&#8221; and &#8220;false&#8221; claims being made by the adtech industry over a forthcoming change to iOS that <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">will give users the ability to decline app tracking. </span></p>
<p>The iPhone maker had been due to introduce the major privacy enhancement to the App Store this fall but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/apple-delay-ios-14-privacy-ad-tracking/">delayed</a> until early 2021 after the plan <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/facebook-vs-apple-ad-tracking/">drew fire from advertising giants</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook, for example, warned the move could have a major impact on app makers which rely on its in-app advertising network to monetize on iOS, as well as some impact on its own bottom line.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since then four online advertising lobby groups have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/apple-advertisting-france-idUSL1N2HJ237">filed an antitrust complaint</a> against Apple in France &#8212; seeking to derail the privacy changes on competition grounds.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9vs7nppjnl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/facebook-vs-apple-ad-tracking/">Facebook isn&#8217;t happy about Apple&#8217;s upcoming ad tracking restrictions</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook isn&#8217;t happy about Apple&#8217;s upcoming ad tracking restrictions&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/facebook-vs-apple-ad-tracking/embed/#?secret=9vs7nppjnl" data-secret="9vs7nppjnl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>However Apple made it clear today that it&#8217;s not backing down.</p>
<p>Federighi described online tracking as privacy&#8217;s &#8220;biggest&#8221; challenge &#8212; saying its forthcoming App Tracking Transparency (ATT) feature represents &#8220;the front line of user privacy&#8221; as far as it&#8217;s concerned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never before has the right to privacy &#8212; the right to keep personal data under your own control &#8212; been under assault like it is today. As external threats to privacy continue to evolve, our work to counter them must, too,&#8221; he said in the speech to the European Data Protection &amp; Privacy Conference.</p>
<p>The aim of ATT is &#8220;to empower our users to decide when or if they want to allow an app to track them in a way that could be shared across other companies’ apps or websites&#8221;, according to Federighi.</p>
<p>Civic society&#8217;s objection to the adtech industry&#8217;s tracking &#8216;dark art&#8217; is that it sums to hellishly opaque mass surveillance of the mainstream Internet.</p>
<p>While harms attached to the practice include the risk of discrimination; manipulation of vulnerable groups; and election interference, to name a few.</p>
<p>Federighi took clear aim in his own attack &#8212; returning to a descriptor that Apple&#8217;s CEO Tim Cook used in a speech to an earlier European privacy conference <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/24/apples-tim-cook-makes-blistering-attack-on-the-data-industrial-complex/">back in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mass centralization of data puts privacy at risk &#8212; no matter who’s collecting it and what their intentions might be,&#8221; he warned. &#8220;So we believe Apple should have as little data about our customers as possible. Now, others take the opposite approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;They gather, sell, and hoard as much of your personal information as they can. The result is a data-industrial complex, where shadowy actors work to infiltrate the most intimate parts of your life and exploit whatever they can find &#8212; whether to sell you something, to radicalize your views, or worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since Cook wooed EU lawmakers by denouncing the &#8220;data-industrial complex&#8221; &#8212; and simultaneously lauding Europe&#8217;s pro-privacy approach to digital regulation &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/gdpr-adtech-complaints-keep-stacking-up-in-europe/">scores</a> of individual and collective complaints have been lodged against the adtech infrastructure that underpins behavioral advertising under the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>Yet regional regulators still haven&#8217;t taken any enforcement action over these <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/iab-europes-ad-tracking-consent-framework-found-to-fail-gdpr-standard/">adtech complaints</a>. Turning the cookie-tracking tanker clearly isn&#8217;t a cake walk.</p>
<p>And while the adtech lobby may have been heartened by remarks made yesterday by Commission EVP and competition chief, Margrethe Vestager &#8212; who told the OECD Global Competition Forum that antitrust enforcers should be &#8220;vigilant so that privacy is not used as a shield against competition&#8221; &#8212; there was a sting in the tail as she expressed support for a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/antitrust-case-against-facebooks-super-profiling-back-on-track-after-german-federal-court-ruling/"> &#8216;superprofiling&#8217; case against Facebook</a> in Germany, which combines the streams of privacy and competition in new and interesting ways, with Vestager dubbing the piece of regulatory innovation &#8220;inspiring and interesting&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Antitrust case against Facebook&#8217;s &#8216;super profiling&#8217; back on track after German federal court ruling&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/antitrust-case-against-facebooks-super-profiling-back-on-track-after-german-federal-court-ruling/embed/#?secret=KtFQw1NDJ5" data-secret="KtFQw1NDJ5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Federighi urged Europe&#8217;s lawmakers to screw their courage to the sticking place where privacy is concerned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gdpr" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gdpr">GDPR <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and other policies &#8212; many of which have been implemented by Commissioner Jourová, Commissioner Reynders, and others here with us today &#8212; Europe has shown the world what a privacy-friendly future could look like,&#8221; he said, lathering on the kind of &#8216;geopolitical influencer&#8217; praise that&#8217;s particularly cherished in Brussels.</p>
<p>He also reiterated Apple&#8217;s support for a GDPR-style &#8220;omnibus privacy law in the U.S.&#8221; &#8212; something Cook called for two years ago &#8212; aka: a law that &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">empowers consumers to minimize collection of their data; to know when and </span>why it is being collected; to access, correct, or delete that data; and to know that it is truly secure&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s already clear that some companies are going to do everything they can to stop [ATT] &#8212; or any innovation like it &#8212; and to maintain their unfettered access to people’s data. Some have already begun to make outlandish claims, like saying that ATT &#8212; which helps users control when they’re tracked &#8212; will somehow lead to greater privacy invasions,&#8221; he went on, taking further sideswipes at Apple&#8217;s adtech detractors.</p>
<p>&#8220;To say that we’re skeptical of those claims would be an understatement. But that won’t stop these companies from making false arguments to get what they want. We need the world to see those arguments for what they are: a brazen attempt to maintain the privacy-invasive status quo.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another direct appeal to EU lawmakers, Federighi suggested ATT &#8220;reflects both the spirit and the requirements of both the ePrivacy Directive, and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/07/eprivacy-an-overview-of-europes-other-big-privacy-rule-change/">planned updates in the draft ePrivacy Regulation</a>&#8221; &#8212; displaying a keen insight into the (oftentimes fraught) process of EU policymaking. (The ePrivacy update has in fact been stalled for years &#8212; so the subtle suggestion in Apple&#8217;s appeal is its technology levers being flipped to enable greater user privacy <em>could</em> help unblock the EU&#8217;s bunged up policy levers.)</p>
<p>&#8220;ATT, like ePrivacy, is about giving people the power to make informed choices about what happens to their data. I hope that the lawmakers, regulators, and privacy advocates here today will continue to stand up for strong privacy protections like these,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Earlier in the speech Federighi also made some plainer points: Likening ATT to the Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) feature Apple added to its Safari browser back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-adds-a-tracker-blocker-to-desktop-safari/">2017</a> &#8212; pointing out that despite similar objections from adtech then the industry as a whole has posted revenue increases every year since.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as with ITP, some in the ad industry are lobbying against these efforts &#8212; claiming that ATT will dramatically hurt ad-supported businesses. But we expect that the industry will adapt as it did before &#8212; providing effective advertising, but this time without invasive tracking,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, some advertisers and tech companies would prefer that ATT is never implemented at all. When invasive tracking is your business model, you tend not to welcome transparency and customer choice,&#8221; he added, taking another swipe at the industry&#8217;s motives for objecting to more choice and privacy for iOS users.</p>
<p>At the same time Federighi did acknowledge that the iOS switch to requiring user permission for app tracking &#8220;is a big change from the world we live in now&#8221;.</p>
<p>Of course it&#8217;s one that will likely bring transitionary pain to iOS developers, too.</p>
<p>But on this his messaging stood firm: He made it clear Apple may wield the stick at developers who don&#8217;t get with its user privacy upgrade program, warning: &#8220;Early next year, we’ll begin requiring all apps that want to do that to obtain their users’ explicit permission, and developers who fail to meet that standard can have their apps taken down from the App Store.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was interesting to note that the speech contained both specific appeals to regional lawmakers to stay the course in regulating to protect data and privacy; and more amorphous appeals to (unnamed) competitors &#8212; to follow Apple&#8217;s lead and innovate around privacy.</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re a tech giant being accused of anti-competitive behaviour by a self-interested adtech clique, framing your desire for increased competition in the (lucrative) business of enhancing user privacy is a nice rebuttal.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don’t define success as standing alone. When it comes to privacy protections, we’re very happy to see our competitors copy our work, or develop innovative privacy features of their own that we can learn from,&#8221; said Federighi.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Apple, we are passionate advocates for privacy protections for all users. We love to see people buy our products. But we would also love to see robust competition among companies for the best, the strongest, and the most empowering privacy features.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course if more iOS developers have to rely on in-app subscriptions to monetize their wares, because users refuse app tracking, it&#8217;ll mean more money passing through the pearly App Store gates and straight into Apple&#8217;s coffers. But that&#8217;s another story.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>The Apple SVP also took gentle aim at any EU policymakers who may be imagining it&#8217;s a clever idea to crack open the pandora&#8217;s box of end-to-end encryption &#8212; urging them to strengthen the bloc&#8217;s commitment to robust security. Duh.</p>
<p>The backstory here is there&#8217;s been some recent chatter around the topic. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/whats-all-this-about-europe-wanting-crypto-backdoors/">Last month</a> a <a href="https://files.orf.at/vietnam2/files/fm4/202045/783284_fh_st12143-re01en20_783284.pdf">draft resolution</a> made by the Council of the European Union triggered press coverage that suggested EU legislators are on the cusp of banning e2e encryption.</p>
<p>Although, to be fair, the only &#8216;b&#8217; word the Commission has used so far is &#8216;balanced&#8217; &#8212; when it said its new EU security strategy will “explore and support balanced technical, operational and legal solutions, and promote an approach which both maintains the effectiveness of encryption in protecting privacy and security of communications, while providing an effective response to serious crime and terrorism”.</p>
<p>&#8220;I also hope that you will strengthen Europe’s support for end-to-end encryption. Apple strongly supported the European Parliament when it EU parliament <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/european-meps-want-to-ban-states-from-backdooring-encryption/">proposed</a> a requirement that the ePrivacy Regulation support end-to-end encryption, and we will continue to do so,&#8221; Federighi added, tone set to &#8216;don&#8217;t disappoint&#8217;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">According <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/doordash-sells-shares-at-102-in-ipo-pricing-above-range.html">to media</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/doordash-poised-to-tap-torrid-ipo-market-11607442406">reports</a>, food-delivery giant DoorDash priced its IPO at $102 per share, ahead of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/doordash-amps-its-ipo-range-ahead-of-blockbuster-ipo/">final IPO pricing range of $90 to $95 per share</a>.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s debut has been warmly anticipated by public investors, as evinced by the company raising its range from an initial target of $75 to $85.</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re still waiting for official pricing, the price point makes <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/doordash" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="doordash">DoorDash <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> worth $32 billion at the time of its IPO price on a non-diluted basis (we&#8217;re using the company&#8217;s final S-1/A share count of 317,656,521). That valuation rises if one includes options that have vested but not been exercised, and even more if shares set aside for future compensation are also tallied. CNBC calculates DoorDash&#8217;s valuation to be $38.7 billion on a diluted basis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How COVID-19 accelerated DoorDash&#8217;s business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/how-covid-19-accelerated-doordashs-business/embed/#?secret=QS1jyZxiGB" data-secret="QS1jyZxiGB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Regardless, any of the valuation marks for DoorDash at $102 per share are far and away greater than its final pre-IPO valuation of around $16 billion, set this summer when the company took on additional capital. The unicorn raised more money during a growth boom, allowing it to add to its cash reserves ahead of its IPO with limited dilution.</p>
<p>DoorDash, which doubled its private startup valuation, is now incredibly well-capitalized to take on rivals Uber Eats and others. And at a price far above its raised range, it has more cash than it probably hoped for. How it uses that cash to preserve pandemic-driven gains will be a key narrative from the company in 2021.</p>
