										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;We think of diversity as a keystone issue for the cannabis industry,&#8221; said Curio WMBE Fund managing director Jerel Registre in a conversation with TechCrunch. Registre&#8217;s conviction around this program is obvious as he explains the problem the fund is addressing.</p>
<p>The new fund, started by the Maryland-based medical cannabis company <a href="https://curiowellness.com">Curio Wellness</a>, aims to help underserved entrepreneurs entering the cannabis market. With $30 million to invest, the Curio WMBE Fund is looking to invest in up to 50 women, minority and <a href="https://rewirenewsgroup.com/article/2016/09/14/say-disabled-person-instead-person-disabilities/">disabled veterans</a> seeking to open and operate a Curio Wellness franchise with a path to 100% ownership in three years.</p>
<p>Registre tells TechCrunch the goal is to create more diverse ownership through a proven business model. Participants of this program gain access to capital and operational resources.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Curio made a name for itself in Maryland, where it&#8217;s the largest cannabis cultivator by market share. Founded in 2014, the family-owned business operates dispensaries rooted in a patient-centric approach. While a legally separate but affiliated entity from Curio Wellness, the Curio WMBE Fund aims to give franchisees access to Curio&#8217;s secret sauce.</p>
<p>&#8220;In looking at the systemic barriers that women, minorities and disabled veterans face in accessing capital, we decided to develop a solution that directly addresses this massive economic disparity,&#8221; said Michael Bronfein, CEO of Curio Wellness. &#8220;The Fund provides qualifying entrepreneurs with the investment capital they need to become a Curio Wellness Center franchisee while ensuring their success through our best in class business operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s bottle the success we have,&#8221; Registre added. He likens the franchise model to McDonald&#8217;s, where the national corporation gives operators a proven standard operating procedure and ongoing support.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our fund is unlike any other in the industry,&#8221; Registre said, &#8220;as eligible entrepreneurs will have a clear path to 100% ownership in as little as three years. Many other funds rely on a model that utilizes minority entrepreneurs as a vehicle to achieve licenses: The Curio approach flips this model by empowering diverse entrepreneurs and supporting them along the way. If something happens and an investment-funded franchisee defaults, they must be replaced by another minority or woman owner. This ensures these licensees can get the financial support they need to launch while ensuring that the fund&#8217;s ultimate mission of supporting diverse entrepreneurs is achieved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Registre explained that diversity is central to Curio Wellness, too. Of the company&#8217;s 200 employees, 40% are female, and more than half are minorities. At the leadership level, 38% of management is female, and 44% identify as a member of a minority community.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diversity is a core asset that we recognize as integral to our success and our future, and that is why we decided to create this investment fund,&#8221; Registre said.</p>
<p>The fund provides two phases of support. The first provides capital to franchisees to open their Curio Wellness Center and assist them in obtaining licenses, selecting a location and hiring and training employees. Once the location is operational, the fund intends to provide ongoing support around managing, sales and marketing, store operations, and ensuring employees stay updated on product information.</p>
<p>Curio sees its locations as more than cannabis dispensaries. The company calls them Wellness Centers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Curio locations go beyond the traditional experience people have at a medical cannabis dispensary &#8212; they are total wellness destinations, under the leadership of a licensed pharmacist,&#8221; Registre explains. &#8220;Patient wellness is at the center of everything we do and is exemplified by a diverse array of holistic health products, services and educational programming we offer. While additive to the medical cannabis patient experience, these features open the store up to the entire community, not limiting the healthcare experience to only those with a medical cannabis card. This practice, of a patient-first mindset through a pharmacist-led model, allows us to truly lead the pursuit of wellness for everyone who walks in the front door.&#8221;</p>
<p>As of writing, the fund has raised half of its $30 million target. The company says the fund intentionally targeted, pitched and secured an investment pool that includes women and minorities. The fund expects to close by the end of 2020, and applications are expected to open in early 2021.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to The Station, a newsletter dedicated to all the present and future ways people and packages move from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>For all my American readers, I hope you&#8217;re happy and satiated from the Thanksgiving holiday in this oddest of years. My hope for all Station readers, no matter where you reside, is a safe and healthy remainder of the year (and beyond!). While I took some time off last week, the news wheel kept on turning. A few of items got my attention last week, notably an EY study that examined how views on public transit, mobility as a service and car ownership are changing due to COVID-19. Let&#8217;s get reading!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Lime is adding another 1,000 scooters in San Francisco, an action it is able to take because the company also holds Jump&#8217;s permit in the city. For those who might have forgotten, Lime now owns Jump through a complex deal with Uber.</p>
<p>The company also released San Francisco scooter ridership data that shows how trip start and ends have moved outside of the downtown core and into neighborhoods like the Mission, Castro and Hayes Valley. Lime said this changing ridership pattern is consistent with its findings across the country, with more trips moving to residential neighborhoods since the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the globe.</p>

<p>Another day, another SPAC. Anyone else looking forward to a good old fashioned S-1 filing?</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/metromile" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="metromile">Metromile, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the pay-per-mile auto insurer, is credited for disrupting some of the inefficiencies of the auto insurance business model, notably how consumers are charged. Instead of a standard flat fee, the company charges customers based on their mileage, which it is able to measure via a device plugged into the vehicle.</p>
<p>That sounds like the kind of business model that might see an uptick in new customers during COVID pandemic times. And that did eventually happen. However, during the space between existing customers reducing their driving time and new drivers signing up with Metromile, the company was forced to lay off about one-third of its workforce.</p>
<p>The company has since recovered and now it&#8217;s taking the SPAC path to the public markets. Metromile plans to merge with special purpose acquisition company INSU Acquisition Corp. II, with an equity valuation of $1.3 billion. The company raised $160 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE, in an investment round led by Chamath Palihapitiya&#8217;s firm Social Capital.</p>
<p>Metromile plans to use those proceeds to reduce existing debt and accelerate growth, specifically to hire employees to support its consumer insurance and enterprise businesses, and grow beyond its eight-state geographic footprint to a goal of 21 states by the end of next year and nationwide coverage by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>For details on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/pay-per-mile-auto-insurer-metromile-is-heading-to-public-markets-via-spac/">Metromile SPAC</a> head on over to my story.

<h3><strong>Another giant deal </strong></h3>
<p>Manbang — described as the Chinese Uber for trucks — was formed in 2017 through a merger between rivals Yunmanman and Huochebang. The company&#8217;s app matches truck drivers and merchants transporting cargo and provides financial services to truckers.</p>
<p>Apparently, investors can&#8217;t get enough of these kinds of freight app businesses. Manbang is the latest example with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/manbang-1-7-billion-funding/">$1.7 billion haul</a> from Softbank Vision Fund, Sequoia Capital China, Permira and Fidelity, a consortium that co-led the round. Other participants were Hillhouse Capital, GGV Capital, Lightspeed China Partners, Tencent, Jack Ma&#8217;s YF Capital and more.</p>
<p>This is just two years after the company raised $1.9 billion. Manbang said it achieved profitability this year. Its valuation was reportedly on course to reach $10 billion in 2018.</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s raining dollars!</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_1996432" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1236085488.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1996432" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1996432 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1236085488.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1236085488.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1236085488.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1236085488.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1236085488.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1236085488.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1236085488.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1996432" class="wp-caption-text"> Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>For <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> that is.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re all aware, but in case you missed it, Tesla&#8217;s market cap surpassed $500 billion last week. As of today (Monday), it sits at $547 billion — a more than fivefold increase since the start of the year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s likely that price will push higher thanks to its imminent inclusion on the S&amp;P 500 Index. When Tesla joins the S&amp;P 500 on December 21, it will be among the most valuable companies on the benchmark. Its weighting will be so influential that the S&amp;P DJI is mulling whether to add the stock at the full float-adjusted market capitalization weight all at once or in two tranches.</p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s addition to the S&amp;P 500 isn&#8217;t just a symbolic nod. Joining the S&amp;P 500 has real financial benefits, as investors that have index-tracked funds will be forced to buy shares. With share prices already popping, that will mean investors will have to sell other stocks to make room for Tesla.</p>
<h2>The rise of the car</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s nearing December, which means I&#8217;ve been — and will continue to be — flooded with year-end surveys, studies and forecasts for 2021.</p>
<p>One study from EY, which <a href="https://www.ey.com/en_gl/automotive-transportation/how-mobility-can-help-build-a-better-post-covid-19-world">examined data from nine countries</a>, suggests that mobility as a service (MaaS) is losing momentum to the car, truck and SUV.</p>
<p>And millennials are driving the trend. The 2020 EY Mobility Consumer Index, which surveyed more than 3,300 consumers across nine countries, found that 31% of people without a car intend to buy one in the next six months with 45% of those will be millennials. The study also found that just 6% of non-car owners surveyed are looking to buy an all-electric vehicle.</p>
<p>More than three-quarters (78%) of respondents said they&#8217;re going to be more likely to use their cars for travel in a post-pandemic world with millennials making more than half of that number (52%), according to EY.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just a U.S. phenomenon. Respondents from Italy (47%) and Germany (46%) said they&#8217;re more likely to purchase a new car. Respondents from China were most likely to increase their car usage (90% of respondents), closely followed by India (85%) and Germany (81%).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, public transport use is expected to decline by around 30%.</p>
<p>John Simlett, EY Global Future of Mobility Leader, raises several questions in the study.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With more people buying cars and car usage expected to increase, this leaves policymakers with some very difficult questions to answer: How to accommodate all these cars on our roads aim for a more diverse mobility mix? How will this trend impact public transport investment? Quite simply, is this sustainable, and if not, what needs to be done and by whom?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Readers: what are your answers? Send them my way.</strong></p>

<p>And finally, the news smorgasbord you&#8217;ve been waiting for.</p>
<p><strong>Ford&#8217;s</strong> all-electric Mustang Mach-E has an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/the-epa-says-the-ford-mustang-mach-es-electric-range-is-a-lackluster-211-300-miles/">estimated EPA range</a> of between 211 miles to 300 miles, depending on the model. While the Mach-E matched Ford&#8217;s range target, it&#8217;s well under that found in competing vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Gatik</strong>, the autonomous vehicle startup focused on the &#8220;middle mile,&#8221; is expanding into Canada through a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/gatiks-self-driving-box-trucks-to-shuttle-groceries-for-loblaw-in-canada/">partnership with retail giant Loblaw</a>. The company, which also announced $25 million in fresh funding, already uses its self-driving box trucks to deliver customer online grocery orders for Walmart.</p>
<p>Gatik is deploying five autonomous box trucks in Toronto to deliver goods for Loblaw starting in January 2021. The fleet will be used seven days a week on five routes along public roads. All vehicles will have a safety driver as a co-pilot. This deployment, which follows a 10-month pilot in the Toronto area, marks the first autonomous delivery fleet in Canada.</p>
<p><strong>General Motors</strong> changed sides in a battle over whether states &#8212; and specifically California &#8212; can set tailpipe emissions regulations and other rules meant to mitigate climate change that are stricter than the federal government. The automaker said it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/gm-dumps-trump-to-side-with-california-in-emissions-rules-fight/">no longer back the Trump administration&#8217;s lawsuit</a> to prevent California from setting its own rules.</p>
<p><strong>May Mobility</strong>, the autonomous shuttle startup backed by Toyota, has a new partnership with on-demand shuttle platform Via. (I missed this item in the last newsletter). The aim is for the companies to combine their expertise to expand services to new cities in 2021. May Mobility will use Via&#8217;s fleet platform for booking, routing, passenger and vehicle assignment and identification, customer experience, and fleet management of its autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p><strong><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ola" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ola">Ola</strong>, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Uber and other ride-hailing firms in India will be only able draw a fee of up to 20% on ride fares. The new rules are  a setback for the SoftBank-backed firms, which are already struggling to improve their finances in the key overseas market.</p>
<p>The guidelines, which for the first time bring modern-age app-based ride-hailing firms under a regulatory framework in the country, also put a cap on the so-called surge pricing, the fare Uber and Ola charge during hours when their services see peak demands, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/india-sets-rules-for-commissions-surge-pricing-for-uber-and-ola/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Manish Singh reports</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cred-6ab0" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cred-6ab0">CRED, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a two-year-old startup that is helping <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/india-cred-kunal-shah/">credit card users in India improve their financial behaviour</a>, has raised $80 million in a new financing round, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The new financing round, a Series C for <a href="https://www.cred.club/">CRED</a>, was led by existing investor DST Global. Much of the round &#8212; in fact, if not whole &#8212; has been financed by existing investors including Sequoia Capital and Ribbit Capital that are doubling down on Kunal Shah’s startup, the source said on the condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to the media.</p>
<p>The new round gives CRED a post-money valuation of about $800 million, the source said. That&#8217;s up from about $450 million valuation that CRED attained after its $120 million Series B round last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A CRED spokesperson declined to comment.</p>
<p>On CRED, customers are offered a range of features, including the ability to better track their spendings across various credit cards, and get reminders. Moreover, CRED incentivizes customers to pay their bill on time by rewarding them points, which they can use to subscribe to a range of premium services and get a discount on purchase of high-quality products.</p>
<p>The platform is not available to all credit card holders in India. The startup requires a customer to have a certain credit score &#8212; about 750 &#8212; to be able to sign up for the service. This way, CRED has built a customer base that comprise of some of the most sought-after people in India.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">CRED is 2 years old now. As a founder it’s a privilege to build a missionary company with immense support from the whole ecosystem. I am eternally grateful to everyone who’s helped us become better everyday.</p>
<p>We are far from perfect, but heading in the right direction. Thank you.</p>
<p>&mdash; Kunal Shah (@kunalb11) <a href="https://twitter.com/kunalb11/status/1331832025418850304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In recent quarters, CRED has introduced a number of additional services including allowing customers to pay their rent using their credit card, and bulked up its e-commerce store. What other ways Shah, who previously ran mobile wallet service Freecharge and is celebrated for delivering one of the few successful exits in the nation&#8217;s 15-year-old startup ecosystem, wants to serve these customers remains a big question.</p>
<p>&#8220;CRED has the richest Indians as customers already,&#8221; <a href="https://hind.substack.com/p/cred-unicorn-or-popcorn">wrote</a> Anmol Maini, a San Francisco based engineer, who closely tracks the Indian startup ecosystem. &#8220;Kunal Shah has the luxury of time for building CRED into the company he envisions it to be. He has that luxury because he has access to capital and talent, knows how to build and scale companies and he definitely knows how to generate returns for his investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new funds come at a time when CRED is enjoying a surge in its growth. The startup, which was one of the sponsors of recently concluded IPL cricket tournament, ran a number of clever and fun advertisements during the tournament featuring Indian legends. And those ads worked.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A couple of years ago, French President <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/emmanuel-macron" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="emmanuel-macron">Emmanuel Macron <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/23/50-tech-ceos-come-to-paris-to-talk-about-tech-for-good/">initiated</a> the Tech for Good Summit by inviting 50 tech CEOs to discuss the challenges in the tech industry and make some announcements.</p>
<p>Usually, tech CEOs meet ahead of <a href="https://vivatechnology.com">Viva Technology</a>, a tech event in Paris. This year, Viva Technology had to be canceled, which means that tech CEOs couldn’t get together, take a group photo and say that they want to make the world a better place.</p>
<p>In the meantime, dozens of tech CEOs have chosen to sign a common pledge. Despite the positive impact of some technological breakthroughs, they collectively recognize that everything is not perfect with the tech industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Recognizing that such progress may be hindered by negative externalities, including unfair competition such as abuse of dominant or systemic position, and fragmentation of the internet; that, without appropriate safeguards, technology can also be used to threaten fundamental freedoms and human rights or weaken democracy; that, unless we implement appropriate measures to combat it, some individuals and organizations inevitably use it for criminal purposes, including in the context of conflicts,” the pledge says.</p>
<p>Among other things, companies that sign the pledge agree to cooperate when it comes to fighting toxic content, such as child sexual abuse material and terrorist content. They promise to “responsibly address hate speech, disinformation and opinion manipulation.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, they also agree that they should “contribute fairly to the taxes in countries where [they] operate.” This has been an ongoing issue between the French government and the U.S. government. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> and the European Union have also discussed implementing a tax on tech giants so that they report to tax authorities in each country where they operate.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VRmce2UwcF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/france-starts-collecting-tax-on-tech-giants/">France starts collecting tax on tech giants</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;France starts collecting tax on tech giants&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/france-starts-collecting-tax-on-tech-giants/embed/#?secret=VRmce2UwcF" data-secret="VRmce2UwcF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Other commitments mention privacy, social inclusiveness, diversity and equity, fighting all sorts of discriminations and more. As the name suggests, the pledge revolves around using technology for good things.</p>
<p>Now let’s talk about who signed the pledge. There are some well-known names, such as Sundar Pichai from Alphabet (Google), Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook, Brad Smith from Microsoft, Evan Spiegel from Snap and Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and Square. Other companies include Cisco, Deliveroo, Doctolib, IBM, OpenClassrooms, Uber, etc.</p>
<p>Some nonprofit organizations also signed the pledge, such as the Mozilla Foundation, Simplon, Tech for Good France, etc.</p>
<p>But it’s more interesting to see who’s <em>not</em> on the list. Amazon and Apple have chosen not to sign the pledge. There have been discussions with Apple but the company eventually chose not to participate.</p>
<p>“Amazon didn’t want to sign it and I invite you to ask them directly,” a source close to the French president said. The French government is clearly finger-pointing in Amazon’s case.</p>
<p>This is an odd move as it’s a non-binding pledge. You can say that you want to “contribute fairly to taxes” and then argue that you’re paying everything that you owe — tax optimization is not tax evasion, after all. Worse, you can say that you’re building products with “privacy by design” in mind while you’re actually building entire companies based on personalized ads and micro-targeting.</p>
<p>In other words, the Tech for Good summit was created for photo opportunities (like this photo from 2018 below). Tech CEOs want to be treated like heads of state, while Macron wants to position himself as a tech-savvy president. It’s a win-win for them, and a waste of time for everyone else.</p>
<p>Some nonprofit organizations and governance groups are actually working hard to build digital commons. But big tech companies are using the same lexicon with these greenwashing-style campaigns.</p>
<p>In 2018, hundreds of organizations signed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/12/with-the-paris-call-macron-wants-to-limit-cyberattacks/">the Paris Call</a>. In 2019, the biggest social media companies signed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/world-leaders-ask-tech-giants-to-tackle-toxic-content-with-christchurch-call/">the Christchurch Call</a>. And now, we have the Tech for Good Call. Those calls can’t replace proper regulation.</p>

		Dominik Schiener is co-Founder and Chairman of the <a href="https://www.iota.org/">IOTA Foundation</a>. He has been in the blockchain space since 2011, with several startups in Switzerland, UK and Germany. His primary focus is how to improve physical infrastructure with digital infrastructure such as DLT and AI. 	</div>

		Mathew is Head of Mobility and Automotive at the <a href="https://www.iota.org/">IOTA Foundation</a>, where he develops strategy and solutions around the use of data with distributed ledger technology-based innovations. These solutions focus on enabling flexible and privacy-centric data and value transfer within the public sector for use in smart cities, critical infrastructure, environmental and energy systems, and mobility-focused data industries.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">In the United States, critical city, state and federal infrastructure is falling behind. While heavy investment, planning and development have gone into the U.S. infrastructure system, much of it is not keeping up with the pace of new technology, and some of it hasn&#8217;t had a proper update in decades, instead just adding new systems onto old systems. This can be allotted to a combination of liability structures in the U.S., difficulty in enabling interconnection between infrastructure in different jurisdictions, worry over introducing large-scale security risks and an attempt to mitigate that risk.</p>
<p>There is interest in upgrading city systems to be more efficient, to be more in line with real-time demand and to move into the 21st century, but it&#8217;s going to take work. It&#8217;s also going to take new technology.</p>
<p>Distributed ledger technology (DLT), when applied correctly, can do for a city&#8217;s infrastructure what existing technologies cannot. Where existing technologies are heavy, requiring expensive servers and a larger energy draw, distributed ledger technology is light and can be implemented on individual nodes (code environments) and directly onto things like traffic light sensors. It also allows for more oversight from a privacy perspective. The ability to bring distributed ledger technology into lightweight frameworks allows for more security and upgrades to critical infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Benefits of smart infrastructure</h2>
<p>The biggest impact of smart infrastructure is that it enables local governments to focus on the reason they’re there in the first place; to increase the quality of life of the local residents, bring stability and culture to local businesses, and create a welcoming and frictionless environment for tourists or visitors. Governments can create stability, streamline sources of revenue, and integrate a frictionless operational environment for people and organizations in their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Consider transportation infrastructure. A lot of revenue in cities and states comes from things like tolls and roadside parking, and of course taxes. States control the highways, interstates, and tolling infrastructure commonly through collaboration with service providers. Cities control the local roadside and passthrough streets and the revenue accrued through parking solutions. With the pandemic, these resources have dried up due to people staying at home, social distancing, using less public transit and working remotely.</p>
<p>This now offers an opportunity for an expanded example of the desire to understand the transportation flow. If cities had more real time insights into this, they&#8217;d be able to understand the demand and have a more fluidly flowing traffic condition. This can be done through new technologies such as what are seen deployed in Singapore like green link determinings systems, parking guidance systems, and expressway monitoring systems allowing for enhanced traffic awareness and guidance.</p>
<p>There are also keen ways to incentivize traffic guidance while bringing stability to local small and medium businesses throughout cities such as using parking guidance systems to enable local businesses to offer discounts for parking nearby.</p>
<p>An open transportation grid (in the sense of data points gathered for streamlining and managing) can create smoother traffic patterns in cities with smaller road grids. Transportation centers could communicate with delivery services, understanding their routes and setting up parking reservation windows. Traffic flow could be managed so that delivery services are able to get in and out without causing back-ups on tight, busy roads.</p>
<p>Another offering of smart infrastructure can be seen with cross border connections for transportation of goods and services. The ownership of infrastructure in the U.S. is highly fragmented; with cities owning local and neighborhood roadsides, and states owning highways and interstates. This also means that the infrastructure supporting this is highly distributed, because each entity has to have it’s own systems in place to support their infrastructure, typically using different solutions, services and data structures.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/deepmind" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="deepmind">DeepMind, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the AI technology company that&#8217;s part of Google parent Alphabet, has achieved a significant breakthrough in AI-based protein structure prediction. The company announced today that its AlphaFold system has officially solved a protein folding grand challenge that has flummoxed the scientific community for 50 years. The advance inn DeepMind&#8217;s AlphaFold capabilities could lead to a significant leap forward in areas like our understanding of disease, as well as future drug discovery and development.</p>
<p>The test that AlphaFold passed essentially shows that the AI can correctly figure out, to a very high degree of accuracy (accurate to within the width of an atom, in fact), the structure of proteins in just days – a very complex task that is crucial to figuring out how diseases can be best treated, as well as solving other big problems like working out how best to break down ecologically dangerous material like toxic waste. You may have heard of &#8216;Folding@Home,&#8217; the program that allows people to contribute their own home computing (and formerly, game console) processing power to protein folding experiments. That massive global crowdsourcing effort was necessary because using traditional methods, portion folding prediction takes years and is extremely expensive in terms of straight cost, and computing resources.</p>
<p>DeepMind&#8217;s approach involves using an &#8220;Attentionb-basd neural network system&#8221; (basically a neural network that can focus on specific inputs in order to increase efficiency). It&#8217;s able to continually refine its own predictive graph of possible protein folding outcomes based on their folding history, and provide highly accurate predictions as a result.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>How proteins fold – or go from being a random string of amino acids when originally created, to a complex 3D structure in their final stable form – is key to understanding how diseases are transmitted, as well as how common conditions like allergies work. If you understand the folding process, you can potentially alter it, halting an infection&#8217;s progress mid-stride, or conversely, correct mistakes in folding that can lead to neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders.</p>
<p>DeepMind&#8217;s technological leap could make accurately predicting these folds a much less time- and resource-consuming process, which could dramatically change the pace at which our understanding of diseases and therapeutics progresses. This could come in handy to address major global threats including future potential pandemics like the COVID-19 crisis we&#8217;re currently enduring, by predicting viral protein structures to a high degree of accuracy early in the appearance fo any new future threats like SARS-CoV-2, thus speeding up the development of potential effective treatments and vaccines.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The rumors ignited last Thursday that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/slacks-stock-climbs-on-possible-salesforce-acquisition/">Salesforce had interest in Slack</a>. This morning, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/30/salesforce-deal-to-buy-slack-expected-to-be-announced-tomorrow.html">CNBC is reporting</a> the deal is all but done and will be announced tomorrow. Chances are, this is going to a big number, but this won&#8217;t be Salesforce&#8217;s first big acquisition. We thought it would be useful in light of these rumors to look back at the company&#8217;s biggest deals.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/how-salesforce-beat-its-own-target-to-reach-20b-run-rate-ahead-of-schedule/">already surpassed $20 billion in annual revenue</a>, and the company has a history of making a lot of deals to fill in the road map and give it more market lift as it searches for ever more revenue.</p>
<p>The biggest deal by far so far was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/10/salesforce-is-buying-data-visualization-company-tableau-for-15-7b-in-all-stock-deal/">the $15.7 billion Tableau acquisition</a> last year. The deal gave Salesforce a missing data visualization component and a company with a huge existing market to feed the revenue beast. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/how-salesforce-beat-its-own-target-to-reach-20b-run-rate-ahead-of-schedule/">In an interview in August</a> with TechCrunch, Salesforce president and chief operating officer Bret Taylor (who came to the company in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/salesforce-buys-word-processing-app-quip-for-750m/">$750 million Quip deal in 2016</a>), sees Tableau as a key part of the company&#8217;s growing success:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>“Tableau is so strategic, both from a revenue and also from a technology strategy perspective,” he said. That’s because as companies make the shift to digital, it becomes more important than ever to help them visualize and understand that data in order to understand their customers’ requirements better.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Next on the Salesforce acquisition hit parade was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/salesforce-is-buying-mulesoft-at-enterprise-value-of-6-5-billion/">the $6.5 billion Mulesoft acquisition in 2018</a>. Mulesoft gave Salesforce access to something it didn&#8217;t have as an enterprise SaaS company &#8212; data locked in silos across the company, even in on-prem applications. The CRM giant could leverage Mulesoft to access data wherever it lived, and when you put the two mega deals together, you could see how you could visualize that data and also give more fuel to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/19/salesforce-einstein-celebrates-its-first-birthday-with-a-couple-of-new-features/">Einstein intelligence layer</a>.</p>

<p>In 2016, the company spent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/01/salesforce-buys-demandware-for-2-8b-taking-a-big-step-into-e-commerce/">$2.8 billion on Demandware</a> to make a big splash in e-Commerce, a component of the platform that has grown in importance during the pandemic when companies large and small have been forced to move their businesses online. The company was incorporated into the Salesforce behemoth and became known as Commerce Cloud.</p>

<p>In 2013, the company made its first billion dollar acquisition when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/04/with-exacttarget-acquisition-salesforce-com-has-spent-close-to-3-5-billion-to-get-into-the-chief-marketing-officers-suite/">it bought ExactTarget for $2.5 billion</a>. This represented the first foray into what would become the Marketing Cloud. The purchase gave the company entree into the targeted email marketing business, which again would grow increasingly in importance in 2020 when communicating with customers became crucial during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Last year, just days after closing the Mulesoft acquisition, Salesforce opened its wallet one more time and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/07/salesforce-is-acquiring-clicksoftware-for-1-35b/">paid $1.35 billion for ClickSoftware</a>. This one was a nod to the company&#8217;s Service cloud, which encompasses both customer service and field service. This acquisition was about the latter, and giving the company access to a bigger body of field service customers.</p>

<p>The final billion deal (until we hear about <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/slack" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="slack">Slack <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> perhaps) is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/salesforce-grabs-vlocity-for-1-33b-a-startup-with-1b-valuation/">$1.33 billion Vlocity acquisition</a> earlier this year. This one was a gift for the core CRM product. Vlocity gave Salesforce several vertical businesses built on the Salesforce platform and was a natural fit for the company. Using Vlocity&#8217;s platform, Salesforce could (and did) continue to build on these vertical markets giving it more ammo to sell into specialized markets.</p>
<p>While we can&#8217;t know for sure if the Slack deal will happen, it sure feels like it will, and chances are this deal will be even larger than Tableau as the Salesforce acquisition machine keeps chugging along.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://materialize.com/">Materialize</a>, the SQL streaming database startup built on top of the open source <a href="https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/timely-dataflow">Timely Dataflow</a> project, announced a $32 million Series B investment today led by Kleiner Perkins with participation from Lightspeed Ventures.</p>
<p>While it was at it, the company also announced a previously unannounced $8 million Series A from last year that had been led by Lightspeed, bringing the total raised to $40 million.</p>
<p>These firms see a solid founding team that includes CEO Arjun Narayan, formerly of Cockroach Labs, and chief scientist Frank McSherry, who created the Timely Dataflow project on which the company is based.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Narayan says that the company believes fundamentally that every company needs to be a real-time company and it will take a streaming database to make that happen. Further, he says the company is built using SQL because of its ubiquity, and the founders wanted to make sure that customers could access and make use of that data quickly without learning a new query language.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is really to help any business to understand streaming data and build intelligent applications without using or needing any specialized skills. Fundamentally what that means is that you&#8217;re going to have to go to businesses using the technologies and tools that they understand, which is standard SQL,&#8221; Narayan explained.</p>
<p>Bucky Moore, the partner at Kleiner Perkins leading the B round sees this standard querying ability as a key part of the technology. &#8220;As more businesses integrate streaming data into their decision making pipelines, the inability to ask questions of this data with ease is becoming a non-starter. Materialize&#8217;s unique ability to provide SQL over streaming data solves this problem, laying the foundation for them to build the industry&#8217;s next great data platform,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>They would naturally get compared to <a href="https://www.confluent.io/">Confluent</a>, a streaming database built on top of the <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a> open source streaming database project, but Narayan says his company uses straight SQL for querying, while Confluent uses its own flavor.</p>
<p>The company still is working out the commercial side of the house and currently provides a typical service offering for paying customers with support and a service agreement (SLA). The startup is working on a SaaS version of the product, which it expects to release some time next year.</p>

<p>They currently have 20 employees with plans to double that number by the end of next year as they continue to build out the product. As they grow, Narayan says the company is definitely thinking about how to build a diverse organization.</p>
<p>He says he&#8217;s found that hiring in general has been challenging during the pandemic, and he hopes that changes in 2021, but he says that he and his co-founders are looking at the top of the hiring funnel because otherwise, as he points out, it&#8217;s easy to get complacent and rely on the same network of people you have been working with before, which tends to be less diverse.</p>
<p>&#8220;The KPIs and the metrics we really want to use to ensure that we really are putting in the extra effort to ensure a diverse sourcing in your hiring pipeline and then following that through all the way through the funnel. That&#8217;s I think the most important way to ensure that you have a diverse [employee base], and I think this is true for every company,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While he is working remotely now, he sees having multiple offices with a headquarters in NYC when the pandemic finally ends. Some employees will continue to work remotely, but the majority coming into one of the offices.</p>

<p>This is <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/equity-87d6" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="equity-87d6">Equity <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest big news, chats about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a> — and don’t forget to check out last Thursday&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/equity-dive-edtechs-2020-wakeup-call/">edtech deep dive from our own Natasha Mascarenhas</a>.</p>
<p>Right, now through the first of America&#8217;s national Q4 feast days, it&#8217;s time to get back to business. Namely, the business of VC and startups. Here&#8217;s what we got into this morning:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s Cyber Monday, which means that the Internet is going to be annoying today, but the fake-holiday is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/27/black-friday-2020-live-updates.html">boosting ecommerce players like Etsy</a>. That should be good news for payments processors incumbent and startup, as well as other ecommerce businesses, again large, small, and even platform-focused.</li>
<li>Zappos founder Tony Hsieh <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/28/tony-hsieh-iconic-las-vegas-tech-entrepreneur-dies-aged-46/">passed away this weekend</a>. It was a surprise. He was loved.</li>
<li>The UK is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-30/u-k-unveils-5g-plan-banning-huawei-installations-from-september?sref=gni836kR">banning China&#8217;s Huawei 5G gear next year</a> as <a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorWong/status/1333274509076353024">Australia condemns China over a different matter</a>. So if you are keeping tally of countries where Chinese tech may no longer be welcome, the list is certainly longer than merely India, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/india-bans-another-43-chinese-apps/">banned all popular China-built apps from its mobile phones</a>.</li>
<li>These broader tensions are <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/grab-defence-grabs-big-hit">changing where VCs are investing their money</a>, notably.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/29/primed-for-accel/">Primer, the fintech helping merchants consolidate the payments stack, raises £14M Series A</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/hungrypanda-raises-70m-for-a-food-delivery-app-aimed-at-overseas-chinese-consumers/">HungryPanda raises $70M for a food delivery app aimed at overseas Chinese consumers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/29/firstminute-capital-launches-second-111-fund-featuring-a-whos-who-of-founders-as-lps/">Firstminute Capital launches second $111M fund, featuring a who’s-who of founders as LPs</a></li>
<li>And finally, we are heading into a deluge of IPOs over the next few weeks. So strap in, it&#8217;s going to be messy and fun.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/doordash" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="doordash">DoorDash <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520304953/d752207ds1a.htm">filed a new S-1 document</a>, this time updating the market about the price it expects to command during its public offering. The food-delivery giant gave a range of $75 to $85 per share, which would revalue the company sharply higher <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/after-ipo-delays-doordash-confirms-400m-raise/">than its final private price</a>, set during a June Series H that valued DoorDash at $16 billion.</p>
<p>The company intends to sell 33 million shares, raising between $2.475 billion and $2.805 billion in the process. Notably, there are no shares set aside for its underwriting banks to buy at its IPO price.</p>

<hr />
<p>After the public offering, DoorDash expects to have 317,656,521 shares outstanding across various classes, giving it a valuation of between $23.8 billion and $27 billion at the two extremes of its IPO range, not counting shares that have not yet vested or are set aside for future employee compensation. CNBC calculates that the company could be worth up to $30 billion on a fully-diluted basis.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>What matters more than the raw dollar amounts, however, is what we can learn from them. Let&#8217;s get into the guts of the valuation range and find out if it&#8217;s bullish or if we should anticipate DoorDash to raise its range before it goes public.</p>
<h2>Valuations, ranges</h2>
<p>The new DoorDash S-1/A filing, it doesn&#8217;t appear to contain new financial information, so we can keep <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/doordash-files-to-go-public/">our prior notes</a> on the company&#8217;s health and performance in mind. Recall that we were generally impressed by DoorDash&#8217;s growth and its improving profitability.</p>
<p>Other on-demand food services are doing well: HungryPanda <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/hungrypanda-raises-70m-for-a-food-delivery-app-aimed-at-overseas-chinese-consumers/">just raised $70 million</a>, and on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/ubers-delivery-business-is-now-larger-than-ride-hailing/">the back of Uber Eats&#8217; growth</a> &#8212; and optimism that its ride-hailing business will return with the market-readiness of strong COVID-19 vaccines &#8212; shares of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> are at all-time highs.</p>
<p>So you can taste the optimism that DoorDash is riding as it looks to list. Given our take, you would be forgiven for presuming that DoorDash is targeting an aggressive price.</p>
<p>Is it?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM is backing away from an agreement to take a stake in electric automaker Nikola Corp, marking the collapse of a deal that has been problematic since it was announced just two months ago.</p>
<p>Nikola shares were down 24.75% as of 11:12 am ET Monday morning.</p>
<p>GM has instead signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding to supply Nikola with its Hydrotec fuel cell system. This supplier agreement replaces its previous transaction announcement made on Sept. 8, 2020 to take a 11% stake in Nikola and produce a fuel cell pickup for the company by the end 2022. The investment was valued at $2 billion at the time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speculation that GM would pull the plug on the deal has been rampant almost from the start. Just days after GM announced the investment, a noted short-seller Hindenburg Research accused the Nikola of fraud. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/sec-to-investigate-short-sellers-claims-against-nikola-report-says/">opened up an inquiry</a> in the matter and within two weeks Nikola&#8217;s founder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/nikolas-chairman-steps-down-stock-crashes-following-allegations-of-fraud/">Trveor Milton had stepped down</a> as executive chairman.</p>
<p>Stephen Girsky, a former General Motors executive who was already on the company’s board and who introduced Nikola to GM, took over as executive chairman.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Nikola&#8217;s troubles aren&#8217;t over. GM&#8217;s wording in its announcement suggests as much. GM describes the non-binding MoU as a &#8220;potential agreement.&#8221; If it goes through, GM would engineer its Hydrotec fuel cell system to the specifications mutually agreed upon by both companies. It is expected that the potential arrangement would be &#8220;cost plus,&#8221; meaning that Nikola would pay upfront for the capital investment for the capacity. The companies are also discussing the potential of a supply agreement for GM&#8217;s Ultium battery system for Nikola&#8217;s Class 7 and Class 8 trucks.</p>
<p>Doug Parks, GM executive vice president of global product development, purchasing and supply chain said supplying the Hydrotec fuel cell systems to heavy-duty class of commercial vehicles is an important part GM&#8217;s growth strategy and reinforces the company&#8217;s commitment toward an all-electric, zero-emissions future.&#8221;</p>
<p>GM&#8217;s Hydrotec fuel cell system will be engineered at its Michigan technical facilities in Pontiac and Warren and manufactured at its Brownstown Charter Township battery assembly plant, the company said.</p>

<p>And yet, shortly after its release last year, the community of Raspberry Pi users noticed that the single-board computer tends to get hot. In some cases, it becomes so hot that the device has no choice but to throttle the frequency of the CPU.</p>
<p>That problem is particularly noticeable if you’re using the official case as it prevents proper ventilation. Over the past year, the foundation has released a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/thermal-testing-raspberry-pi-4/">software update</a> focused on power optimization.</p>
<p>While it solves the issue in some cases, it’s not a magic fix for all situations. Some users tend to use the computing power of the Raspberry Pi for long periods.</p>
<p>There are some <a href="https://flirc.tv/more/raspberry-pi-4-case">third-party cases</a> with a big heatsink. But the Raspberry Pi Foundation didn’t have its own solution for the issue.</p>
<p>According to the foundation, the tiny fan should be enough to prevent throttling. “It draws air in over the USB and Ethernet connectors, passes it over a small finned heatsink attached to the processor, and exhausts it through the SD card slot,” the Raspberry Pi Foundation says.</p>
<p>It’s a cheap stopgap solution, but I hope the Foundation will prioritize heat dissipation for the next iteration of the Raspberry Pi.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European Union lawmakers are considering whether current rules aimed at limiting the practice of geoblocking across the bloc should be extended to cover access to streaming audio-visual content.</p>
<p>Access to services like Netflix tends to be gated to individual EU Member States, meaning Europeans can be barred from accessing libraries of content offered elsewhere in the region. So if you&#8217;re trying to use your Netflix subscription to access the service after moving to another Member State, or want to access inventory offered by Netflix elsewhere in Europe, the answer is typically a big fat no, as we&#8217;ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/06/at-last-an-end-to-geoblocking-in-europe-nope-not-by-a-long-chalk/">reported before</a>.</p>
<p>This undermines the core concept of the EU&#8217;s Single Market (and the Digital Single Market &#8212; aka the frictionless ecommerce end-goal which rules such as those limiting geoblocking aim to deliver).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Commission is alive to ongoing issues around online access to audio-visual content. In a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/commission-publishes-its-short-term-review-geo-blocking-regulation">review</a> of the two-year-old Geo-blocking Regulation published today, it says it will kick off discussions with the audiovisual sector on ways to improve consumer access to this type of copyrighted content across the bloc.</p>
<p>It says the planned talks will feed its upcoming Media and Audiovisual Action Plan &#8212; which aims to help European market players scale up and reach new audiences. However it&#8217;s not committing to any specific actions as yet. So whether the push yields anything more nuanced than another &#8216;no&#8217; remains to be seen. (The movie industry being a blocker to freer digital flows of content is, after all, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/european-parliament-votes-for-controversial-copyright-reform/">not a new story</a>.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Increased access and circulation of audiovisual content will benefit an increasing demand across-borders, including in border regions and with linguistic minorities,&#8221; the Commission suggests in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/commission-publishes-its-short-term-review-geo-blocking-regulation">press release</a> on its review of the current rules.</p>
<p>It notes that on average a European consumer only has access to 14% of the films available online in all the Member States as a whole (the EU27), with &#8220;significant variations&#8221; by country (such as viewers in Greece having access only to 1.3% of the films available online in the EU, vs those in Germany having access to 43.1%).</p>
<p>Its review also highlights growing demand (especially for younger age ranges) to access audio-visual content offered in other Member States &#8212; noting it almost doubled between 2015 and 2019 (from 5% to 9%).</p>
<p>&#8220;A <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/survey/getsurveydetail/instruments/flash/surveyky/2221">2019 Eurobarometer</a> confirmed that there is interest in gaining access to audio-visual content offered in different Member States,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>For other types of copyrighted content &#8212; including music, e-books and videogames &#8212; the Commission sounds less convinced of the need for regulatory reform.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Report concludes that a further extension of the scope would not necessarily bring substantial benefits to consumers in terms of choice of content, as the catalogues offered are rather homogeneous (in many instances beyond 90%) among Member States,&#8221; it writes, also flagging &#8220;potential impacts&#8221; on the price of such services in Member States (which can vary).</p>
<p>After 18 months of application of the current Geo-blocking Regulation (in force since December 2018), the Commission review lauds progress in reducing some obstacles &#8212; claiming there&#8217;s been &#8220;a stark reduction in barriers caused by location requirements, from 26.9% down to 14% of approximately 9,000 websites surveyed&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such restrictions prevent users from attempting to register to foreign websites due to a postal address in another Member State, and is important because registration is a key stage of the online shopping process,&#8221; it notes.</p>
<p>&#8220;A further decrease in restrictions that users faced when trying to access websites cross-border was reported (e.g. users were denied access or automatically rerouted), the remainder of which was residual (only 0.2% of websites blocking access).&#8221;</p>
<p>It also credits the regulation with boosting the amount of cross-border delivery purchases, saying the increased access to cross-border websites provided by regulation led to an increase of 1.6% in the EU27 compared to 2015, adding that a third of the surveyed websites offered cross-border delivery.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, the internal market commissioner, ThierryBreton, said: “This first review of the Geo-blocking Regulation already shows first positive results. We will further monitor its effects and discuss with stakeholders, notably in the context of the Media and Audio-visual Action Plan to ensure the industry can scale up and reach new audiences, and consumers can fully enjoy the diversity of goods and services in the different EU Member States.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://servicenow.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ServiceNow</a>, the cloud-based IT services company, is making a significant acquisition today to fill out its longer-term strategy to be a big player in the worlds of automation and artificial intelligence for enterprises. It is acquiring <a href="https://www.elementai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Element AI</a>, a startup out of Canada.</p>
<p>Founded by AI pioneers and backed by some of the world&#8217;s biggest AI companies &#8212; it raised hundreds of millions of dollars from the likes of Microsoft, Intel, Nvidia and Tencent, among others &#8212; Element AI&#8217;s aim was to build and provision AI-based IT services for enterprises, in many cases organizations that are not technology companies by nature.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal are not being disclosed, a spokesperson told TechCrunch, but we now have multiple sources telling us the price was around $500 million. For some context, Element AI was valued at between <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/13/element-ai-raises-151m-on-a-600-700m-valuation-to-help-companies-build-and-run-ai-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$600 million and $700 million</a> when it last raised money, $151 million (or C$200 million at the time) in September 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even at $500 million, this deal would be ServiceNow&#8217;s biggest acquisition, although it would be a sizeable devaluation compared to the startup&#8217;s last price at fundraising.</p>
<p>A spokesperson confirmed that ServiceNow is making a full acquisition and will retain most of Element AI’s technical talent, including AI scientists and practitioners, but that it will be winding down its existing business after integrating what it wants and needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our focus with this acquisition is to gain technical talent and AI capabilities,&#8221; the spokesperson said. That will also include Element AI co-founder and CEO, JF Gagné, joining ServiceNow, and co-founder Dr. Yoshua Bengio taking on a role as technical advisor.</p>
<p>Those who are not part of those teams will be supported with severance or assistance in looking for other jobs within ServiceNow. A source estimated to us that this could affect around half of the organization.</p>
<p>The startup is headquartered in Montreal, and ServiceNow&#8217;s plan is to create an AI Innovation Hub based around that &#8220;to accelerate customer-focused AI innovation in the Now Platform.&#8221; (That is the brand name of its automation services.)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least, ServiceNow will start re-platforming some of Element AI’s capabilities, she said. &#8220;We expect to wind down most of Element AI’s customers after the deal is closed.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The deal is the latest move for a company aiming to build a modern platform fit for our times.</p>
<p>ServiceNow, under CEO Bill McDermott (who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/former-sap-ceo-bill-mcdermott-taking-over-as-servicenow-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joined in October 2019</a> from SAP), has been on a big investment spree in the name of bringing more AI and automation chops to the SaaS company. That has included a number of acquisitions this year, including<a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; border-bottom-color: #00a562;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/servicenow-to-acquire-belgian-configuration-management-startup-sweagle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sweagle</a>, <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/servicenow-acquires-conversational-ai-startup-passage-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Passage AI</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">,</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/servicenow-acquires-loom-systems-to-expand-aiops-coverage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loom</a> (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1373715/000137371520000257/now-20200930.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">respectively</a> for $25 million, $33 million and $58 million), plus regular updates to its larger workflow automation platform.</p>
<p>ServiceNow has been around since 2004, so it&#8217;s not strictly a legacy business, but all the same the publicly-traded company, with a current market cap of <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NOW?p=NOW&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly $103 billion</a>, is vying to position itself as the go-to company for &#8220;digital transformation&#8221; &#8212; <em>the</em> buzz term for enterprise IT services this year, as everyone scrambles to do more online, in the cloud, and remotely to continue operating through a global health pandemic and whatever comes in its wake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Technology is no longer supporting the business, technology is the business,&#8221; McDermott said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/servicenow-updates-its-workflow-automation-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">earlier this year</a>. In a tight market where it is completely plausible that Salesforce might scoop up Slack, ServiceNow is making a play for more tools to cover its own patch of the field.</p>
<p>“AI technology is evolving rapidly as companies race to digitally transform 20th century processes and business models,” said ServiceNow Chief AI Officer Vijay Narayanan, in a statement today. “ServiceNow is leading this once-in-a-generation opportunity to make work, work better for people. With Element AI’s powerful capabilities and world class talent, ServiceNow will empower employees and customers to focus on areas where only humans excel – creative thinking, customer interactions, and unpredictable work. That’s a smarter way to workflow.”</p>
<p>Element AI was always a very ambitious concept for a startup. Dr Yoshua Bengio, winner of the 2018 Turing Award who co-founded the company with AI expert Nicolas Chapados and Jean-François Gagné (Element AI&#8217;s CEO) alongside Anne Martel, Jean-Sebastien Cournoyer and Philippe Beaudoin, saw a gap in the market.</p>
<p>Their idea was to build AI services for businesses that were not tech companies in their DNA, but would still very much need to tap into the innovations of the tech world in order to continue growing and remaining competitive with said tech companies as the latter moved deeper into a wider range of industries and the companies themselves required increasing sophistication to operate and grow. They needed, in essence, to disrupt themselves before getting unceremoniously disrupted by someone else.</p>
<p>And on top of that, Element AI could work for and with the tech companies taking strategic investments in Element AI, as those investors wanted to tap some of that expertise themselves, as well as work with the startup to bring more services and win more deals in the enterprise. In addition to its four (sometimes fiercely competitive) investors, other backers included the likes of McKinsey.</p>
<p>Yet what form all of that would take was never completely clear.</p>
<p>When I covered the startup&#8217;s most recent tranche of funding last year, I noted that it wasn&#8217;t very forthcoming on who its customers actually where. Looking at its website, it still isn&#8217;t, although it does lay out several verticals where it aims to work. They include insurance, pharma, logistics, retail, supply chain, manufacturing, government and capital markets.</p>
<p>There were some other positive points. Element AI also played a strong ethics card with its AI For Good efforts, starting with work with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/23/element-ai-opens-london-outpost-with-focus-on-ai-for-good/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amnesty in 2018</a> and most recently <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/mozilla-partners-with-element-ai-to-spearhead-ethical-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla</a>. Indeed, 2018 &#8212; a year after Element AI was founded &#8212; was also the year AI seemed to hit the mainstream consciousness &#8212; and also start to appear somewhat more creepy, with algorithmic misfires, pervasive facial recognition, and more &#8220;automated&#8221; applications that didn&#8217;t work that well and so on &#8212; so launching an ethical aim definitely made sense.</p>
<p>But for all of that, it seems that there perhaps were not enough threads there to need a bigger cloth as a standalone business. <a href="https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Overview/Working-at-Element-AI-EI_IE1624154.11,21.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glassdoor reviews</a> also speak of an endemic disorganization at the startup, which might not have helped, or was perhaps a sign of bigger issues.</p>
<p>“Element AI’s vision has always been to redefine how companies use AI to help people work smarter,” said Element AI Founder and CEO, Jean-Francois Gagné in a statement. “ServiceNow is leading the workflow revolution and we are inspired by its purpose to make the world of work, work better for people. ServiceNow is the clear partner for us to apply our talent and technology to the most significant challenges facing the enterprise today.”</p>
<p>The acquisition is expected to be completed by early 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Drugmaker Moderna has completed its initial efficacy analysis of its COVID-19 vaccine from the drug&#8217;s Phase 3 clinical study, and determined that it was 94.1% effective in preventing people from contracting COVID-19 across 196 confirmed cases from among 30,000 participants in the study. Moderna also found that it was 100% effective in preventing severe cases (such as those that would require hospitalization) and says it hasn&#8217;t found any significant safety concerns during the trial. On the basis of these results, the company will file an application for emergency use authorization (EUA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Monday.</p>
<p>Seeking an EUA is the next step towards actually beginning to distribute and administer Moderna&#8217;s COVID-19 vaccine, and if granted the authorization, it will be able to provide it to high-risk individuals in settings where it could help prevent more deaths, such as with front-line healthcare workers, ahead of receiving a full and final regulatory approval from the U.S. healthcare monitoring agency. Moderna will also seek conditional approval from the European Medicines Agency, which will enable similar use ing the EU.</p>
<p>Moderna&#8217;s vaccine is an mRNA vaccine, which provides genetic instructions to a person&#8217;s body that prompts them to create their own powerful antibodies to block the receptor sites that allows COVID-19 to infect a patient. It&#8217;s a relatively new therapeutic approach for human use, but has the potential to provide potentially even more resistance to COVID-19 than do natural antibodies, and without the risk associated with introducing any actual virus, active or otherwise, to an inoculated individual in order to prompt their immune response.</p>
<p>In mid-November, Moderna announced that its COVID-19 vaccine showed 94.5% efficacy in its preliminary results. This final analysis of that same data hews very close to the original, which is promising news for anyone hoping for an effective solution to be available soon. This data has yet to be peer reviewed, though Moderna says that it will now be submitting data from the Phase 3 study to a scientific publication specifically for that purpose.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> marketing of iPhones as &#8216;water resistant&#8217; without clarifying the limits of the feature and also having a warranty that excludes cover for damage by liquids has got the company into hot water in Italy.</p>
<p>The Italian competition authority (AGCM) has informed the tech giant of an intent to fine it €10 million for commercial practices related to the marketing and warranty of a number of iPhone models since October 2017, starting with the iPhone 8 through to the iPhone 11, following an investigation into consumer complaints related to its promotion of water resistance and subsequent refusal to cover the cost of repairs caused by water damage.</p>
<p>In a document setting out the AGCM&#8217;s decision dated towards the end of October &#8212; which was made public today (via <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-italy-apple-antitrust/italys-antitrust-fines-apple-10-million-euros-for-misleading-commercial-practices-idUKKBN28A0OH">Reuters</a>) &#8212; the regulator concludes Apple violated the country&#8217;s consumer code twice because of what it characterizes as &#8220;misleading&#8221; and &#8220;aggressive&#8221; commercial practices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Its investigation found Apple&#8217;s iPhone marketing tricked <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">consumers into believing the devices were impermeable to water, rather than merely water resistant &#8212; with the limitations of the feature not given enough prominence in ads. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While a disclaimer stating that Apple&#8217;s warranty excludes damage by liquids was deemed an aggressive attempt to circumvent consumer rights obligations &#8212; given its heavy promotion of the devices as water resistant.</span></p>
<p>Apple places a liquid contact indicator inside iPhones, which changes from white or silver to red on contact with liquid, and checking the indicator is a standard step undertaken by its repair staff.</p>
<p>The AGCM report cites examples of consumers who&#8217;s iPhone had taken a &#8220;short dive&#8221; in the sea being refused cover. Another complainant had been washing their device under the tap &#8212; which Apple deemed improper use.</p>
<p>A third reported that their one-month old iPhone XR stopped working after coming into contact with water. Apple told them they must buy a new device &#8212; albeit at a subsidized price.</p>
<p>While an iPhone XS user, with a one-year old handset who reported it had never come into contact with water was refused coverage by Apple support who said it had, complained to the regulator there&#8217;s no way for a consumer to prove their device was not immersed in water for more than the length of time and depth to which Apple&#8217;s small print specifies it has water resistance.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Apple for comment on the AGCM&#8217;s findings.</p>
<p>The tech giant has 60 days from the date it was notified of the regulator&#8217;s intent to fine to appeal the decision.</p>
<p>The size of the penalty is well under half of the operating profit the regulator says Apple&#8217;s Italian operation made in the year September 2018 to September 2019, when it note it recorded revenues on its sales and services of €58,652,628; and an operating profit of €26,918,658.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/24/italian-consumer-watchdog-hands-down-e15m-in-fines-to-apple-and-samsung-for-slowing-devices/">Two years ago</a> Italy&#8217;s competition watchdog also fined Apple and Samsung around $15M for forcing updates on consumers that may slow or break their devices. While, this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/apple-fined-27-million-for-throttling-old-iphones-without-telling-users/">February</a>, France fined Apple $27 million for capping the OS performance of iPhones with older batteries.</p>
<p>Apple has also faced much larger penalties from competition authorities elsewhere in Europe &#8212; including being notified of a $1.2BN fine by France&#8217;s competition authority in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/apple-fined-record-1-2b-in-france-over-anti-competitive-sales-practices/">March</a> this year, which accused the tech giant of operating a reseller cartel along with two wholesale distribution partners, Ingram Micro and Tech Data.</p>
<p>Apple also had to stump up as much as €500M in back taxes demanded by French authorities <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/apple-fined-27-million-for-throttling-old-iphones-without-telling-users/">last year</a>.</p>
<p>While some $15BN from Apple&#8217;s European HQ is sitting in an escrow account to cover a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/30/apple-ordered-to-pay-up-to-145-billion-for-illegal-tax-benefits-in-ireland/">2016 European Commission &#8216;State Aid&#8217; charge</a> that it illegally benefited from corporate tax arrangements in Ireland between 2003 and 2014.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/apple-and-ireland-win-appeal-against-the-european-commissions-15-billion-tax-ruling/">July</a> Apple and Ireland won the first round of an appeal against the charge.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK government has squeezed the timetable for domestic telcos to stop installing 5G kit from Chinese suppliers, per the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55124236">BBC</a>, which reports that the deadline for installation of kit from so-called &#8216;high risk&#8217; vendors is now September.</p>
<p>It had already announced a ban on telcos buying kit from Huawei et al by the end of this year &#8212; acting on national security concerns attached to companies that fall under the jurisdiction of Chinese state surveillance laws. But, according to the BBC, ministers are concerned carriers could stockpile kit for near-term installation to create an optional buffer for themselves since it has allowed until 2027 for them to remove such kit from existing 5G networks. Maintaining already installed equipment will also still be allowed up til then.</p>

<p>A Telecommunications Security Bill which will allow the government to identify kit as a national security risk and ban its use in domestic networks is slated to be introduced to parliament tomorrow.</p>
<p>Digital secretary Oliver Dowden told the BBC he&#8217;s pushing for the &#8220;complete removal of high-risk vendors&#8221;.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/uk-u-turns-on-huawei-and-5g-giving-operators-until-2027-to-rip-out-existing-kit/">July</a> the government said changes to the US sanction regime meant it could no longer manage the security risk attached to Chinese kit makers.</p>
<p>The move represented a major U-turn from the policy position announced in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/uk-will-allow-huawei-to-supply-5g-with-tight-restrictions/">January</a> &#8212; when the UK said it would allowed Chinese vendors to play a limited role in supplying domestic networks. However the plan faced vocal opposition from the government&#8217;s own back benches, as well as high profile pressure from the US &#8212; which has pushed allies to expel Huawei entirely.</p>
<p>Alongside policies to restrict the use of high risk 5G vendors the UK has said it will take steps to encourage newcomers to enter the market to tackle concerns that the resulting lack of suppliers introduces another security risk.</p>
<p>Publishing a supply <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/5g-supply-chain-diversification-strategy/5g-supply-chain-diversification-strategy">chain diversification strategy for 5G</a> today, Dowden warns that barring &#8220;high risk&#8221; vendors leaves the country &#8220;overly reliant on too few suppliers&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This 5G Diversification Strategy is a clear and ambitious plan to grow our telecoms supply chain while ensuring it is resilient to future trends and threats,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;It has three core strands: supporting incumbent suppliers; attracting new suppliers into the UK market; and accelerating the development and deployment of open-interface solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The government is putting an initial £250 million behind the 5G diversification plan to try to build momentum for increasing competition and interoperability.</p>
<p>&#8220;Achieving this long term vision depends on removing the barriers that prevent new market entrants from joining the supply chain, investing in R&amp;D to support the accelerated development and deployment of interoperable deployment models, and international collaboration and policy coordination between national governments and industry,&#8221; it writes.</p>
<p>In the short to medium term the government says it will proritize support for existing suppliers &#8212; so the likely near term beneficiary of the strategy is Finland&#8217;s Nokia.</p>
<p>Though the government also says it will &#8220;seek to attract new suppliers to the UK market in order to start the process of diversification as soon as possible&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;As part of our approach we will prioritise opportunities to build UK capability in key areas of the supply chain,&#8221; it writes, adding: &#8220;As we progress this activity we look forward to working with network operators in the UK, telecoms suppliers and international governments to achieve our shared goals of a more competitive and vibrant telecoms supply market.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Huawei for comment on the new deadline for UK carriers to stop installing its 5G kit.</p>
<p>The company has continued to reject security concerns attached to its business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Food delivery apps have been a big deal this year both for consumers stuck at home and unable (or unwilling) to go to restaurants or grocery stores, and for investors who are eyeing the opportunity to back rising stars to help them grow.</p>
<p>Today came the latest development in that story: <a href="https://www.hungrypanda.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HungryPanda</a>, which makes a Mandarin-language app specifically targeting Chinese consumers outside of China, has raised $70 million to continue its global expansion in delivering food from Chinese restaurants and Asian grocery stores targeting the Chinese diaspora.</p>
<p>Estimates put the number of Chinese people living abroad (counting students and first-generation immigrants, and counting those living outside of the Mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau) at <a href="http://www.culturaldiplomacy.org/academy/index.php?chinese-diaspora" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">around 50 million</a>, with most of them concentrated in other Asian countries, so that is a specific target for the startup. Longer term, there are tens of millions more people if you consider second-, third- and further generations of people, although that will likely see big changes to the app, including introducing other languages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding comes on the back of a surge of usage of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hungrypanda" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hungrypanda">HungryPanda <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. It is now live in 47 cities (versus 31 in February of this year) across Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, and the UK &#8212; the country where it is was founded. Growing some 30-fold in the last three years, HungryPanda&#8217;s CEO and founder Eric Liu said in an interview that it is already profitable in its earliest markets in the UK, as well as in New York City, and is safely en route to getting into the black in other locations, too.</p>
<p>The Series C is being led by Kinnevik (a prolific backer of e-commerce startups), with participation also from 83North and Felix Capital (which backed HungryPanda in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/hungrypanda-a-food-delivery-app-for-chinese-communities-raises-20-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last round of $20 million earlier this year</a>), as well as Piton Capital and Burda Principal Investment.</p>
<p>HungryPanda is not disclosing its valuation right now, but it&#8217;s notable that most of its four-year life has been spent bootstrapped &#8212; it has raised only $90 million to date, all of it this year.</p>
<p>Food apps have come into their own in 2020. Already popular with consumers who like the convenience of using a phone or website to browse and order food to be brought to their door, during the Covid-19 pandemic, many services were stretched to capacity in cities where people were being ordered to shelter in place and restaurants were closed.</p>
<p>E-marketer estimates that in the US alone, usage went up by <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/more-consumers-turning-food-delivery-apps-amid-indoor-dining-restrictions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than 25%</a>. It all still came at a cost, though. For example, the increased measures that needed to be taken to ensure social distancing meant higher costs for the companies, which are often already stretched in their unit economics.</p>
<p>In that sea of apps, however, you might be hard-pressed to distinguish one from another. At one point in the UK, for example, even the delivery bags and logos of two big rivals, Deliveroo and Uber Eats, looked the same.</p>
<p>HungryPanda is a very different bird compared to these. For starters, the whole app is in Mandarin. And it focuses primarily (in most cases, only) on Chinese food. If you want pizza or a burger, or if you want to read the menu in English, go somewhere else.</p>
<p>The app was founded four years ago by Liu, who was an international student in computer science student at the University of Nottingham. Coming over from China, even though there are indeed a number of Chinese restaurants in the city, he and other Chinese students found it nearly impossible to order from them.</p>
<p>The reasons? All of the menus were in English, and the names of dishes, as they were translated, had no meaning for them; and in any case they were all essentially filtered and altered for local (read: British) palates. This was a bigger deal than it might be for some: Chinese people prefer to eat &#8220;traditional&#8221; food, said Liu, and they take the business of eating very seriously.</p>
<p>His solution was to build an app that provided all the information to students like him in a format that they could actually use, including items that typically might only be offered on side menus to Chinese customers in Mandarin, if at all.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that while food delivery unit economics can be very challenging in a sprawling city, the same does not apply typically to HungryPanda. Typically, at a company like Deliveroo, the rule of thumb has been to be slightly above two deliveries per hour per driver to make that hour profitable. That is not always possible, however, in the real world. (And that&#8217;s before counting all of the other costs around marketing, and so on.)</p>
<p>HungryPanda, however, was delivering to students who were in dormitories, and often ordering in groups to eat &#8220;family style&#8221;. It meant that HungryPanda was mitigating a lot of the typical unit economics, said Antoine Nussenbaum, the co-founder of Felix Capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;This made the efficiency of delivering much higher,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The same has gone for grocery delivery. Panwen Chen, the global VP of strategy and an early employee of the company, was also a student at Nottingham and said, considering that even students don&#8217;t want to eat out all that time, getting groceries was next to impossible for him and others like him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn’t have a car, and so getting to the Chinese grocery in Nottingham meant taking two buses or 50-60 minute walk,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Before you know it, you&#8217;re struggling with very heavy bags of groceries. It&#8217;s not a nice experience. We then started working with groceries, and what we found was that with food delivery we already had the infrastructure, so it was a natural extension of what we do, especially since the community was the same. That helped us to understand also what they wanted.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that takeaway ready-made food is still majority of the startup&#8217;s business, both growing very fast.</p>
<p>Loading in one function, and then two, into the app sets up HungryPanda for how it might grow further in the future. Asia has been a pioneer on that front, with apps like WeChat, and more specifically those focused around delivery services like Grab, really carving out a place for themselves as &#8220;super apps,&#8221; providing users with a vast array of services beyond the core, original purpose of those apps.</p>
<p>Consumers and businesses in the wider network are accustomed to the existence of &#8220;super apps&#8221;, and they are well-used. So in a world where some of the homegrown Chinese apps have found it harder to break into international markets (and in some cases like the US, they may be <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/30/1011450/wechat-censored-china-under-attack-in-america/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">downright challenged to do so</a>) this gives HungryPanda, which is a UK app, an interesting position, potentially as a partner or as a strong competitor in those markets.</p>
<p>Indeed it already pushes a wide range of offers to users from partner organizations, which stretch well beyond basic food ordering.</p>
<p>HungryPanda started for Liu as a side project to university. His plan was to go on to the London School of Economics for post-graduate work after getting his Nottingham undergrad degree. The business took off, though, and so he deferred for two years. Last year, he got the reminder from the LSE to nudge him on what happens next, and he said he ended up deferring indefinitely for now.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel it&#8217;s been not just a good experience for me, but for the Chinese community that uses us,&#8221; he said. He now lives in New York City, building the business in the US.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We are now into the all-important holiday sales period, and new numbers from <a href="http://gartner.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner</a> point to some recovery underway for the smartphone market as vendors roll out a raft of new 5G handsets.</p>
<p>Q3 smartphone figures from the analysts published today showed that smartphone unit sales were 366 million units, a decline of 5.7% globally compared to the same period last year. Yes, it&#8217;s a drop; but it is still a clear improvement on the first half of this year, when sales <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/covid-19-blamed-as-smartphone-sales-plummet-20-in-q2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slumped by 20%</a> in each <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-06-01-gartner-says-global-smartphone-sales-declined-20--in-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quarter</a>, due largely to the effects of Covid-19 on spending and consumer confidence overall.</p>
<p>That confidence is being further bolstered by some other signals. We are coming out of a relatively strong string of sales days over the Thanksgiving weekend, traditionally the &#8220;opening&#8221; of the holiday sales cycle. While sales on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/thanksgiving-on-track-for-a-record-6b-in-us-online-sales-says-adobe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thursday</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/28/black-friday-online-sales-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Friday</a> were at the lower end of predicted estimates, they still set records over previous years. With a lot of tech like smartphones often bought online, this could point to stronger numbers for smartphone sales as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On top of that, last week <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/idc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="idc">IDC <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> &#8212; which also tracks and analyses smartphones sales &#8212; published a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201125005413/en/Smartphone-Shipments-Will-Return-to-Growth-in-the-Holiday-Quarter-and-Beyond-Driven-by-Strong-Push-Behind-5G-According-to-IDC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> predicting that sales would grow 2.4% in Q4 compared to 2019&#8217;s Q4. Its take is that while 5G smartphones will drive buying, prices still need to come down on these newer generation handsets to really see them hit with wider audiences. The average selling price for a 5G-enabled smartphone in 2020 is $611, said IDC, but it thinkgs that by 2024 that will come down to $453, likely driven by Android-powered handsets, which have collectively dominated smartphone sales for years.</p>
<p>Indeed, in terms of brands, Samsung, with its Android devices, continued to lead the pack in terms of overall units, with 80.8 million units, and a 22% market share. In fact, the Korean handset maker and China&#8217;s Xiaomi were the only two in the top five to see growth in their sales in the quarter, respectively at 2.2% and 34.9%. Xiaomi&#8217;s numbers were strong enough to see it overtake Apple for the quarter to become the number-three slot in terms of overall sales rankings. Huawei just about held on to number two. See the full chart further down in this story with more detail.</p>
<p>Also worth noting: overall mobile sales &#8212; a figure that includes both smartphones and feature phones &#8212; were down 8.7% 401 million units. That underscores not just how few feature phones are selling at the moment (smartphones can often even be cheaper to buy, depending on the brands involved or the carrier bundles), but also that those less sophisticated devices are seeing even more sales pressure than more advanced models.</p>
<h2>Smartphone slump: it&#8217;s not just Covid-19</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s worth remembering that even before the global health pandemic, smartphone sales were facing slowing growth. The reasons: after a period of huge enthusiasm from consumers to pick up devices, many countries reached market penetration. And then, the latest features were too incremental to spur people to sell up and pay a premium on newer models.</p>
<p>In that context, the big hope from the industry has been 5G, which has been marketed by both carriers and handset makers as having more data efficiency and speed than older technologies. Yet when you look at the wider roadmap for 5G, rollout has remained <a href="https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/ip_services/understanding-5g/5g-innovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patchy</a>, and consumers by and large are still <a href="https://www.govtech.com/network/For-Many-Consumers-5G-Remains-an-Unknown-Quantity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not fully convinced</a> they need it.</p>
<p>Notably, in this past quarter, there is still some evidence that emerging/developing markets continue to have an impact on growth &#8212; in contrast to new features being drivers in penetrated markets.</p>
<p>“Early signs of recovery can be seen in a few markets, including parts of mature Asia/Pacific and Latin America. Near normal conditions in China improved smartphone production to fill in the supply gap in the third quarter which benefited sales to some extent,” said Anshul Gupta, senior research director at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gartner" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gartner">Gartner, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in a statement. “For the first time this year, smartphone sales to end users in three of the top five markets i.e., India, Indonesia and Brazil increased, growing 9.3%, 8.5% and 3.3%, respectively.”</p>
<p>The more positive Q3 figures coincide with a period this summer that saw new Covid-19 cases slowing down in many places and the relaxation of many restrictions, so now all eyes are on this coming holiday period, at a time when Covid-19 cases have picked up with a vengeance, and with no rollout (yet) of large-scale vaccination or therapeutic programs. That is having an inevitable drag on the economy.</p>
<p>“Consumers are limiting their discretionary spend even as some lockdown conditions have started to improve,” said Gupta of the Q3 numbers. “Global smartphone sales experienced moderate growth from the second quarter of 2020 to the third quarter. This was due to pent-up demand from previous quarters.”</p>
<p>Digging into the numbers, Samsung has held on to its top spot, although its growth was significantly less strong in the quarter. Even with that slump, Samsung is still a long way ahead.</p>
<p>That is in part because number-two Huawei, with 51.8 million units sold, was down by more than 21% since last year. It has been having a hard time in the wake of a public relations crisis after sanctions in the US and UK, due to accusations that its equipment is used by China for spying. (Those UK sanctions, indeed, have been <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55124236" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brought up in timing, just as of last night</a>.)</p>
<p>That also led Huawei earlier this month to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/huawei-sells-budget-phone-unit-honor-to-government-distribution-partners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirm</a> the long-rumored plan to sell off its Honor smartphone division. That deal will involve selling the division, reportedly valued at around $15 billion, to a consortium of companies.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how Apple&#8217;s small decline of 0.6% to 40.6 million units to Xiaomi&#8217;s 44.4 million, will shift in the next quarter, on the back of the company launching a new raft of iPhone 12 devices.</p>
<p>“Apple sold 40.5 million units in the third quarter of 2020, a decline of 0.6% as compared to 2019,” said Annette Zimmermann, research vice president at Gartner, in a statement. “The slight decrease was mainly due to Apple’s delayed shipment start of its new 2020 iPhone generation, which in previous years would always start mid/end September. This year, the launch event and shipment start began 4 weeks later than usual.”</p>
<p>Oppo, which is still not available through carriers or retail partners in the US, rounded out the top five sellers with just under 30 million phones sold. The fact that it and Xiaomi do so well despite not really having a phone presence in the US is an interesting testament to what kind of role the US plays in the global smartphone market: huge in terms of perception, but perhaps less so when the chips are down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Others&#8221; &#8212; that category that can take in the long tail of players who make phones, continues to be a huge force, accounting for more sales than any one of the top five. That underscores the fragmentation in the Android-based smartphone industry, but all the same, its collective numbers were in decline, a sign that consumers are indeed slowly continuing to consolidate around a smaller group of trusted brands.</p>
