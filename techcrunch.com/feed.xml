										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shared micromobility operator Lime is on track for third quarter adjusted EBITDA profitability, marking this as the second profitable quarter in the company&#8217;s history, according to CEO Wayne Ting. During the Wall Street Journal Tech Live event, Ting said COVID has turned from a &#8220;headwind into a tailwind,&#8221; heralding more prosperous times in the year to come.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Around this time last year, at the WSJ Future of Everything event,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/lime-touts-a-2020-turnaround-and-2021-profitability/"> Ting also boasted of the company&#8217;s movement</a> beyond the financial hardships of the pandemic and toward Q3 profitability. Lime said it was operating both cash flow positive and free cash flow positive, with expectations to be full-year profitable in 2021. Unfortunately, COVID got in the way again.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219923" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;The Delta variant led to additional lockdowns and delays of cities opening up around the world, which impacted projected top-line revenue,&#8221; Russell Murphy, senior director of corporate communications at Lime, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Even without tourism and commuting returning to pre-COVID levels, we&#8217;re glad that demand has returned and we&#8217;re anticipating a continued surge in ridership in 2022.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ting said bottom-line growth is what made a difference this year. Q3&#8217;s top line was about the same as the same quarter in 2019, give or take 1% to 2%, and that was not a profitable quarter. This means that although Lime was not able to generate more sales and revenue, it was able to spend its money and manage its operating costs far more efficiently.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP accounting measure that many startups use to give a more comparable picture of their financial performance. Factors like stock-based compensation for employees are often removed from adjusted EBITDA, which can make it all but impossible to truly understand a company&#8217;s cash flow position without an official SEC filing. Ting did not mention cash-flow positivity during the event, and the company has not yet responded to specific inquiries about how it&#8217;s managed to increase bottom-line growth.</p>
<p>That said, over the past year, Lime has done things like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/lime-plans-for-modes-beyond-bikes-and-scooters-in-2021/">deploy its Gen4 scooters with swappable batteries</a>, which can certainly help streamline charging processes. Better-quality scooters and bikes that last longer also remove some of the significant costs of vehicle depreciation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The business is coming back even though some of our biggest use cases are still not back, so commute is not back, tourism is not back,&#8221; said Ting. &#8220;What we&#8217;ve actually seen is we dramatically grew what we call &#8216;intercity travel.&#8217; People are using us versus alternatives because we are open-air, single passenger, because people want a greener way to move around. And when I look forward to 2022, commute is going to come back to some extent, tourism is going to come back. We just announced opening travel from Europe, and all those are going to be tailwinds going into next year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lime is also relying on shifting consumer sentiments to grow revenues, particularly around younger generations and climate change.</p>
<p>&#8220;The number one source for carbon pollution in the United States is transportation,&#8221; said Ting. &#8220;If we want to fundamentally solve carbon from transportation we have to look at lighter weight alternatives like scooters and bikes, and we have to invest in public transportation. When you talk to young people, this is deeply felt by them and they&#8217;re changing their behavior to meet this moment.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook already allows users to cross-post their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/359139904893501?id=526867548205796">Instagram Stories</a> and <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/launching-reels-on-facebook-us/">Reels</a> to Facebook. Now it&#8217;s testing a new feature that would see posts flowing in the other direction, too. The company recently rolled out an option that allows users to cross-post their Facebook updates that include photos or videos over to their Instagram. For people who are active on both platforms, the feature could save you from having to upload the same media twice in two different apps. It also gives Facebook an easy way to seed Instagram with more content at a time when the company is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/16/technology/instagram-teens.html">invested in ensuring Instagram remains</a> a popular social media platform with younger users in the face of increased competition from apps like Snapchat and TikTok.</p>
<p>Facebook said the feature, which has yet to be formally announced, first began to roll out earlier this month. However, the company noted the option is currently a global test that&#8217;s only available to a small group of people who already have their Facebook profiles linked to a personal, creator or business account on Instagram.</p>
<p>If available, you&#8217;ll see the feature in Facebook&#8217;s compose box where you create posts. The new toggle appears besides those for editing the audience for your post and creating a new album.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219874" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2219885" style="width: 598px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219885" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2219885" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1429.png?w=680" alt="" width="588" height="347" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1429.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1429.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1429.png?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1429.png?resize=768,453 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1429.png?resize=680,401 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1429.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219885" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screenshot from the Facebook app on iOS</p></div></p>
<p>When tapped, you&#8217;ll be taken to a new screen where you can choose to share the individual Facebook post to your connected Instagram account, as well. The screen informs you this option will only apply to the post in question &#8212; it won&#8217;t become the default setting going forward.</p>
<p>If you do want to change your defaults, though, you can visit the linked &#8220;Accounts Center,&#8221; where you can now toggle on an option to automatically share all your Facebook Posts to Instagram, in addition to automatically sharing your Facebook Stories to Instagram Stories. (The latter was previously available.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219905" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219905" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2219905 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1430-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219905" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screenshot from the Facebook app on iOS</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company told us users will be able to cross-post to Instagram single photos, single videos or multiphoto albums up to 10 photos â the max that&#8217;s supported through Instagram&#8217;s carousels. Other formats, like GIFs, polls, photos albums with more than 10 photos, Feed reshares, text-only posts and any media that&#8217;s too tall for Instagram&#8217;s Feed are not eligible for cross-posting at present.</p>
<p>Facebook has been working to make its suite of apps more interoperate in recent months &#8212; and not just by making cross-posting an option for those who use multiple apps.</p>
<p>The company last year introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/facebook-introduces-cross-app-communication-between-messenger-and-instagram-plus-other-features/">cross-app communication between Messenger and Instagram</a>, allowing Instagram users to chat with friends who use Facebook and (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-messenger-releases-cross-app-group-chats-further-integrating-with-instagram/">as of last month</a>) vice versa. It&#8217;s also been working on making Messenger more of a &#8220;connective tissue&#8221; for Facebook&#8217;s growing number of real-time experiences and has been testing a way that Facebook users could <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/messenger-celebrates-its-10th-anniversary-with-new-features-and-a-plan-to-become-the-connective-tissue-for-real-time-experiences/">make voice and video calls right on Facebook</a> without having to switch to the Messenger app. And last month, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-revamps-its-business-tool-lineup-following-threats-to-its-ad-targeting-business/">revamped its ad products</a> to include more tools that would allow people to message businesses on any of Facebook&#8217;s chat platforms, instead of just the one where they&#8217;re seeing the ad. That means users could click an Instagram ad to chat with a business on WhatsApp, for example.</p>
<p>If this all makes it a bit more confusing to determine what content lives where and who&#8217;s using which app, that could be by design. The tighter integrations may make it more difficult to fully exit Facebook, as content and communications flow between the Facebook suite of apps. In addition, the complexity could be hard to unravel in the case that regulators decide to break up Facebook into separate businesses, if it were to be declared a monopoly at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Facebook did not say how long the global test would run or when it would roll out more broadly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford Motor Company is investing $316 million (Â£230 million) to transform its Halewood, U.K. vehicle transmission facility into an electric power unit plant, making it Ford&#8217;s first EV component in-house assembly site in Europe.</p>
<p>The investment is subject to and includes about $42 million (Â£30 million) from the U.K. government through its Automotive Transformation Fund, according to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=the+times+uk+ford+halewood&amp;sxsrf=AOaemvIONEXZTRmBpXYdkBQ5JycJJVObbw%3A1634596414710&amp;ei=PvZtYezhKoK-3LUPoq6P4Ao&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjs-JiVgtXzAhUCH7cAHSLXA6wQ4dUDCA4&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=the+times+uk+ford+halewood&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBwghEAoQoAEyBwghEAoQoAEyBwghEAoQoAEyBwghEAoQoAE6BwgAEEcQsAM6BQghEKsCOggIIRAWEB0QHjoFCCEQoAFKBAhBGABQiyZY8S5gxy9oAXACeACAAfQBiAGpC5IBBTAuMy40mAEAoAEByAEIwAEB&amp;sclient=gws-wiz">The Times</a>. Some 500 local automotive jobs will be saved as a result of the investment, the paper said.</p>
<p>Power units produced in the plant will supply all-electric passenger and commercial vehicles sold in Europe, helping the company inch toward its electrification goals. Earlier this year,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/ford-to-go-all-electric-in-europe-by-2030/"> Ford announced its European strategy</a> to only sell electric vehicles on the continent by 2030 and to only produce electric commercial vehicles in Europe by 2024. The company spent $1 billion to revamp an assembly factory in Cologne, Germany and predicts that electric models will account for two-thirds of its European sales.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219821" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The power unit is what replaces the engine and transmission in an ICE vehicle; it manages the flow of electricity delivered by the battery and controls the speed of the electric motor and the torque it produces. Ford estimates power unit production in Halewood will begin in mid-2024, with planned capacity at around 250,000 units per year. The automaker did not respond to requests about whether the power units will be sent to the Cologne facility or elsewhere for assembly.Â  Historically, the Halewood factory exports 100% of its production, helping to make Ford one of the U.K.&#8217;s largest exporters of engines and transmissions from its facilities to &#8220;more than 15 countries on six continents, with overseas sales generating around Â£2.5 billion ($3.5 billion) annually,&#8221; according to the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this highly competitive, global race to secure electric vehicle manufacturing, our priority is to ensure the U.K. reaps the benefits,&#8221; Kwasi Kwarteng, the U.K. governmentâs business secretary and member of parliament, said in a statement. âTodayâs announcement, backed by government funding, is a huge vote of confidence in Britainâs economic future and our plans to ramp up electric vehicle production. It will future-proof Halewoodâs proud industrial heritage and secure high-skilled, well-paid jobs across the North West for years to come.â</p>
<p>Europe isn&#8217;t the only place Ford is expanding its electric capabilities. The automaker has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/fords-30b-investment-in-electric-revs-up-in-house-battery-rd/">$30 billion to play with</a> by 2025, and the fruits of its labor in China have finally dropped. On Monday, the first Mustang Mach-E manufactured in China rolled off the assembly line. Customers in China will have access to the locally produced Mach-E by the end of the year through Ford&#8217;s direct sales network of EV city stores, according to the company. Ford says it&#8217;s on track to open 25 stores in major metro areas this year and expand to more than 100 within the next five years.</p>

<h2>Astra completes its investigation into August&#8217;s sideways launch</h2>
<p>It appears that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/astra-completes-investigation-into-august-launch-failure-aims-for-next-attempt-in-october/">small rocket startup Astra has identified</a> the root cause of the anomaly that led to its launch failure at the end of August. Evidently, it was due to a propellant leakage, which caused one of the engines to shut down one second after launch, Astra&#8217;s chief engineer Benjamin Lyon <a href="https://astra.com/news/launch-and-learn-lv0006/">said in a blog post</a>. The subsequent asymmetrical engine firing that came after led the rocket to hover and drift in the air before managing a brief vertical ascension.</p>
<p>Even as it recounted the debacle, the company is ready to try again, opening the launch window for its next attempt on October 27. The rocket, dubbed âLV0007,â will carry a test payload for the U.S. Space Force.</p>

<h2>Steve Wozniak and Alex Fielding want to create &#8220;the Google Maps of space&#8221;</h2>
<p>Rumors were swirling in September after Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak tweeted a link to a one-minute promo video on YouTube for a new company called Privateer. Sleuths started to wonder if the new company might have to do with orbital debris or space junk &#8212; cleaning it up, perhaps?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Not quite. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/steve-wozniak-privateer-space-company/">I got the lowdown</a> on the new startup from co-founder Alex Fielding, who told me that Privateer&#8217;s aim is to create concrete and actionable knowledge regarding the location of space debris. As it turns out, what info we do have isn&#8217;t that great. To solve this problem, Privateer aims to send up its first demo spacecraft, dubbed Pono 1, next February; subsequent launches will follow.</p>
<p>âIâm an optimist and I still am very, very, very afraid that weâre too late, that weâre probably within 24 months of the first on-orbit human space casualty,&#8221; Fielding said. &#8220;And the reason for that is just the proliferation in low Earth orbit.â</p>
<h2>A new partnership between defense and venture capital</h2>
<p>This week, I chatted with the co-founders of Embedded Ventures, an eleven-month-old venture capital firm that&#8217;s recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/u-s-space-force-partners-with-vc-firm-embedded-ventures-under-new-rd-agreement/">entered into a novel agreement</a> with the U.S. Space Force. This news interested me because the two entities are using a partnership agreement called a CRADA &#8212; a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement &#8212; that&#8217;s never before been used with a VC fund.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunchâs biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for October 18, 2021. Yes, it was an Apple event day, so we have a pile of coverage for you to enjoy down below. But we <em>also</em> have a mess of startup stories and some IPO notes to boot. Letâs go! â <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-its-unleashed-event-this-morning/"><strong>Hereâs everything Apple announced today:</strong></a><strong>Â </strong>Appleâs event included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apple-announces-third-generation-airpods-with-new-design-spatial-audio/">new AirPods</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apples-macbook-pro-get-a-redesign-new-chips-and-magsafe-charging/">new MacBook Pros</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apple-launches-the-m1-pro/">new chips</a> â the lot. If you are in the market for a new Apple laptop and donât want something as light as possible, it was a pretty good day. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apple-notched-the-new-macbook-pro/">Unless you hate notches</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apple-wows-tech-crowd-with-new-chips-wall-street-yawns/">Wall Street was bored by the whole affair</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/lawmakers-accuse-amazon-executives-of-misleading-or-lying-to-congress-about-its-business-practices/">Amazon in hot water over congressional testimony:</a> </strong>After testifying that Amazon didnât use third-party marketplace data to guide its own first-party product decisions, the company is in the soup after the press <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-rigging/">disclosed</a> that it did just that. Amazon reiterated its policy against such actions, despite former employees claiming that breaking the rule was standard practice. Congress is peeved. And Amazon is under fire for <a href="https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/amazon-puts-its-own-brands-first-above-better-rated-products">allegedly preferring its own products</a>, despite saying that it doesnât. As an aside, if Amazon is unable to enforce its own policies due to its size, itâs not really doing itself or any of its fellow technology giants much of a favor as they fend off regulatory scrutiny.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/inside-expensifys-ipo-filing/"><strong>Inside Expensifyâs IPO filing:</strong></a><strong>Â </strong>Another week, another S-1 filing to enjoy. This time itâs Expensifyâs turn to go public. The Portland, Oregon-based company is bouncing back from COVID impacts to its business, with growing revenues and historical profitability. Itâs a neat IPO, though weâre not entirely sure yet where it will price.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Kicking off todayâs startup digest, a note for startups building in the MENA region: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/calling-mena-put-your-city-on-the-tc-map-by-joining-techcrunchs-cities-survey-2021/">We want to chat</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219772" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/what-you-should-know-about-prepping-your-startup-for-the-public-markets/">What you should know about going public:</a> </strong>Are you a startup founder with hopes of eventually taking your company public? Good news: We recently sat down with a group of experts on the matter, including investor and operator perspectives. So if you want to get a leg up on your own future, this is for you.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/tripleblind-secures-24m-for-a-new-approach-to-enterprise-level-privacy-preserving-data-sharing/"><strong>TripleBlind raises $24M for corporate data encryption:</strong></a><strong>Â </strong>Data privacy is an increasingly key concept for global companies loath to run afoul of regulators &#8212; or consumers. TripleBlind is building a service that has âdevised a way to encrypt data so that it can be shared without ever being decrypted or even leaving the data ownerâs firewall and keeping the whole process compliant with data protection regulations,â which we quite like the sound of. Notably, the company is based in Kansas City, Missouri.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/with-customers-like-coinbase-and-shopify-remote-hiring-startup-deel-raises-425m-at-a-5-5b-valuation/"><strong>Deel shows that remote hiring is hot:</strong></a><strong>Â </strong>Talk to an early-stage startup today, and youâll be regaled with tales of how they are eight people in four time zones across five countries. But supporting remote employees in different locales is not easy. Taxes alone can get messy. Deel manages that headache for other companies, and it just raised $425 million at a $5.5 billion valuation. Thatâs one hell of a load of cash wagered on remote hiring not just sticking around, but growing.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/allplants-scoops-52m-to-deliver-more-plant-based-microwave-meals/"><strong>Allplants wants to make all-plant TV dinners:</strong></a>Â If it comes in a box and goes in the microwave, itâs probably not that good for you. Thatâs been a reasonable sentiment for ages. Allplants wants to shake that up with vegan meals that come in a box. Draper Esprit led its Series B, putting Â£38 million into the company. Frankly, thatâs a metric tonne of sterling. If I can find an Allplants meal to buy and try, I will report back.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/more-african-startups-get-into-techstars-toronto/"><strong>African startups take more accelerator spots:</strong></a> As the African startup market accelerates â data <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/african-startups-join-global-funding-boom-as-fintech-shines/">here</a> â weâre seeing more startups from the continent take part in the global accelerator market.</li>
<li>And because I cannot help but mention it, the company that sailed a drone sailboat into a hurricane the other week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/saildrone-catches-a-100m-c-breeze-to-build-more-robo-boats/">just raised $100 million</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Leveraging customer feedback and data to iterate on your product</h2>
<p>Very few startups go to market with the product they first envisioned.</p>
<p>Iteration is a key process for early-stage companies, but it&#8217;s also an acquired skill. To learn more about how operators can lean on data to accelerate the product development process and segment users into useful cohorts, Anna Heim spoke to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jean-Denis GrÃ¨ze, CTO, Plaid</li>
<li>Stephanie Mencarelli, VP, Product Design at InVision</li>
<li>Pete Thompson, SVP &amp; Chief Product Officer, eBay</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://aiven.io/">Aiven</a>, a Finnish startup that helps companies combine various open source technologies with public cloud infrastructure resources, announced a $60 million investment on a $2 billion valuation today. The news follows a $100 million investment in March at an $800 million valuation, a hefty increase in such a short time.</p>
<p>World Innovation Labs and IVP co-led the round with participation from Atomico &#8212; all existing investors. Today&#8217;s round, which is considered an extension of that $100 million C round announced in March, brings the total amount raised to $210 million, according to Crunchbase data.</p>
<p>Company CEO and co-founder Oskari Saarenmaa says the company helps take the complexity out of managing open source projects in the cloud. &#8220;We started working on Aiven back in 2015 and we wanted to create a cloud data platform that we would have liked to have used ourselves [when we were working as engineers prior to creating the company]. We created this cloud operations platform that could turn the best open source data technologies into managed services on any public cloud.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219849" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company works with a portfolio of nine open source data technologies, including Kafka, Cassandra, OpenSearch and Grafana. Saarenmaa points out that they don&#8217;t simply commercialize these technologies, they also contribute to the communities building these tools as well. In fact, they recently formed a team of 10 engineers devoted specifically to writing code for the open source projects that are part of their product portfolio.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re thinking that many of these tools already have startups built on top of these open source technologies, you&#8217;re right. He acknowledged that they do overlap sometimes with companies that have their own cloud services built around open source tooling such as <a href="http://confluent.io">Confluent</a> does with <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a>, but they are trying to package it in a way that simplifies it for the customers even more by providing the public cloud infrastructure, as well as the open source data technology required for any data processing project.</p>
<p>Part of the reason the company is attracting this kind of investment is that it is growing quickly and currently boasts 700 customers across 50 countries around the world. They are also working with some ISVs to increase the company&#8217;s market reach further.</p>
<p>They have grown from a team of 40 people pre-pandemic, adding more than 200 employees since March 2020, with plans to continue building the team. As they do, Saarenmaa says they are making diversity a priority. &#8220;It is very important for us to be able to bring in leaders who candidates can really connect and identify with. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any other option than to make diversity one of the top priorities,&#8221; he said. That said, he admits that the staff still tilts heavily male, even as he is trying to change that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says that in spite of the substantial valuation, the company sees great value in remaining private for the time being. &#8220;It makes a lot of sense for us to continue being an independent company and growing on this path that we&#8217;ve chosen, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we don&#8217;t see becoming a public company at some point. It is likely that is the way we are thinking, but we&#8217;re not exactly working on filing our S-1,&#8221; he joked.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another big infusion of cash from a major investor is making its way to a fintech out of the U.K. on the heels of strong growth. Today <a href="https://www.zopa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zopa</a> &#8212; a neobank with some 500,000 users in the U.K. where it provides peer-to-peer lending, savings accounts, credit cards and other services &#8212; has raised $300 million, at a valuation that we&#8217;ve confirmed to be $1 billion (Â£750 million) post-money.</p>
<p>Zopa describes this as a &#8220;pre-IPO&#8221; round, and from what we understand, that public offering &#8212; if things continue on the same trajectory as now &#8212; will come in Q4 of 2022. The company is currently on a run rate of Â£85 million ($116 million), and expects that to double to Â£170 million ($233 million) by 2022. It&#8217;s also on track to reach profitability by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Unlike other neobanks, Zopa&#8217;s banking services focus not on current (checking) accounts but a savings account, which complements its loan and credit products. &#8220;This means we are driving less customers in the ecosystem,&#8221; CEO Jaidev Janardana said in an interview today, but he added that this is also a better business model in terms of margins and returns. &#8220;They really use us and are willing to pay for the services.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219428" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Softbank Vision Fund 2 led the round with participation also from Chimera Capital, with existing investors IAG Silverstripe, Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP, NorthZone and Augmentum Fintech all also participating. Zopa&#8217;s timed the news to coincide with a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/global-investment-summit-gis-2021">Global Investment SummitÂ (GIS) 2021</a> led by the U.K. government this week, although it looks like the company has been working on this round since this summer, <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/digital-bank-zopa-hires-jp-morgan-to-oversee-100m-funding-boost-12364010" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first as a $100 million round</a>; in the interim the size of the fundraise has nearly tripled.</p>
<p>That investor enthusiasm is part of a bigger trend at the moment. Neobanks in Europe have been leading the charge in the race for huge fintech funding rounds this year, buoyed by strong customer growth and a collective consumer appetite for a new take on banking that is easier to use (namely via mobile apps) and features services that are more attuned to how younger generations of adult consumers manage and spend their money.</p>
<p>Just today, Berlin&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/challenger-bank-n26-raises-900-million-at-9-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">N26 raised</a> $900 million on a $9 billion valuation. Earlier this summer, London&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/revolut-confirms-a-fresh-800m-in-funding-at-a-33b-valuation-to-supercharge-its-financial-services-superapp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revolut raised</a> $800 million on a $33 billion valuation. Starling in March <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/uk-challenger-bank-starling-raises-376m-now-valued-at-1-9b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $376 million on a $1.9 billion valuation</a>. And even startups catering to helping older incumbent banks get modernized and up to speed are seeing some of the windfall: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/10x-a-uk-fintech-raises-187m-to-build-new-services-for-old-banks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10x in June raised</a> $187 million to build new services for older banks.</p>
<p>Zopa is, relatively speaking, not a new kid on the block, less neo than some of the other neobanks making waves at the moment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It got its start in 2005 and claims to be the first company to develop the concept of P2P lending: When people apply to borrow money, the funds are sourced not from Zopa&#8217;s deposits as they might be in a traditional bank, but from a network of individual retail investors and institutional investors, who are banking on Zopa using better algorithms and other technology to ensure that they&#8217;re lending to people who are more likely to pay back what they borrow.</p>
<p>That was the bulk of the business until the company started, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/07/zopa-the-u-k-p2p-lending-company-closes-60m-round-on-path-to-launching-a-bank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2018</a>, to set its sights expanding to new product horizons with the launch of a bank. That finally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/zopa-granted-full-uk-bank-licence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happened last year</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see this latest investment as a validation of the successful launch of our banking service,&#8221; Janardana said. He added that while Zopa&#8217;s lending service is still the bigger part of the business, the banking is seeing the most growth. (That lending business has processed some Â£6 billion in loans to date.)</p>
<p>The company plans to use the funding to continue expanding the products that it offers to its customers, which will expand on the theme of providing tools to consumers to help them build and manage their savings better. &#8220;We have a lot of ambitions for savings,&#8221; Janardana said. &#8220;We think it&#8217;s an important part of the ecosystem for borrowers to have a habit of saving, so creating products that promote that&#8221; is important. It will also be looking at ways of helping consumers pay off credit cards, rather than enabling the kind of balance transfers between cards that are the norm today.</p>
<p>He said that while there will be more products aimed at &#8220;solopreneurs&#8221; the business market is not one that Zopa plans to take on in the near future. But it will likely look at ways of partnering with others in the area of neobanks and fintechs where its technology in lending, credit and savings might be complementary.</p>
<p>The fact that most of the products that Zopa offers today were built from the ground up by the company &#8212; not sourced by way of APIs as some neobanks have done &#8212; means that there is a stronger degree of flexibility in what Zopa can do next, either with partners or on its own, and that is something that seems to have stood out for investors, too.</p>
<p>âWe believe Zopaâs fast-growing market penetration reflects high customer demand for adaptable financial services within a usable platform that can be customized to their specific needs,&#8221; said Sourav Sen, investor for SoftBank Investor Advisers, in a statement. &#8220;Zopa is fast emerging as a leading player in the U.K.âs nascent neobanking sector and we are proud to partner with Jaidev and the team on this journey.â</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Our team of researchers started CoCoPIE to solve the chip shortage crisis. Weâre a group of Ph.D.s who aim to power next-generation technology without the need for expensive hardware that takes billions of dollars to develop and years to deploy. We needed a way to bring our idea into action.</p>
<p>For deep tech startups, the capital game can be a tricky one to play. The VC world is attracted to the low-investment/high-returns model deep tech tends to offer, but it can also be impatient with the time it takes to get there. According to PitchBook, the VC world is also trending toward the megadeal ($100 million+), which doesnât generally apply to early-stage startups with a handful of employees.</p>
<p>While we did raise funds from one of the VC worldâs glitterati &#8212; Sequoia Capital &#8212; when we were accepted into the Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer (<a href="https://seedfund.nsf.gov/about/">SBIR/STTR</a>) program, we knew our solution was much more valuable than a chip that would make its way to the reject line.</p>
<p>Hereâs why we applied for a federal grant and why we think you should add âAmerica&#8217;s Seed Fundâ to your deep tech fundraising mix.</p>
<h2>Build credibility</h2>
<p>There are several SBIR/STTR programs. Ours is powered by the National Science Foundation. These grants are highly competitive and, if chosen, can establish and strengthen your company&#8217;s technical image on the market.</p>
<p>Being selected out of thousands of U.S. applicants signals that your innovation has strong technical and commercial merit and the potential for broad U.S. economic impact. Itâs a stamp that encourages other potential investors to raise their hands. Even if you arenât selected, the feedback you receive from the review committee is invaluable.</p>
<h2>Keep equity and decision-making authority</h2>
<p>Receiving funding often means you have to give something back. That can be interest payments if youâve taken a loan or equity if youâve received VC funds. The SBIR/STTR programs allow you to retain full ownership of your company and IP. The administrators also arenât interested in driving strategy &#8212; they believe in your vision and want to help you bring it to fruition. Their <a href="https://seedfund.nsf.gov/about/">goal</a> is to âinvest in a better future for our shareholders: the American public.â</p>
<p>CoCoPIEâs vision is to enable real-time AI for off-the-shelf mobile devices. If adopted by the semiconductor, digital media and IoT industries, it can significantly improve the way we consume, learn and interact with our devices.</p>
<p>But, like any deep tech company, the question becomes how to get it widely adopted. We are using the SBIR/STTR funds to convert our technology into a minimum viable product, an essential step for us to reach a broader customer base. Thus far, our technology has attracted multiple key pilot customers, including Tencent, a global gaming giant that utilizes our super-resolution technology to enhance its customersâ gaming experience.</p>
<h2>Potential for additional funding</h2>
<p>The SBIR/STTR program is administered in three gated phases that progress your product toward commercialization. Each startup can receive up to $2 million in funding. What you donât get in funding in Phase III you make up for in actual business, typically through government procurement contracts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alaska Airlines has become the latest major airline to enter corporate investing with the launch of a new venture capital arm, dubbed Alaska Star Ventures, as the aviation industry looks to emerging technologies to help decarbonize air travel.</p>
<p>Alaska Star Venturesâ first investment, to the tune of $15 million, is in Los Angeles-based UP.Partnersâ inaugural venture fund. The $230 million early-stage fund will focus on mobility technologies and has garnered additional investment from Woven Capital, the investment arm of Toyota Motorâs Woven Planet Group; Standard Industries; Hillwood; and OSM Maritime.</p>
<p>The airline also said that it would work with UP.Partners on its inaugural investments. While Alaska Star Ventures may consider additional sector-focused fund investments, most of the focus will be on investing in discrete technologies, Alaska Airlinesâ VP of public affairs and sustainability Diana Birkett Rakow told TechCrunch in a recent interview.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219752" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Alaska Airlines&#8217; intent is to invest in emerging tech that can help it hit its target of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. The company also set a nearer-term objective of being the most fuel-efficient airline by 2025 and cutting ground services emissions in half by the same year. Alaska Airlines announced the non-binding targets in April, when it joined a slew of other businesses in joining Amazonâs Climate Pledge.</p>
<p>âWhen we looked at, what&#8217;s our execution plan for that path [to net-zero], we started to realize that there were a lot of areas where technology was essential for us to hit our goals,â she said. âSo we decided to set up this investment vehicle to really be a catalyst for finding and accelerating and advancing technologies that help us accelerate that path to net-zero.â</p>
<p>While investments in clean tech are growing, Birkett Rakow said that the move to establish a fund would help the airline identify technologies that are âtruly applicableâ to the operating environment and could be deployed in the next three to 10 years.</p>
<p>Alaska Airlines chose to contribute to UP.Partnersâ first fund because of the deep background and expertise of its two founders, Ben Marcus and Cyrus Sigari, Birkett Rakow explained. The two founded jet sales services company jetAVIVA in 2006, and AirMap in 2014, a traffic management system for unmanned aircraft.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She added that the airline will get a front-row seat to the rapidly changing technology landscape, while also being able to contribute input into what technologies might work in the operating environment. UP.Partners will also act as an adviser and occasionally co-invest with Alaska Star Ventures.</p>
<p>To give a hint at what types of technologies Alaska Star Ventures might fund in the future, Birkett Rakow pointed to the roadmap the airline released alongside its pledge, which established five areas of focus: increasing operational efficiency; evolving the fleet; sustainable aviation fuels (SAF); novel propulsion technology; and credible carbon offsets.</p>
<p>While SAF and propulsion, like batteries or hydrogen fuel cells, tend to garner the most attention â in part because they offer the most promising potential in terms of magnitude at addressing emissions â Birkett Rakow said the new fund will also look at other types of technologies that increase efficiency or cut unnecessary fuel burn.</p>
<p>For example, Alaska Airlines recently partnered with Airspace Intelligence to launch an AI-based system for airplane route optimization, which she said shaved off around five minutes per flight.</p>
<p>âWhile we didn&#8217;t make a financial investment in [Airspace Intelligence], it was a good model for us of how us having access to technology that could make a difference, a significant difference, in our operating performance towards net zero [ â¦ ] really could help this technology be more successful and scale,â she explained.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a wide-ranging interview at the <a href="https://www.wsjtechlive.com/">WSJ Tech Live</a> conference that touched on topics like the future of remote work, AI innovation, employee activism and even misinformation on YouTube, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also shared his thoughts on the state of tech innovation in the U.S. and the need for new regulations. Specifically, Pichai argued for the creation of a federal privacy standard in the U.S., similar to the GDPR in Europe. He also suggested it was important for the U.S. to stay ahead in areas like AI, quantum computing and cybersecurity, particularly as China&#8217;s tech ecosystem further separates itself from Western markets.</p>
<p>In recent months, China has been undergoing a tech crackdown, which has included a number of new regulations designed to combat tech monopolies, limit customer data collection and create new rules around data security, among other things. Although many major U.S. tech companies, Google included, don&#8217;t provide their core services in China, some who did are now exiting &#8212; like Microsoft, which just this month announced its plan to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/microsoft-to-pull-linkedin-from-chinese-market/">pull LinkedIn from the Chinese market</a>.</p>
<p>Pichai said this sort of decoupling of Western tech from China may become more common.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219692" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>He also said it would be important to stay ahead in areas where the U.S. and China compete, like AI, quantum computing and cybersecurity, noting that Google&#8217;s investments in these areas comes at a time when governments were slightly pulling back on &#8220;basic R&amp;D funding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The government has limited resources and it needs to focus,&#8221; noted Pichai, &#8220;but all of us are benefiting from foundational investments from 20 to 30 years ago &#8212; which is what a lot of the modern tech innovation is based on, and we take it for granted a bit,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So when I look at the semiconductor supply chain [and] quantum â¦ the government can play a key role, both in terms of policies and allowing us to bring in the best talent from anywhere in the world, or participating with universities and creating some of the longer-term research areas,&#8221; Pichai added. These are areas that private companies may not focus on from day one, but play out of 10 to 20 years, he said.</p>
<p>In the wake of increased cyberattacks across borders, Pichai said that the time had come for a sort of &#8220;Geneva Convention equivalent&#8221; for the cyber world, adding that governments should put security and regulation higher on their agendas.</p>
<p>He more directly argued in favor of new federal privacy regulations in the U.S. &#8212; something Google has <a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/proposing-framework-data-protection-legislation/">pushed for</a> many times in the past &#8212; suggesting that something like the GDPR in Europe is warranted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I think the GDPR has been a great foundation,&#8221; said Pichai. &#8220;I would really like to see a federal privacy standard in the U.S. and worried about a patchwork of regulations in states. That adds a lot of complexity,&#8221; he continued, noting that &#8220;larger companies can cope with more regulations and entrench themselves, whereas for a smaller company to start,Â  it can be a real tax.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a point that&#8217;s been consistently brought up when Facebook&#8217;s CEO Mark Zuckerberg calls for regulation, too. A more regulated U.S. tech industry could work in favor of larger companies like Facebook and Google that have the resources to address the regulatory hurdles. But a single federal standard could also give Big Tech only one law to battle against, instead of many scattered across the U.S. states.</p>
<p>Pichai additionally tied consumer privacy to security, even noting that &#8220;one of the biggest risks to privacy is the data getting compromised&#8221; &#8212; an interesting statement coming only days after Amazon, a top Google rival, saw its game streaming site Twitch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/hacker-leaks-twitch-source-code-and-creator-payout-data/">hacked</a>.</p>
<p>As for where to draw the line in regulating tech, Pichai said the law shouldn&#8217;t encroach on the open internet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the internet works well because it&#8217;s interoperable, it&#8217;s open, it works across borders, promotes trade across borders â¦ and so, as we evolve and regulate the internet, I think it&#8217;s important to preserve those attributes,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>The exec also responded to many other questions about ongoing issues Alphabet and Google are facing, like the pandemic impacts to corporate culture, employee activism, misinformation on YouTube and more.</p>
<p>On the latter, Pichai expressed a commitment to freedom of experience but noted at the end of the day, the company was trying to balance content creators, users and advertisers. He said many brand advertisers would not want their ads to appear next to some types of content. Essentially, he suggested that the nature of YouTube&#8217;s ads-based economy could help to solve the misinformation problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can look at it from a free-market basis and say, [advertisers] don&#8217;t want their ads next to content because they think it&#8217;s brand-negative. So, in some ways, the incentives of the ecosystem actually help get to the right decision over time.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sidestepped the interviewer&#8217;s question as to whether YouTube was basically acting as a publisher as it made its content decisions, however.</p>
<p>Pichai also talked about Alphabet&#8217;s corporate culture in the pandemic era and going back to the office, saying that a three-two model (meaning three days of in-person versus two days remote) can offer better balance. The in-person days allow for collaboration and community, while the remote days help employees better manage the issues that traditionally came with in-person work, like longer commutes. However, in another part of the interview, he spoke of missing his own commute, now that he does it less, saying it was time where he had the space for &#8220;deeper thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for employee activism &#8212; which is seeing more activity as of late as tech companies grapple with large and diverse staffs who often share contradictory opinions on the decisions made at the executive level &#8212; Pichai says this is the &#8220;new normal&#8221; for business. But it&#8217;s also nothing new for Google, he pointed out. (Years ago, Google employees were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/technology/google-employees-protest-search-censored-china.html">protesting</a> the company&#8217;s work on a censored search engine for the Chinese market, for instance.)</p>
<p>&#8220;If anything, we&#8217;ve been used to it for a while,&#8221; said Pichai, noting that the best the company could do is to try to explain its decisions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I view it as a strength of the company, at a high level, having employees be so engaged they deeply care about what the company does,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp <a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp/status/1450130250671681537">announced</a> on Monday that itâs expanding its joinable calls feature to group chats. Joinable calls, which were<a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/never-miss-a-group-call-again"> first introduced</a> in July, allow users to join an ongoing group call after it has begun. With this latest expansion, users can now call a WhatsApp group and join the call directly from a group chat window.</p>
<p>The company also notes that the call notification will now display the name of the group instead of the participantsâ names. The ongoing call is shown in the chat list, so users can see which groups have live calls as soon as they open the app.</p>

<p>âWe are making it easier to connect spontaneously with your groups. Join ongoing calls with your groups anytime, effortlessly and directly from the chat view with one click,&#8221; WhatsApp said in a statement. &#8220;With group calling growing in popularity, integrating joinable calls gives WhatsApp users a new spontaneous way to connect with their family and friends groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>Additionally, WhatsApp says the calls will now have a light distinct ringtone, making them feel âas light as sending and receiving a message.â</p>
<p>The Facebook-owned company has been rolling out several new features over the past few months to retain and attract new users. Most recently, WhatsApp announced that it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/whatsapp-now-lets-users-encrypt-their-chat-backups-in-the-cloud/">beginning to roll out</a> a new feature that will allow users to encrypt their chat history backup in iCloud or Google Drive. Although the company offers encrypted chats between users on its platform, users havenât had the means to protect the backups of those chats stored in the cloud.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The addition of encrypted chat backups addresses a major loophole that has been exploited by governments in order to obtain private communication between users. WhatsApp says itâs providing this new feature to users in every market where the app is operational.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The ocean economy is growing in importance, and with it grows the need to map, understand, and track the ocean itself. Saildrone has been doing just that with its fleet of autonomous science vessels, and the company has now raised a <a href="https://www.saildrone.com/press-release/saildrone-announces-series-c-funding">massive $100M round C</a> to pursue its ro-boat aspirations further.</p>
<p>Saildrone&#8217;s boats have been in continuous use for years now, making all kinds of interesting voyages that would be too dangerous or too tedious for a human crew to attempt. For instance earlier this month one of the vessels <a href="https://pmel.noaa.gov/news-story/when-saildrone-met-hurricane-sam">sailed straight into a hurricane</a> for a NOAA project to better understand these increasingly frequent and violent storms. Good luck getting someone to brave <a href="https://saildrone.mediavalet.com/portals/2021-hurricane-mission">50-foot waves and 120 MPH winds</a> to collect some data when there&#8217;s a robotic option.</p>
<p>Having traveled half a million miles collectively, Saildrone&#8217;s fleet is the most seasoned set of autonomous boats out there, and that makes for an attractive market position as marine intelligence becomes more important. Not only is knowing the condition of the ocean in a given location helpful for scientific and expected purposes like steering ships around storms, but the vast quantities of systematically collected data will help build a new fundamental understanding of the complex aquatic ecosystem during climate change and a shift towards sustainable aquaculture.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219476" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Saildrone is the go-to name in autonomous science boats, others are approaching the new blue economy from other directions: autonomous tugs and commercial boats from Sea Machines (which recently<a href="https://sea-machines.com/sea-machines-uses-biofuel-to-power-tug-nellie-bly-on-long-haul-autonomous-journey"> demonstrated a thousand-mile sailing</a>), while <a href="https://oceansunmanned.org/eco-drone/">EcoDrone</a> and <a href="http://www.seaproven.com/">Sea Proven</a> are looking to compete with smaller or more customizable ships. And there&#8217;s a whole separate world of underwater drones that will be zooming around mapping the sea bed, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/bedrock-modernizes-seafloor-mapping-with-autonomous-sub-and-cloud-based-data/">like Bedrock&#8217;s</a>.</p>
<p>But Saildrone isn&#8217;t standing still, or rather sitting at anchor. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/saildrone-launches-a-72-foot-autonomous-seabed-mapping-boat/">Its newest vessel, the Surveyor</a>, can spend a year at sea and map the ocean floor past two miles of depth. They aren&#8217;t cheap, though, and if the company wants to capture as much of the &#8220;ocean domain intelligence&#8221; sector as possible it will need to scale fast. That&#8217;s what the hundred mil is for, presumably.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0KLwIN9gCE"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/saildrone-launches-a-72-foot-autonomous-seabed-mapping-boat/">Saildrone launches a 72-foot autonomous seabed-mapping boat</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Saildrone launches a 72-foot autonomous seabed-mapping boat&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/saildrone-launches-a-72-foot-autonomous-seabed-mapping-boat/embed/#?secret=0KLwIN9gCE" data-secret="0KLwIN9gCE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The C round was led by BOND and with participation from XN, Standard Investments, Emerson Collective, Crowley Maritime Corporation, Capricornâs Technology Impact Fund, Lux Capital, Social Capital, and Tribe Capital. The &#8220;data insight teams&#8221; will be hired up and they&#8217;ll put the money to good use on &#8220;go-to-market functions,&#8221; which I suppose is VC jargon for building boats.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The combination of the most tried and tested autonomous ocean technology with the partnership of some of the most experienced venture capitalists in the world consolidates our industry leadership and enables our rapid growth path to meet the needs of our customers,&#8221; said Saildrone CEO and Founder Richard Jenkins in the press release. No doubt we&#8217;ll be hearing more about their missions in years to come as their star rises.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Many founders aspire to an IPO, even if the average time horizon has now stretched as capital flows into the market. But how to get a company ready for an IPO isn't usual fare in startup conversations.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been an active four quarters for technology IPOs. If you rewind the clock to Q4 2020, we&#8217;ve seen megawatt public debuts from tech shops of all sorts. Airbnb recovered from COVID-19-induced lows to list, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/the-roblox-gambit/">Roblox delayed its IPO</a> and went out with a direct listing. DoorDash went public. C3.ai had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/unpacking-the-c3-ai-ipo-filing/">an explosive offering</a> late last year as well.</p>
<p>Things have largely continued in 2021, with IPOs throughout the first and second quarters leading to debuts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/inside-freshworks-ipo-filing-as-the/">from Freshworks</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/toast-raises-ipo-price-range-providing-a-monday-bump-to-fintech-valuations/">Toast</a>Â and, most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/inside-gitlabs-ipo-filing/">filings from GitLab</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/what-rent-the-runways-ipo-filing-says-about-the-business-of-loaner-garments/">Rent the Runway</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/nerdwallets-ipo-filing-reveals-high-margin-content-business-accelerating-marketing-spend/">NerdWallet and others</a>.</p>
<p>Many startup founders aspire to an IPO, even if the average time horizon for the liquidity event has now stretched as capital flows into the private tech market. But how to get a company ready for an IPO isn&#8217;t normal fare in startup conversations â it&#8217;s a bit like talking about your 21st birthday when you are in middle school. Sure, it&#8217;s a thing that will happen <em>someday,</em> but not much of a pressing concern.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d think so, at least. The prep process for going public is actually somewhat long if done well, and startups might need to get started with prepping their operations for the public markets earlier than they think. It&#8217;s a topic that we explored during TechCrunch Disrupt 2021, where I hosted a conversation with <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Lux Capital Partner </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://twitter.com/deenashakir">Deena Shakir</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, Madrona Managing Director </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://twitter.com/HopeCochran">Hope Cochran</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, and CrowdStrike CFO </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/about-crowdstrike/executive-team/burt-podbere/">Burt Podbere.</a></p>
<p>The entire discussion is embedded below, but I&#8217;ve pulled out a few key moments for those of you who are more reading-based learners than video-watchers. Topics follow by subheadline, with the video at the bottom. Enjoy!</p>
<h2>You can prep too early</h2>
<p>Heading into the conversation, I expected to encounter three folks all nodding their heads sagely, intoning in unison that startups can&#8217;t really start IPO prep too early. That was not what I wound up hearing. Cochran said this, following my question about how early a startup should start prep for its public debut:</p>
<blockquote><p>You hear many people talk about, <em>&#8220;</em>Oh, you need to start thinking about going public really, really early&#8221; and building that rigor. I&#8217;m actually more on the camp of: &#8220;Let&#8217;s let the company run and be agile for a while and put in processes as they&#8217;re needed.&#8221; You will get there in the appropriate amount of time.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello again, and welcome back to TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/apple-sheds-value-during-iphone-event/">running series of posts</a> discussing how the public markets rarely give even half of a spare fuck concerning what Apple announces at its events.</p>
<p>Indeed, Apple&#8217;s stock seems to be far more labile to external events than from internally sourced announcements; rare is the case in which Apple&#8217;s stock actually picks up ground in contrast to the Nasdaq Composite during its press-friendly announce-a-thons.</p>
<p>Which never ceases to astound us somewhat. Perhaps Apple&#8217;s events are so well-leaked these days that new products are baked into its value?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219708" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That argument is perhaps necessary but not sufficient in market terms &#8212; participatory but not complete? &#8212; as Apple did break some news today regarding its line of PC chips. Yes, Apple did detail the new M1 Pro, but it also blew more than a few minds with its M1 Max chip. Sure, the name is a bucket of boomer cringe, but the chip itself appears to be an incredibly impressive feat. And Apple is baking the new chips into a range of computers that have price points <a href="https://twitter.com/JoannaStern/status/1450156894455312385">above expectations</a>.</p>
<p>Sitting here, I&#8217;m thinking: Killer new hardware, and potentially higher per-computer revenue? Sounds good, right? And yet, Apple&#8217;s stock pretty much tracked the Nasdaq during its event, which took place between the hours of 1 pm and 2 pm in the following chart:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2219720" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AAPL_^SPXTR_^IXIC_chart-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="439" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AAPL_^SPXTR_^IXIC_chart-1.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AAPL_^SPXTR_^IXIC_chart-1.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AAPL_^SPXTR_^IXIC_chart-1.png?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AAPL_^SPXTR_^IXIC_chart-1.png?resize=768,496 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AAPL_^SPXTR_^IXIC_chart-1.png?resize=680,439 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AAPL_^SPXTR_^IXIC_chart-1.png?resize=1536,991 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AAPL_^SPXTR_^IXIC_chart-1.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The only notable element of that chart is that Apple&#8217;s initial declines after 1 pm struck were sharper than what the larger Nasdaq tech collection managed. But then Apple recovered more sharply, leaving the entire trading period essentially a wash &#8212; Apple gained ground just as tech shares did. Wee.</p>
<p>If I was an Apple engineer, I&#8217;d be livid.Â <em>Look, world, behold chips that are actually really good. All those years, Intel was screwing over the market by putting out bilge whenÂ </em>this<em> was possible!</em> And yet Wall Street is precisely and exactly not impressed.</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has backpedaled on years of questionable design choices with its MacBook Pros, unceremoniously retiring the universally disliked Touch Bar and adding back the ports and Magsafe users have missed. But in a show of perverse solidarity with the iPhone, the company has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apples-macbook-pro-get-a-redesign-new-chips-and-magsafe-charging/">added a big, ugly notch</a> front and center on the &#8220;best notebook screen in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>It must be something of a humbling moment of Apple, despite its seeming bravado, to be forced to acknowledge that it has been told so clearly for so long that so few of its design innovations were valued by its users. As you salivate over this MacBook Pro, don&#8217;t forget why you&#8217;re hungry in the first place: Apple&#8217;s misguided attempts to streamline in pursuit of a slick promo.</p>
<p>The Touch Bar was interesting in theory but ultimately hamstrung by a lack of compelling use cases and the fact that 90 percent of the time people just wanted the default keys â and the accessibility loss of mapping these crucial features onto an undifferentiated touchscreen was a misstep as well.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219559" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Going all USB-C was another aspirational step that had no basis in reality. All it ended up doing was juicing the dongle industry in a big way and making people carry around half a dozen two-inch cables so they could use the various devices and drives they&#8217;ve accumulated over the years.</p>
<p>The keyboard design has reverted to a thicker one with a &#8220;mechanical feel&#8221; (we&#8217;ll see) after the dismal failure of the butterfly switches. Turns out people don&#8217;t care about losing that last millimeter if it means typing sucks and your keys break on a regular basis.</p>
<p>So, after withdrawing or failing to improve on these and other aspects, Apple has turned around and added them back in as if they were novel ideas. The irony of seeing a commercial touting the power of the M1 Pro Max but there&#8217;s an SD card reader assembling itself in the cutaway view is thick and worth savoring.</p>
<p>But then Apple went and a bad thing.</p>
<h2>They notched it</h2>
<p>Now, I really don&#8217;t like notches. I know that not everyone feels that way. But I find them very distracting both in everyday use and on fullscreen media. A hole punch is even worse, but the notch isn&#8217;t great. The new iPhones <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/19/the-new-iphone-is-ugly/">aren&#8217;t as ugly as the old ones</a>, but that notch means I&#8217;m sticking with my SE 2 for a while longer. (RIP, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/14/the-iphone-se-was-the-best-phone-apple-ever-made-and-now-its-dead/">original SE</a>&#8230; you&#8217;ll return some day.)</p>
<p>What appears to have happened is that Apple essentially extended the display upwards and closer to the bezel, but couldn&#8217;t shrink its new webcam down enough to fit it in there (there&#8217;s no Face ID or anything). So in a sense you&#8217;re gaining space, or so my perennial Apple apologist colleagues have convinced themselves.</p>
<p>What do you need to do with that middle piece of the menu bar or whatever anyway, they say? It&#8217;ll probably be letterboxed out in media; the new screen aspect ratio is taller than 16:9, 2:1, 21:9, and other common ratios. And when you&#8217;re in a fullscreen app they&#8217;ll black out either side of the notch, so you won&#8217;t see it (though on the other hand, it wipes out the extra space you&#8217;ve supposedly gained). It&#8217;s a net gain, they say.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&#8217;s ugly.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219699" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-mbp-crop.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219699" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2219699" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-mbp-crop.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-mbp-crop.jpg 1312w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-mbp-crop.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-mbp-crop.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-mbp-crop.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-mbp-crop.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-mbp-crop.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2219699" class="wp-caption-text">Look, you can&#8217;t even see it! Of course, you can&#8217;t see the whole top quarter inch.</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s really a super simple question. Which would you prefer, a screen with a notch or a screen without a notch? The answer is pretty much always &#8220;the one without a notch,&#8221; because the notch is disruptive to the basic mission of a display, which is to show things. Anything that obtrudes into the rectangle (the shape we now expect) of the display prevents it from using that shape fully and effectively. Fundamentally speaking, everything you show on the screen has a notch taken out of it, or otherwise accommodates the notch in some fashion.</p>
<p>Some people truly won&#8217;t mind. Some people truly won&#8217;t notice. I&#8217;m happy for them. But some people also leave &#8220;TruMotion HD Smooth&#8221; on and make everything on their TV look like a soap opera. Some people have both cold LEDs and warm incandescent bulbs in the same room. Some people don&#8217;t organize their books by color. Okay, you get what I&#8217;m saying â and the objections of a neurotic aesthetic like mine can go too far.</p>
<p>Tech should be as invisible as is practically possible. The whole industry has been pursuing the reduction of wires and the increase of automation and &#8220;smartness&#8221; so that their products can be ubiquitous and practically invisible. A little sphere the size of a tennis ball (now in 5 fabulous new colors) but it&#8217;s a conduit to your entire digital world. A pair of little earbuds that &#8220;magically&#8221; charge themselves, connect automatically, and adjust their levels based on the idiosyncrasies of your ear canal. And so on.</p>
<p>A display is meant to be a magic window: a &#8220;Retina&#8221; display sharp enough to be mistaken for real life; a 120hz refresh rate to enhance the illusion and prevent lag and blur from noticing the difference between digital and physical; a minimal bezel to minimize the &#8220;frontier&#8221; between those two worlds. Every advance in displays has been in pursuit of the idea of a more magical window. The notch is a step backwards instead of forwards, simple as that. It&#8217;s less magical, it&#8217;s less real, it&#8217;s obtrusive and artificial, the digital compromised to admit the physical.</p>
<p>You know it&#8217;s true â even if it doesn&#8217;t bother you â because as soon as it is physically possible for Apple to remove this notch, they will. They know and we know that screens are better without notches. And when they do, they&#8217;ll act like they&#8217;ve reinvented the wheel on purpose, like they did today when they touted the return of decade-old features no one asked to be changed in the first place.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has unveiled some new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apples-macbook-pro-get-a-redesign-new-chips-and-magsafe-charging/">MacBook Pro models</a> at a virtual conference today. And the company is timing the release of the next major release of macOS with the new laptop. Mac users will be able to update to macOS Monterey on Monday, October 25. This new major release of macOS will be available for free in the App Store.</p>
<p>macOS Monterey comes with Safari 12, which you might already be using on macOS Big Sur. It lets you create tab groups that you can sync between your devices and it features a brand new design. The new tab design has been <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/10/the_tragedy_of_safari_15_quote_unquote_tabs">controversial</a> but it sounds like Apple isnât done <a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1450162004820467719">tweaking it</a>.</p>
<p>FaceTime is also receiving some new features. SharePlay isnât part of this update just yet, but youâll now be able to share your screen, turn on Portrait mode, view your friends in a grid view and create links so that people on other devices can join your conversation â&nbsp;yes, even Windows PCs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219667" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new Focus modes that were introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/ios-15-adds-all-the-little-features-that-were-missing/">with iOS 15</a> are also coming to the Mac. Youâll be able to create a Work mode, a Gaming mode or whatever you want. When you change your mode on one Apple device, it changes it on all other Apple devices you use.</p>
<p>With macOS Monterey, your Mac is now an AirPlay device. You can send music or videos from your phone to your Mac display. Essentially, it works like AirPlay on an Apple TV.</p>
<p>When it comes to automation, the Shortcuts app is landing on the Mac. Itâll gradually replace Automator, but Automator is sticking around for now.</p>
<p>A ton of apps are also receiving small or big updates, such as Notes, Messages and Maps. And if you like to use your MacBook during long trips, youâll be able to turn on Low Power Mode on your computer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you think your Mac works fine right now, Apple won&#8217;t force you to update to macOS Monterey. You can keep using a previous major release of macOS for as long as you want.</p>

<p>The last one focused on iPhones and Apple Watches. This time around? They were all about new chips, new AirPods, and new MacBook Pros.</p>
<p>Too busy to follow along live? Here&#8217;s pretty much everything you need to know, boiled down to just the bullet points.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219621" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>New AirPods</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2219521" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219521" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2219521" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-ipods-price.jpg?w=680" alt="airpods 3rd generation price - $179" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-ipods-price.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-ipods-price.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-ipods-price.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-ipods-price.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-ipods-price.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-ipods-price.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-ipods-price.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219521" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>The base level (read: non-Pro) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apple-announces-third-generation-airpods-with-new-design-spatial-audio/">AirPods are getting an upgrade</a> â a new look, Spatial audio support, the Pro line&#8217;s &#8220;force sensor&#8221; for controlling music/calls, and improved sweat/water resistance. Apple says the battery life has been improved as well, bumping the promised run time from 5 hours to 6 hours on a single charge.</p>
<p>The third-gen AirPods will ship for $179 beginning next week.</p>
<h2>M1 Pro and M1 Max</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2219530" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-m1-max-splash.jpg?w=680" alt="Apple M1 Max" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-m1-max-splash.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-m1-max-splash.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-m1-max-splash.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-m1-max-splash.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-m1-max-splash.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-m1-max-splash.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-m1-max-splash.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Apple blew minds when it introduced its own absurdly fast chip with the M1 in 2020. Now they&#8217;ve gone and doubled down, introducing not one, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apple-launches-the-m1-pro/"><em>two</em> new M1 chips</a> â the M1 Pro and M1 Max.</p>
<p>Apple says the M1 Pro CPU is up to 70% faster than the original M1, with a GPU up to 2x faster, 32GB of unified memory, and 200GB/s of memory bandwidth.</p>
<p>The M1 Max, meanwhile, bumps the unified memory up to 64GB. Both M1 Pro and M1 Max support up to 10 CPU cores; on the GPU front, the Pro does up to 16-core, while the Max supports up to 32-core.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These things are gonna be really, <em>reallyÂ </em>fast.</p>

<p>Looking to put those new chips to good use, Apple introduced a new generation of Macbook Pros. And in a rare backpedal from the company, some of the MacBook Pro&#8217;s more contested recent changes are being undone.</p>
<p><strong>The highlights:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;ll come in two sizes: 16-inch or 14-inch.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/magsafe-is-back/">MagSafe is back</a>! The Touch Bar is gone! It has ports â including an SD card slot, and an HDMI port!</li>
<li>120Hz ProMotion support for smoother scrolling</li>
<li>In what&#8217;ll probably be the most argued-about aspect of this model, it&#8217;s got a camera notch. That lets them squeeze in a bit more screen, but means, well, a notch.</li>
<li>The camera has been upgraded to 1080p, with Apple promising doubled performance in low-light.</li>
<li>The entire audio system has been overhauled, with larger tweeters and woofers for improved audio fidelity.</li>
<li>14-inch model will start at $1999, while the 16-inch model will start at $2499.<img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2219630" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/macbook-pro.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="421" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/macbook-pro.jpg 970w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/macbook-pro.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/macbook-pro.jpg?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/macbook-pro.jpg?resize=768,475 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/macbook-pro.jpg?resize=680,421 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/macbook-pro.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Stuff:</h2>
<ul>
<li>You&#8217;ll now be able to ask Siri to play different themed playlists via Apple Music â like a playlist for relaxing, dinner parties, or hiking.</li>
<li>Apple is introducing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apple-debuts-a-4-99-per-month-apple-music-voice-plan-designed-mainly-for-homepod-use/">new $5 per month &#8220;Voice Plan&#8221;</a> for Apple Music â basically, as we understand it, a cheaper plan for those willing to ditch the interface and use only Siri for queueing up songs.</li>
<li>HomePod mini will now come in three new colors: dark blue, orange, and yellow.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple sure loves taking us on a rollercoaster of connectivity. The new MacBooks Pro computers are power-hungry enough that the USB-C connectors the MacBook line has been relying on for a while isn&#8217;t cutting it anymore. YouÂ <em>can</em> still charge your computer using the Thunderbolt ports, but if you&#8217;re planning to flog the new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apple-launches-the-m1-pro/">M1 Pro</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apple-m1-max-launched/">M1 Max</a> processors to within a micron of their little lives, it&#8217;s MagSafe o clock.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a clever design, actually: It means you can leave the MagSafe 3 charger at your main workstation, where you do your heavy-lifting computer work. You can bring a smaller, less powerful charger with you on the road, for when you&#8217;re using your laptop as a glorified typewriter or web browsing device. It&#8217;s the best of both worlds &#8211; although obviously, the USB-C cables don&#8217;t have the advantage of the MagSafe quick disconnect. A bit silly, given that if someone were to trip over your leads, it&#8217;s more likely to happen while you&#8217;re out and about, then when you&#8217;re safely at your desk at home or at work.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219627" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219627" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2219627" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/magsafe.png?w=680" alt="MagSafe connector" width="680" height="403" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/magsafe.png 857w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/magsafe.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/magsafe.png?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/magsafe.png?resize=768,455 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/magsafe.png?resize=680,403 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/magsafe.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219627" class="wp-caption-text">The brand new MagSafe 3 connector, along with the new port lineup on the MacBook Pro</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219613" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new MagSafe port has the familiar magnetic quick-release that Apple pioneered back in 2006 &#8211; preventing your laptop from being sent crashing to the floor if someone clumsily stumbles over your power cord. At the time, Apple heralded it as the solution to all your computer-tumbling woes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219566" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219566" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2219566" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-macbook-pro-2021-magsafe.jpg?w=300" alt="Apple Macbook pro 2021 magsafe port" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-macbook-pro-2021-magsafe.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-macbook-pro-2021-magsafe.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-macbook-pro-2021-magsafe.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-macbook-pro-2021-magsafe.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-macbook-pro-2021-magsafe.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-macbook-pro-2021-magsafe.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-macbook-pro-2021-magsafe.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219566" class="wp-caption-text">The new MagSafe 3 connectors certainly have a certain magnetism about them.</p></div></p>
<p>A decade later, Apple changed its mind and went all-in on USB-C, leading to some head-scratching; was the computers-falling issue not really a thing after all? Seeing the connector return to the company&#8217;s laptops is welcome, but further makes me wonder what, exactly, the messaging is here.</p>
<p>I suspect that Apple simply needed more power than USB-C can reliably provide (not to mention, people were plugging woefully under-powered phone chargers into their laptops), and if they were going to design a brand new connector, why not go back to the Greatest Hits of days gone by.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The MagSafe 3 is available on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apples-macbook-pro-get-a-redesign-new-chips-and-magsafe-charging/">Apple&#8217;s brand new line of MacBook Pro computers launched today</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/google-confirms-1b-investment-into-africa-including-subsea-cable-for-faster-internet/">Google</a> has today launched TaskMate in Kenya, a crowdsourcing app that lets people use smartphones to do tasks and get paid, tapping the growing gig economy. The tech giant said it has rolled out the beta version after a year-long experiment in the East African country, and is preparing to introduce it to other countries across the continent. The app is available in India too, where itâs also in the pilot stage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TaskMate mobile app users fulfill skilled and unskilled tasks such as translation or photography for businesses â that are approved by Google to post on the platformâ world-over.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TaskMate joins a growing list of apps and services launched by Google that offer people payment for services carried out. They include a rewards</span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.paidtasks&amp;showAllReviews=true"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that lets people get paid for filling out surveys and </span><a href="https://ads.google.com/intl/en_uk/local-services-ads/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local services ads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that link businesses, at a fee, with clients within their vicinity.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219279" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âToday we have launched TaskMate, and it&#8217;s the first time we have opened it in Africa and across the world,â said TaskMate product manager, Mike Knapp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pilot started in Kenya late last year and users were able to carry-out different tasks including taking photos of plants for a research project carried out by Penn State University. ââThe appâs gigs are defined as either sitting or field tasks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âWe went to a pilot phase where we had 1000 people use the app, and they gave very positive feedback. And so now we&#8217;ve moved to the beta phase. And we&#8217;re really experimenting at a bigger level at this point,â said Knapp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âAnd we&#8217;re looking for businesses and startups, to come and experiment with us on the platform, to see how this can help them solve the difficult problems that they&#8217;re working on,â he said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses posting tasks on the platform have the option of making it available to a select group of people or can invite specific people to carry it out. TaskMate users in Kenya withdraw the money earned through mobile-money payment platform M-Pesa, run by Safaricom, the biggest telecommunication company in the East Africa region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âThis is a crowdsourcing platform that simplifies the distribution and accomplishments of tasks from business, for businesses and organizations. It is also an app that provides opportunities to Kenyans, whether it&#8217;s community building or earning extra taxes. This is Google&#8217;s commitment to build for and with Africa, and its digital transformation journey,â he said.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The launch happened as Google announced that it had disbursed $10 million in loans to help small businesses across Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa make economic recovery brought about by the COVID pandemic. Google is disbursing the loans through Kiva, a San-Francisco based nonprofit lending organization. The funding is</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/google-confirms-1b-investment-into-africa-including-subsea-cable-for-faster-internet/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">part of the $1 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it said a fortnight ago it will invest in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Googleâs investment will include a subsea cable, which will</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cut across South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria and St Helena, connecting Africa and Europe. It will offer faster internet and create about 1.7 million jobs in Nigeria and South Africa by 2025 as the digital economy grows, they said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africaâs digital economy is </span><a href="https://www.afdb.org/fr/news-and-events/africas-digital-economy-poised-to-explode-as-regional-integration-opens-new-markets-19272"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expected to grow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as integration continues, offering newer growth opportunities as more people get connected. In sub-Saharan Africa, about 303 million, 28 percent of the population, are currently connected to the mobile internet according to the 2021 GSMA mobile economy </span><a href="https://data.gsmaintelligence.com/research/research/research-2021/the-mobile-economy-2021"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This number is expected to grow to about 40% by 2025, offering a bigger market to internet-based businesses and services such as TaskMate that are tapping internet connectivity and Africaâs youthful population.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[We held a panel during Disrupt with Jean-Denis GrÃ¨ze of Plaid, Stephanie Mencarelli of InVision and Pete Thompson of eBay on being data driven, segmenting your user base, iteration speed and more.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">How to iterate on product has always been one of the top concerns at startups. But while they previously had to rely solely on customer feedback and instincts, they now also have a trove of data to balance. This dynamic creates new opportunities but also requires a new kind of arbitrage.</p>
<p>We discussed this new context during <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> in a panel conversation with Jean-Denis GrÃ¨ze of Plaid, Stephanie Mencarelli of InVision and Pete Thompson of eBay. We explored different perspectives on being data driven, segmenting your user base, iteration speed and more.</p>
<h2>The role of data</h2>
<p>Our conversation started with a provocative question: Can a startup or a tech company ever be too data driven?</p>
<p>According to Thompson, the answer is &#8220;absolutely not&#8221; â but Mencarelli wasn&#8217;t so affirmative.</p>
<p>Thompson:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s a matter of how you use the data and how you balance it with other forms of feedback that you get. But I would say that it&#8217;s just getting more and more important to uncover things within the organization with data that you can&#8217;t do with any other means. It identifies things that human curation or manual processing wouldn&#8217;t uncover.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mencarelli:</p>
<blockquote><p>I will maybe slightly disagree and say that there is a point where you can get too data driven, where you&#8217;re not seeing what I call the edges of the innovation bell curve. So it&#8217;s really important to see what smaller cohorts are doing, because they could be early adopters to a new behavior.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, Thompson himself had added some nuance earlier, noting that &#8220;You need to be able to also think about other things that you&#8217;re not doing or features that you could build that the data won&#8217;t actually tell you.&#8221; He gave an example of this at eBay:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve recently been launching something that we call searching through images, so not just text queries. And this is a great example where our data would never have told us that on our site, for instance, for fashion, the younger audiences just want to be able to browse and see other things that look like the same image, not based on a text-based search. And these are things that you have to glean through other forms of feedback loops.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The importance of segmenting well</h2>
