										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Stripe-subsidiary Paystack raised its seed round of $1.3 million in 2016, it was one of the largest disclosed rounds at that stage in Nigeria. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, seven-figure seed investments in African startups were a rarity. But over the years, those same seed-stage rounds have become more common, with some very early-stage startups even raising eight-figure sums. Nigerian fintech startup, Kuda, which bagged $10 million last year, comes to mind, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also notable amidst the growth in seven and eight-figure African seed deals have been gains in pre-seed fundraising. Typically, pre-seed rounds are raised when the startup is still in the product development phase, yet to make revenue or discover product-market fit. These investments are usually made by third-party investors (friends and family), and range between $25,000-$150,000.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the narrative as to how much an early-stage African startup can raise as pre-seed has changed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, African VCs who usually fund seed and Series A rounds began partaking in pre-seed rounds, and they don&#8217;t seem to be slowing down. Just a month into 2021,  Egyptian fintech startup </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cassbana"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cassbana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised a </span><a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2021/01/11/egyptian-fintech-startup-cassbana-raises-1m-pre-seed-funding-round/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1 million pre-seed investment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by VC firm </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/disruptech"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disruptech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a bid to drive expansion within the country.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="aHIRrtsSEv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/nigerias-kuda-raises-10m-to-be-the-mobile-first-challenger-bank-for-africa/">Nigeria&#8217;s Kuda raises $10M to be the mobile-first challenger bank for Africa</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nigeria&#8217;s Kuda raises $10M to be the mobile-first challenger bank for Africa&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/nigerias-kuda-raises-10m-to-be-the-mobile-first-challenger-bank-for-africa/embed/#?secret=aHIRrtsSEv" data-secret="aHIRrtsSEv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why the sudden change in appetite from investors?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreata Muforo is a partner at TLcom Capital, a pan-African early-stage VC firm. She told TechCrunch that last year&#8217;s run of 23 pre-seed rounds (10 of which were $150,000+ deals) per </span><a href="https://www.briterintelligence.com/deals"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briter Bridges data</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> was due to the confidence investors had in the market, especially fintech.</span></p>
<h2>Startups building financial infrastructure got noticed</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most African pre-seed investments in 2020 went to fintech, there were exceptions, including Egyptian edtech startup </span><a href="https://zedny.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zedny,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which raised $1.2 million; Nigerian automotive tech startup </span><a href="https://www.autochek.africa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autochek Africa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which raised $3.4 million; and Nigerian talent startup </span><a href="https://talentql.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TalentQL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which raised $300,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Paystack and Flutterwave built payment infrastructure for thousands of African businesses, these fintech startups are trying to make their mark in the sweet spots of credit and banking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fintech is compelling. But while most fintech startups play around the commodities side of fintech, it&#8217;s the companies building infrastructure around the market that got most of the pre-seed validation last year,&#8221; Muforo said. Her firm, TLcom, led the $1 million pre-seed investment in Okra.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://okra.ng/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okra</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an API fintech startup. So are </span><a href="https://mono.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mono</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://onepipe.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OnePipe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://pngme.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pngme</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They are building Africa&#8217;s API infrastructure that connects bank accounts with financial institutions and third-party companies for different purposes. Within the past 18 months, Mono and Pngme raised $500,000, while OnePipe raised $950,000 in pre-seed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is noteworthy that while these startups are clamoring to solve Africa&#8217;s open API banking issues, three of the four deals came after Visa&#8217;s</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/visa-is-acquiring-plaid-for-5-3-billion-2x-its-final-private-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $5.3 billion acquisition of Plaid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year in January.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Visa-Plaid acquisition </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has now been called off</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it is safe to say some African investors developed FOMO, handing out sizable checks to fund &#8220;Africa&#8217;s Plaid” in the process.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="co4UMRfdqL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">Visa will not acquire Plaid after running into regulatory wall</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Visa will not acquire Plaid after running into regulatory wall&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/embed/#?secret=co4UMRfdqL" data-secret="co4UMRfdqL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital lenders remain one of their most important customers for fintech API startups. They can access customers’ financial accounts to understand their spending patterns and know who to loan to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Egypt&#8217;s </span><a href="https://shahry.app/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shahry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Nigeria&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.evolvecredit.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evolve Credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are fintech startups building credit infrastructure for their markets. Evolve Credit connects digital lenders to those who need loan services in Nigeria via its online loan marketplace. Shahry, on the other hand, employs an AI-based credit scoring engine so users in Egypt can apply for credit. The pair also secured impressive pre-seed funding &#8212; Evolve Credit, $325,000, and Shahry, $650,000.</span></p>
<h2>A recurring theme: Serial founders</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muforo points out that aside from startups building fintech infrastructure, the caliber of founders was another reason pre-seed funding peaked last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adewale Yusuf, co-founder and CEO of </span><a href="https://talentql.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TalentQL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that hires, manages and outsources talent for Nigerian and global companies, seemed to agree. He told TechCrunch that trust between the VCs and founders involved played a major role in most pre-seed rounds last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t surprising that a lot of investors put money in pre-seed rounds. I say this because we also saw existing founders and serial entrepreneurs coming back to the market. To me, these founders&#8217; credibility was a major part of why those rounds were large,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second-time founder himself, Yusuf is the co-founder of Nigerian tech media publication Techpoint Africa. His partner at TalentQL, Opeyemi Awoyemi, is also a serial entrepreneur. He co-founded Ringier One Africa Media-owned Jobberman, one of Africa&#8217;s most popular recruitment platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Adedayo Amzat, founder of </span><a href="https://zedcrest.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zedcrest Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is the lead investor in TalentQL’s round, the founders’ experience proved vital in closing the deal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He says investors are more comfortable backing experienced founders in pre-seed rounds because they have a more mature understanding of the problems they’re trying to solve. So, in essence, they tend to raise more capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you look at pre-seed sizes, experienced founders can demand a significant premium over first-time founders,&#8221; Amzat said. &#8220;Pre-seed valuation cap for first-time founders will typically be between 400K to $1 million while we frequently see up to $5 million for experienced founders.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a recurring theme last year. Yele Bademosi, who runs </span><a href="http://www.microtraction.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microtraction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a West African early-stage VC firm, is the CEO of </span><a href="https://bundle.africa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bundle Africa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Nigerian-based crypto-exchange startup that raised $450,000 in April 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shahry co-founders Sherif ElRakabawy and Mohamed Ewis also run Egypt’s largest shopping engine and price comparison website, <a href="https://yaoota.com/en-eg/">Yaoota</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mono co-founder and CEO Abdulhamid Hassan was the co-founder of Nigerian fintech startup OyaPay and data science startup Voyance. Also, Etop Ikpe, the co-founder and CEO of Autochek Africa, was CEO of DealDey and Cars45.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Fara Ashiru Jituboh of Okra and Akan Nelson of Evolve Credit as first-time founders got investments that most of their counterparts would only dream of. For Jituboh, her solid tech background spoke for her &#8212; boasting a senior software engineering job at Pexels and engineering consultant role at Canva before founding Okra.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We backed Fara because she&#8217;s a strong tech founder. When you look at the core of what Okra does as a tech-heavy company, you see how important it was to make the decision,&#8221; Muforo said about backing Okra&#8217;s CEO and CTO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelson also told TechCrunch that his finance background helped Evolve Credit raise its six-figure sum. The team&#8217;s bullishness on finding product-market fit and the potential of Africa&#8217;s loan marketplace was also enough to bring foreign and local VCs like <a href="https://samurai-incubate-africa.asia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samurai Incubate</a>, <a href="https://www.future.africa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Future Africa</a>, <a href="https://ingressivecapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ingressive Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.microtraction.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microtraction</a> on board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While early-stage investments in African startups haven&#8217;t reached full speed, the explosion in the number of angel investors has lowered entry barriers into early-stage investing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now investors are beginning to show readiness toward African startups that have promise as they continue to search for the next Paystack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;More people are willing to take risks now in the market, especially angel investors. They can easily let go of $10K-$50K because of success stories like Paystack,&#8221; Yusuf said about the $200 million </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquisition by U.S. payments startup Stripe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5BFKB8wujp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/">Stripe acquires Nigeria&#8217;s Paystack for $200M+ to expand into the African continent</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Stripe acquires Nigeria&#8217;s Paystack for $200M+ to expand into the African continent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/embed/#?secret=5BFKB8wujp" data-secret="5BFKB8wujp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For all of its significance to the African tech ecosystem, what particularly stands out about Paystack&#8217;s exit is the return on investment made for early investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time it exited in October 2020, some angel investors had an ROI of more than 1,400% according to Jason Njoku in his </span><a href="https://jason.com.ng/paystack-acquisition-angel-investors-turned-1-3m-into-15-20m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Njoku, who took part in the round as an angel investor, is the CEO of</span><a href="http://iroko.ng/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> IROKO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Nigerian VOD internet company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Muforo, witnessing more early-stage investments is a big deal, one the African tech ecosystem should savor regardless of the round in question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Pre-seed or seed are just names investors and founders give. They can basically mean the same thing, in my opinion,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What I think is most important is the fact that we&#8217;re getting more early-stage capital into Africa, and startups are getting more attention from investors, which is fantastic.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/small-cap/21/01/18914558/2020-the-year-of-the-spac">many</a> deemed <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/2020-is-the-year-of-the-spac/">2020</a> the year of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/19/business/dealbook/deals-mergers-acquisitions-2020.html">SPAC</a>, short for special purpose acquisition company, 2021 may well make last year look quaint in comparison.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably not premature to be asking: is there any company too big to be SPAC&#8217;d?</p>
<p>Just today, we saw the trading debut of the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/united-wholesale-mortgage-goes-public-in-biggest-spac-deal-ever-11611336319">most valuable company to date</a> go public through a merger with one of these SPACs: 35-five-year-old, Pontiac, Michigan-based <a href="https://www.uwm.com/">United Wholesale Mortgage</a>, which is among the biggest mortgage companies in the U.S.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its shares slipped a bit by the end of trading, closing at $11.35 down from their starting price of $11.54, but it&#8217;s doubtful anyone involved is crying into their cocktails tonight. The outfit was valued at a whopping $16 billion when its merger with the blank-check outfit Gores Holdings IV was approved earlier this week.</p>
<p>Why is this interesting? Well, first, despite UWM&#8217;s size, its path to going public took less than a year, beginning with Gores Holdings IV completing its IPO in late January 2020 and raising approximately $425 million in cash.</p>
<p>Alec Gores, the billionaire founder of of the private equity firm Gores Group, led the deal. The tie-up was announced <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-united-wholesale-mortgage-m-a-gores-h/united-wholesale-agrees-merger-with-gores-holdings-to-go-public-idUSKCN26E1PH">back in September</a> and ultimately included an additional $500 million private placement. (It&#8217;s typical to tack-on these transactions once a target company has been identified and accepts the terms of the proposed merger. Most targets are many times larger than the blank check companies with which they are joining forces.)</p>
<p>Also notable is that UWM is a mature company, one that says it generated $1.3 billion in revenue in the third quarter of last year alone and whose CEO, whose father started the company in 1986, <a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/ahead-of-its-big-ipo-united-wholesale-mortgage-reports-record-volume-and-margins/">said last fall</a> that the company is &#8220;massively profitable.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a story unlike that of most outfits to go public recently through the SPAC process. Consider Opendoor, Luminar Technologies, and Virgin Galactic. Each is still developing a business that needs capital to keep going and which might not have found much more funding from private market investors.</p>
<p>SpaceX director Steve Jurvetson underscored the point pretty bluntly <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/steve-jurvetson-maryanna-saenko-on-space-spacs-great/id1498270180?i=1000505493210">last week</a>, saying, for example, that Virgin Galactic has seen &#8220;no positive business development&#8221; since being taken public. &#8220;They announced that they&#8217;re going to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352390/virgin-galactic-supersonic-aircraft-mach-3-rolls-royce">develop a hypersonic plane</a>, but that has zero synergy with the current business they&#8217;re trying to launch, which is suborbital spaceflights, which have yet to happen for customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>If more profitable, more mature, more businesses with a very clear path to future revenue &#8212; more companies like UMW &#8212; begin choosing SPACs over traditional IPOs, it could change widespread perceptions of SPAC candidates as businesses that had nowhere else to go.</p>
<p>It could also broaden thinking about what size companies are appropriate to take public this way and lead to much bigger transactions.</p>
<p>More certain: UWM isn&#8217;t likely to hold the record for &#8216;biggest SPAC deal ever&#8217; for long. Not only is interest in SPACs as feverish as ever, but one vehicle in particular seems poised to take the title, and that&#8217;s the SPAC of billionaire investor William Ackman, whose blank-check company raised $4 billion last summer.</p>
<p>Presumably, the deal will be a doozy. Reportedly, Ackerman was at one point looking to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/03/airbnb-spurns-approach-to-go-public-through-ackmans-blank-check-company.html">take public</a> Airbnb with his SPAC. When Airbnb passed on the proposed merger, he reportedly <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/20/michael-bloomberg-in-talks-to-take-his-media-empire-public/">reached out</a> to the privately held media conglomerate Bloomberg. (Bloomberg has said it&#8217;s untrue.)</p>
<p>Because SPACs typically complete a merger with a private company in two years or less, speculation has been runs rampant about what Ackman &#8212; who plans to kick in an additional $1 billion in cash from his hedge fund &#8212; will piece together with all that money.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there have been 59 new SPAC offerings in the last 22 days alone &#8212; as many as in all of 2019. They&#8217;ve raised $16.8 billion. And there&#8217;s seemingly no end in sight.</p>
<p>Just this week, Fifth Wall Ventures, the four-year-old, L.A.-based proptech focused venture firm, registered plans to raise <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2020/08/04/blank-check-companies-make-a-comeback-in-real-estate/">$250 million</a> for a new blank-check company.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Intel Chairman Omar Ishrak, who previously ran medical device giant Medtronic, is planning to raise between <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-19/intel-chairman-said-to-eye-up-to-1-billion-health-tech-spac-ipo">$750 million and $1 billion</a> for a blank-check firm targeting deals in the health tech sector, Bloomberg reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>As for Gores Group, on Wednesday, it <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/75407/The-Gores-Groups-seventh-SPAC-Gores-Holdings-VII-files-for-a-$400-million-I">registered plans</a> to raise $400 million in an IPO for its newest blank-check company. It will be the outfit&#8217;s seventh SPAC to date.</p>

<p>Alphabet announced that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-alphabet-is-shutting-down-loon-internet/">it&#8217;s shutting down Loon</a>, the project that used balloons to bring high-speed internet to more remote parts of the world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Loon started out under Alphabet&#8217;s experimental projects group X, before spinning out as a separate company in 2018. Despite some successful deployments, it seems that Loon was never able to find a sustainable business model.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we’ve found a number of willing partners along the way, we haven’t found a way to get the costs low enough to build a long-term, sustainable business,&#8221; Loon CEO Alastair Westgarth wrote in a blog post. &#8220;Developing radical new technology is inherently risky, but that doesn’t make breaking this news any easier.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Almost half the global population currently has no internet access, and many who do cannot freely access all information sources.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The digital divide is now a matter of life and death for people who are unable to access essential healthcare information,” <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/06/12/global-digital-divide-barrier-wider-equality-must-be-closed-says-world-wide-web">said</a> UN Secretary General António Guterres in June 2020. Almost half the global population currently has no internet access, and many who do cannot freely access all information sources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freedom House, which tracks internet restrictions worldwide, says the coronavirus pandemic is accelerating a dramatic decline in global internet freedom. It found that </span><a href="https://freedomhouse.org/article/report-amid-global-decline-china-remains-worlds-worst-abuser-internet-freedom-2020"><span style="font-weight: 400;">governments in at least 28 countries censored websites and social media posts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020 to suppress unfavorable health statistics, corruption allegations and other COVID-19-related content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, U.S. company <a href="https://toki.com/">Toki</a> is building “school-in-a-box” devices to connect up to 1 billion people across Africa and Asia, using technologies that it claims could filter content to avoid some information sources and bypass local censorship. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The devices will be Wi-Fi-ready servers that run on electric power or batteries and can handle dozens of concurrent users. If no networks are available, the servers will also come pre-installed with digital libraries curated to provide “</span><a href="https://toki.com/products"><span style="font-weight: 400;">locally relevant content</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Toki’s country managers <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-o-997104170/?trk=public_profile_browsemap_profile-result-card_result-card_full-click&amp;originalSubdomain=ng">describes on LinkedIn</a> that the devices would also run a decentralized search engine, designed to be anonymous, private and censorship-resistant. They will be donated to communities in the developing world by U.S.-based <a href="https://www.erise.org/about/">eRise</a>*, which was founded in 2019 to, according to its website, “focus on digital empowerment initiatives that are capital-efficient, and which improve access to content, community and commerce.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Toki and eRise were founded by entrepreneur and free speech advocate Rob Monster. Monster owns domain registration company Epik, which allowed controversial social network Parler to come briefly back online last week after the site was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-is-officially-offline-after-aws-suspension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">booted from Amazon&#8217;s cloud service</a>. Parler is just one of several platforms enabled by Epik, and Monster’s other domain and web hosting companies, that have been home to far-right content. Parler is accused of hosting users that <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-the-capitol-riot-what-the-parler-videos-reveal">helped to coordinate the attack</a> on the U.S. Capitol on January 6. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="b18QvwzRpc"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-is-officially-offline-after-aws-suspension/">Parler is officially offline after AWS suspension</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Parler is officially offline after AWS suspension&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-is-officially-offline-after-aws-suspension/embed/#?secret=b18QvwzRpc" data-secret="b18QvwzRpc" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “school-in-a-box” would contain a memory card with educational content, games, books, maps and modules related to prayers, the story of religions and “the art of being grateful.” It says the device is intended for “parents who want their kids to be smarter and curious; schools who can’t afford a computer; [and] religious places who wish to spread awareness about education and empower the society.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But one researcher says this effort recalls Facebook’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/facebook-addresses-political-controversy-in-india-monetization-opportunities-startup-investments/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">heavily criticized project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offering free connectivity in India, which spawned accusations of bias and self-censorship. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve seen a similar tactic by Facebook, to provide digital access points that can also serve the purpose of delivering favorable content and ensuring that these groups become dependent on your benevolence,” said Dr. Joan Donovan, director of the</span><a href="https://shorensteincenter.org/programs/technology-social-change/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology and Social Change Research Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the Shorenstein Center. “It becomes that much harder later on to change the power dynamics when the ideology is in the infrastructure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monster has used free speech arguments to defend Epik’s</span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/gy4yg9/the-far-right-has-found-a-web-host-savior"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">working with platforms that either welcome or tolerate extreme content</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, has been</span><a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/19/epik-parler-web-domain-dns-provider-gab-conservatives-social-media/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as saying that Monster “offers services to the most disreputable horrific people on the Internet.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Epik spokesperson Rob Davis told TechCrunch that Epik actively works with its clients to help them moderate content, and claimed that the company has deplatformed Nazi groups and deleted those promoting genocide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lawful, responsible freedom of speech is an amazing right,” said Davis. “Every [domain registrar] has groups like this but Epik is often held to a higher standard.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a series of</span><a href="https://www.namepros.com/threads/update-on-erise-org-philanthropy-making-impact.1162664/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">posts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019 on a forum dedicated to domain-name trading, Monster provided more details about the Toki technology. The servers would be powered by cheap Raspberry Pi processors and run a proprietary version of Linux that would enable file sharing, peer-to-peer commerce, a digital wallet and a personalized search engine, with the option of “</span><a href="https://www.namepros.com/threads/update-on-erise-org-philanthropy-making-impact.1162664/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ignoring certain data sources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KV33F7UVQh"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/facebook-addresses-political-controversy-in-india-monetization-opportunities-startup-investments/">Facebook addresses political controversy in India, monetization opportunities, startup investments</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook addresses political controversy in India, monetization opportunities, startup investments&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/facebook-addresses-political-controversy-in-india-monetization-opportunities-startup-investments/embed/#?secret=KV33F7UVQh" data-secret="KV33F7UVQh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Decentralization not only means decentralization of the narrative and talking points of big tech groups like Google, Twitter and Facebook,” said Epik&#8217;s Davis. “It also means anti-censorship by empowering people with things that they didn’t know.” The spokesperson gave the example of naturopathic remedies for minor health complaints. Naturopathic remedies have not been proven to be effective against COVID-19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, each device might come pre-loaded with a “snapshot” of the internet, said Davis, although he did not describe how the internet might be reduced to fit on a single, small physical device. The eRise website notes that content would be curated by local digital librarians that it would recruit. Davis told TechCrunch that Toki has working models of its server, is already conducting field trials and hopes to start deploying the devices to 6,000 villages in Africa in 2022 or 2023, perhaps in collaboration with an unnamed Asian telecoms company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Toki devices’ selectivity, if practical, could raise its own content and censorship concerns; for example, if eRise allowed extreme content similar to that seen on Epik’s clients like Gab and Parler, or ignored scientific advice on COVID-19 or other health issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donovan said she is wary of any one-box solution. “We have to focus on decoupling information companies from service providers,” she said. “That much control can be used for political gain. Technology is politics by other means.”</span></p>
<p>*ERise had claimed<em> to be a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, which would have exempted it from some taxes and allow tax-free donations. TechCrunch could not locate it on the IRS’s database of nonprofits. Monster later admitted eRise was not a registered 501(c)(3)) and removed its 501(c)(3) claim</em></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">At Battery, a central part of our consumer investing practice involves tracking the evolution of where and how consumers find and purchase goods and services. From our annual <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/Battery_Ventures/the-state-of-marketplaces-march-2020?ref=https://www.battery.com/powered/state-of-marketplaces-march-2020/">Battery Marketplace Index</a>, we’ve seen seismic shifts in how consumer purchasing behavior has changed over the years, starting with the move to the web and, more recently, to mobile and on-demand via smartphones.</p>
<p>The evolution looks like this in a nutshell: In the early days, listing sites like Craigslist, Angie’s List* and Yelp effectively put the Yellow Pages online — you could find a new restaurant or plumber on the web, but the process of contacting them was largely still offline. As consumers grew more comfortable with the web, marketplaces like eBay, Etsy, Expedia and Wayfair* emerged, enabling historically offline transactions to occur online.</p>
<p>More recently, and spurred in large part by mobile, on-demand use cases, managed marketplaces like Uber, DoorDash, Instacart and StockX* have taken online consumer purchasing a step further. They play a greater role in the operations of the marketplace, from automatically matching demand with supply, to verifying the supply side for quality, to dynamic pricing.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The key purpose of being end-to-end is to deliver an even better value proposition to consumers relative to incumbent alternatives.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Each stage of this evolution unlocked billions of dollars in value, and many of the names listed above remain the largest consumer internet companies today.</p>
<p>At their core, these companies are facilitators, matching consumer demand with existing supply of a product or service. While there is no doubt these companies play a hugely valuable role in our lives, we increasingly believe that simply facilitating a transaction or service isn’t enough. Particularly in industries where supply is scarce, or in old-guard industries where innovation in the underlying product or service is slow, a digitized marketplace — even when managed — can produce underwhelming experiences for consumers.</p>
<p>In these instances, starting from the ground up is what is really required to deliver an optimal consumer experience. Back in 2014, Chris Dixon wrote a bit about this phenomenon in his post on &#8220;<a href="https://cdixon.org/2014/03/15/full-stack-startups">Full stack startups</a>.&#8221; Fast forward several years, and more startups than ever are “full stack” or as we call it, “end-to-end operators.”</p>
<p>These businesses are fundamentally reimagining their product experience by owning the entire value chain<em>,<strong> </strong></em>from <em>end to end</em>, thereby creating a step-functionally better experience for consumers. Owning more in the stack of operations gives these companies better control over quality, customer service, delivery, pricing and more &#8212; which gives consumers a better, faster and cheaper experience.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that these end-to-end models typically require more capital to reach scale, as greater upfront investment is necessary to get them off the ground than other, more narrowly focused marketplaces<strong>. </strong>But in our experience, the additional capital required is often outweighed by the value captured from owning the entire experience.</p>
<h2>End-to-end operators span many verticals</h2>
<p>Many of these businesses have reached meaningful scale across industries:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2099098" style="width: 780px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2099098" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2099098" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/endtoendoperators.png" alt="a list of companies that are disrupting incumbents across several industries" width="770" height="1028" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/endtoendoperators.png 770w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/endtoendoperators.png?resize=112,150 112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/endtoendoperators.png?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/endtoendoperators.png?resize=768,1025 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/endtoendoperators.png?resize=509,680 509w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/endtoendoperators.png?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2099098" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.battery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Battery Ventures </a><span class="screen-reader-text"><a href="https://www.battery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(opens in a new window)</a></span></p></div></p>
<p>All of these companies have recognized they can deliver more value to consumers by “owning” every aspect of the underlying product or service — from the bike to the workout content in Peloton’s case, or the bank account to the credit card in Chime’s case. They have reinvented and reimagined the entire consumer experience, from <em>end to end.</em></p>
<h2>What does success for end-to-end operator businesses look like?</h2>
<p>As investors, we’ve had the privilege of meeting with many of these next-generation end-to-end operators over the years and found that those with the greatest success tend to exhibit the five key elements below:</p>
<h3>1. Going after very large markets</h3>
<p>The end-to-end approach makes the most sense when disrupting very large markets. In the graphic above, notice that most of these companies play in the largest, but notoriously archaic industries like banking, insurance, real estate, healthcare, etc. Incumbents in these industries are very large and entrenched, but they are legacy players, making them slow to adopt new technology. For the most part, they have failed to meet the needs of our digital-native, mobile-savvy generation and their experiences lag behind consumer expectations of today (evidenced by low, or sometimes even negative, NPS scores). Rebuilding the experience from the ground up is sometimes the only way to satisfy today’s consumers in these massive markets.</p>
<h3>2. Step-functionally better consumer experience versus the status quo<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[Speaking as an unvaccinated urban dweller: I'd rather speak to a nurse or doctor via my laptop than try to remain physically distanced on a bus or hailed ride traveling to/from their office.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I had my first telehealth consultation last year, and there&#8217;s a high probability that you did, too. Since the pandemic began, consumer adoption of remote healthcare has increased 300%.</p>
<p>Speaking as an unvaccinated urban dweller: I&#8217;d rather speak to a nurse or doctor via my laptop than try to remain physically distanced on a bus or hailed ride traveling to/from their office.</p>
<p>Even after things return to <em>(rolls eyes)</em> normal, if I thought there was a reliable way to receive high-quality healthcare in my living room, I&#8217;d choose it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Clearly, I&#8217;m not alone: a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/telehealth-a-quarter-trillion-dollar-post-covid-19-reality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 2020 McKinsey study</a> pegged yearly domestic telehealth revenue at $3 billion before the coronavirus, but estimated that &#8220;up to $250 billion of current U.S. healthcare spend could potentially be virtualized&#8221; after the pandemic abates.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a staggering number, but in a category that includes startups focused on sexual health, women&#8217;s health, pediatrics, mental health, data management and testing, it&#8217;s clear to see why digital-health funding topped more than $10 billion in the first three quarters of 2020.</p>
<p>Drawing from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/the-techcrunch-list/">The TechCrunch List</a>, reporter Sarah Buhr <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/8-vcs-agree-behavioral-support-and-remote-visits-make-digital-health-a-strong-bet-for-2021/">interviewed eight active health tech VCs</a> to learn more about the companies and industry verticals that have captured their interest in 2021:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bryan Roberts and Bob Kocher, partners, Venrock</li>
<li>Nan Li, managing director, Obvious Ventures</li>
<li>Elizabeth Yin, general partner, Hustle Fund</li>
<li>Christina Farr, principal investor and health tech lead, OMERS Ventures</li>
<li>Ursheet Parikh, partner, Mayfield Ventures</li>

<hr />
<p>Since COVID-19 has renewed Washington&#8217;s focus on healthcare, many investors said they expect a friendly regulatory environment for telehealth in 2021. Additionally, healthcare providers are looking for ways to reduce costs and lower barriers for patients seeking behavioral support.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remote really does work,&#8221; said Elizabeth Yin, general partner at Hustle Fund.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll cover digital health in more depth this year through additional surveys, vertical reporting, founder interviews and much more.</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading Extra Crunch this week; I hope you have a relaxing weekend.</p>

<p>A big IPO debut is a juicy topic for a few news cycles, but because there&#8217;s always another unicorn ready to break free from its corral and leap into the public markets, it doesn&#8217;t leave a lot of time to reflect.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/hot-ipos-hang-onto-gains-as-investors-keep-betting-on-tech/">Alex studied companies like Lemonade, Airbnb and Affirm</a> to see how well these IPO pop stars have retained their value. Not only have most held steady, &#8220;many have actually run up the score in the ensuing weeks,&#8221; he found.</p>

<p>I began my career as an avid TechCrunch reader and remained one even when I joined as a writer, when I left to work on other things and now that I’ve returned to focus on better serving our community.</p>
<p>I’ve been chatting with some of the folks in our community and I’d love to talk to you, too. Nothing fancy, just 5-10 minutes of your time to hear more about what you want to see from us and get some feedback on what we’ve been doing so far.</p>
<p>If you would be so kind as to take a minute or two to <a href="https://elxde0ik7j1.typeform.com/to/Y1yIXgrH">fill out this form</a>, I’ll drop you a note and hopefully we can have a chat about the future of the Extra Crunch community before we formally roll out some of the ideas we’re cooking up.</p>

<p>Last year was a disaster across the board thanks to a global pandemic, economic uncertainty and widespread social and political upheaval.</p>
<p>But if you were involved in the private markets, however, 2020 had some very clear upside — VCs flowed $156.2 billion into U.S.-based startups, &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/in-2020-vcs-invested-428m-into-us-based-startups-every-day/">or around $428 million for each day,</a>&#8221; reports Alex Wilhelm.</p>
<p>&#8220;The huge sum of money, however, was itself dwarfed by the amount of liquidity that American startups generated, some $290.1 billion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using data sourced from the National Venture Capital Association and PitchBook, Alex used Monday&#8217;s column to recap last year&#8217;s seed, early-stage and late-stage rounds.</p>

<p>“Where do I want to see the company in three years? I want to see three things: I want to be public, I want to see us driving a lot of profits and I want it to be a lot bigger, because we’ve consolidated a lot of other publications,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We are all pumping out data into the cloud. Some of it we&#8217;d like to keep forever. <a href="https://www.emortal.com/">Emortal</a> is a startup that wants to help you organize, protect, preserve and pass on your &#8220;digital legacy&#8221; and protect it from becoming unreadable, otherwise known as &#8220;bit-rot.&#8221; The project has received backing from the legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf">Vint Cerf</a>, one of the co-creators and founding fathers of the internet.</p>
<p>Emortal, which has been in engineering R&amp;D for more than 10 years, has raised $5.7 million from &#8220;friends and family.&#8221; It is now raising $2.7 million in <a href="https://www.crowdcube.com/companies/emortal-1/pitches/bXdvOb">crowdfunding</a> on the U.K.&#8217;s Crowdcube platform, following what it says was a successful BETA test.</p>
<p>The company will use Google architecture to preserve digital memories — photographs, documents, correspondence, videos, interviews and more – indefinitely into the future. The idea is that this will ensure that as operating systems, devices and tech evolves, your entire digital legacy will remain safe, secure and accessible — to only those you choose.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2099618" style="width: 691px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2099618" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2099618 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2020-12-18-at-11.14.07-1.png" alt="" width="681" height="385" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2020-12-18-at-11.14.07-1.png 681w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2020-12-18-at-11.14.07-1.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2020-12-18-at-11.14.07-1.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2020-12-18-at-11.14.07-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2099618" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Emortal</p></div></p>
<p>The platform is now set to be launched in the U.K. and U.S. in Q3 this year and will be designed for occasional considered use, for example when taking a picture at a christening, rather than saving every photo you take. It will charge a flat, standard subscription fee of £4.99 a month.</p>
<p>Cerf said in a statement: “The cornerstone of the Emortal proposition is to tie data preservation in with digital legacy protection to ensure that our digital memories are safe and accessible for generations to come.”</p>
<p>Colin Culross, founder and CEO of Emortal said: “We are keen to use the Crowdcube platform for this raise because Emortal is a service designed for ALL families. We believe the most powerful way for the business to grow is to have thousands of our customers investing in the business.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Moving from dorm room to billion-dollar exit is the dream of every startup founder. Dries Buytaert got there by being bold, working hard and thinking big.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twenty years ago <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a> and <a href="http://acquia.com">Acquia</a> founder Dries Buytaert was a college student at the University of Antwerp. He wanted to put his burgeoning programming skills to work by building a communications tool for his dorm. That simple idea evolved over time into the open-source Drupal web content management system, and eventually a commercial company called Acquia built on top of it.</p>
<p>Buytaert would later raise over $180 million and exit in 2019 when the company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/vista-equity-partners-buys-acquia-for-1b/">acquired by Vista Equity Partners for $1 billion</a>, but it took 18 years of hard work to reach that point.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			When Drupal came along in the early 2000s, it wasn&#8217;t the only open-source option, but it was part of a major movement toward giving companies options by democratizing web content management.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Many startups are built on open source today, but back in the early 2000s, there were only a few trail blazers and none that had taken the path that Acquia took. Buytaert and his co-founders decided to reduce the complexity of configuring a Drupal installation by building a hosted cloud service.</p>
<p>That seems like a no-brainer now, but consider at the time in 2009, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/">AWS was still a fledgling side project</a> at Amazon, not <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">the $45 billion behemoth</a> it is today. In 2021, building a startup on top of an open-source project with a SaaS version is a proven and common strategy. Back then nobody else had done it. As it turned out, taking the path less traveled worked out well for Acquia.</p>
<p>Moving from dorm room to billion-dollar exit is the dream of every startup founder. Buytaert got there by being bold, working hard and thinking big. His story is compelling, but it also offers lessons for startup founders who also want to build something big.</p>
<h2>Born in the proverbial dorm room</h2>
<p>In the days before everyone had internet access and a phone in their pockets, Buytaert simply wanted to build a way for him and his friends to communicate in a centralized way. &#8220;I wanted to build kind of an internal message board really to communicate with the other people in the dorm, and it was literally talking about things like &#8216;Hey, let&#8217;s grab a drink at 8:00,'&#8221; Buytaert told me.</p>
<p>He also wanted to hone his programming skills. &#8220;At the same time I wanted to learn about PHP and MySQL, which at the time were emerging technologies, and so I figured I would spend a few evenings putting together a basic message board using PHP and MySQL, so that I could learn about these technologies, and then actually have something that we could use.&#8221;</p>
<p>The resulting product served its purpose well, but when graduation beckoned, Buytaert realized if he unplugged his PC and moved on, the community he had built would die. At that point, he decided to move the site to the public internet and named it drop.org, which was actually an accident. Originally, he meant to register dorp.org because &#8220;dorp&#8221; is Dutch for &#8220;village or small community,&#8221; but he mistakenly inverted the letters during registration.</p>
<p>Buytaert continued adding features to drop.org like diaries (a precursor to blogging) and RSS feeds. Eventually, he came up with the idea of open-sourcing the software that ran the site, calling it Drupal.</p>
<h2>The birth of web content management</h2>
<p>About the same time Buytaert was developing the basis of what would become Drupal, web content management (WCM) was a fresh market. Early websites had been fairly simple and straightforward, but they were growing more complex in the late 90s and a bunch of startups were trying to solve the problem of managing them. Buytaert likely didn’t know it, but there was an industry waiting for an open-source tool like Drupal.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Boston Globe is starting a new program by which people who feel an article at the newspaper is harmful to their reputation can ask that it be updated or anonymized. It&#8217;s reminiscent of the EU&#8217;s &#8220;right to be forgotten,&#8221; though potentially less controversial, since it concerns only one editorial outlet and not a content-agnostic search engine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/01/22/metro/boston-globe-launches-fresh-start-initiative-people-can-apply-update-or-anonymize-coverage-them-thats-online/">The &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; initiative</a> isn&#8217;t for removing bad restaurant reviews or coverage of serious crimes, but rather for more commonplace crime desk reporting: a hundred words saying so-and-so was arrested for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, perhaps with a mugshot.</p>
<p>Such stories do serve a purpose, of course, in informing readers of crime in their area. But as the Globe&#8217;s editor, Brian McGrory points out:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p><span class="html-render">It was never our intent to have a short and relatively inconsequential Globe story affect the futures of the ordinary people who might be the subjects. Our sense, given the criminal justice system, is that this has had a disproportionate impact on people of color. The idea behind the program is to start addressing it.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Evidence of bias in policing, which is turned into inherited bias in reporting, is a serious problem and one the country has been grappling with for decades. But it is exacerbated by the nature of the digital record.</p>
<p>An employer looking at an application has only to search for the name or a few other details to find any standout information, such as a crime sheet entry with a mugshot. And while outlets often cover low-level arrests, they rarely cover low-level acquittals or dropped charges. No one clicks on those, after all. So for many the result is incomplete and therefore potentially damaging information.</p>
<p>The attempt in Europe to fix this at the search engine level has been met with opposition and difficulty, since search engines are not in charge of the information they index and felt they should not be put in the position of deciding what should or shouldn&#8217;t be removed. Furthermore the task may be complex, as a single article may be replicated or referenced dozens or thousands of times, or backed up on a site like the Internet Archive. What then?</p>
<p>At the same time, it&#8217;s certainly less of a threat to free speech to ask a search engine to limit discoverability than to ask a publication to remove or change its content. The debate is ongoing.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="emsSQTjekb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/advisor-to-europes-top-court-favors-regional-limit-to-right-to-be-forgotten/">Advisor to Europe&#8217;s top court favors regional limit to &#8216;right to be forgotten&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Advisor to Europe&#8217;s top court favors regional limit to &#8216;right to be forgotten&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/advisor-to-europes-top-court-favors-regional-limit-to-right-to-be-forgotten/embed/#?secret=emsSQTjekb" data-secret="emsSQTjekb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Globe&#8217;s approach is nowhere near as comprehensive as making Google &#8220;forget&#8221; a person&#8217;s record, but it is considerably simpler and less open to opposition. The paper exerts editorial control over itself, of course, and the question is not one of putting a piece of information down the memory hole, but revisiting whether it was newsworthy to begin with.</p>
<p><span class="html-render">&#8220;It’s changing how we look at our coverage,&#8221; said managing editor for digital Jason Tuohey in the Globe announcement of its new endeavor. &#8220;If we change a story like this with the Fresh Start committee, why would we assign one like it next week?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The newspaper has established a 10-person committee to examine petitions from people asking to have articles updated — never removed, it&#8217;s important to add. While an earlier effort like this at the Cleveland Plain Dealer required people to show a court record expungement order, there is no legal bar to meet here.</p>
<p>The team admits off the bat that this will be complicated. Automated or fraudulent requests will surely pour in, public figures will take a shot, there will be conflicting opinions on what evidence, if any, is required to confirm an event or identity, and so on. And at the end, all that will be accomplished is one article, perhaps even just one line, will be altered — long after it has been replicated across the web and archival infrastructure. But it&#8217;s a start.</p>
<p>One paper doing this may not have a large effect, but if the program is successful other outlets may take notice. And as Tuohey noted, the wisdom of publishing the information in the first place starts to look shaky when one learns how ramshackle the justice system really is. Perhaps it&#8217;s only fair that people have a shot at applying that newfound skepticism to events of years past.</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks they could benefit from Fresh Start <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/01/22/metro/globes-fresh-start-initiative-submit-your-appeal/">can apply here</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In what feels like an attempt at kicking some bad news under the rug on a Friday, Microsoft announced this morning that the price of Xbox Live Gold is going up.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Updated at 10:26PM PT, January 22</strong>: Microsoft is backtracking on the planned price hike of Xbox Live Gold, less than 24 hours after making the announcement as the gaming giant attempts to mend its relationship with fans.</p>
<p>“We messed up today and you were right to let us know. Connecting and playing with friends is a vital part of gaming and we failed to meet the expectations of players who count on it every day. As a result, we have decided not to change Xbox Live Gold pricing,” the company wrote in a blog post.</p>
<p>Microsoft said it is going a step further to make up with Xbox users. The company said free-to-play games on Xbox will no longer require an Xbox Live Gold subscription for online play. “We are working hard to deliver this change as soon as possible in the coming months,” the company wrote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Our original story from earlier Friday follows.</p>
<p>————————————————</p>
<p>In what feels like an attempt at kicking some bad news under the rug on a Friday, Microsoft <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/01/22/update-on-xbox-live-gold-pricing/">announced this morning</a> that the price of Xbox Live Gold is going up.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s how the price changes break down:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The one-month plan is going from $10 per month to $11.</li>
<li>The three-month plan is going from $25 to $30.</li>
<li>The six-month plan is going from $40 to $60 — but only for new customers, says Microsoft.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;But what about the twelve-month plan? Didn&#8217;t they used to offer those?&#8221;</p>
<p>They did! It was $60 — or the price that a six-month subscription will go for now. They stopped selling <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/microsoft-stops-selling-12-month-xbox-live-gold-subscriptions">twelve-month plans back in July of last year</a>, presumably because this change was on the horizon and they would&#8217;ve had to acknowledge on the price tag that 12 months of Live Gold would cost $120.</p>
<p>The good news:<strong> the price hike on the six-month plan only impacts new customers</strong>. If you&#8217;ve already got a six-month subscription (or are grandfathered into an auto-renewing twelve-month subscription), Xbox Support confirmed in a tweet that the price won&#8217;t increase:</p>

<p>So why bump the cost? Microsoft doesn&#8217;t officially outline their reasoning (beyond pointing out that they haven&#8217;t increased the price in years, or as long as a decade in some regions), but one can assume it&#8217;s at least partially to make the $15 a month Xbox Game Pass (which bundles Xbox Live Gold with a library of all-you-can-eat, on-demand titles) that much more alluring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">EVgo, the wholly owned subsidiary of LS Power that owns and operates public fast chargers for electric vehicles, has reached a deal to become a publicly traded company through a merger with special-purpose acquisition company Climate Change Crisis Real Impact I Acquisition Corporation.</p>
<p>The combined company, which will be listed under the new ticker symbol &#8220;EVGO&#8221; will have a market valuation of $2.6 billion. LS Power and EVgo management, which today own 100% of the company will be rolling all of its equity into the transaction. Once the transaction closes in the second quarter, LS Power will hold a 74% stake in the newly combined company.</p>
<p>EVgo has raised about $575 million in proceeds through the business combination, including a $400 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE. Investors include Pacific Investment Management Company LLC (PIMCO), funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Wellington Management, Neuberger Berman Funds and Van Eck Associates Corporation, according to the announcement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>EVgo&#8217;s leadership will remain intact, with Cathy Zoi continuing as CEO of the combined company.</p>
<p>The deal is the latest in a long string of electric-vehicle-related companies to merge with so-called blank check companies, eschewing the traditional path to an IPO. Arrival, Canoo, ChargePoint, Fisker, Lordstown Motors, Proterra and The Lion Electric Company are some of the companies that have merged with SPACs — or announced plans to — in the past eight months.</p>
<p>EVgo is not a new entrant to the electric vehicle industry. The company was founded in 2010 and has spent better part of the decade scaling up its infrastructure. Today, EVgo has chargers in more than 800 locations in 67 major metropolitan markets across 34 states. The company has landed a number of partnerships, including with Albertsons, Kroger and Wawa to locate its chargers at these properties.</p>
<p>EVgo has also struck deals with automakers such as GM and Nissan as well as ride-hailing companies Lyft and Uber. In July, GM and EVgo announced plans to add more than 2,700 new fast chargers over the next five years.</p>
<p>While electric vehicles still make up just a fraction of total cars, trucks and SUVs on today&#8217;s roads, the industry has forecast that the EV market will increase more than 100-fold between 2019 and 2040, EVgo said. The funds raised through the public market will be used to accelerate its expansion, according to the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a few years ago, electric vehicles were considered niche,&#8221; EVgo CEO Cathy Zoi said in a statement. &#8220;Today, improved technology, lower costs, greater selection and a better appreciation for the performance of EVs is increasingly making them the vehicle technology of choice. With that, the need for fast charging is on the rise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zoi noted that public charging will be essential to meet the needs of the estimated 30% of Americans who do not have access to at-home charging as well as the growing number of fleets that are switching to electric vehicles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pinterest is expanding its virtual makeup try-on capabilities with today&#8217;s launch of a new augmented reality feature that allows online shoppers to virtually try on new eyeshadow. Initially, Pinterest is allowing try-on with 4,000 shades from brands like Lancome, YSL, Urban Decay and NYX Cosmetics.</p>
<p>The feature leverages Pinterest&#8217;s existing Lens visual search technology, its <a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/skintoneranges2020">skin tone ranges feature</a> and computer-vision-powered recommendations, the company says. We also understand Pinterest is incorporating elements from data partner <a href="https://modiface.com/">ModiFace</a>, including digitization parameters that ensure the products recognized are mapped to ModiFace’s database for higher-quality rendering.</p>
<p>This is not Pinterest&#8217;s first virtual makeup feature. The company had previously launched an AR try-on experience <a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/pinterests-new-ar-tech-lets-you-try-on-makeup-before-you-buy">for lipstick a year ago</a>, which has now grown to include 10,000 shades, discoverable from 48 million beauty pins from brands like Estée Lauder, bareMinerals, Neutrogena, NARS, Cle de Peau, Thrive Causemetics, NYX Professional Makeup, YSL Beauté, Lancôme and Urban Decay. Retailers, including Kohl&#8217;s, have also used AR try-on to reach consumers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With the newly launched eyeshadow try-on, users can filter the product search results by factors like color, price range and brand. If they find something they like, they can then purchase it immediately, save it to a board, or browse a &#8220;more like this&#8221; section to find more Pins offering similar shades.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2099459" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2099459" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2099459" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/VTO_Eyeshadow-Urban_Decay-US-EN-edit.gif" alt="video of AR eyeshadow effect" width="680" height="452" /><p id="caption-attachment-2099459" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p>
<p>The expansion to eyeshadow means users can now experiment with more of a full makeup look, rather than just try on individual shades. There&#8217;s a toggle that lets users switch between lipstick and eyeshadow to try on multiple products at once, Pinterest says.</p>
<p>AR-powered virtual makeup experiences have been growing in popularity over the years, thanks in part to AR beauty apps like ModiFace&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/the-company-behind-youcam-makeup-app-launches-a-new-set-of-ar-tools-for-beauty-brands-like-ulta/">YouCam Makeup</a>, <a href="https://sephoravirtualartist.com/landing_5.0.php?country=US&amp;lang=en&amp;x=&amp;skintone=&amp;currentModel=">Sephora’s Virtual Artist</a>, <a href="https://www.ulta.com/app/">Ulta’s GLAMLab</a> and others. L’Oréal has also offered Live Try-On on its website and <a href="https://www.mobilemarketer.com/news/loreal-brings-ar-makeup-sampling-to-facebook/529822/">partnered</a> with Facebook to bring virtual makeup to the site. <a href="https://www.target.com/c/virtual-try-on/-/N-3726b">Target’s online Beauty Studio</a> also offers virtual makeup.</p>
<p>More recently, Google entered the AR virtual makeup space, initially with the launch of a more limited feature <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/youtubes-new-ar-feature-lets-you-virtually-try-on-makeup-while-watching-videos/">on YouTube</a> that allowed some beauty influencers to incorporate an AR try-on experience for products in their videos. In December 2020, however, Google more fully embraced AR try-on with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/google-now-lets-you-virtually-try-on-makeup-using-ar-shop-from-influencer-videos/">the launch of virtual makeup try-on within Google Search</a>, also in partnership with ModiFace.</p>
<p>But Pinterest&#8217;s expansion to eyeshadow means it&#8217;s once again ahead of Google when it comes to visual search technology and virtual makeup. Not only does it offer more lipstick shades than Google, it now also offers eyeshadow try-on.</p>
<p>Pinterest says the AR try-on feature is being made available for free to brands who want to create visual shopping experiences and reach customers earlier in their decision-making process. The company says it continues to generate revenue through ads, including shopping ads, and not by monetizing its AR features or doing any revenue share on the try-ons that turn into sales.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we make Pinterest more shoppable through products like AR Try on, the platform becomes more engaging and actionable to Pinners, which can result in increases in usage and click-through of ads,&#8221; a spokesperson explains. &#8220;Organic features like Try on and ingestion of catalogs to create product Pins can oftentimes complement a paid strategy where brands drive traffic across the site,&#8221; they noted.</p>
<p>The support for eyeshadow try-on is timely. Some beauty brand <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/beauty-stocks-face-new-reality-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-11598952600">sales have been depressed</a> by the pandemic, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/eye-makeup-sales-rise-lipstick-dips-due-to-mask-wearing-2020-8">and particularly lipsticks</a>, since it makes no sense to use lip color when your face is under a mask. Instead, <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/g29892877/makeup-trends-2020/">current beauty trends</a> have shifted to highlighting the eyes, with bright and bold colors for eyeshadow shades, the wild <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/08/167134/graphic-eyeliner-trend-photos">floating eyeliner look</a>, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-02-12/column-false-eyelashes-are-out-of-control-blame-fox-news-and-the-kardashian-sisters">large false lashes</a>, and more &#8212; trends that are also designed to look good when filmed for social media posts, of course.</p>
<p>Pinterest says it has indications that its AR features are converting undecided shoppers to customers. In 2020, Pinterest found that users would try on an average of six lipstick shades once they began the AR try-on experience, and then were five times more likely to show purchase intent on try-on compared with standard Pins.</p>
<p>The new eyeshadow try-on is live starting today using the Lens camera in the Pinterest app for iOS and Android.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today announced a subtle but welcome refresh of its mobile search experience. The idea here is to provide easier to read search results and a more modern look with a simpler, edge-to-edge design.</p>
<p>From what we&#8217;ve seen so far, this is not a radically different look, but the rounded and slightly shaded boxes around individual search results have been replaced with straight lines, for example, while in other places, Google has specifically added more roundness. You&#8217;ll find changes to the circles around the search bar and some tweaks to the Google logo. &#8220;We believe it feels more approachable, friendly and human,&#8221; a Google spokesperson told me. There&#8217;s a bit more whitespace in places, too, as well as new splashes of color that are meant to help separate and emphasize certain parts of the page.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2099488" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hero.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2099488" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2099488" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hero.png" alt="" width="1024" height="427" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hero.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hero.png?resize=150,63 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hero.png?resize=300,125 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hero.png?resize=768,320 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hero.png?resize=680,283 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hero.png?resize=1536,640 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hero.png?resize=2048,853 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hero.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2099488" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Rethinking the visual design for something like <span class="il">Search</span> is really complex,&#8221; Google designer Aileen Cheng said in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;That’s especially true given how much <span class="il">Google</span> <span class="il">Search</span> has evolved. We’re not just organizing the web’s information, but <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/information-sources-google-search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.google/products/search/information-sources-google-search&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1611352113484000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGsK9Tx1qovr5O9P6MucqAJ_4q2DQ">all the world’s information</a>. We started with organizing web pages, but now there’s so much diversity in the types of content and information we have to help make sense of.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2099489" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mock-2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2099489" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2099489" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mock-2.png" alt="" width="1000" height="1080" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mock-2.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mock-2.png?resize=139,150 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mock-2.png?resize=278,300 278w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mock-2.png?resize=768,829 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mock-2.png?resize=630,680 630w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mock-2.png?resize=46,50 46w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2099489" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Google is also extending its use of the Google Sans font, which you are probably already quite familiar with thanks to its use in Gmail and Android. &#8220;Bringing consistency to when and how we use fonts in <span class="il">Search</span> was important, too, which also helps people parse information more efficiently,&#8221; Cheng writes.</p>
<p>In many ways, today&#8217;s refresh is a continuation of the work Google did with its mobile search <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/new-design-google-search/">refresh in 2019</a>. At that time, the emphasis, too, was on making it easier for users to scan down the page by adding site icons and other new visual elements to the page. The work of making search results pages more readable is clearly never done.</p>
<p>For the most part, though, comparing the new and old design, the changes are small. This isn&#8217;t some major redesign &#8212; we&#8217;re talking about minor tweaks that the designers surely obsessed over but that the users may not even really notice. Now if Google had made it significantly easier to distinguish ads from the content you are actually looking for, that would&#8217;ve been something.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In an unprecedented work environment defined by distributed teams and virtual-only communication, two co-founders think their 2018 bet reigns truer than ever: mentors need mentorship, too.</p>
<p><a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://twitter.com/christineptao?lang=en">Christine Tao</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://twitter.com/LoriMazan">Lori Mazan</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, the brains behind </span><a href="https://www.soundingboardinc.com/">Sounding Board</a>, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">want to train any leader within an organization to be a better leader. The San Francisco startup connects anyone from first-time managers to C-suite executives with coaches through a marketplace.</span></p>
<p>Revenue has doubled or tripled every year since 2016, which the company says hovers in the “multi-millions” range. But in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Sounding Board has seen demand for its platform grow even more. Quarterly bookings have increased 3.4 times from Q2 2020, and in the last five months, monthly revenue has doubled.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the heels of this growth, the co-founders say that Sounding Board’s next step as a startup is to grow beyond coaching services and into a platform that can show leaders how those newfound skills are impacting business development. The new product is meant to serve as a hub and roadmap where a participant and coach can track insights, progress and behaviors.</p>
<p>Within the platform, a user can schedule sessions with a coach, get matched to someone, as well as look at resources and complete tasks assigned to them. Beyond that, there is a feature that allows the coach and the manager to measure goals on an ongoing basis, similar to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/why-is-everyone-making-okr-software/">OKR-related software.</a></p>
<p>“The content is great, but unless you can apply that content, it&#8217;s not very useful,” Mazan said. “So this coaching is a way to help people apply the insights and the learning they&#8217;ve gotten from some kind of content and really utilize that in the workplace.”</p>
<p>The new product takes the monthly in-person summit that your organization used to call executive coaching and turns it into a living, breathing part of a manager’s workflow.</p>
<p>Beyond helping its users have a better temperature check on their progress, the product will help Sounding Board scale its services. Now any tutor on Sounding Board has more ways into a user’s mind and workflow, so every call isn’t synchronous and can be managed more evenly.</p>
<p>The co-founders see their long-term differentiation living in this feature. Anyone can create a marketplace, but it takes seamless, easy-to-use tech to track the effectiveness of what happens post-coaching.</p>
<p>Tao admits that the startup isn’t for everyone. Sounding Board has seen early adoption around enterprise companies that are in a late-stage, hyper-growth mindset heading toward an IPO. That level of maturity is a sweet spot for a third-party such as them to come in and scale leaders across teams. Customers include VMware, Uber, Plaid, Chime and Dropbox.</p>

<p>That said, within organizations, 60% of Sounding Board’s users are first-time managers, 30% are middle-tier and 10% are C-suite. The co-founders think these numbers indicate a broader demand for mentorship beyond what their competitors offer, which often sticks to C-suite life coach territory or stress management.</p>
<p>“Everyone is starting to realize that we&#8217;re going to have to offer coaching broader than just in the C-suite, and sometimes they don&#8217;t really know what that means,” said Mazan.</p>
<p>The realization, along with COVID-19 tailwinds, has helped Sounding Board attract new millions in venture capital. The startup tells TechCrunch that it has raised a $13.1 million Series A led by Canaan Partners. Other investors include Correlation Ventures, Bloomberg Beta, Precursor Ventures, as well as Degreed founder David Blake and Kevin Johnson, the former CEO of Udemy.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Falling seed volume, lots of big rounds. That's 2020 VC around the world in a nutshell.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Wrapping our look at how the venture capital asset class invested in 2020, today we&#8217;re taking a peek at Europe&#8217;s impressive year, and Asia&#8217;s slightly less invigorating set of results. (We&#8217;re speaking soon with folks who may have data on African VC activity in 2020; if those bear out, we&#8217;ll do a final entry in our series concerning the continent.)</p>
<p>After digging into the United States&#8217; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/in-2020-vcs-invested-428m-into-us-based-startups-every-day/">broader venture capital results</a> from last year with an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/fintech-startups-and-unicorns-had-a-stellar-q4-2020/">extra eye on fintech and unicorn investing</a>, at least one trend was clear: Venture capital is getting later and larger (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/fintech-vc-keeps-getting-later-larger-and-more-expensive/">as expected</a>).</p>
<p>Record dollar amounts were being invested, but across falling deal volume. More money and fewer rounds meant larger rounds, often going to the late and super-late stage startups in the market.</p>
<p>Unicorns are feasting, in other words, while some younger startups struggle to raise capital.</p>

<hr />
<p>There have been some encouraging signs of seed activity, mind, but full-year data made it clear that in America, the more mature startups had the best of it.</p>
<p>But what about the rest of the world? After parsing KPMG data concerning both how VCs invested in Europe (<a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2021/01/venture-pulse-q4-2020-report-europe.pdf">here</a>) and Asia (<a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2021/01/venture-pulse-q4-2020-report-asia.pdf">here</a>) last year, there are clear echoes. But not entire reproductions.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s discuss key data points from the two reports. This will be illustrative, brief and painless. Into the data!</p>
<h2>European VCs: Rich, but not evenly distributed</h2>
<p>Compared to historical investment levels, KPMG&#8217;s European VC report describes a venture capital scene at its peak. Q4 2020 saw $14.3 billion invested into EU startups across 1,192 deals, the highest dollar amount charted and a modest besting of the previous record set in Q3 2020.</p>
<p>However, despite impressive investment totals, the number of deals that the money was spread over proved lackluster.</p>
<p>The Q4 2020 deal count was the lowest on record since the continent&#8217;s deal peak in Q1 2019. Squinting at the provided chart, it appears that deal volume in Europe has fallen from around 2,200 in that peak quarter, to Q4&#8217;s fewer than 1,200 deals.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A month before the COVID-19 pandemic had spread to North America, auto fintech startup MotoRefi — newly armed with nearly $9 million in venture capital — was preparing to bring its refinancing platform to the masses.</p>
<p>CEO Kevin Bennett, and the investors behind the company, saw the opportunity to service Americans who collectively hold $1.2 trillion in auto loans. What they didn&#8217;t anticipate was the sudden uptick in demand fueled by COVID-19 and the uncertainty and chaos that the pandemic created.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">MotoRefi, which </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">was born out of QED Investors in 2017, developed an auto refinancing platform that handles the entire process, including finding the best rates, paying off the old lender and re-titling the vehicle. The company </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">has benefitted from the convergence of two trends sparked by COVID-19 that has turbocharged its business: an accelerated adoption of fintech across the economy and growing attention toward personal finance. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now, investors are pouring more money into the startup to help it make the most of the spike in demand for auto refinancing.</p>
<p>MotoRefi said Friday it has raised $10 million in a round led by Moderne Ventures. Liza Benson, a partner at Moderne Venture, will join the board.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many people are looking around saying how can they save money?&#8221; Bennett said, commenting on the events of the past year. &#8220;And while auto refinance historically is in a relatively low awareness category of personal finance, that interest has really grown and accelerated through 2020.&#8221;</p>
<p>For instance, Google searches for auto refinance increased about 40% in 2020 over the previous year, he added.</p>
<p>The company said its revenue rose by sixfold, its workforce tripled to more than 150 people and the number of lenders on its platform doubled over the past year. MotoRefi said it refinanced more than $250 million of auto loans in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;We actually weren&#8217;t planning on raising twice in a year,&#8221; Bennett said. &#8220;But the growth had been pretty noticeable from the investor standpoint in the market.&#8221;</p>
<p>That new capital will be used to hire more employees and expand its offerings, according to Bennett, who noted that MotoRefi now operates in 42 states and Washington, DC.</p>
<p>MotoRefi has raised more than $24 million to date. The company raised $8.6 million last February in a Series A funding round. That round, which would later grow to $9.4 million, was co-led by Accomplice and Link Ventures. Motley Fool Ventures, CMFG Ventures (part of CUNA Mutual Group) and Gaingels also participated in the round. The Series A round followed $4.7 million in seed funding that MotoRefi announced in March 2019.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Our reliance on internet-based services is at an all-time high these days, and that&#8217;s brought a new focus on how well we are protected when we go online. Today comes some news from one of the bigger companies working in the area of password security, which points out how business is shifting for the companies providing these tools.</p>
<p>Emmanuel Schalit, the co-founder of popular password manager <a href="http://dashlane.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dashlane</a>, is stepping down as CEO of the startup. He is being replaced by JD Sherman, the former COO of HubSpot, as Dashlane makes plans to move more aggressively to court more business users.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is about thinking about its next leg of our scaling strategy, more B2B monetization after being strong in B2C,&#8221; Sherman said in an interview, praising his predecessor&#8217;s growth of the consumer business and noting his realization that &#8220;B2B was not his forte.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sherman&#8217;s career focus, in contrast, has been all about B2B. Before his eight years at HubSpot, he was the CFO of Akamai (which, as a CDN, also had security as a focus, albeit in a completely different way), and before that IBM.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2099448" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JD-Bio-Pic-1.jpeg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JD-Bio-Pic-1.jpeg 449w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JD-Bio-Pic-1.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JD-Bio-Pic-1.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JD-Bio-Pic-1.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JD-Bio-Pic-1.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JD-Bio-Pic-1.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JD-Bio-Pic-1.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JD-Bio-Pic-1.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Since accepting the offer, Sherman (pictured right) has been quietly working with Schalit &#8212; who will no longer hold any operational role &#8212; to get up to speed and will be taking over formally at the start of February.</p>
<p>Sherman is based out of Boston and will eventually commute to Dashlane&#8217;s HQ in New York (&#8220;eventually&#8221; because everyone is remote-working at the moment, with Sherman himself getting hired in a virtual process).</p>
<p>The changing of the guard comes at an interesting time for the startup. Dashlane now has 15 million users, up from 10 million+ in 2019. That was the same year that Dashlane announced two significant rounds of funding just six weeks apart from each other: first a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/12/password-manager-dashlane-closes-on-30m-adds-former-spotify-cmo-to-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$30 million round</a> (which appeared to have <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/52836-76/company/profile#deal-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some debt as part of it</a>), then a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/dashlane-series-d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$110 million Series D</a> that valued the company at just over $500 million. Its backers include the likes of Sequoia, Bessemer, FirstMark, Rho Ventures and consumer credit reporting giant TransUnion.</p>
<p>Sherman would not talk about current valuation, nor where the company is currently standing regarding its next financial steps, except to say that it&#8217;s in a good place and to provide the smallest of hints of an IPO on the horizon.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Series D was a healthy round for a subscription business,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Right now, cashflow is solid and we have the funding we need for our growth, so there is no urgent plan to raise money. When we do, we&#8217;ll see if it is an IPO round&#8221; &#8212; that is, the last round before an IPO &#8212; &#8220;or not. To me, it&#8217;s all about growing the business.&#8221;</p>
<p>My guess: that valuation has gone up, given the boost in user numbers, the growth of its enterprise business and the huge shifts in the market in the last year that have put a spotlight on companies that are making using the internet safer. (Also, note that LogMeIn, which owns competitor LastPass, was picked up by PE firms for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/logmein-agrees-to-be-acquired-by-francisco-partners-and-evergreen-for-4-3b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about $4.3 billion</a> in a deal that completed last year.)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Use &#8216;productive paranoia&#8217; to build cybersecurity culture at your startup&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/lock-down-startup-security/embed/#?secret=Q9r8cLi5is" data-secret="Q9r8cLi5is" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Dashlane was founded focused primarily on providing password management tools for consumers. These still account for the majority of its users, but the Series D funding was in part to fuel a bigger push into the business market, and to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dashlane-super-bowl-ad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">generally get on the radar of more people</a>.</p>
<p>The expansion into business users was a natural move in more ways than one. First, the consumer service is designed as a <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/plans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freemium offering</a>, while businesses provide a more <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/business/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">steady and guaranteed revenue stream</a>. Second, there is a natural progression that comes from being a happy consumer user: you might want to have the same service for your online work life, too. That remains the strategy for Sherman.</p>
<p>&#8220;The plan is to have two sides to the business,&#8221; he said, using the well-worn consumer-to-business analogy of a flywheel to describe how it will work: &#8220;The more who use it, more businesses will start to adopt it and get comfortable with using a password manager.&#8221;</p>
<p>That strategy is lately getting a major fillip, in the form of the massive boost in online activity in the past year.</p>
<p>Activities like taking care of all your shopping, entertainment, social and work-related needs have all moved online in the last year, pushed into the virtual sphere by the emergence and persistent presence of the easily contagious and dangerous COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>Some of that shift has worked out better than many thought it would, and now, some believe that even when the pandemic does get under control, a lot of us will still be using the internet to get all of those things done on a regular basis.</p>
<p>But while I&#8217;ve heard a lot of industry people describe that situation as &#8220;the genie is out of the bottle&#8221;, perhaps a more fitting expression might be that Pandora&#8217;s box has been opened. That is to say, the increased online usage has created an alarmingly large opportunity for malicious hacking, security breaches and misuse of our online identities.</p>
<p>This consequently has a pretty direct link back to Dashlane.</p>
<p>Password protection is one of the most important elements of keeping yourself and your information safe online, with weak, stolen and reused passwords some of the biggest causes of security breaches both for consumers and businesses (by some estimates, you can track 80-90% of all security breaches back to password issues).</p>
<p>Beyond that, not least because of all the breaches we&#8217;ve now seen, the current market has become much more concerned about privacy and security (<a href="https://t.co/VLXpVNanXv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a trend manifesting in all kinds of ways</a>), and that has bred a lot more awareness and appetite for the kinds of tools that Dashlane, and other companies that enable better online security, provide.</p>
<p>There will likely continue to be developments in the technology to both suss out bad actors and block them in their tracks when they do try to enter networks, and the technology sold to organizations to keep their and their customers&#8217; information in the cloud in more secure ways will also be improved. But above and beyond all that, password managers are likely to continue to play a role in the mix.</p>

<p>Password managers may not always be a perfect solution &#8212; there have been a<a href="https://privacyaustralia.net/are-password-protectors-safe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> few cases of breaches</a> over the years, and while they have not been in recent times, security <a href="http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/158056/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">researchers at the University of York in May 2020</a> identified vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited &#8212; but they remain a relatively easy option for end users themselves to be more proactive in protecting their identities specifically by building a better way to guard their passwords. (Among all that, it&#8217;s also worth pointing out that Dashlane has never had a breach in its 10+ years of operations.)</p>
<p>And there are a number of routes to providing password management, including efforts from platform players themselves and more direct Dashlane competitors like 1Password and LastPass. Notably, some of the efforts to bridge some of that together, such as the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/04/dashlane-google-launch-openyolo-an-api-based-password-project-for-android-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> &#8220;OpenYolo&#8221; project spearheaded by Google and Dashlane</a>, have <a href="https://1password.community/discussion/111985/is-openyolo-dead" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stalled over the years</a>, in part because of the complexity of implementing it with other existing managers.</p>
<p>But even within that fragmented, competitive and (still at times) vulnerable market, Dashlane still has a lot of opportunities for growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;The business is strong and growing,&#8221; Sherman said. &#8220;The craziness around COVID and remote networking have raised the profile of password management and security in general. It&#8217;s a more difficult environment, but there is a tailwind there.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.blobr.io/">Blobr</a>, a Paris-based startup operating in the no-code space with tech to make it easier for companies to expose and monetise their existing APIs, has raised €1.2 million in pre-seed funding.</p>
<p>The round is led by pan-European pre-seed and seed investor Seedcamp, with participation from New Wave, Kima and various angel investors. Blobr is also the first company to take investment from New Wave &#8212; the new European venture capital firm co-founded by Pia d’Iribarne and Jean de la Rochebrochard &#8212; since the VC <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/new-wave/">confirmed</a> it had closed $56 million in deployable capital from an all-star lineup of investors, including Iliad’s Xavier Niel, Benchmark’s Peter Fenton and Tony Fadell of Apple fame.</p>
<p>Blobr, founded by Alexandre Airvault (CEO) and Alexandre Mai (CTO), is aiming to become the default &#8220;business and product layer&#8221; for APIs. This idea is to enable product and business people to manage and monetise a company&#8217;s application programming interfaces without technical knowledge or the need to use up more internal engineering resources. And by doing so, the startup believes we&#8217;ll see much more innovative use of APIs as commercial data and functionality is made accessible by more third parties to build on top.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We believe companies should stop thinking of APIs as mere pipes and start building them as products to unleash their power,&#8221; says Airvault. &#8220;This means APIs should be priced, customized and managed with a user-oriented mindset and not only a tech one&#8221;.</p>
<p>To make this a reality, Blobr is designed to empower product and business owners to &#8220;make data-sharing a profitable model&#8221;, while reducing their dependence on tech. &#8220;I believe this approach is what will drive the data exchanges to the next level&#8221;, he explains.</p>
<p>Blobr’s no-code technology offers quite a lot of functionality already. From one existing internal API, you can filter confidential information or GDPR-related data; it’s also possible to deliver different API output depending on customer segmentation so you only expose the data that’s needed; and API usage can be linked to usage-based business models or a monthly subscription in Stripe.</p>
<p>Airvault says the startup’s main competitors include API management solutions from Google, IBM, Axway and MuleSoft. “Those platforms are tailored for internal APIs but are not thought of and optimized to manage APIs as products. They are tailored for technical people, whereas Blobr as a no-code solution is built from scratch for product and business people to avoid technical people to be involved in the equation,” he adds.</p>

<p>Last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/google-warns-users-in-australia-free-services-are-at-risk-if-its-forced-to-share-ad-revenue-with-big-media/">August</a> the tech giant took another pot-shot at the proposal, warning that the quality of its products in the country could suffer and might stop being free if the government proceeded with a push to make the tech giants share ad revenue with media businesses.</p>

<p>Since last summer Google appears to have changed lobbying tack &#8212; apparently giving up its attempt to derail the law entirely in favor of trying to reshape it to minimize the financial impact.</p>
<p>Its latest bit of lobbying is focused on trying to eject the most harmful elements (as it sees it) of the draft legislation &#8212; while also pushing its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/google-to-pay-out-1b-to-publishers-to-license-content-for-new-google-news-showcase/">News Showcase program</a>, which it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/google-will-start-paying-publishers-to-provide-content-for-a-new-news-experience/">hastily spun up last year</a>, as an alternative model for payments to publishers that it would prefer becomes the vehicle for remittances under the Code.</p>
<p>The draft legislation for Australia&#8217;s digital news Code which is currently before the parliament includes a controversial requirement that tech giants Google and Facebook pay publishers for linking to their content &#8212; not merely for displaying snippets of text.</p>
<p>Yet Google has warned Australia that making it pay for &#8220;links and snippets&#8221; would break how the internet works.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/australia/mel-silvas-opening-statement">statement</a> to the Senate Economics Committee today, its VP for Australia and New Zealand, Mel Silva, said: &#8220;This provision in the Code would set an untenable precedent for our business, and the digital economy. It’s not compatible with how search engines work, or how the internet works, and this is not just Google’s view &#8212; it has been cited in many of the submissions received by this Inquiry.</p>
<p>&#8220;The principle of unrestricted linking between websites is fundamental to Search. Coupled with the unmanageable financial and operational risk if this version of the Code were to become law it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google is certainly not alone in crying foul over a proposal to require payments for <em>links</em>.</p>
<p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web, has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jan/20/australias-proposed-media-code-could-break-the-world-wide-web-says-the-man-who-invented-it">warned</a> that the draft legislation &#8220;risks breaching a fundamental principle of the web by requiring payment for linking between certain content online&#8221;, among other alarmed submissions to the committee.</p>
<p>In written testimony he goes on:</p>
<blockquote><p>Before search engines were effective on the web, following links from one page to another was the only way of finding material. Search engines make that process far more effective, but they can only do so by using the link structure of the web as their principal input. So links are fundamental to the web.</p>
<p>As I understand it, the proposed code seeks to require selected digital platforms to have to negotiate and possibly pay to make links to news content from a particular group of news providers.</p>
<p>Requiring a charge for a link on the web blocks an important aspect of the value of web content. To my knowledge, there is no current example of legally requiring payments for links to other content. The ability to link freely &#8212; meaning without limitations regarding the content of the linked site and without monetary fees &#8212; is fundamental to how the web operates, how it has flourished till present, and how it will continue to grow in decades to come.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, it&#8217;s notable that Berners-Lee&#8217;s submission does not mention snippets. Not once. It&#8217;s all about links.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Google has just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-inks-agreement-in-france-on-paying-publishers-for-news-reuse/">reached an agreement with publishers in France</a> &#8212; which <em>they say</em> covers payment for snippets of content.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mHM4CWoq2c"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-inks-agreement-in-france-on-paying-publishers-for-news-reuse/">Google inks agreement in France on paying publishers for news reuse</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google inks agreement in France on paying publishers for news reuse&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-inks-agreement-in-france-on-paying-publishers-for-news-reuse/embed/#?secret=mHM4CWoq2c" data-secret="mHM4CWoq2c" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the EU, the tech giant is subject to an already reformed copyright directive that extended a neighbouring right for news content to cover reuse of snippets of text. Although the directive does <em>not</em> cover links or &#8220;very short extracts&#8221;.</p>
<p>In France, Google says it&#8217;s only paying for content &#8220;beyond links and very short extracts&#8221;. But it hasn&#8217;t said anything about snippets in that context.</p>
<p>French publishers argue the EU law clearly <em>does</em> cover the not-so-short text snippets that Google typically shows in its News aggregator &#8212; pointing out that the directive states the exception should not be interpreted in a way that impacts the effectiveness of neighboring rights. So Google looks like it would have a big French fight on its hands if it tried to deny payments for snippets.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s still everything to play for in Australia. Hence, down under, Google is trying to conflate what are really two separate and distinct issues (payment for links versus payment for snippets) &#8212; in the hopes of reducing the financial impact versus what&#8217;s already baked into EU law. (Although it&#8217;s only been actively enforced in France so far, which is ahead of other EU countries in transposing the directive into national law.)</p>
<p>In Australia, Google is also heavily pushing for the Code to &#8220;designate News Showcase&#8221; (aka the program it launched once the legal writing was on the wall about paying publishers) &#8212; lobbying for that to be the vehicle whereby it can reach &#8220;commercial agreements to pay Australian news publishers for value&#8221;.</p>
<p>Of course, a commercial negotiation process is preferable (and familiar) to the tech giant versus being bound by the Code&#8217;s proposed &#8220;final offer arbitration model&#8221; &#8212; which Google attacks as having &#8220;biased criteria&#8221;, and claims subjects it to &#8220;unmanageable financial and operational risk&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;If this is replaced with standard commercial arbitration based on comparable deals, this would incentivise good faith negotiations and ensure we’re held accountable by robust dispute resolution,&#8221; Silva also argues.</p>
<p>A third provision the tech giant is really keen gets removed from the current draft requires it to give publishers notification ahead of changes to its algorithms which could affect how their content is discovered.</p>
<p>&#8220;The algorithm notification provision could be adjusted to require only reasonable notice about significant actionable changes to Google’s algorithm, to make sure publishers are able to respond to changes that affect them,&#8221; it suggests on that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly interesting to consider how, over a few years, Google&#8217;s position has moved from &#8220;we&#8217;ll never pay for news&#8221; &#8212; pre- any relevant legislation &#8212; to &#8220;please let us pay for licensing news through our proprietary licensing program&#8221; once the EU had passed a directive now being very <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/google-must-negotiate-to-pay-for-french-news-appeals-court-confirms/">actively enforced in France</a> (with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/frances-competition-watchdog-orders-google-to-pay-for-news-reuse/">help of competition law</a>) and also with Australia moving toward inking a similar law.</p>
<p>Turns out legislation can be a real tech giant mind-changer.</p>
<p>Of course the idea of making anyone pay to link to content online is obviously a terrible idea &#8212; and should be dropped.</p>
<p>But if that bit of the draft is a negotiating tactic by Australian lawmakers to get Google to accept that it will have to pay publishers <em>something</em> then it appears to be a winning one.</p>
<p>And while Google&#8217;s threat to close down its search engine might sound &#8220;full on&#8221;, as Silva suggests, when you consider how many alternative search engines exist, it&#8217;s hardly the threat it once was.</p>
<p>Especially as plenty of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/duckduckgo-now-crawls-the-web-regularly-to-create-a-free-list-of-trackers-to-block/">alternative search engines</a> are a lot <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/xayn-is-privacy-safe-personalized-mobile-web-search-powered-by-on-device-ais/">less abusive toward users&#8217; privacy</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Five-year-old &#8220;slow dating&#8221; app <a href="https://getonce.com/en">Once</a> has been acquired by the <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dating-com-group">Dating Group</a>, one of the largest companies in the dating world, for $18 million in cash and stock. Dating Group has 73 million registered users across a range of portfolio apps, including Dating.com.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/clemeeentine?lang=en">Clémentine Lalande</a>, co-founder and CEO of Once, will continue leading the company under a two-year agreement. Fellow co-founder Jean Meyer retained a stake in the company after departing two years ago.</p>
<p>Once has 9 million users on its platform, while the startup also garnered a further 1 million from a spin-out app it later launched called Pickable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once is a dating app that uses matching algorithms to deliver just one match per day to each user. It pitched itself as an alternative to the frenetically paced apps such as Tinder and Bumble. Indeed, Bumble revealed last week that two in five people of those it surveyed are taking longer to get to know someone as a result of pandemic lockdowns. And 38% Bumble users <a href="https://www.cnnphilippines.com/life/culture/tech/2021/1/7/dating-in-the-time-of-covid19.html">admit</a> that it had made them want something more serious. So Once had a ready market.</p>

<p>Each pair on the Once app has 24 hours of each other’s attention and can continue chatting if they “like” each other. The AI looks at the account’s info, dating preferences and previous history in order to find the best possible match. Users can also rate each particular profile to let the AI better understand their taste.</p>
<p>In a statement, Lalande said: “I am thrilled to join the Dating Group today, both because of their proven focus on post-swiping dating alternatives, and to leverage the huge synergies between Once and Dating Group. In such a concentrated and competitive market having a large partner will allow us to augment our reach and accelerate geographical expansion”.</p>
<p>Bill Alena, chief investment officer at Dating Group said: “We strongly believe in the concept of AI and making quality matches. We see a huge potential in integrating Once into our portfolio. We’re excited to have Clémentine join Dating Group, she and her team have built a fascinating product and with this acquisition, Dating Group expands deeper into the Western European market.”</p>
<p>Dating Group has offices in seven countries and a team of more than 500 professionals, with more than 73 million registered users across the entire portfolio. Its brands include Dating.com, DateMyAge, Dil Mil, Cherish, Tubit, AnastasiaDate and ChinaLove.</p>
