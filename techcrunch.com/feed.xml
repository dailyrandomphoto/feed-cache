										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Get your spool-of-yarn emojis ready &#8212; threads might be coming to Facebook soon. Facebook has been spotted testing a new feature that gives public figures on Facebook the ability to create a new post that&#8217;s connected to a previous one on a related subject. This feature ties the posts together more visually so fans can more easily follow updates over time. When the new post appears on followers&#8217; News Feeds, it will be shown as being connected to the other posts in a thread.</p>
<p>Social media consultant Matt Navarra first <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1410595945687945220">spotted this</a> feature in action, and shared several screenshots of how it looks. Reached for comment, Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch it&#8217;s testing the feature with a small group of &#8220;public figures&#8221; on Facebook for the time being. A public figure is a specific type of Facebook Page category aimed at high-profile individuals or anyone else who wants to establish a more public presence on Facebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2173336" style="width: 434px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2173336" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2173336" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/E5Nxh9-VoAkVzAb.jpeg?w=424" alt="" width="424" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/E5Nxh9-VoAkVzAb.jpeg 598w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/E5Nxh9-VoAkVzAb.jpeg?resize=93,150 93w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/E5Nxh9-VoAkVzAb.jpeg?resize=187,300 187w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/E5Nxh9-VoAkVzAb.jpeg?resize=424,680 424w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/E5Nxh9-VoAkVzAb.jpeg?resize=31,50 31w" sizes="(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2173336" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Matt Navarra</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Facebook explained these threaded posts will have a &#8220;View Post Thread&#8221; button, which lets followers easily navigate to see all of the posts in the thread. When you tap on the button, you&#8217;ll be shown where you can see all the threaded posts connected together in one place.</p>
<p>Facebook was unable to confirm if or when the test would roll out more broadly to other public figures on its platform or if it would later expand to other Page categories, like Businesses, or to Facebook Groups.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Threads are useful on sites like Twitter, where the character limit makes it harder to have more nuanced conversations &#8212; that&#8217;s why we end up with those oh-so-beloved &#8220;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/style/notes-app-celebrity-statements.html">notes app apology</a>&#8221; posts on Twitter. (Now, Twitter promotes its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/twitters-acquisition-strategy-eat-the-public-conversation/">Revue</a> newsletter app when you write a thread). But on Facebook, your posts can be up to precisely 63,206 characters long (or, about 225 tweets).</p>
<p>Rather than inspiring longer posts, Facebook threads could be used for live commentary on an event like an award show. Or, users could post updates to their existing posts in a thread, rather than updating the original and making a clunky &#8220;edited to add&#8230;&#8221; announcement. Given that Facebook is testing this feature with public figures, perhaps its intended use is to make the sharing of news more streamlined. It&#8217;s no secret that Facebook has dealt with some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/as-advertisers-revolt-facebook-commits-to-flagging-newsworthy-political-speech-that-violates-policy/">misinformation issues</a> in the past, so for journalists or government officials sharing information about developing news events, threads could provide useful context.</p>
<p>This testing comes after Facebook announced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/facebooks-newsletter-platform-bulletin-is-now-live/">Bulletin newsletter offshoot</a> earlier this week.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">A CEO’s fiduciary duties to their company and its shareholders do not end when they are off the clock — they must always act in good faith. However, navigating the boundaries between a company’s official communications and a personal voice can be difficult in today’s social-media-connected environment.</p>
<p>What a CEO posts on Twitter can raise not only serious reputational issues for themselves and their companies but posting the wrong things at the wrong time can also cause breach of fiduciary duties and may even run afoul of securities laws.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Reputation and goodwill take a long time to build and are difficult to maintain, but it only takes one tweet to destroy it all.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Fiduciary duties can be divided into three buckets: (1) duty of care — CEOs must act in good faith with the care of a reasonable person in a like position with a reasonable belief that their decisions are in furtherance of their company’s best interest; (2) duty of loyalty — CEOs must put the interest of shareholders and the company above their own self-interest; and (3) duty of good faith — CEOs must act with honesty and fairness to shareholders and the company.</p>
<p>There is no denying that Twitter can be leveraged as a powerful tool. Used appropriately, it can fortify the reputation of a company and its CEO, forge stronger consumer relationships and drive business profits. For example, Tim Cook’s habit of tweeting about his interactions with Apple customers demonstrates his customer-service values and effort to connect with consumers, which can potentially lead to a bigger and more loyal following.</p>
<p>Lately, more and more CEOs are communicating their stance on issues that are important to their consumer base to exhibit authenticity, relatability and demonstrate their personal and corporate values through social media. Following last year’s murder of George Floyd and rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, <a href="https://www.teneo.com/ceos-and-twitter-how-a-new-and-more-diverse-generation-of-ceos-are-leading-and-communicating-through-challenging-times/">nearly 60% of all S&amp;P 100 tech CEOs, unicorn CEOs, and Fortune 500 CEOs tweeted, &#8220;Black Lives Matter.&#8221;</a> This was the first time CEOs active on Twitter overwhelmingly voiced their position on racial and social justice issues.</p>
<p>Twitter can also be an opportunity to show transparency in policy. CEOs can use social media to announce new management initiatives, capability expansions and new investments in employees (diversity initiatives, new roles for women, organizational changes) that are positive in tone and speak about the future direction of the company. These can have a <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/298f9b44201.pdf">positive correlation with stock prices</a>.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that long ago that the world was fixated on Donald Trump’s Twitter posts and their <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923621000877">correlation with the stock market</a>. Words have permanence and their impact can be catastrophic. Given their elevated role as a leader and representative of the company and the fiduciary duties they owe, CEOs must watch what they say and when they say it. What it all boils down to is awareness, common sense and the law.</p>
<h2>Don’t break the law and stick to the facts</h2>
<p>For U.S. publicly traded companies, SEC Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD) says that “an issuer may not disclose material nonpublic information to certain groups, either intentionally or unintentionally, without disclosing the same information to the entire marketplace.” If companies use social media to announce key information, to comply, they must alert investors that social media will be used to disseminate such information.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether it is a public or private company, CEOs are corporate officers and owe fiduciary duties to their companies and their shareholders. Fiduciary duty requires CEOs to act in good faith, apply their best business judgment and to act in the best interest of the company. This is true whether they are in the boardroom or on Twitter.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yesterday, enterprise computing corporation Zebra Technologies announced its plan to acquire Fetch Robotics. The San Jose-based startup has been a mainstay in warehouse and fulfillment robotics for a number of years, offering a modular system designed to automate companies behind the scenes.</p>
<p>The full deal is valued at $305 million, with Zebra acquiring the remaining 95% of the company for $290 million. It comes as interest in the category is at an all-time high, following widespread labor shortages during the pandemic.</p>
<p>After the news broke, we sat down with Fetch co-founder and CEO Melonee Wise to discuss the deal and the future of warehouse robotics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Why was this acquisition the right move for Fetch?</strong></p>
<p>When you look at it, over the last seven years, we’ve been building a pretty compelling cloud robotics platform. About two years ago, Zebra invested in Fetch, and we started working together through our partnership. One of the first things we did was integrating their mobile computing devices, for an out-of-the-box experience on our cloud robotics platform. When our customers got robots, they could take the hand scanner they already had today, scan a barcode and call a robot to them.</p>
<p>As we were fundraising for our Series D, this opportunity came out of that. I think when you look at it, over the last couple of years, we’ve had a good relationship with them. With the pandemic, there’s been a huge draw for more and more automation technology. Before the pandemic, there were already labor shortages for warehouse and logistics, and the pandemic only exacerbated it. One of the other great things about us joining Zebra is they have a strong go-to-market engine, and they can amplify our sales capability. They’re already in all of the customers we want to be working with. It helps us reach a much broader, wider and deeper audience.</p>
<p><strong>I’d assumed Fetch was a good potential candidate for an acquisition, but I’d always imagined it would be something like a Walmart looking to compete with Amazon robotics. I suspect that you&#8217;ve been approached by companies over the years. Why does this kind of acquisition make more sense, ultimately?</strong></p>
<p>I think the acquisition made sense because it aligns with more of our long-term vision. When we built our platform, we built it to be unifying. Not just our robots. Over the years we’ve been slowly bringing in other partners on the platform. We have a partnership with SICK, we have partnerships with other MWS providers like VARGO. That isn’t going to change. We’re still going to be partner friendly and we’re still going to bring other devices into the ecosystem. When you look at the options and the opportunities, this was a good opportunity and was well aligned with the team we wanted to build.</p>
<p><strong>I know Zebra has developed their own robot and invested in other robotics companies. Are you the cornerstone of an ecosystem play? Is this Zebra building a a robotic retail and fulfillment ecosystem around Fetch?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that so far has been the discussion. It&#8217;s still evolving. I don&#8217;t have all the details for you, obviously. And of course, we still have 30 days or 35 days ‘till closing, so we&#8217;re still operating as independent businesses. In terms of vision of how we&#8217;re thinking about it, Zebra is very excited to kind of make Fetch the centerpiece of this whole new offering that they&#8217;re building out. It’s a high strategic priority for them.</p>
<p><strong>Will the Fetch brand remain? Will the company stay in San Jose? Are you staying on board?</strong></p>
<p>Fetch is not moving. We’re kind of becoming the centerpiece, so they want to keep the team together, in San Jose. My plan is to stay. We’re still working out the details [ … ] Fetch has a very strong brand, and so how do we get the best of both worlds.</p>
<p><strong>Is acquisition something that a company like Fetch works toward? Do you consider it to be kind of an inevitability?</strong></p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s complicated. When I started the company, I never really planned on anything. I just wanted to go build something. I mean that in the most sincere way. I wanted to go build something and not fail. And the question is, what does not failing look like? I think the facts are that in the last 20-something years, almost no robotics company has IPO&#8217;ed. Now we’re starting to see SPACS, but there hasn&#8217;t been a robotics company that’s IPO&#8217;ed through the traditional route.</p>
<p>I would say that if you were to ask me on any given day, what I thought the probability of IPO versus acquisition, I probably would have said acquisition, because there&#8217;s just not a history of robotics companies IPO&#8217;ing. That’s for lots of reasons. It’s a hardware intensive business. It takes a lot of technology and investment. Typically, they&#8217;re held privately. It’s hard for large corporate entities to have the P&amp;L to invest in this deep technology. I think that’s starting to change. And I think now that there’s SPACs, you’ll see a lot changing in that regard. But I would say you’re still going to see more acquisitions than you’re going to see IPOs for the next 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>Had you been approached about acquisition in the past?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. In the past we had been, but many times before it was just too early.</p>
<p><strong>What does it mean to be too early?</strong></p>
<p>It just didn’t feel like the right time for lots of reasons. Some of it has to do with what I want. Some of it has to do with what the team wants. And some of it has to do with what our investors want. There are a lot of people at the table. This is always a hard question. Previously when those things had come up, the market was so undefined and so new, we just wanted to see where it went. Now we’re starting to see more structure to the environment, and we’re starting to see an inflection point.</p>
<p><strong>Is additional international expansion part of the plan?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. We’re in several companies in Europe. We’re in APAC and expanding in that region. Right now, we aren’t placing any large bets in any of those countries. We’re waiting to see how the market develops, but we’re looking to expand.</p>

<p>The mobile site view on the left labeled &#8220;before&#8221; is the control ( &#8220;A&#8221; version) while that on the right labeled &#8220;after&#8221; is the optimized page (&#8220;B&#8221; version). We conducted a split test aka A/B test, directing half of the traffic to each version, and the result attained 95% statistical significance. Below is a description of the key changes made.</p>
<h2>Used a headline with a more compelling value proposition</h2>
<p>The headline on the control version is <strong>“Health Insurance in China.”</strong> If I am an expat looking for health insurance in China, at least I know I am in the right place but I don’t immediately have a reason to choose you. I have to scroll and infer this from multiple elements.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			For revenue-generating landing pages it is best to always follow the Bauhaus design aesthetic (from architecture). Form follows function, ornament is evil!					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The winning version instantly conveys a compelling value proposition: <strong>“Save Up to 32% on Your Health Insurance in China,”</strong> accompanied by “evidentials” to support this claim &#8212; the number of past customers and a relevant testimonial with a 4.5 star rating (by the way, it is better to use a default static testimonial rather than a moving carousel).</p>
<p>As the famed old-school direct response marketer John Caples taught us, “The reader’s attention is yours only for a single instant. They will not spend their valuable time trying to figure out what you mean.” What was true in Caples’ 1920s heyday is doubly so in the mobile age, when attention spans are shorter than a fruit fly’s!<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lordstown Motors continues to stumble. The beleaguered electric vehicle startup is now being investigated by the Department of Justice, in addition to an ongoing investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>The investigation, first broke by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-is-probing-lordstown-motors-11625239730">Wall Street Journal</a> on Friday, is still in its early stages, according to unnamed sources. It is being conducted by the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Lordstown Motors is committed to cooperating with any regulatory or governmental investigations and inquiries,&#8221; a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;We look forward to closing this chapter so that our new leadership – and entire dedicated team – can focus solely on producing the first and best full-size all-electric pickup truck, the Lordstown Endurance.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The probe is just the latest in a series of woes for the startup, which recently said it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">had to cut production volumes</a> for its debut electric pickup, Endurance, by half — from around 2,200 vehicles to 1,000. Just a few weeks after it made that announcement, there followed news of a corporate shakeup: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/lordstown-motors-ceo-and-cfo-resign-amidst-production-woes/">the resignation</a> of founding CEO Steve Burns and CFO Julio Rodriguez. Burns started the company as an offshoot of his previous startup, Workhorse Group.</p>
<p>Lordstown had a strong start, with investments from General Motors that helped it purchase a 6.2-million-square-foot factory from the leading automaker in late 2019. Lordstown made positive headlines last August, when it announced it would go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/lordstown-motors-becomes-latest-ev-automaker-to-use-a-spac-to-go-public/">The deal</a> injected the EV startup with around $675 million in gross proceeds and skyrocketed its market value to $1.6 billion. Less than a year later, Lordstown <a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/static-files/f0d0d2f4-d298-4576-9344-61f82e345e19">informed the SEC</a> that it does not have sufficient capital to manufacture Endurance.</p>
<p>Then, in March, the short-seller firm Hindenburg Research <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/lordstown-motors-accused-of-faking-ev-truck-orders-by-short-seller-firm-hindenburg-research/">released a report</a> disputing the company’s claims that it had booked 100,000 pre-orders for the electric pickup. It wrote that “extensive research reveals that the company’s orders appear largely fictitious and used as a prop to raise capital and confer legitimacy.” The SEC opened its investigation in the wake of these accusations.</p>
<p>The WSJ story is unclear on the scope of the inquiry and the company declined to provide details. TechCrunch will update the story if it learns more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For a brief moment, earlier this week, it seemed as though Pittsburgh might be the center of the tech universe. Just as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/duolingo-s-1/">Carnegie Mellon alum Duolingo was announcing its IPO</a>. Senators Bob Casey and Pat Toomey were in town, as Vice President Kamala Harris paid a visit to the City of Bridges to talk infrastructure.</p>
<p>The morning of TechCrunch’s City Spotlight, the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/robotics-roundup-18/"> Pittsburgh Robotics Network held its own event</a> to announce a new alliance with members of the local government and faculty from nearby universities.</p>
<p>“The alliance brings together leaders from top robotics companies, research institutions and universities in the Pittsburgh area, including Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Argo AI, Aurora, the University of Pittsburgh, Kaarta, RE2 Robotics, Neya Systems, Carnegie Robotics, HEBI Robotics, Near Earth Autonomy, BirdBrain Technologies, Omnicell and Advanced Construction Robotics,” a press release noted. “The Richard King Mellon Foundation commemorated this membership milestone with a grant of $125,000 to support the continued growth of the PRN.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/pittsburgh-city-spotlight/">Our own Spotlight event</a>, held later that afternoon, was designed to highlight the city’s continued evolution. To many, Pittsburgh is still very much the plucky but troubled city reeling from the deindustrialization of the 70s and 80s, as the factory and industry jobs that formed its foundation moved out of town and shipped overseas. The rust belt veneer is a hard one to leave behind, but the city’s biggest cheerleaders are working hard to transform the image of Pittsburgh into one of robotics, AI, autonomy and other cutting-edge technologies.</p>
<p>Carnegie Mellon has — and continues to be the cornerstone of that Pittsburgh. A world-class research school by any metric, CMU is the crown jewel of the area’s dozens of colleges and universities. While the University of Pittsburgh is a huge driver for the city’s medical and science communities, CMU is the reason it can count itself among the leaders in robots and self-driving cars.</p>
<p>Speaking at our event, Farnam Jahanian cited the school’s The Swartz Center as a major driver in its efforts to support the startup ambitions of students and faculty alike.</p>
<p>“The Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship at Carnegie Mellon is a system of programming activities that offers a unique path of entrepreneurship, education, engagement, collaboration and opportunities for students, faculty and staff that are interested in entrepreneurship, from the Innovation Scholars Program, to the corporate startup lab, to essentially garages that students and faculty can essentially sign up for to launch their companies from plus a host of other programmatic things, resources that you would need,” says Jahanian, who was appointed CMU’s president in 2018.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cmu.edu/swartz-center-for-entrepreneurship/">The Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship</a> was founded in 2015, courtesy of a $31 million donation from CMU alumnus and Accel Partners co-founder, James R. Swartz. The center built on previous efforts like 2012’s Carnegie Mellon Center and Project Olympus, founded in 2007. The Swartz Center and its recent precursors list among their success stories Duolingo, DataSquid and AbilLife.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/how-cmu-is-helping-build-its-own-startups-and-keeping-them-in-pittsburgh/">Dave Mawhinney recently told TechCrunch</a> that he took the role as the center’s executive director in an effort, “to make it on par with Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, Harvard and other great entrepreneurial universities.” CMU certainly isn’t outclassed by any of the above in terms of its position as a world-class research university, but Mawhinney concedes that the school and the city have traditionally grappled with entrepreneurial retention.</p>
<p>“You can always learn from what you have and build on it,” says Jahanian. “I would stress it is really about the entire ecosystem. It&#8217;s not about just what CMU does &#8212; that&#8217;s a critical part of it. It’s University of Pittsburgh, it&#8217;s other universities that are in our region that are also contributing significantly to our ecosystem.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How Carnegie Mellon is helping build its own startups and keeping them in Pittsburgh&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/how-cmu-is-helping-build-its-own-startups-and-keeping-them-in-pittsburgh/embed/#?secret=XVrh0JZ7YG" data-secret="XVrh0JZ7YG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Mawhinney says that CMU’s ability to incubate and foster tech startups hit an inflection point roughly a decade and a half ago, as Big Tech took an increasing interest in the research the school was doing around things fields like AI and automation.</p>
<p>“Really, the seminal event was when Google put an office in Pittsburgh in 2006. They have over 1,000 employees,” he says. “Every major tech company — Amazon, Facebook, Apple — have all embedded hundreds of engineers in our community, so we’re growing really, really rapidly. Artificial intelligence was invented at Carnegie Mellon — and that sort of set off the robot revolution [ … ] Now we’re the center of the automated vehicle community. Aurora is co-located here, Argo is here, Aptiv is here. We have a very vibrant community and we do want to continue to grow it.”</p>
<p>Building a successful company requires a lot more than engineers, of course (there’s a decent chance you wouldn’t be reading this if that weren’t the case). In the lead up to our event, I asked several interested parties what the biggest hurdle was in continuing to attract and grow the city’s startup ecosystem. The overwhelming answer was simple: venture capital.</p>
<p>“What we need is more capital — angel funds, venture funds so that entrepreneurs have a variety of funding sources to go to locally,” Yvonne Campos of Next Act Fund LLC told TechCrunch. “We definitely need more funding for women-led businesses — women raise about one-third less capital than men-led companies. Not because of the business idea or leader, but because we invest in companies where we have the most comfort — we invest in people that look like us. Nationally, only about 20%-25% of all angel investors are women. We need more women to become active as investors.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pittsburgh’s mayor on the city’s startup community and the difficulty of attracting venture capital&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/pittsburghs-mayor-on-the-citys-startup-community-and-the-difficulty-of-attracting-venture-capital/embed/#?secret=PNya9kofGx" data-secret="PNya9kofGx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The city’s mayor, Bill Peduto, who also appeared at our event, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/pittsburghs-mayor-on-the-citys-startup-community-and-the-difficulty-of-attracting-venture-capital/">echoed the sentiment</a>.</p>
<p>“I think the biggest hurdle remains access to venture capital, especially in this stage. I think we’ve been able to convince investors from the coast that the companies don’t need to leave Pittsburgh in order to be highly successful and see their investment pay off,” he told me in an interview. “However, I believe if we had more venture capital arriving here to help to take early-stage companies into that critical next stage of expansion, it would build off itself and it would excel growth in all of the industry cluster, significantly.”</p>
<p>During our conversation, however, Jahanian pushed back on the sentiment. “I respectfully disagree,” he told me. “Funding is important, but great ideas get funded. I’ve seen it my entire career. They get funded at levels that really show that these companies have a shot at being really successful.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;VCs discuss the opportunities — and challenges — in Pittsburgh&#8217;s startup ecosystem&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/vcs-discuss-the-opportunities-and-challenges-of-the-pittsburgh-startup-ecosystem/embed/#?secret=8h4Wmo7bPP" data-secret="8h4Wmo7bPP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>CMU’s president points to another problem, entirely. “You need a lot more than just cool technologies or new research ideas or new concepts or products just to launch a company,” Jahanian says. “You need a lot more around it. You need marketing, product management, you need to be able to develop a business plan. So those are a lot of the resources that we do provide.”</p>
<p>Kleiner Perkins CPO Bing Gordon reflected the sentiment, speaking to me over email. “[Pittsburgh needs] to import CFOs, product managers, ad sales,” he wrote. Another historical concern for the city is attracting that talent. CMU hasn’t had an issue on that front, because location is less of a key concern for students applying for research universities. When it comes to careers after college, settling down and starting a family, on the other hand, suddenly quality of life rockets up the list.</p>
<p>Jahanian says he has long championed green spaces and other communal gathering places in his conversations over the years with Peduto. He adds that the subject should continue to be top of mind for whoever the city’s new mayor is next year.</p>
<p>“One of the most important things about the startup and high-tech community in Pittsburgh is the quality of life for citizens across this town,” says Jahanian. “I can tell you as a university president, an overwhelming majority of the faculty that we recruit want to live in the city and enjoy it. That’s an important part of it. Obviously, there&#8217;s a lot more going on beyond the quality of life. The more that the city does to bridge the gap between those who are prospering and those who are potentially left behind in the economies that are created the high-tech economies is important. That&#8217;s a responsibility of the private sector and the public sector. I&#8217;m really optimistic that we&#8217;ll have a great partnership with our future mayor, as we&#8217;ve done in the past mayors to catalyze the economy and lift all boats.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Therapy is rapidly becoming a standard part of many people&#8217;s lives, but 2020 interrupted that trend by nixing in-person sessions and forcing therapists to migrate their entire practice online — and it turns out that&#8217;s not so easy. <a href="https://www.tryframe.com/">Frame</a> simplifies it with an all-in-one portal for clients and therapists, unifying the listings, tools and management software that run the countless small businesses making up the industry.</p>
<p>Kendall Bird and Sage Grazer are old friends who happened to be in the right place at the right time — a strange thing to say about anyone anywhere at the start of 2020, but it&#8217;s true. The startup&#8217;s pitch of bringing your practice entirely online and offering all-online sessions, bookkeeping, scheduling and everything turned out to be exactly what would soon be needed — though as they tell it, it has actually been needed for some time.</p>
<p>Grazer, a therapist herself, experienced firsthand the unexpected difficulties of getting up and running.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I started my practice in 2016, I was really passionate about the clinical work, but I was very overwhelmed by setting up a business, marketing, financial stuff,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So we wanted to help other therapists through that.&#8221;</p>
<p>She and Bird happened to reconnect around that time and the two saw an opportunity to improve things.</p>

<p>&#8220;We think about therapists as being a one-on-one thing, but they&#8217;re really a small business,&#8221; said Bird, who formerly worked in marketing at Snapchat, Google and YouTube. &#8220;They&#8217;re underserved and undersupported as mental health professionals — they don&#8217;t have the back-office support that doctors do, and they&#8217;re not trained how to run businesses. It just made sense to build a scalable SaaS solution that lets these people work for themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>The therapy industry, like other medical institutions, has two sides: client-facing and practitioner-facing. While there are a handful of services online that combine these, many essentially recruit therapists as contractors. If you want to run your own practice, you&#8217;ll likely be using a combination of specialty scheduling, telehealth, billing and other tools made with medical privacy considerations in mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;The therapy tools and services landscape is incredibly fragmented — the average therapist is using 5-7 tools, and most of those are not built for therapy,&#8221; said Bird.</p>
<p>And then of course there&#8217;s Psychology Today: a periodical that straddles the roles of pop psych and industry rag, but whose chief reason for existing for many is its voluminous therapist listings, which dominate search and provide an overwhelming first stop for anyone looking to find one in their area. But for such a personal and consequential decision these brief listings don&#8217;t give wary potential clients the impression they&#8217;re making an informed choice.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted an experience that was more approachable, uses language that doesn&#8217;t feel overwhelming or pathologizing,&#8221; said Grazer. &#8220;There are people going to therapy feeling alone and confused, who don&#8217;t identify with a disorder or checking a check box.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frame eschews the oversimplified &#8220;scroll through therapists near your area code&#8221; with a short quiz — not a diagnosis or personality test but just a few basic questions — that winnows down your choices to a handful of local and appropriate therapists, with whom you can instantly set up free introductory video calls. If you find someone you like, the rest of the professional relationship takes place on Frame, though of course soon in-person sessions may return.</p>
<p>For those not quite ready to take the plunge, the company organizes livestreamed sessions between volunteers and therapists to show what a full hour of work might look like. (Whatever courage it may take to confront one&#8217;s issues in therapy, it surely takes even more to do so with an audience.)</p>
<p>On the therapist&#8217;s side, Frame is meant to be a one-stop shop. Marketing and telehealth sessions are on there, as noted above, but so are things like scheduling, notes, billing, notifications, and so on, all tailored specifically to the needs of the industry. And while the shift to online services has been a long time coming, the company just happened to drop in just as the need went into overdrive.</p>

<p>&#8220;We built it before COVID ever existed — launched in March 2020 and had telehealth as an option, thinking &#8216;oh, well maybe some people will do this.&#8217; The majority of therapists in America weren&#8217;t doing sessions online at the time&#8230; but after COVID they <em>all</em> are,&#8221; Bird said. &#8220;And they&#8217;re looking for these tools now because they&#8217;re seeing the rewards of running a lot of their business through telehealth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many therapists are finding that after resisting the transition for years, they are encountering all kinds of benefits, explained Grazer. Like other industries, the flexibility inherent to shifting in-person meetings to virtual ones has been freeing and in some cases profitable. The change is here to stay.</p>
<p>The site is in a closed beta limited to a part of California at present, since therapists are limited to operating in-state and there are other regulations to consider, not to mention all the usual struggles of putting together a sprawling professional service. But the $3 million funding round, led by Maven Ventures, will help fill out the product and move the company toward a larger audience. Sugar Capital, Struck Capital, Alpha Edison and January Ventures participated in the raise.</p>
<p>The money is &#8220;almost exclusively going to engineering.&#8221; The goal is to open up the beta, expand to the rest of California, then move out to other states once they have the infrastructure to do so and have responded to feedback from the initial rollout.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sage and I are really aligned in the belief that the best way to make therapy more accessible to America is to support therapists,&#8221; said Bird.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Privacy litigation that&#8217;s being brought against Facebook by two not-for-profits in the Netherlands can go ahead, an Amsterdam court has <a href="https://linkeddata.overheid.nl/front/portal/document-viewer?ext-id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2021:3307">ruled</a>. The case will be heard in October.</p>
<p>Since 2019, the Amsterdam-based <a href="https://dataprivacystichting.com">Data Privacy Foundation</a> (DPS) has been seeking to bring a case against Facebook over its rampant collection of Internet users&#8217; data &#8212; arguing the company does not have a proper legal basis for the processing.</p>
<p>It has been joined in the action by the Dutch consumer protection not-for-profit, <a href="https://www.consumentenbond.nl">Consumentenbond</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The pair are seeking redress for Facebook users in the Netherlands for alleged violations of their privacy rights &#8212; both by suing for compensation for individuals; and calling for Facebook to end the privacy-hostile practices.</p>
<p>European Union law allows for collective redress across a number of areas, including data protection rights, enabling qualified entities to bring representative actions on behalf of rights holders. And the provision looks like an increasingly important tool for furthering privacy enforcement in the bloc, given how European data protection regulators&#8217; have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">continued to lack uniform vigor</a> in upholding rights set out in legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (which, despite coming into application in 2018, has yet to be seriously applied against platform giants like Facebook).</p>
<p>Returning to the Dutch litigation, Facebook denies any abuse and claims it respects user privacy and provides people with &#8220;meaningful control&#8221; over how their data gets exploited.</p>
<p>But it has fought the litigation by seeking to block it on procedural grounds &#8212; arguing for the suit to be tossed by claiming the DPS does not fit the criteria for bringing a privacy claim on behalf of others and that the Amsterdam court has no jurisdiction as its European business is subject to Irish, rather than Dutch, law.</p>
<p>However the Amsterdam District Court rejected its arguments, clearing the way for the litigation to proceed.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Contacted for comment on the ruling, a</span> Facebook spokesperson told us:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are currently reviewing the Court’s decision. The ruling was about the procedural part of the case, not a finding on the merits of the action, and we will continue to defend our position in court. We care about our users in the Netherlands and protecting their privacy is important to us. We build products to help people connect with people and content they care about while honoring their privacy choices. Users have meaningful control over the data that they share on Facebook and we provide transparency around how their data is used. We also offer people tools to access, download, and delete their information and we are committed to the principles of GDPR.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a statement today, the <a href="https://www.consumentenbond.nl/nieuws/2021/rechter-veegt-bezwaren-facebook-van-tafel">Consumentenbond</a>&#8216;s director, Sandra Molenaar, described the ruling as &#8220;a big boost for the more than 10 million victims&#8221; of Facebook&#8217;s practices in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook has tried to throw up all kinds of legal hurdles and to delay this case as much as possible but fortunately the company has not succeeded. Now we can really get to work and ensure that consumers get what they are entitled to,&#8221; she added in the written remarks (translated from Dutch with Google Translate).</p>
<p>In another supporting statement, Dick Bouma, chairman of DPS, added: &#8220;This is a nice and important first step for the court. The ruling shows that it pays to take a collective stand against tech giants that violate privacy rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two not-for-profits are urging Facebook users in the Netherlands to <a href="https://www.consumentenbond.nl/acties/facebook/aanmelden">sign up</a> to be part of the representative action (and potentially receive compensation) &#8212; saying more than 185,000 people have registered so far.</p>
<p>The suit argues that Facebook users are &#8220;paying&#8221; for the &#8220;free&#8221; service with their data &#8212; contending the tech giant does not have a valid legal basis to process people&#8217;s information because it has not provided users with comprehensive information about the data it is gathering from and on them, nor what it does with it.</p>
<p>So &#8212; in essence &#8212; the argument is that Facebook&#8217;s tracking and targeting is in breach of EU privacy law.</p>
<p>The legal challenge follows an earlier investigation (back in 2014) of Facebook&#8217;s business by the Dutch data protection authority that identified problems with its privacy policy and &#8212; in a 2017 report &#8212; found the company to be processing users&#8217; data without their knowledge or consent.</p>
<p>However, since 2018, Europe&#8217;s GDPR has been in application and a &#8220;one-stop-shop&#8221; mechanism baked into the regulation &#8212; to streamline the handling of cross-border cases &#8212; has meant complaints against Facebook have been funnelled through Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission. The Irish DPC has yet to issue a single decision against Facebook despite receiving scores of complaints. (And it&#8217;s notable that  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">&#8220;forced consent&#8221;</a> complaints were filed against Facebook the day GDPR begun being applied &#8212; yet still remain undecided by Ireland.)</p>
<p>The GDPR&#8217;s enforcement bottleneck makes collective redress actions, such as this one in the Netherlands a potentially important route for Europeans to get rights relief against powerful platforms that seek to shrink the risk of regulatory enforcement via forum shopping.</p>
<p>Although national rules &#8212; and courts&#8217; interpretations of them &#8212; can vary. So the chance of litigation succeeding is not uniform.</p>
<p>In this case, the Amsterdam court allowed the suit to proceed on the grounds that the Facebook data subjects in question reside in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>It also took the view that a local Facebook corporate entity in the Netherlands is an establishment of Facebook Ireland, among other reasons for rejecting Facebook&#8217;s arguments.</p>
<p>How Facebook will seek to press a case against the substance of the Dutch privacy litigation remains to be seen. It may well have other procedural strategies up its sleeve.</p>
<p>The tech giant has used similar stalling tactics against far longer-running <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/25/facebooks-least-favorite-austrian-can-now-press-privacy-suit-in-vienna/">privacy litigation in Austria</a>, for example.</p>
<p>In that case, brought by privacy campaigner Max Schrems and his not-for-profit noyb, Facebook has sought to claim that the GDPR&#8217;s consent requirements do not apply to its advertising business because it now includes &#8220;personalized advertising&#8221; in its T&amp;Cs &#8212; and therefore has a &#8220;duty&#8221; to provide privacy-hostile ads to users &#8212; seeking to bypass the GDPR by claiming it must process users&#8217; data because it&#8217;s &#8220;necessary for the performance of a contract,&#8221; as <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/facebooks-gdpr-bypass-reaches-austrian-supreme-court">noyb explains here</a>.</p>
<p>A court in Vienna accepted this &#8220;GDPR consent bypass&#8221; sleight of hand, dealing a blow to European privacy campaigners.</p>
<p>But an appeal reached the Austrian Supreme Court in March &#8212; and a referral could be made to Europe&#8217;s top court.</p>
<p>If that happens it would then be up to the CJEU to weigh in whether such a massive loophole in the EU&#8217;s flagship data protection framework should really be allowed to stand. But that process could still take over a year or longer.</p>
<p>In the short term, the result is yet more delay for Europeans trying to exercise their rights against platform giants and their in-house armies of lawyers.</p>
<p>In a more positive development for privacy rights, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/cjeu-ruling-could-open-big-tech-to-more-privacy-litigation-in-europe/">recent ruling</a> by the CJEU bolstered the case for data protection agencies across the EU to bring actions against tech giants if they see an urgent threat to users &#8212; and believe a lead supervisor is failing to act.</p>
<p>That ruling could help unblock some GDPR enforcement against the most powerful tech companies at the regulatory level, potentially reducing the blockages created by bottlenecks such as Ireland.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s EU to U.S. data flows are also now facing the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">possibility of a suspension order in a matter of months</a> &#8212; related to another piece of litigation brought by Schrems that hinges on the conflict between EU fundamental rights and U.S. surveillance law.</p>
<p>The CJEU weighed in on that last summer with a judgment that requires regulators like Ireland to act when user data is at risk. (Germany&#8217;s federal data protection commissioner, for instance, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/german-government-bodies-urged-to-remove-their-facebook-pages-before-next-year/">warned government bodies to shut their official Facebook pages</a> ahead of planned enforcement action at the start of next year.)</p>
<p>So while Facebook has been spectacularly successful at kicking Europe&#8217;s privacy rights claims down the road, for well over a decade, its strategy of legal delay tactics to shield a privacy-hostile business model could finally hit a geopolitical brick wall.</p>
<p>The tech giant has sought to lobby against this threat to its business by suggesting it might switch off its service in Europe if the regulator follows through on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling/">preliminary suspension order last year</a>.</p>
<p>But it has also publicly denied it would actually follow through and close service in Europe.</p>
<p>How might Facebook actually comply if ordered to cut off EU data flows? <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/max-schrems-on-the-eu-court-ruling-that-could-cut-facebook-in-two/">Schrems has argued</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> it may need to federate its service and store European users&#8217; data inside the EU in order to comply with the eponymous Schrems II CJEU ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Albeit, Facebook has certainly shown itself adept at exploiting the gaps between Europeans&#8217; on-paper rights, national case law and the various EU and member state institutions involved in oversight and enforcement as a tactic to defend its commercial priorities &#8212; playing different players and pushing agendas to further its business interests. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">So whether any single piece of EU privacy litigation will prove to be the silver bullet that forces a reboot of its privacy-hostile business model very much remains to be seen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">A perhaps more likely scenario is that each of these cases further erodes user trust in Facebook&#8217;s services &#8212; reducing people&#8217;s appetite to use its apps and expanding opportunities for rights-respecting competitors to poach custom by offering something better. </span></p>

		Founder of Unicorn Capital and Minimal Capital, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/evanhfisher">Evan Fisher</a>'s pitching and investor strategy has helped startups raise more than $2.5 billion. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Let’s play out this scenario. Your deck is ready and you’re just about to start reaching out. What does conventional wisdom say that you should send? A three-paragraph overview, four bullet points outlining the problem, and three bullet points on how you solve it and why you’re the best. You went through all that work … but who is going to read it? <strong>A junior person</strong>. Not even a senior VC.</p>
<p>Even if you do end up with a meeting, odds are that your deck didn’t even get read. The biggest lie in venture capital is: “Yes, I read through your deck.” Because those words are immediately followed by, <em>“ … but why don’t you run us through it from the beginning?”</em></p>
<p>At that point, it’s safe to assume that no one has actually taken the time to read through what you sent, the junior guy thought it would be an interesting meeting considering the fund’s current themes of interest, and no one objected to taking the meeting. But no one has really taken the time to read through your deck.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Even if the only benefit was that other investment committee members heard the story direct from the founder, that alone would make your video pitch worth it.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>According to DocSend, the average pitch deck review time over the last 20 weeks is <a href="https://www.docsend.com/index/2020-docsend-startup-index/">less than three minutes</a>. Let’s break down how much time you’ll be given for a 12-page deck (a very concise deck):</p>
<ul>
<li>Cover — 5 seconds.</li>
<li>Back cover — 5 seconds.</li>
<li>All the rest — 2:50.</li>
</ul>
<p>That also includes time for that critical-to-understand diagram that illustrates and distills your unique system or view of the world. Do you think 25 seconds is long enough to fully comprehend that diagram and connect the dots with your value prop? Not likely.</p>
<h2>What should you do about it?</h2>
<p>Don’t send cold decks, ever. Instead, you should be video pitching — this is a video walkthrough of your deck, with your face in a camera bubble talking through it and giving added color in a video no longer than six-and-a-half minutes. Your objective for this video: Get in, provide a basis of understanding, and get out with a punchy CTA. Nothing flashy, nothing fancy.</p>
<p>More investors are embracing video pitches (prime example: Ashton Kutcher’s <a href="https://www.soundventures.com/contact/">Sound Ventures</a>), and in the age of the Zoom-based pitch meeting, it’s quickly becoming the standard.</p>
<p>The rapid but notable shift is because in video pitching, founders get to showcase the preparedness, commitment and passion VCs are looking for, all while telling their story. None of that is effectively transmitted in a cold pitch deck. Further, it allows you to create a deeper connection even before a meeting ever takes place. In a sense, it allows you and the investor to skip a step in the relationship-building process.</p>
<h2>Why you have to do video pitches</h2>
<p>Cold decks get blown out of the water when compared with the benefits of the video pitch:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can connect the dots in an easy-to-digest manner. Instead of simply reading the slides, you’re adding context as you go through them. Basically, you’re doing investors a favor by doing the mental heavy lifting for them.</li>
<li>You <a href="https://unicrn.substack.com/p/investors-parenting-and-why-you-should">control the interaction</a>. It’s a recorded video, so you get to pitch with the added benefit of not getting interrupted.</li>
<li>People might not give three minutes to skim a PDF, but they will watch a six-and-a-half minute high-relevance video!<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a surprise announcement today, IBM announced that Jim Whitehurst, who came over in the Red Hat deal, would be stepping down as company president <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/paul-cormier-takes-over-as-red-hat-ceo-as-jim-whitehurst-moves-to-ibm/">just 14 months after taking over</a> in that role.</p>
<p>IBM didn&#8217;t give a lot of details as to why he was stepping away, but acknowledged his key role in helping bring the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/with-the-acquisition-closed-ibm-goes-all-in-on-red-hat/"> 2018 $34 billion Red Hat deal</a> to fruition and helping bring the two companies together after the deal closed. &#8220;Jim has been instrumental in articulating IBM’s strategy, but also, in ensuring that IBM and Red Hat work well together and that our technology platforms and innovations provide more value to our clients,&#8221; the company stated.</p>
<p>He will stay on as a senior adviser to Krishna, but it begs the question why he is leaving after such a short time in the role, and what he plans to do next. Oftentimes after a deal of this magnitude closes, there is an agreement as to how long key executives will stay. It could be simply that the period has expired and Whitehurst wants to move on, but some saw him as the heir apparent to Krishna and the move comes as a surprise when looked at in that context.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am surprised because I always thought Jim would be next in line as IBM CEO. I also liked the pairing between a lifer IBMer and an outsider,&#8221; Patrick Moorhead, founder and principal analyst at Moor Insight &amp; Strategies told TechCrunch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Regardless, it leaves a big hole in Krishna&#8217;s leadership team as he works to transform the company into one that is primarily focused on hybrid cloud. Whitehurst was undoubtedly in a position to help drive that change through his depth of industry knowledge and his credibility with the open source community from his time at Red Hat. He is not someone who would be easily replaced and the announcement didn&#8217;t mention anyone filling his role.</p>
<p>When IBM bought Red Hat in 2018 for $34 billion, it led to a cascading set of changes at both companies. First<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/01/ginni-rometty-leaves-complex-legacy-as-she-steps-away-as-ibm-ceo/"> Ginni Rometty stepped down</a> as CEO at IBM and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/10/incoming-ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-faces-monumental-challenges-on-multiple-fronts/">Arvind Krishna took over</a>. At the same time, Jim Whitehurst, who had been Red Hat CEO moved to IBM as president and long-time employee Paul Cormier moved into his role.</p>
<p>At the same time, the company also announced some other changes including that long-time IBM executive Bridget van Kralingen announced she too was stepping away, leaving her role as senior vice president of global markets. Rob Thomas, who had been senior vice president of IBM cloud and data platform, will step in to replace Van Kraligen.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[To see Didi get taken to task mere days after its U.S. debut puts a bad taste in our mouths.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shares of Chinese ride-hailing provider Didi are sharply lower this morning after news broke that its domestic regulators are investigating the newly public company. A loose translation of the probe&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/2021-07/02/c_1626811521011934.htm">official notice</a> indicates that the cybersecurity review is &#8220;in order to prevent national data security risks, maintain national security and protect the public interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yesterday, regulators ordered Didi to stop registering new users during the investigation.</p>
<p>The move comes amid a larger reset of relations between China&#8217;s burgeoning technology sector and its autocratic government. Other fallouts from the campaign included the effective silencing of Jack Ma, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">embarrassing cancellation of the Ant IPO</a> and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/china-regulation-data-collection-may-starts/">crackdown on data collection from technology companies</a> more broadly.</p>

<strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>China is not the only nation grappling with its technology sector; India has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/">made consistent noise</a> in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/indias-central-bank-says-growing-presence-of-big-tech-in-financial-services-a-concern/">recent months</a> regarding tech firms inside its borders, for example. And there is effort inside the U.S. Congress to put some cap on Big Tech&#8217;s scale and power, though of the trio, the United States appears the least likely to take a real swipe at technology companies&#8217; market influence.</p>
<p>That Didi has run afoul of China&#8217;s regulatory bodies is not a surprise; it&#8217;s a well-known tech company in the country with lots of consumer data. Similar <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-new-power-play-more-control-of-tech-companies-troves-of-data-11623470478">data-rich tech shops in the country</a> have come under increased scrutiny as well.</p>
<p>But to see Didi get taken to task mere days <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/softbank-uber-tencent-set-to-reap-rewards-from-didi-ipo/">after its U.S. debut</a> puts a bad taste in our mouths.</p>
<p>The way that this saga reads from the cynical perspective is that the Chinese Communist Party was willing to let the company go public in the United States, allowing it to raise billions of dollars from foreign sources. And that the ruling party was then content to leave them holding a midsized bag by announcing its cybersecurity probe.</p>
<p><a href="https://fs.blog/2017/04/mental-model-hanlons-razor/">Hanlon’s Razor</a> is at play in this situation, naturally.</p>
<p>Didi has not published a new SEC filing since June 30, and, as of the time of writing, its investor relations page is devoid of any information regarding today&#8217;s news.</p>
<p>While going public, it&#8217;s worth noting that Didi <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001764757/000104746921001221/a2243298zf-1a.htm#da10201_risk_factors">did warn investors</a> that it faces a host of risks relating to its status as a Chinese company, namely its government, and as a Chinese company going public in the United States. Observe the following risk factors that it shared while going public (emphasis added) that dealt with the company&#8217;s business operations:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Our business is <strong>subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks</strong> that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.</li>
<li>Our business is subject to a variety of laws, regulations, rules, policies and other obligations regarding privacy, data protection and information security. Any losses, unauthorized access or releases of confidential information or personal data could subject us to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors is investing in domestically sourced lithium. The company said Friday it became the first investor in an Australian company’s project to extract the mineral, a critical component of electric vehicle batteries, from the Salton Sea Geothermal Field near Los Angeles. The automaker will have first rights on lithium produced by Controlled Thermal Resources’ “Hell’s Kitchen” lithium extraction project.</p>
<p>The Hell’s Kitchen project is expected to begin producing lithium in 2024. That output would be used in GM’s Ultium battery cells, which are being manufactured as part of a joint venture with LG Energy Solution, after undergoing validation and testing. While Tim Grewe, GM’s general director of electrification strategy and cell engineering, declined to provide specifics on how much lithium GM will likely receive, he said the company expects “it’ll be a significant amount of [GM&#8217;s] North American lithium.”</p>
<p>GM and other automakers will need a lot of lithium if they want to meet their electrification targets. For GM, that includes transitioning away from internal combustion engines entirely by 2035. But that wide-scale transition will also likely mean greater competition – not only for customers&#8217; dollars, but for the source minerals that compose essential parts like batteries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In general, lithium is produced either via hard rock mining or by extracting the mineral from brine deposits. Both methods have been criticized for their impacts on the environment. What makes CTR’s project stand out is that it will use renewable geothermal energy – produced from the Salton Sea Geothermal Field, a huge area in the Imperial Valley that’s already home to 11 geothermal power stations – to process the lithium.</p>
<p>In addition to being powered by renewable energy, CTR says the project uses a closed-loop direct extraction process that returns spent brine to its underground source and leaves no production tailings, a kind of waste reside from mining.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PARLmFc1iKc" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Most of the world’s lithium is sourced from a small number of countries, predominately Chile, Australia, China and Argentina. There is only one lithium production site in the United States, a brine operation in Nevada owned by chemical manufacturing giant Albemarle. But there’s been an increased focus on boosting domestic production in the mineral in recent years, driven largely by two trends: the anticipated demand for the mineral, which is expected to rapidly increase due in part to the transition to battery electric vehicles; and a bipartisan focus on keeping the U.S. competitive in emerging technologies.</p>
<p>According to the California Energy Commission, as much as one-third of the world’s current demand for lithium could be found in the state’s lithium deposits. The CTR project is one of many aimed at extracting lithium from the Salton Sea’s vast brine fields.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Licious, a Bangalore-based startup that sells fresh meat and seafood online, has raised $192 million in a new financing round as it looks to expand its footprint beyond the South Asian market.</p>
<p>The new round &#8212; a Series F &#8212; was led by Singapore’s investment firm Temasek and Multiples Private Equity. The round, which brings the six-year-old Indian firm’s to-date raise to over $285 million, values the startup at more than $650 million (according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/16/licious-raises-30m-to-grow-its-meat-and-seafood-e-commerce-platform-in-india/">up from $285 million in December 2019 Series E funding</a>.</p>
<p>Existing investors 3one4 Capital, Bertelsmann India Investments, Vertex Growth Fund, and Vertex Ventures also participated in the new round, and some early investors sold some of their stakes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.licious.in">Licious</a> operates an eponymous e-commerce platform where it sells meat and seafood in over a dozen Indian cities. The startup has built a supply chain network across several Indian cities to be able to procure meat and seafood, keep them fresh, and deliver within hours of the order.</p>
<p>In recent months, the startup says it has accelerated its growth as people increase their protein consumption in a bid to improve their immunity.</p>
<p>It didn’t disclose exact figures, but said the startup has seen a 500% growth in the past 12 months and delivered to more than 2 million unique customers.</p>
<p>“This is just the beginning in our pursuit of building an exemplary and iconic tech-led D2C (direct-to-consumer) brand,” said Vivek Gupta and Abhay Hanjura in a joint statement Friday.</p>
<p>According to industry estimates, India&#8217;s online meat market is worth over $4.4 billion and has grown by over 2.5x since the pandemic hit last year.</p>
<p>Licious, which competes with FreshToHome, plans to deploy the fresh capital to expand to “multiple geographies,” it said, without identifying any market. The startup is also making investments to broaden its tech and supply chain networks, it said.</p>
<p>The startup’s co-founders have “revolutionised the purchase of poultry, seafood and meat in the country delighting customers with their promise of quality, freshness and timely delivery,” said Sridhar Sankararaman, MD, Multiples.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swedish gaming giant Modern Times Group (MTG) has acquired Indian startup <a href="http://playsimple.in">PlaySimple</a> for at least $360 million, the two firms said Friday.</p>
<p>MTG said it will pay 77% of the acquisition sum to Indian game developer and publisher in cash and the rest in company shares. There’s also another $150 million reward put aside if certain undisclosed performance metrics are hit, the two firms said.</p>
<p>Friday’s deal marks one of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/indias-byjus-acquires-whitehat-jr-for-300-million/">largest exits in the Indian startup ecosystem</a>. PlaySimple had raised $4 million Series A at a valuation of about $16 million from Elevation Capital and Chiratae Ventures in 2016. (The startup, which began its journey in Bangalore, raised just $4.5 million in total from external investors.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And it’s clear why: the revenues of PlaySimple &#8212; which operates nine word games including “Daily Themed Crossword,” “Word Trip,” “Word Jam,” and “Word Wars” &#8212; grew by 144% y-o-y to $83 million last year and it was on track to hit over $60 million revenue in the first half of 2021.</p>

<p>“We’re very proud of the games we’ve developed over the years, and of the infrastructure and scale that we’ve achieved with our team,&#8221; said PlaySimple co-founders and management team members &#8212; Siddhanth Jain, Suraj Nalin and Preeti Reddy &#8212; in a joint statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we join the MTG family, we look forward to leveraging our proprietary technology across MTG’s gaming portfolio, expanding into the European market, investing in cutting-edge technology and building exciting new games.”</p>
<p>PlaySimple, which says its free-to-play games have amassed over 75 million installs and maintain nearly 2 million daily active users, plans to launch a number of games later this year and also expand into the card games genre.</p>
<p>&#8220;PlaySimple is a rapidly growing and highly profitable games studio that quickly has established itself as one of the leading global developers of free-to-play word games, an exciting new genre for MTG,&#8221; said Maria Redin, MTG Group President and CEO, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Stockholm-headquartered firm, which has also acquired Hutch and Ninja Kiwi in recent quarters, said PlaySimple will help it build a diversified gaming vertical. &#8220;Scaling and diversifying the GamingCo [an MTG subsidiary] helps to accelerate the operational performance while at the same time creating a more stable business,&#8221; the firm said.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TeamApt has quite the story.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TeamApt bootstrapped with revenue made on a per-project basis. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2017, the company, which optimized core bank back-office operations was servicing 26 financial institutions and processing $160 million in monthly transactions without raising a dime</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A year later, TeamApt began releasing direct consumer and business-facing products targeted at driving financial inclusion in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

But in developing markets like Nigeria, it&#8217;s necessary because the bank to population ratio in Nigeria is low. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to reports, there are 4.3 branches per 100,000 people compared to the global average of 11.7 branches</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agency banking serves as an alternative distribution strategy for traditional retail banking by using authorized personnel who acts as agents to expand the reach of the branch network</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many Nigerians, agency banking represents a financial access lifeline and one of the most viable options for accessing the financial services they need</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>Moniepoint agents <span style="font-weight: 400;">use</span> mobile apps and point-of-sale terminals to offer these customers access to financial services like cash withdrawal, cash deposit, funds transfer, airtime purchase and bill payments. I<span style="font-weight: 400;">n less than two years, Moniepoint claims to account for 74% of agency banking transactions in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform also processes about 68 million transactions worth over $3.5 billion monthly through 100,000 agents and 14 million customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When transactions from Monnify </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, TeamApt said it processed $17.5 billion in the past 12 months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite the seeming success, TeamApt </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is poised</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to add digital banking services to Moniepoint&#8217;s dominant agency banking play</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;What is the reason behind this? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> players, was the agency banking space becoming too crowded that Moniepoint couldn&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more market share</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?&#8221; I ask Eniolorunda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s still room for growth in the agency space. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can actually grow more and take more share as more agents continue to enter the market and consumers embracing agency networks and point-of-sale networks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So the reason we&#8217;re trying to do this is for two reasons &#8212; a mission and commercial reason,&#8221; he answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most well-known digital banks in Nigeria cater to the already banked, neglecting the unbanked or underbanked consumers that banks do not serve</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eniolorunda&#8217;s &#8220;mission reason&#8221; is to provide financial services for them via launching a digital bank</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The commercial reason? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to be the middle ground between banks and digital approaches to actually serve the next billion Africans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason why we can do this is that we have demonstrated our traction in Nigeria to become the largest agency network </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the period of two years,&#8221; the CEO added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging by the transactions made on Moniepoint and since existing digital banks capture the same customers as big commercial banks, TeamApt sits on a big opportunity if it can convert a chunk of its offline users online and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hould it show significant success, other platforms might widely adopt the approach which will</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> go a long way in providing digital banking services to the unbanked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To test out this strategy at scale, TeamApt has secured an undisclosed Series B investment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors who participated include lead investor<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/novastar-ventures-becomes-200m-african-vc-fund-after-108m-raise/"> Novastar Ventures</a> which controls a $200 million Pan-African fund; Dubai-based Global Ventures, FMO, CDC Group, Soma Capital, and Pan-African VC firms Kepple Africa and Oui Capital alongside some</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> local angel investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TeamApt, while continuing its switching business for enterprise, will be looking to extend its offerings </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to customers and micro-SMEs with Moniepoint</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In addition, and s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ubject to regulatory approval, both agency and digital banking platforms will exist under Moniepoint</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/waswani">Brian Waswani Odhiambo</a>, the head of West Africa at Novastar Ventures, said the VC firm backed TeamApt after seeing the speed at which its agency network became the leading operator in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The firm, “by providing TeamApt with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sufficient</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> capital to pursue its new phase of growth,” has no doubt the company will do the same with its digital banking platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past month, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TeamApt has announced to that it&#8217;s currently in the process of closing another round. Eniolorunda confirmed this to TechCrunch that it would be a Series C round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While that is in progress,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> TeamApt will be making expansion plans to other African countries with strong economies in every region &#8212; Central, East, North and South</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is also keen on performing a few acquisitions along the way to tap significant opportunities for leveraging technology and offline distribution to provide financial services to Africa&#8217;s mass market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neobanks have led the charge as regards venture capital funding for consumer fintech startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while they have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">collectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dominated the fintech space, they don&#8217;t operate a monolithic model</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/which-neobanks-will-rise-or-fall/">five distinct models</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/nubank-ec1/">the one adopted by Nubank, the $30 billion behemoth</a>, is the credit-led model</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neobanks operating this model start by offering credit via cards or on an app and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offer bank accounts as a gateway to other services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerian fintech startup FairMoney operates this model. Today, it is announcing a $42 million Series B raise to diversify its offerings and expand to &#8220;become the financial hub for its users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiger Global Management led the round. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing investors from the company&#8217;s previous rounds, DST Partners, Flourish Ventures, Newfund, and Speedinvest, participated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The investment comes after FairMoney raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/fairmoney-raises-11-million-for-its-challenger-bank-for-emerging-markets/">€10 million Series A</a> two years ago and €1.2 million seed in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2017 by</span><a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/laurin-nabuko-hainy-03a5b862"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Laurin Hainy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/matthieu-gendreau-22661a3a/en-us"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthieu Gendreau,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolasberthozat/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicolas Berthozat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, FairMoney started as an online lender that provides instant loans and bill payments to customers in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When CEO Hainy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/with-over-1-3-million-users-nigerian-based-fintech-fairmoney-wants-to-replicate-growth-in-india/">spoke to TechCrunch in February</a>, the company was six months into its expansion to India</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One of the highlights of that discussion was FairMoney&#8217;s impressive numbers in 2020. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the company disbursed a total loan volume of $93 million to over 1.3 million users who made more than 6.5 million loan applications</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also made some progress on the India front, processing more than 500,000 loan applications from over 100,000 unique users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what has changed since then? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one, Hainy says FairMoney ticked one of the goals which was acquiring a microfinance bank license</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The license allows FairMoney to operate as a financial service provider in Nigeria.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have received our MFB banking license which now enables us to open current accounts for our users, and we&#8217;re doing that on quite a big scale,&#8221; Hainy said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We opened accounts for our repeated and new customers, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is quite a unique company strategy because we don&#8217;t need to burn millions of dollars of customer acquisition cost on users like other competitors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I think </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that has enabled us to become sort of the largest digital bank in Nigeria.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quite the claim but behind it are figures to back it up. Of the company&#8217;s current 3.5 million registered users, 1.3 million are unique bank account holders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company says it is projecting to disburse $300 million worth of loans to them this year. How will it finance that? By raising bonds. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">FairMoney&#8217;s loan book is grown by its capital markets activity and has convinced some investment banks to invest a substantial amount in its unlisted bond</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The credit-led neobank offers loans to individuals from ₦1,500 (~$3) to ₦500,000 (~$1,000) ranging from days to six months. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small business loans have become a prominent service most digital banks have begun to offer in Nigeria&#8217;s retail sector, and FairMoney sees an opportunity there</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hainy states that from now on, the company will start servicing loans to registered SMEs in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the works also is the issuance of cards. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, unlike the credit cards operated by Nubank, FairMoney is shipping debit cards, the more prevalent one in the Nigerian market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The ambition is that by the end of the year, the customer has the full-fledged banking experience from P2P transfers and lending to debit cards and current accounts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to that, we are working on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a number of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> services from savings products, stock trading, and crypto-trading products </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">potentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> depending on where regulation is heading,&#8221; Hainy continued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most African companies, after completing a Series B raise, think about expansion, it&#8217;s a different case for FairMoney</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hainy calls this a &#8216;focus round&#8217; and says FairMoney wants to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consolidate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its position in Nigeria and India; therefore,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it is not considering any expansion to other markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We feel that with India and Nigeria, we have tons of work to do and tons of problems to solve. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are doubling down on the Nigerian opportunity, which is building out more banking services and becoming one of the commercial banks in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And then India by building a large credit book there,&#8221; the CEO combined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">African fintech startups have attracted a lot of capital this year and they continue to do so. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the continent has seen three nine-figure raises, all from fintech companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Flutterwave</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/south-african-digital-bank-tymebank-lands-109m-from-uk-and-phillippines-investors/">TymeBank</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/africa-has-another-unicorn-as-chipper-cash-raises-100m-series-c-led-by-svb-capital/">Chipper Cash</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There&#8217;s also one <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/african-fintech-opay-reportedly-raising-400m-at-a-1-5b-valuation/">reportedly in the works</a> from OPay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerian fintechs are leading the crop as exciting startups keep coming from the country week in week out, gaining access to capital at an astonishing rate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not news that while local investors are cutting checks at pre-seed and seed levels, and sometimes Series A, international investors control the continent&#8217;s latter stages</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. TymeBank cited U.K. and Philippines venture capital firms as investors. For Chipper Cash, it was SVB Capital, Ribbit, and Bezos Expeditions, while Avenir Growth Capital and Tiger Global invested in Flutterwave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In FairMoney, Tiger Global has made a return to the continent. Per public knowledge, it is the first time the U.S. hedge fund is investing in two African startups in a year after backing Flutterwave in March. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to partner with FairMoney as they build a better financial hub for customers in Nigeria and India,&#8221; Scott Shleifer, partner at Tiger Global, said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were impressed by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the team and the strong growth to date and look forward to supporting FairMoney as they continue to scale</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hainy calls the investment a great industry signaling for the continent. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He believes Tiger Global decided to back FairMoney because the company has been able to scale </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tremendously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and shown that it can operate banking and lending while running a profitable business when most of its counterparts are not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think what most people have been discussing is the question of sustainability. How long can digital banks operate as financial service providers while making losses? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that&#8217;s another great signal for the market that we&#8217;ve actually managed to do that in a profitable manner, providing upside for our shareholders and also showing our clients that they can actually bank on us in the future,&#8221; Hainy added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>And to achieve its goal to become a financial hub for its customers’ banking needs, the CEO said the company is embarking on a hiring spree for top talent. “We are hiring worldwide, and there are 150 open positions out there right now that we’re trying to fill with strong talent to help us build the financial app for Nigerians.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two billionaires are neck and neck in the final sprint to the Kármán line, <a href="https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-announces-first-fully-crewed-spaceflight/">but Richard Branson may clinch it with a July 11 flight</a> on a Virgin Galactic spacecraft, narrowly beating out Jeff Bezos&#8217;s planned July 20 trip aboard a Blue Origin New Shepard capsule. Whoever wins, the real lesson here is that with enough money, you truly can do anything.</p>
<p>The news came today in the form of an announcement from Virgin Galactic stating that the launch window for its next test flight opens at 6 AM Pacific time on July 11, and that the mission will be the first to carry a full crew: two pilots, three specialists, and one billionaire. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/jeff-bezos-and-his-brother-will-fly-on-blue-origins-first-human-spaceflight-with-auction-winner/">Blue Origin had its own announcement.</a>)</p>
<p>Dave Mackay and Michael Masucci will pilot the VSS Unity spacecraft; Chief Astronaut instructor Beth Moses will oversee the flight; Lead Operations Engineer Colin Bennett will monitor cabin equipment and procedures; Vice President of Government Affairs and Research Operations Sirisha Bandla will be handling a University of Florida microgravity experiment; and lastly, Sir Richard Branson &#8220;will evaluate the private astronaut experience.&#8221; In other words, he&#8217;s the first plain old passenger.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;FAA clears Virgin Galactic for commercial astronaut spaceflight&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/faa-clears-virgin-galactic-for-commercial-astronaut-spaceflight/embed/#?secret=bl0CUjUQMX" data-secret="bl0CUjUQMX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;I truly believe that space belongs to all of us,&#8221; the billionaire founder and private funder of the space tourism company said in the company&#8217;s press release. &#8220;After more than 16 years of research, engineering, and testing, Virgin Galactic stands at the vanguard of a new commercial space industry, which is set to open space to humankind and change the world for good. It’s one thing to have a dream of making space more accessible to all; it’s another for an incredible team to collectively turn that dream into reality. As part of a remarkable crew of mission specialists, I’m honoured to help validate the journey our future astronauts will undertake and ensure we deliver the unique customer experience people expect from Virgin.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mission will, like others in the Virgin Galactic style, involve being flown by traditional means to what is normally considered a high altitude, after which the rocket-powered VSS Unity will detach from the plane and zoom up to above 80 kilometers, generally (though not universally) considered the edge of space. Branson will have gone through all the same training that future Virgin Galactic space tourists will go through, and will of course wear the same special blue suit.</p>
<p>If all goes according to plan, Branson will beat Bezos to space by a little more than a week, and probably win a long-running bet.</p>

<p>Bezos, for his part, will be going up July 11 (again, delays notwithstanding) on a more traditional launch vehicle, Blue Origin&#8217;s New Shepard, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/jeff-bezos-and-his-brother-will-fly-on-blue-origins-first-human-spaceflight-with-auction-winner/">accompanied by his brother</a> and a lucky ticket-holder — lucky and rich, that is, since the ticket ended up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-auctions-off-seat-on-first-human-spaceflight-for-28m/">selling at auction for $28 million</a> to an as-yet unannounced party.</p>
<p>The company did however today announce that <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/wally-funk-will-fly-to-space-on-new-shepard">the fourth passenger on the first crewed flight will be Wally Funk</a>, the first graduate of NASA&#8217;s Mercury 13 program that trained women astronauts in 1961 — but the mission was cancelled and Funk never went to space. After 50 years of waiting, it seems she&#8217;ll finally get her chance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is considering changes to the way it contextualizes misleading tweets that the company doesn&#8217;t believe are dangerous enough to be removed from the platform outright.</p>
<p>The company announced the test in a tweet Thursday with an image of the new misinformation labels. Within the limited test, those labels will appear with color-coded backgrounds now, making them much more visible in the feed while also giving users a way to quickly parse the information from visual cues. Some users will begin to see the change this week.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Last year, we started using labels to let you know when a Tweet may include misleading information. </p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For some of you on web, we’ll be testing a new label design with more context to help you better understand why a Tweet may be misleading. <a href="https://t.co/p1KONJz5Vo">https://t.co/p1KONJz5Vo</a> <a href="https://t.co/m55f4RlMDg">pic.twitter.com/m55f4RlMDg</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Tweets that Twitter deems &#8220;misleading&#8221; will get a red background with a short explanation and a notice that users can&#8217;t reply to, like or share the content. Yellow labels will appear on content that isn&#8217;t as actively misleading. In both cases, Twitter has made it more clear that you can click the labels to find verified information about the topic at hand (in this case, the pandemic).</p>
<p>&#8220;People who come across the new labels as a part of this limited test should expect a more communicative impact from the labels themselves both through copy, symbols and colors used to distill clear context about not only the label, but the information or content they are engaging with,&#8221; a Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172971" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172971" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2172971 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/twitter-labels-new.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="580" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/twitter-labels-new.jpeg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/twitter-labels-new.jpeg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/twitter-labels-new.jpeg?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/twitter-labels-new.jpeg?resize=768,435 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/twitter-labels-new.jpeg?resize=680,385 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/twitter-labels-new.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172971" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: Twitter</strong></p></div></p>
<p>Twitter found that even tiny shifts in design could impact how people interacted with labeled tweets. In a test the company ran with a pink variation of the label, users clicked through to the authoritative information that Twitter provided more but they also quote-tweeted the content itself more, furthering its spread. Twitter says that it tested many variations on the written copy, colors and symbols that made their way into the new misinformation labels.</p>
<p>The changes come after a long public feedback period that convinced the company that misinformation labels needed to stand out better in a sea of tweets. Facebook&#8217;s own misinformation labels have also faced criticism for blending in too easily and failing to create much friction for potentially dangerous information on the platform.</p>
<p>Twitter first created content labels as a way to flag &#8220;manipulated media&#8221; — photos and videos altered to deliberately mislead people, like the doctored<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/facebook-will-not-remove-deepfakes-of-mark-zuckerberg-kim-kardashian-and-others-from-instagram/"> deepfake</a> of Nancy Pelosi that went viral back in 2019. Last May, Twitter expanded its use of labels to address the wave of COVID-19 misinformation that swept over social media early in the pandemic.</p>
<p>A month ago, the company rolled out new labels specific to vaccine misinformation and introduced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/twitter-vaccine-misinformation-labels-strike-system/?tpcc=ECTW2020">strike-based system</a> into its rules. The idea is for Twitter to build a toolkit it can use to respond in a proportional way to misinformation depending on the potential for real-world harm.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;&#8230; We know that even within the space of our policies, not all misleading claims are equally harmful,&#8221; a Twitter spokesperson said. &#8220;For example, telling someone to drink bleach in order to cure COVID is a more immediate and severe harm than sharing a viral image of a shark swimming on a flooded highway and claiming that&#8217;s footage from a hurricane. (That&#8217;s a real thing that happens every hurricane season.)&#8221;</p>

<p>Labels are just one of the content moderation options that Twitter developed over the course of the last couple of years, along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-pop-up-trump-video-capitol-rally/">warnings that require a click-through</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/twitter-may-slow-down-users-ability-to-like-tweets-containing-misinformation/">pop-up messages</a> designed to subtly steer people away from impulsively sharing inflammatory tweets.</p>
<p>When Twitter decides not to remove content outright, it turns to an a la carte menu of potential content enforcement options:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Apply a label and/or warning message to the Tweet</li>
<li>Show a warning to people before they share or like the Tweet;</li>
<li>Reduce the visibility of the Tweet on Twitter and/or prevent it from being recommended;</li>
<li>Turn off likes, replies, and Retweets; and/or</li>
<li>Provide a link to additional explanations or clarifications, such as in a curated landing page or relevant Twitter policies.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In most scenarios, the company will opt for all of the above.</p>
<p>&#8220;While there is no single answer to addressing the unique challenges presented by the range of types of misinformation, we believe investing in a multi-prong approach will allow us to be nimble and shift with the constantly changing dynamic of the public conversation,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Edtech startup <a href="https://www.microverse.org/">Microverse</a> has tapped new venture funding in its quest to help train students across the globe to code through its online school that requires zero upfront cost, instead relying on an income-share agreement that kicks in when students find a job.</p>
<p>The startup tells TechCrunch it has closed a $12.5 million Series A led by Northzone with additional participation from General Catalyst, All Iron Ventures and a host of angel investors. We last covered the company after it had closed a bout of seed funding from General Catalyst and Y Combinator; this latest round brings the startup&#8217;s total funding to just under $16 million.</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s vision has seen added pandemic-era traction as larger tech companies have embraced remote work that spans geographic boundaries and time zones. Microverse has now brought English-speaking students from over 188 countries through its program.</p>
<p>Since we last chatted, CEO Ariel Camus says the startup has landed some 300 early graduates in positions at tech companies including Microsoft, VMWare and Huawei. The company says its has above a 95% employment rate for its students within six months of graduation so far, pushing past one of the bigger issues that income-share-agreement-based schools have had stateside &#8212; getting graduates employed.</p>
<p>Microverse does have notably less generous terms than counterparts like Lambda School when it comes to when students begin loan repayment, the terms of both are actually quite different, as noted in my previous article:</p>
<blockquote><p>While Lambda School’s ISA terms require students to pay 17% of their monthly salary for 24 months once they begin earning above $50,000 annually — up to a maximum of $30,000, Microverse requires that graduates pay 15% of their salary once they begin making more than just $1,000 per month, though there is no cap on time, so students continue payments until they have repaid $15,000 in full. In both startups’ cases, students only repay if they are employed in a field related to what they studied, but with Microverse, ISAs never expire, so if you ever enter a job adjacent to your area of study, you are on the hook for repayments. Lambda School’s ISA taps out after five years of deferred repayments.</p></blockquote>
<p>The startup has made efforts to streamline their online program since launch to ensure that students are being set up to succeed in the full-time, 10-month program. Part of Microverse&#8217;s efforts have included condensing lesson segments into shorter time frames to ensure students aren&#8217;t starting the program unless they have enough free time to commit. Camus says the startup is receiving thousands of applications per month, of which only a fraction are accepted in an effort to ensure that the small startup isn&#8217;t overcommitting itself early on. The startup estimates it will usher 1,000 students through its program this year.</p>
<p>The startup has big plans for the future, including working more closely with tech companies to ensure that students have easier access to job placement once they graduate.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have data now that the day we launch a partner program &#8212; which we haven&#8217;t done yet but we will eventually &#8212; it opens up the market by 5x,&#8221; Camus tells TechCrunch. &#8220;To get 10,000 students per year in a world where 90% of the world&#8217;s population doesn&#8217;t have access to higher education &#8212; it&#8217;s not going to be that hard, to be honest, I&#8217;m not too worried.&#8221;</p>
