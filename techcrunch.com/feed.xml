										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="https://www.southparkcommons.com/fund">South Park Commons</a> (SPC), a community of tens of engineers in San Francisco&#8217;s South Park neighborhood, came together, it mostly flew under the radar, save for a New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/02/business/tech-scene-south-park-commons-san-francisco.html">profile</a> in 2017, a year after it was formed.</p>
<p>Founded by Facebook&#8217;s first female engineer, Ruchi Sanghvi, she explained at the time that her ambition with SPC was to create tech’s answer to the Bloomsbury Set or Benjamin Franklin’s Junto club, where people could discuss their respective and shared experiences and hopefully form new ideas along the way.</p>
<p>Fast forward and SPC &#8212; which went on to raise a $55 million venture fund in 2018 to back projects born by community members &#8212; says the experiment is working. It now has 450 members in the Bay Area and across the globe. It just closed a new $150 million fund from tech luminaries, as well as institutional investors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249592" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It says it also has a highly valuable portfolio. In fact, says Sanghvi, SPC&#8217;s debut fund has already returned its capital &#8212; and then some &#8212; to investors owing to Compound Labs, an open-source platform for decentralized lending whose <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/price/compound">tokens</a> were distributed in part to early shareholders. Sanghvi says SPC has 10 to 12 other so-called unicorns across its portfolio, too.</p>
<p>We chatted earlier today with Sanghvi and her husband and business partner, Aditya Agarwal, who was also an early engineer at Facebook before cofounding with Sanghvi a startup they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/27/dropbox-buys-cove-to-bring-former-facebookers-ruchi-sanghvi-and-aditya-agarwal-to-the-team">sold</a> to Dropbox in 2012 in a reported talent acquisition. (Sanghvi stayed two years as Dropbox&#8217;s VP of Operations; Agarwal, who joined as Dropbox&#8217;s VP of engineering, was promoted to CTO in 2016 and left in 2018, joining Sanghvi at South Park Commons.)</p>
<p>We talked at some length about the evolution of the SPC community, which began in a physical space, has largely become a highly structured virtual society during the pandemic, but that remains very focused on bringing people together in real life.</p>
<p>Indeed, Sanghvi and Agarwal believe so strongly in the power of offline interactions that in addition to their San Francisco hub, a New York location is currently in the works and they suggest that other locations could follow, including in Seattle and even Southeast Asia.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As for that membership, roughly 70% of SPC members are &#8220;technical,&#8221; says Sanghvi, though she adds that the other 30% are &#8220;domain experts or have operational expertise or are even academics.&#8221; That composition is very much by design. &#8220;The funny thing is that when you talk with a great entrepreneur and ask if they want to hang out with another entrepreneur, the answer is always &#8216;no,'&#8221; says Sanghvi, laughing. &#8220;They want to hang out with the expert who beat the Stanford team on some AI algorithm, so having those operational experts mixed into the community is super valuable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The connections lead to more than friendship and fresh ideas, seemingly. According to Agarwal, upwards of 50% of the organization&#8217;s members find their cofounders or founding employees within the community, which underscores another way that South Park Commons sees itself as distinctive. Unlike a Y Combinator, which meets with nascent teams, or VCs who keep tabs on operational execs at big companies, SPC says its focused on capturing people who are plainly talented and probably much in demand but who, though they&#8217;ve left their last gig, aren&#8217;t immediately sure of their next move and mostly just want a little time to figure it out.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s looking to capture people whose next move is simply to freely explore ideas, squishy though it might sound. &#8220;We&#8217;re really like a learning community that helps people in the &#8216;negative one to zero phase&#8217; get to the point of being able to start a company,&#8221; says Agarwal, &#8220;and if startups come out of that process, the fund invests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other things to know: members tend to work closely inside the community for nine months before &#8220;graduating,&#8221; meaning they&#8217;ve either raised more than a million dollars for a new startup concept, have more than four full-time employees, or they&#8217;ve taken a job. (Exploring ideas doesn&#8217;t always lead to starting companies.)</p>
<p>When a community member does reach the fundraising phase, one agreement made early on is to give SPC the right of first refusal to invest. (Each member is also invited to invest in SPC funds if they like, and many take the firm up on this offer. According to Sanghvi, SPC&#8217;s new $150 million fund counts 100 members as investors.)</p>
<p>As for the shape of those investments, it&#8217;s fairly standard. Agarwal says that SPC typically invests anywhere from $700,000 to $2 million dollars for 7% to 10% of the company. He also suggests that because SPC&#8217;s network is so valuable, the venture firms that tend to make subsequent investments typically make room for SPC to maintain its percentage ownership rather than dilute it for their own shorter-term benefit.</p>
<p>Certainly, the formula appears to be working right now. In addition to Compound Labs, some of the outfits to pass through South Park Commons&#8217; corridors (physical and virtual), including <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/vitalik-buterin-announces-ethereum-scaling-roadmap-using-the-graph-protocol-202111281110">The Graph</a>, an indexing protocol for organizing blockchain data that has gained the very public support of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin; Pilot, a maker of bookkeeping software that&#8217;s now backed by Sequoia Capital and Index Ventures and valued at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/jeff-bezos-backed-start-up-pilot-hits-1point2-billion-valuation-.html">$1.2 billion</a>; and Unit21, a no-code software startup that helps businesses monitor fraudulent activities and in July raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/tiger-global-leads-34m-investment-into-unit21-a-no-code-fraud-prevention-platform/">$34 million</a> in Series B funding led by Tiger Global.</p>
<p>In addition to Sanghvi and Agarwal, who are the outfit&#8217;s two general partners, SPC counts as investors Mitra Lohrasbpour, who previously led revenue analytics and international expansion efforts at Dropbox, and Finn Meeks, who previously spent two years as chief of staff for Sanghvi.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, Agarwal says that though SPC&#8217;s new fund is triple the size of its last, he doesn&#8217;t expect the team to invest any more aggressively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our emphasis is on quality over quantity. If the quality happens quickly, that&#8217;s great, but that&#8217;s not the high-order play.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hiiii and welcome to Daily Crunch for December 17, 2021! As <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> noted in yesterday&#8217;s newsletter, I&#8217;m handling the daily recap today while he takes a much-deserved vacation/personal day. Alex is one of the most hardworking and efficient humans I&#8217;ve ever met, so I like to think that one vacation day for him is somehow the equivalent to five vacation days for anyone else.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/buskill-kill-cord-self-destruct-laptop/">The USB &#8216;kill cord&#8217;</a>: You know the lever you&#8217;ve got to hold down to keep a lawn mower running? Imagine that, but it&#8217;s a magnetic USB cable for your laptop. Pull the cable, and your laptop automatically locks down or wipes itself. Zack Whittaker takes a look at the project, which was built to help journalists and activists keep their files safe from physical attacks.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/cytrox-predator-phone-hacking-meta/">The new spyware-for-hire</a>: Just as Apple moves to sue the group behind one spyware-for-hire tool, it&#8217;s becoming clear that this is less &#8220;slaying the dragon&#8221; and more &#8220;battling the Hydra.&#8221; Meta/Facebook announced this week that they are banning not one, not two, but <em>seven </em>groups from touching their social networks after detecting that the groups had targeted up to 50,000 people. Citizen Labs reports that one of these banned companies, Cytrox, tried to trick targets into unintentionally infecting their phones with its spyware &#8220;Predator,&#8221; which gives its operator full control over the mic, camera and more.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/well-tiktok-has-a-discord-now/">TikTok has a Discord now</a>: Ever wish you could talk about TikTok with other TikTokers while not actually being on TikTok? Good news! For some reason, TikTok launched a Discord. As Amanda Silberling puts it, &#8220;If the fast-food chain Wendy’s can have a Discord with over 60,000 members, why not a viral platform like TikTok?&#8221;

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/ex-uber-software-engineers-raise-3m-for-sperta/">THIS. IS. SPERTAAAAA</a>: After spending years helping to fight fraud at Uber, a pair of engineers are taking that hard-earned knowledge and building it into Sperta, an anti-fraud “rules engine as a service” system for fintech companies. Just a few months after launch, they’ve raised $3 million to keep the ball rolling.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/no-code-data-pipeline-platform-hevo-raises-30-million-led-by-sequoia-capital-india/">Hevo raises $30M for its no-code data platform</a>: Successful startups generate a ridiculous amount of data as they grow, but a lot of it tends to get locked up in each individual team’s tools of choice. Hevo taps into all of these tools and pulls that data into a “360-degree view” dashboard, allowing companies to answer complicated questions quickly — and, notably, without writing any code.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/fuzey-takes-in-4-5m-to-charge-up-its-management-tools-for-service-based-businesses/">Fuzey funding</a>: Fuzey aims to be a “one-stop shop” for small businesses — think plumbers, electricians, mechanics — by handling their messages/invoices/appointments and more in one view. Anything that makes running your own business less of a stress labyrinth is a win in my book. The company has just raised $4.5 million in seed funding, bringing its total raised to $5.2 million.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/longtime-gm-exec-dan-ammann-is-out-as-cruise-ceo/">Cruise’s CEO is out</a>: Longtime GM executive Dan Ammann is out as CEO of Cruise. Neither GM nor Cruise said much about the reasoning behind the departure; according to one of Kirsten Korosec’s sources, the announcement “seemed unplanned and chaotic.” Cruise co-founder Kyle Vogt, who was Cruise’s first CEO before shifting to a president/CTO role, will take over as interim CEO.</p>

<p>Founded 16 years ago, Reddit has raised $1.3 billion, boosting the company to a $10 billion valuation. This week, the user-generated community revealed that it had filed confidentially to go public.</p>
<p>“You know what that means,” wrote Alex Wilhelm. “It’s time to ask questions.”</p>
<p>While he awaits Reddit’s S-1 with a sharpened scalpel, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/a-few-questions-about-the-impending-reddit-ipo/">Alex shared his initial questions</a> about the social hub’s operations, specifically:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’re curious about content moderation costs, product expansion, the company’s revenue mix, how frequently governments come up in the filing, and what the unicorn has to say about crypto.”</p></blockquote>

TikTok will be launching a set of around 300 “TikTok Kitchen”-branded, delivery-only restaurants next year, working with creators to ship recreations of their popular dishes. I’m trying not to judge it in advance but … well, let’s just say I’ll be very surprised if these are good.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The debate around social media’s impact on mental health is hardly new, but the conversation has recaptured the world’s attention in light of<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/05/tech/facebook-whistleblower-testify/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> reports</a> this fall that suggest Facebook has been well aware of the toxic mental health consequences of its platforms for teens.</p>
<p>While this data &#8212; and the knowledge that Facebook ignored these concerns &#8212; is troubling, understanding social media’s impact on mental health isn’t all that simple. In fact, there’s a strong argument to be made that social media can offer safe, affirming spaces and connections for young people on the journey to discover themselves and their identities.</p>
<p>These benefits are too often pushed aside while the dark consequences of social media rage on. The fact is that today’s popular social networking platforms, like Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook and more, are designed with monetization as a top priority. At their core, these apps encourage excessive use because more user hours on the app equal more ad support.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248891" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

			The tech industry has an opportunity &#8212; and a responsibility &#8212; to make space for platforms that aren’t dependent on ad dollars.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>While some have responded to the latest backlash by declaring that spaces like Instagram should be<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/28/opinion/instagram-social-media-children.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> strictly reserved for adults</a>, I strongly believe that it’s possible to build a social media environment that is beneficial for teenagers &#8212; one that helps them discover themselves and affirm who they are; one that lets them explore their identities freely; and one that comforts them in times of darkness and helps them know they are not alone.</p>
<p>I’m not sure this future can be cultivated by<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/10/22719545/instagram-introduce-take-a-break-nudge-teens-harmful-content-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> reactive features</a> alone, but there is potential for social media giants to team up with other organizations and nonprofits to make social media a safer place for all people.</p>
<h2>Creating space for ad-supported and nonprofit social media</h2>
<p>While it’s difficult to imagine a world where for-profit social media is not a monopoly, it doesn’t have to be this way. It may not be realistic to eliminate ad-supported social media apps completely, but the tech industry does have an opportunity &#8212; and responsibility &#8212; to make space for platforms that aren’t dependent on ad dollars.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If the number of views, clicks and ads were secondary to people’s wants and needs, we could revolutionize the way social media platforms work. Together, we could build communities that users can come to on their own terms &#8212; whether to escape pressure from other apps, connect with peers or find an accepting place where they can be themselves.</p>
<p>While a handful of ad-free social media spaces already exist &#8212; such as <a href="https://ello.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ello</a> and <a href="https://www.trevorspace.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TrevorSpace</a>, The Trevor Project’s social networking site for LGBTQ+ young people &#8212; they are much smaller and have fewer features, and therefore may not attract the high volume of users who are accustomed to the bells and whistles that come with social media apps such as Instagram.</p>
<p>There also needs to be a space online for young people to explore their identities anonymously, which is nearly impossible when social media companies prioritize ad support over their users’ mental health and well-being. Advertisers want to know exactly who is spending time on social media so they can target users based on their age, gender, behavior and identities. This becomes especially problematic for young users who want to use social media as a vehicle for figuring out who they are but can’t do so discreetly.</p>
<p>In order to overcome this, the industry as a whole needs to make more investments in social media spaces whose purpose isn&#8217;t profit. Over the past few years, tech giants have made incredible strides in product innovation, which could be applied to other sites that give users a safe place to express themselves and find supportive communities.</p>
<p>There’s a time and place for Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and other ad-supported apps, but there’s also a clear need and want for online spaces that aren’t driven by revenue. It doesn’t have to be one or the other, and we can work together to make room for both.</p>
<p>With TrevorSpace, for example, we’ve invested in research to better understand our users’ wants and needs, without the added pressure of meeting specific revenue goals. Through this research, we’ve learned that our users look to the internet to explore their identities and value having a safe space where they can express themselves.</p>
<h2>What if we used AI for good?</h2>
<p>Beyond investing in more nonprofit social media platforms, there’s also an opportunity for tech companies to apply their leading-edge AI developments to improve the user experience on social media and alleviate some of the mental health stressors caused by spending too much time online.</p>
<p>Social media sites currently use machine learning to inform algorithms that encourage people to spend more time online, but its possibilities extend far beyond that. We know that technology has the power to support people’s mental health instead of exacerbating mental illness, so what if we used AI to give users newfound control over social media?</p>
<p>Imagine if AI could help people find what they really need in a given moment &#8212; like guiding users to content that makes them laugh when they want to laugh or cry when they want to cry, facilitating connections between like-minded users that build positive relationships, or suggesting resources that give them skills or knowledge that positively impact their life.</p>
<p>The majority of social media apps today use AI to determine our feeds, “for you” pages and timelines for us. However, if we instead used AI to let people guide their own journeys on social media, we could foster a fundamentally different emotional experience — one that supported their wants and needs instead of simply monopolizing their time and attention.</p>
<p>This sounds like a no-brainer, and some may even believe this is already happening. However, as recently bolstered by former Facebook product manager Frances Haugen’s testimony, this is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/10/tech/facebook-whistleblower-algorithms-fix/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simply not</a> how the content we see is curated in the current hands of social media leaders. That must change.</p>
<p>Thanks to unprecedented innovations and research in social media, we have the technology needed to create sites that are conducive to our well-being; it’s just a matter of investing time and resources in developing them and creating space for nonprofit apps to coexist with major ad-supported apps.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I see the potential for social media companies to partner with nonprofit companies to develop AI that gives users control over the content they see and how they interact with it, but it would take major time, investment and collaboration from both parties. It would also require social media giants to be OK with making room for much-needed alternative apps in the space.</p>
<p>Making social media safer and healthier for all people is a goal that many nonprofits, including The Trevor Project, are dedicated to realizing, and we would greatly benefit from social media companies’ help making it happen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The fees investment banks charge to underwrite IPOs can gobble several points from a public company’s gross proceeds, but new competition is giving some firms a chance to hold on to more of that sweet debut money.</p>
<p>This week, Nubank paid just 1.6% of the $2.6 billion it raised to its underwriters. As Bloomberg reported, “among 490 IPOs in the U.S. so far this year, only three paid a smaller percentage.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/are-nubanks-low-ipo-fees-a-sign-of-the-times/">In this morning’s edition of The Exchange</a>, Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm compared Nubank’s savings to DoorDash, which didn’t set aside <strong>any</strong> shares for underwriters in its November 2020 IPO.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249371" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>They found several contributing factors, including increased global competition, a desire to attract more retail investors and, yes, SPACs.</p>
<p>This is indubitably “good news for startups” as stock exchanges in different time zones offer more places where startups can list (or double-list) their shares, write Alex and Anna.</p>
<p>“Could it also be a sign of some of the changes we are planning to track in 2022?”</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 2021 H-1B lottery process has been quite a rollercoaster!</strong></p>
<p><strong>We sponsored several people in this year’s lottery. One of our registrants was selected in the first round in March, but none were selected in the second round in July.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We just found out another of our registrants was selected in November; however, he’s from South Africa and restricted from traveling to the U.S. due to omicron.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What should we do? Any suggestions for what to do about our other prospective hires who didn’t get selected?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Eager Employer</strong></p>

<p>Founded 16 years ago, Reddit has raised $1.3 billion, boosting the company to a $10 billion valuation. This week, the user-generated community revealed that it had filed confidentially to go public.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“You know what that means,” wrote Alex Wilhelm. “It’s time to ask questions.”</p>
<p>While he awaits its S-1 with a sharpened scalpel, Alex shared initial questions about the social hub’s operations, specifically:</p>
<p>“We’re curious about content moderation costs, product expansion, the company’s revenue mix, how frequently governments come up in the filing, and what the unicorn has to say about crypto.”</p>

<p>In “New Kids on the Launch Block,” a panel at TC Sessions: Space 2021, Darrell Etherington spoke to three rocket makers to learn more about the factors making commercial space launches less expensive and more competitive:</p>

<li>Lauren Lyons, COO, Firefly Aerospace</li>
<li>Benjamin Lyon, Chief Engineer &amp; EVP Engineering, Astra</li>
<li>Max Haot, founder and CEO, Launcher</li>
</ul>
<p>“One common theme that quickly emerged was that vertical integration is a key driver of success in the rocket business is driving down costs, especially with smaller capacity launch vehicles,” writes Darrell.</p>

<p>A report by RockHealth.org found that 2021 has been the best fundraising year to date for digital health startups.</p>
<p>Fueled in large part by an explosion in demand for mental health services and the expansion of telehealth during the pandemic, more investors are hunting for founders who can creditably lower costs and create efficiencies in a notoriously ramshackle industry.</p>
<p>Regardless, “proving out a financially substantiated ROI case requires a combination of time and data, and digital health is no exception,” writes Alyssa Jaffee, a partner at digital health-focused VC firm 7wireVentures.</p>

<p>The space industry is seeing unprecedented levels of private investment — and exits — as several companies scale up their operations.</p>
<p>In a TC Sessions: Space 2021 panel titled “Backing the Brightest,” Darrell Etherington reviewed activity over the last year and looked ahead to 2022 with three investors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tess Hatch, partner, Bessemer Venture Partners</li>
<li>Shaun Maguire, partner, Sequoia</li>
<li>Lisa Rich, managing partner, Hemisphere Ventures</li>

<p>Launching a startup is inherently risky, but scaling up a company to succeed where others have failed spectacularly is a very bold move.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based Ample is partnering with companies that manage EV fleets to swap its modular battery packs in and out of their vehicles.</p>
<p>“Fourteen years ago, Better Place raised nearly a billion dollars to do what Ample’s doing, and it ended up declaring bankruptcy,” reports Rebecca Bellan.</p>
<p>In an extended interview with co-founder John de Souza, she asked about the company’s go-to-market strategy, its culture and why he’s certain Ample will succeed where others did not.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The economics and operations work very well because you don’t need a large number at a single station to break even. With a small fleet, you’d have it at max 20 cars and it will break even. That’s what makes it so attractive. You don’t need to deploy the stations until you have a customer.”</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A security researcher says an internet gateway used by hundreds of hotels to offer and manage their guest Wi-Fi networks has vulnerabilities that could put the personal information of their guests at risk.</p>
<p>Etizaz Mohsin told TechCrunch that the Airangel HSMX Gateway contains hardcoded passwords that are &#8220;extremely easy to guess.&#8221; With those passwords, which we are not publishing, an attacker could remotely gain access to the gateway&#8217;s settings and databases, which store records about the guest&#8217;s using the Wi-Fi. With that access, an attacker could access and exfiltrate guest records, or reconfigure the gateway&#8217;s networking settings to unwittingly redirect guests to malicious webpages, he said.</p>
<p>Back in 2018, Mohsin discovered one of these gateways on the network of a hotel where he was staying. He found that the gateway was synchronizing files from another server across the internet, which Mohsin said contained hundreds of gateway backup files from some of the most prestigious and expensive hotels in the world. The server also stored &#8220;millions&#8221; of guest names, email addresses and arrival and departure dates, he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249542" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Mohsin reported the bug and the server was secured, but that sparked a thought: Could this one gateway have other vulnerabilities that could put hundreds of other hotels at risk?</p>
<p>In the end, the security researcher found five vulnerabilities that he said could compromise the gateway — including guests&#8217; information. One screenshot he shared with TechCrunch showed the administration interface of one hotel&#8217;s vulnerable gateway revealing the guest&#8217;s name, room number and email address.</p>
<p>Mohsin reported the newly discovered cache of flaws to Airangel, but months passed and the U.K.-based networking gear maker still has not fixed the bugs. A representative told Mohsin that the company hasn&#8217;t sold the device since 2018 and was no longer supported.</p>
<p>But Mohsin said the device is still widely used by hotels, malls and convention centers around the world. Internet scans show more than 600 gateways are accessible from the internet alone, though the true number of vulnerable devices is likely to be higher. Most of the affected hotels are in the U.K., Germany, Russia and across the Middle East, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the level of access that this chain of vulnerabilities offers to attackers, there is seemingly no limit to what they could do,&#8221; Mohsin told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Mohsin presented his findings at the @Hack conference in Saudi Arabia last month. Airangel did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The rapid expansion of the commercial space industry over the last couple of years has led early-stage investors to consider very different types of companies than they did when space startups were a novelty.</p>
<p>The availability of more affordable rides to space, the maturity of ground infrastructure and improvements to accessibility and usability of earth observation data have combined to position entirely new breeds of space-related ventures as ripe for high-risk, high-growth investment.</p>
<p>At TC Sessions: Space 2021, we hosted &#8220;Being There When Stars Form,&#8221; a panel discussion with three early-stage investors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chad Anderson, founder and managing partner, Space Capital</li>
<li>Jessica Robinson, co-founder and partner, Assembly Ventures</li>
<li>Jonathan Fentzke, managing director, Techstars</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the topic, we talked about SPACs and also focused on areas that are piquing the interest of people who are placing bets on new and emerging space-related tech companies. Something everyone shared an interest in was infrastructure, including sustainable on-orbit operations and collision-avoidance, as well as applications being developed using in-space assets that are already in operation.</p>
<p>Find highlights from our conversation below, or scroll to the bottom for a video with the entire chat.</p>
<p><strong>Chad Anderson</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The last 10 years have been transformative for space; we&#8217;ve gone from a handful of defense contractors and a few monolithic satellites in orbit, to suddenly tons of participation by 1,600 space companies, raising a lot of capital over the last 10 years and deploying a lot of satellites. SpaceX and Starlink have launched quite a few satellites this year, as they roll out their beta version of Starlink and going into commercial production next year. And from 2020 to 2021, we&#8217;ve seen a massive uptick in the number of satellites launched. So we have tons more commercial activity that&#8217;s happening in space and no doubt, there&#8217;s 100 times more debris in orbit. So getting our arms around that is a key focus area for governments and commercial companies.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Jessica Robinson</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The things that are most exciting to us, regardless of whether they&#8217;re here on Earth, or in space, are certainly around data. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll talk a lot about that today. I think the continued opportunities and applications of AI and machine learning are particularly applicable here as well, given that you don&#8217;t want to downlink things that you don&#8217;t have to. And I think robotics is another area that for us as investors translates well, certainly there are considerations in the space environment.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Foursquare’s heyday is long over, but the problem of finding cool local stuff to do lives on. Most people seem to make it work through a sometimes reluctant combination of Facebook or Instagram and word of mouth, but the reality is that there aren’t many good apps that help us get off of apps and out into the world. For Go Disco, that’s the priority.</p>
<p>“On the simplest level, it’s an app to get you offline, together with people that you care about more,” Go Disco co-founder Sean Conrad told TechCrunch. Go Disco is an event recommendation engine, but Conrad sees the app also as a philosophical antidote to social networks that juice engagement to keep users plugged in.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; The crazy duality or irony here is the more tech has been applied to things like medicine, logistics, transportation, it&#8217;s literally like miracles. It&#8217;s saving lives and making the world more efficient,&#8221; Conrad said. “But there&#8217;s this evil side, which is the markets applied to our social lives. Despite this magical, personally vigorous device in our pocket, it&#8217;s like a nightmare for our social lives.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249496" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The app was founded by Conrad, a consumer app developer, and Jesse Berns, a data scientist. It launches today for iOS, with an Android version on the schedule for mid next year. At launch, Go Disco will only surface cool stuff to do in Los Angeles, but it plans to quickly expand to New York, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Miami, Portland and Austin in 2022.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EnPgcybI2bM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Go Disco searches and sorts local events with a combined approach, blending automated systems that pull public events info with a human-powered editorial team that can find community-specific and more underground happenings that might not show up elsewhere.</p>
<p>The company’s events aggregation tech combs through public event listings and sorts things based on relevant terms, which are then paired with terms from a list of 65 interests. When people sign up for the app, they endorse interests from the list, from stuff like rock climbing and books to the LGBTQ community and activism.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Conrad emphasized the importance of human touch in Go Disco’s recommendations, noting that it’s also a way for the app to be sure the recommendations are inclusive and thoughtful. It’s also meant to make the app’s recommendations more personalized and community-focused than a catch-all events calendar that puts the decision making burden on the user.</p>
<p>For Go Disco, less is more. Rather than being a comprehensive guide to everything happening in your corner of the city, the app aims to serve you a small selection of the stuff it thinks you’ll enjoy most. “We don’t need to have everything&#8230; we just need to show people three or five perfect niche things,” Conrad said. ”The perfect app is you pull it up, the thing you want to do is right there and you&#8217;re done.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first version of the app launches today, but the team has plans in the works to deepen the experience by building in a social layer. By March of next year, Go Disco plans to add a way for users to communicate about upcoming events with each other in threaded replies on the app, though for now they’ll need to settle for normal sharing and calendar features.</p>
<p>With an added social layer, Go Disco aspires to get people out of the kind of arduous text threads that they might use to coordinate with groups of friends and into something purpose-built to connect people to events around them. With event-specific conversations, you can pop in and out of what’s relevant without needing to track back in an endless, disorganized group text.</p>
<p>“You know, I&#8217;ve got my rock climbing friends and my foodie friends and my live music friends. Some of them overlap, some of them don&#8217;t, but I don&#8217;t want three extremely noisy text threads on this,” Conrad said. “I would like the ability to engage with those friend groups and stay connected to them. But I also don&#8217;t want to go to every single live music event that all my live music friends want to go to.”</p>
<p>Go Disco is still early days, but it has some ideas about how it would and wouldn’t like to make money. The app won’t sell user data and would prefer to take a cut of ticket sales or charge dedicated users for premium features. Conrad emphasizes that Go Disco would want to be thoughtful if it implemented promoted events, since the whole project depends on thoughtful curation. Keeping the signal to noise ratio healthy is key, as is a focus on connecting people in real life — ideally to make them happier.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s very sad and frightening to imagine having kids growing up in a fake world created by Mark Zuckerberg that&#8217;s like basically an amplification of weird algorithms built to make us fight with each other,” Conrad said. “&#8230;. What we thought about a lot was empathy can mitigate a lot of this and we believe very strongly that being together is like the forcing function for empathy.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Advertising tends to work in hype cycles. Native ads, mobile targeting, social media — over the past decade, all of these channels have been touted as the long-sought miracle for marketers and advertisers to break through the noise.</p>
<p>Now, with at least one connected TV (CTV) in <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/353799/study-80-of-us-ctv-viewers-watch-ad-supported.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80% of U.S. households</a>, advertisers are ready to realign their hopes once more.</p>
<p>With seemingly high-quality content and a large reach, CTV — often powered by Google Chrome, Roku, Apple TV or other devices — seems like a good ad bet on its face. And with the looming possible obsolescence of third-party cookies triggering panic over ad targeting on desktop and mobile, CTV offers attractive inventory. But there may be a big downside for those not willing to perform due diligence: It can be easy to fall victim to bad actors exploiting the hype CTV is currently experiencing.</p>
<p>For ad buyers — especially those at startups and more agile organizations — CTV can be a viable and powerful channel to add to your advertising mix. But first, it’s imperative to know that CTV advertising can carry unique risks. Don’t get carried away by the hype, or taken advantage of by frauds. Investing the time and resources to get CTV advertising right before committing further is a smart strategy.</p>
<h2>Knowing the risks of CTV environments</h2>
<p>CTV can reach new and niche audiences, but transparency can be challenging. CTV ads don’t provide the technical visibility of ads on desktop and mobile — often, there’s no client-side tracking of when an ad is served.</p>
<p>This lack of transparency is just one of the risks uneducated CTV ad buying can bring. To get a more complete picture of the problem, we need to examine both the business and technical factors that make CTV unique:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High costs attract fraud. </strong>CTV inventory carries a higher price in cost per thousand impressions (CPM) than many other types of advertising. Fraudsters gravitate toward high CPM because it can maximize their return. If paired with a vulnerable ad ecosystem, there’s potential for big profits with little effort — a perfect recipe for opportunists and bad actors.</li>
<li><strong>Scarcity drives low standards.</strong> CTV video inventory is inherently scarce. Making more requires building more CTV channels and either producing or licensing content. Under these conditions, a domino effect occurs. Ad platforms and networks become overeager to source enough inventory to keep business humming, leading to lax supply standards.<br />

<p>If you can&#8217;t read a good book without stopping every few pages to tweet about it, you might be what we call Extremely Online. You unabashedly distinguish between real life and digital life by using phrases like IRL versus URL, you disabled the Screen Time app on your iPhone because you don&#8217;t need that kind of judgement. Maybe you&#8217;re so online that it&#8217;s your job to write about social media, and even when you&#8217;re not working, you&#8217;re still thinking about the vice grip that Meta has on your life. Okay, that last one hit a bit too close to home.</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re someone who would gladly read a dissertation on what the <a href="https://twitter.com/steak_umm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steak-umms Twitter account</a> means for digital advertising strategy, I&#8217;ve got bad news for you &#8212; that gold mine doesn&#8217;t exist yet. Still, some great writers &#8212; from inside Silicon Valley and from firmly outside of it, through fiction and non-fiction &#8212; can bring us offline to teach us about tech culture. Here are some relatively recent books that confront everything from the rise of TikTok to a fictional metaverse gone wrong.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234897" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<h2>&#8220;Several People Are Typing&#8221; by Calvin Kasulke</h2>

<p>Here are the basic facts: book told exclusively through Slack messages, antagonistic Slackbot inhabits human&#8217;s body, human gets trapped in Slack, all his co-workers think it&#8217;s just a really elaborate bit, chaos ensues.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read this book twice this year, once as an e-book (yes, it really is just a bunch of Slack messages, no other exposition), and once as an audiobook, which features an ensemble cast performing as all the various Slack chatters. Both were lovely experiences. You might see &#8220;Slack book&#8221; and think it&#8217;s just a belabored treatise on how ~capitalism and the corporate world are eating us alive!~. This definitely isn&#8217;t a pro-capitalist book, but even as it tackles serious themes about our generation&#8217;s complete inability to understand how to create a work-life balance, it never feels overwrought, since it&#8217;s just so hilarious and absurd. Do you know how weird it looks to (1) read a book on the Philly bus and (2) laugh out loud at the book you are reading on the Philly bus? This book did that to me.</p>

<h2>&#8220;Uncanny Valley&#8221; by Anna Wiener</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2248512" style="width: 453px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248512" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2248512 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Uncanny-Valley.jpg?w=443" alt="" width="443" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Uncanny-Valley.jpg 515w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Uncanny-Valley.jpg?resize=98,150 98w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Uncanny-Valley.jpg?resize=195,300 195w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Uncanny-Valley.jpg?resize=443,680 443w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Uncanny-Valley.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248512" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MCD</p></div></p>
<p>When this buzzworthy memoir about working in Silicon Valley came out last year, I deliberately chose not to read it, even though Goodreads kept telling me I would like it (semi-related: startup founders trying to &#8220;disrupt Goodreads&#8221; &#8212; I see you, and I appreciate you). I felt like I didn&#8217;t need a book to tell me something I already know: that startup culture can be toxic and misogynistic and that tech companies own too much of our data, because yes, we know that Browser A is better privacy-wise than Browser B, but what about all of our customized bookmarks and plugins? Even though none of these revelations were particularly shocking, Wiener&#8217;s perspective on the tech world as a non-technical startup employee was a reprieve from the corporate jargon that litters my inbox every day.</p>
<p>But the book isn&#8217;t so much about what it&#8217;s like to work in the Valley as it is about the experience of being a 20-something who just wants to work an innocuous, creative job that doesn&#8217;t hurt people, only to be seduced by the lucrative paychecks of the tech world, which may or may not hurt people. Wiener&#8217;s memoir begins as she slogs through a publishing gig in New York City, struggling to make ends meet while her bosses are taking lunch meetings at upscale bars and wearing designer clothes to the office. But you can&#8217;t blame her for abandoning her artsy college friends to move to the Bay and learn what MAUs are. It becomes clear to Wiener that it&#8217;s seemingly impossible to make it in fields like publishing or arts administration if your parents aren&#8217;t paying your rent. So what&#8217;s more evil: a corporate world that promises creative fulfillment and instead delivers inescapable student loan debt, or one that is wreaking havoc on the Bay Area and pushing longtime residents out of their homes but at least pays its workers well?</p>
<p>So, I guess the book didn&#8217;t really teach me anything new &#8212; there&#8217;s no ethical consumption under global capitalism, blah blah, we&#8217;re all complicit, et. al. But it&#8217;s at least nice to know you&#8217;re not the only one having an existential crisis about these things, I guess? Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m fine.</p>

<h2>&#8220;No One Is Talking About This&#8221; by Patricia Lockwood</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2248506" style="width: 442px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248506" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2248506 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/No-one-is-talking.jpg?w=432" alt="" width="432" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/No-one-is-talking.jpg 503w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/No-one-is-talking.jpg?resize=95,150 95w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/No-one-is-talking.jpg?resize=191,300 191w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/No-one-is-talking.jpg?resize=432,680 432w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/No-one-is-talking.jpg?resize=32,50 32w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248506" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Riverhead Books</p></div></p>
<p>A nameless protagonist goes viral for posting, &#8220;can a dog be twins?&#8221; Of course, she becomes famous on the internet. It&#8217;s good content.</p>
<p>The first half of the book is told in post-ironic, somewhat nihilistic online-speak that feels mind-numbing. It&#8217;s the novelistic embodiment of doomscrolling. But when tragedy strikes close to home, the narrator is suddenly unconcerned with what&#8217;s going on in &#8220;the portal,&#8221; which is basically Twitter. Like &#8220;Several People Are Typing,&#8221; &#8220;No One Is Talking About This&#8221; is eerie in its mimicry of how Extremely Online people actually experience the internet. You&#8217;re sucked in, until suddenly, you&#8217;re not.</p>

<h2>&#8220;A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor&#8221; by Hank Green</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2248502" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248502" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2248502 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a-beautifully-foolish.jpg?w=450" alt="" width="450" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a-beautifully-foolish.jpg 523w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a-beautifully-foolish.jpg?resize=99,150 99w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a-beautifully-foolish.jpg?resize=198,300 198w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a-beautifully-foolish.jpg?resize=450,680 450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a-beautifully-foolish.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248502" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dutton</p></div></p>
<p>Hank Green was one of the first YouTube stars, going on to found the YouTube conference VidCon and a bunch of other companies, like a <a href="http://awesomesocks.club" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charity sock subscription</a> and an <a href="https://complexly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">educational video company</a>. He&#8217;s also <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hankgreen1?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weirdly popular</a> on TikTok, so if anyone knows how the internet can change your life, it&#8217;s Hank, the enthusiastic nerd who <a href="https://thecrashcourse.com/courses/chemistry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probably taught you chemistry</a> in high school.</p>
<p>Anyway, Green&#8217;s online footprint is relevant because his duology of &#8220;An Absolutely Remarkable Thing&#8221; and &#8220;A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor&#8221; is all about the internet (yes, the book I am recommending you is a sequel, which means you have to read two whole books). The first book chronicles (minor spoiler alert?) an overconfident 20-something&#8217;s rapid rise to global fame as she goes viral for unwittingly making first contact with aliens. April May, this struggling recent grad-turned-superstar, must reckon with what it&#8217;s like to go viral overnight &#8212; and now, in part thanks to TikTok, this experience is more relatable than ever.</p>
<p>But the second book, rather than the first, is highlighted on this list, because that was the story I couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about when Mark Zuckerberg unveiled Facebook/Meta&#8217;s plans for the Metaverse (it also might be relevant that I weirdly haven&#8217;t read &#8220;Ready Player One&#8221;). In the second book, April and her friends try to take down a wealthy tech founder whose virtual reality platform is a front for far more nefarious plans.</p>
<p>In one section of the book, Andy sinks deep into the VR &#8220;Altus Space,&#8221; where a leaderboard tracks which user can make the most money by selling goods in the space&#8217;s digital currency. The top 50 people on the leaderboard are promised an earth-shattering, &#8220;premium&#8221; experience. Andy climbs the ranks by adding value to the community, but he&#8217;s thwarted by celebrities who sell limited edition virtual trinkets in a last-ditch effort to win the contest. Without ever mentioning crypto, NFTs or DAOs, Green reminds us that the decentralized internet is not inherently utopian. As Andy&#8217;s girlfriend points out, since when has capitalism been a meritocracy?</p>

<h2>&#8220;Bad Blood:  Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup&#8221; by John Carreyrou</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2248505" style="width: 461px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248505" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2248505 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bad-blood-1.jpg?w=451" alt="" width="451" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bad-blood-1.jpg 524w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bad-blood-1.jpg?resize=99,150 99w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bad-blood-1.jpg?resize=199,300 199w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bad-blood-1.jpg?resize=451,680 451w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bad-blood-1.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248505" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Knopf</p></div></p>
<p>Every book on this list was published in 2020 or later, but &#8220;Bad Blood,&#8221; released in 2018, is the exception. Over three years since the non-fiction book was published, Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes is now being tried for criminal fraud, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-testifies-in-her-own-criminal-trial/">things are getting spicy</a>. So, if you&#8217;re Extremely Online, you&#8217;re probably going to hear about Elizabeth Holmes and her tiny vials of blood.</p>
<p>An investigative reporter at the Wall Street Journal, John Carreyrou published <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an exposé</a> in 2015 revealing that Theranos, valued at $9 billion, didn&#8217;t actually produce accurate results through its blood testing technology. &#8220;Bad Blood&#8221; reveals how Carreyrou reported the story, including details from his research that didn&#8217;t make his original articles. Whether you&#8217;re eagerly watching Holmes&#8217; trial unfold or you&#8217;ve never heard of Theranos, &#8220;Bad Blood&#8221; is a must-read for anyone interested in (or nervous about) the pitfalls of Silicon Valley culture. It&#8217;s almost too fascinating and horrific to be real.</p>

<h2>&#8220;The Atmospherians&#8221; by Alex McElroy</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2248503" style="width: 458px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248503" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2248503 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/atmospherians.jpg?w=448" alt="" width="448" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/atmospherians.jpg 520w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/atmospherians.jpg?resize=99,150 99w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/atmospherians.jpg?resize=197,300 197w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/atmospherians.jpg?resize=448,680 448w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/atmospherians.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248503" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Atria Books</p></div></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another fiction selection, but this one comes screeching with trigger warnings: eating disorders, suicide, cults, you name it. But it&#8217;s also worth noting that Alex McElroy approaches these sensitive topics responsibly, even writing <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/07/eating-disorders-art-romanticize/619365/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an essay in The Atlantic</a> about how to broach eating disorder narratives without tacitly providing readers with instructions on how to mimic dangerous behaviors. In the case of this novel, McElroy addresses a character&#8217;s eating disorder by showing how his friends react to his suffering, rather than chronicling his exact symptoms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Atmospherians&#8221; is so Extremely Online enough that its book cover is literally Instagram, but much of the book takes place in the woods. After a beauty influencer gets &#8220;cancelled&#8221; on social media, she starts a cult with her childhood best friend, where they attempt to reform &#8220;bad men,&#8221; teaching them to unlearn the behaviors of toxic masculinity. But maybe the most online moment is when the narrator is offered a lucrative contract to be the spokesperson for a product that wants to change social media by asking people, &#8220;are you sure you want to post that?&#8221; before they say something that might offend people. It&#8217;s not too far off from real-world warnings that exist on Twitter and Instagram.</p>

<h2>&#8220;Press Reset: Ruin and Recovery in the Video Game Industry &#8221; by Jason Schreier</h2>

<p>If you&#8217;re Extremely Online in that you play a lot of video games, you&#8217;ve probably heard about how the gaming giant Activision Blizzard, which produces games like Candy Crush, Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, is facing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/blizzard-sec-investigation/">SEC investigations</a> and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/activision-blizzard-ceo-might-step-154146773.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexual harassment scandals</a>. But Jason Schreier&#8217;s reporting reveals that this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to problems in the video game industry.</p>
<p>The start of the book can feel a bit depressing as Schreier recounts numerous stories of game studios closing without notice, developers struggling between jobs and staff being poorly compensated for 70-hour work weeks. But the book&#8217;s subtitle delivers on its promise to chronicle not just ruin, but also, recovery! Ultimately, Schreier creates a hopeful narrative. You&#8217;ll never look at Bioshock Infinite the same way after learning how bad things got behind the scenes, but Schreier shows how independent studios, unionized teams and outsourcing studios like <a href="https://www.disbelief.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disbelief</a> can help solve the toxicity of the video game industry.</p>

<p>I knew that the definitive pandemic-era work from home book was coming, but I&#8217;m glad it was written by Charlie Warzel, who writes the Extremely Online <a href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galaxy Brain</a> newsletter, and Anne Helen Petersen, author of that viral &#8220;millennial burnout&#8221; <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a>-turned-<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Even-Millennials-Burnout-Generation/dp/0358315077" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book</a>. Thankfully, Warzel and Petersen&#8217;s book is less about ~these unprecedented times~ and more about how the culture shift of the pandemic can maybe be an opportunity to solve issues that have existed in the corporate world since before we wore masks every day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Capitalism is inherently exploitative, but it is also &#8212; at least for the immediate future &#8212; our guiding economic system,&#8221; the pair writes. &#8220;If we’re going to live under it, how can we bend it to make that experience involve less suffering?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of Office&#8221; focuses more on &#8220;knowledge workers&#8221; than, let&#8217;s say, an Amazon fulfillment center employee. But, bonus recommendation if you&#8217;re itching to get radicalized about awful capitalism: &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clock-Low-Wage-Drives-America-Insane/dp/0316509000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On the Clock</a>: What Low-Wage Work Did to Me and How It Drives America Insane&#8221; by Emily Guendelsberger.

<p>This comprehensive history of TikTok&#8217;s rise to social dominance begins as the author, a tech journalist who also wrote a book about YouTube, attends a panel at VidCon. It&#8217;s February 2019. The British writer remembers of the time, &#8220;I know that TikTok is popular, but only in the way that people outside of the U.S. know that the NFL pays astronomical salaries without ever getting a grip on it, or comprehending why anyone would care about it.&#8221; How quickly things changed for us all. Now, with over 1 billion monthly active users, TikTok feels like something that&#8217;s always existed, yet its prevalence is still relatively new. Trillion-dollar companies like Meta look at TikTok like the popular kid who just transferred schools and threatens to upend its seemingly impenetrable social dominance. How did this happen, and with a Chinese app nonetheless, in a time when Western xenophobia is horrifyingly rampant? Stokel-Walker picks apart just how TikTok rose to prominence, charting its impact on the creator economy, Silicon Valley, geopolitics and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is preparing to launch a new service that will turn its viral food videos into meals you can actually order and enjoy. The social app is partnering with <a href="https://www.virtualdiningconcepts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virtual Dining Concepts</a> and Grubhub to launch &#8220;TikTok Kitchen&#8221;-branded delivery-only restaurants across the United States next year, as first reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-17/tiktok-viral-food-recipes-like-feta-pasta-available-in-virtual-restaurant-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>. The menu at the restaurants will draw upon the most popular viral food posts on TikTok, which people can then have delivered to their door via Grubhub. TikTok plans to launch around 300 locations that will start delivering dishes in March, with plans to open more than 1,000 restaurants by the end of next year.</p>
<p>The initial menu will include top TikTok viral dishes like baked feta pasta, a smash burger, corn ribs and pasta chips. The baked feta, in particular, gained incredible traction in 2021 as Google reported it was the most-searched dish of the year after it gained immense popularity on TikTok. Going forward, the menu at the locations will be amended quarterly with new dishes that have started to go viral. It&#8217;s unknown whether TikTok will choose to make some popular dishes, like the baked feta pasta, permanent offerings on the menu.</p>
<p>TikTok confirmed to TechCrunch that creators will be receiving credit for dishes within the menu and will be featured prominently throughout the partnership.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249305" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Proceeds from TikTok Kitchen sales will go to both support the creators who inspired the menu item and to encourage and assist other creators to express themselves on the platform in keeping with TikTok’s mission to inspire creativity and bring joy to its users,&#8221; TikTok said.</p>
<p>The company clarified, however, that this was more of a campaign to bring TikTok food to fans, and not TikTok&#8217;s venturing into the restaurant business. That means the company likely sees this as more of a marketing effort, rather than a long-term business. TikTok didn&#8217;t say how long this &#8220;campaign&#8221; will run, or provide other details about the ordering process, or how the menu items will be selected and refreshed.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018, Virtual Dining Concepts runs several delivery-only ghost restaurants and has partnered with many notable individuals, including YouTube celebrity MrBeast (who runs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MrBeast_Burger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his own virtual restaurant business</a>, <a href="https://mrbeastburger.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MrBeast Burger</a>), Guy Fieri, Steve Harvey, Mariah Carey, Tyga and others. The company also has a partnership with Barstool Sports. In October, Virtual Dining Concepts <a href="https://www.nrn.com/delivery-takeout-solutions/virtual-dining-concepts-raises-20-million-series-financing-facilitate-its" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised</a> $20 million in Series A funding, saying it planned to use the investment to fund additional technology, enhance corporate infrastructure and provide additional marketing and customer support.</p>
<p>TikTok is widely known for popular food trends and is home to many viral recipes that are often reshared on other social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. The short-form video app&#8217;s latest partnership indicates that the company is looking to take advantage of this popularity to raise the profile of its brand and those of its creators who are fueling the food content on its app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><em>Update: The article was updated to include information about TikTok&#8217;s partnership with Grubhub.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A proliferation of ominous, non-specific rumors on TikTok and other social platforms suggested that schools across the U.S. faced threats of violence on Friday, December 17. While a number of schools responded to the trend by closing their doors, many local law enforcement agencies and at least one federal one have weighed in, disclosing that the threat doesn’t appear to be substantiated.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security noted that it is aware of reports of a possible threat to schools though did not find any “specific, credible threats.” Still, the agency encouraged that “communities remain alert.”</p>

<p>TikTok first <a href="https://twitter.com/TikTokComms/status/1471572096111239175">noted the viral rumor on Thursday</a>, stating that it was communicating with law enforcement but had “not found evidence of such threats originating or spreading via TikTok.” While it’s true that the threat itself is nowhere to be found on TikTok, posts spreading fear around the possibility of violence on December 17 abound and likely account for the viral rumor’s swift nationwide spread.</p>
<p>“I luv you guys pls stay safe on dec 17,” one post under a related TikTok hashtag stated. In the comments, the video’s creator explained that “Ok so for everyone confused there’s shooting [threats] and bombing threats on dec 17 in schools in the usa my school was threatened 2 times.” Followers chimed in with stories of recent bomb threat scares in their own schools.</p>
<p>TikTok revisited the situation Friday morning, stating that in coordination with the FBI and DHS it was still unable to track down a credible threat that could have kicked off the viral rumors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Around the U.S., school districts and law enforcement addressed the rumors, mostly urging caution while emphasizing that no specific threats have surfaced.

We encourage everyone to remain vigilant and report suspicious activity.”</p>
<p>While the rumors couldn’t be substantiated, schools in a number of states closed their doors Friday, including in <a href="https://gilroyhs.gilroyunified.org/">California</a>, <a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/education/threats-against-kaufman-high-school-prompts-school-closure-friday-texas/287-6c32c971-27d0-4df6-a7e9-5a26fe9fedea">Texas</a>, <a href="https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2021/12/17/social-media-threat-prompts-closure-of-lakeville-area-schools-friday-farmington-to-have-flex-day/">Minnesota</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/no-credible-threats-but-several-ct-schools-to-increase-police-presence-tomorrow/2673703/">Connecticut</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there is plenty of technology out there to help make a building more sustainable, the ability to incorporate features into its design can be easier said than done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter</span><a href="https://www.cove.tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cove.tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that wants to make sure buildings are sustainable by design from the moment of inception. The Atlanta-based startup, which has raised $30 million in a Series B round of funding led by Coatue, claims that in 2021, its software helped design and construction professionals avoid 5x more carbon than Tesla. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert Downey Jr.’s FootPrint Coalition also participated in the financing, along with existing backers Mucker Capital, Urban Us and Knoll Ventures. The round was pre-emptive, according to CEO and co-founder Sandeep Ahuja, and brings the company’s total raised to $36.5 million. While she declined to reveal valuation, she did say it was up “10x” from the company’s $5.7 million raise in November of 2020.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249122" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a B2B SaaS company, cove.tool gives architects and contractors the ability to input the details of a project and its lot and get recommendations for how to optimize for daylighting, HVAC systems, solar and materials, among other things. Powered by machine learning, cove.tool is designed to give architects, engineers and contractors a way to measure a wide range of building performance metrics while reducing construction cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The whole reason why we exist is to reduce the carbon emissions within the building environment because about 40% of all carbon emissions is buildings,” Ahuja told TechCrunch. “The whole goal of cove.tool is to make the process of material selection and building simulation much, much simpler so we can allow people to pick better material alternatives that are not only low carbon, but also cost optimal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cove.tool launched the beta version of its software in August 2017. Today, more than 25,000 projects are being built using cove.tool’s software &#8212; everything from warehouses to data centers to office buildings. The software has more than 15,000 users across 30 countries, including architects, engineers, contractors and building product manufacturers such as HDR, AECOM, Skanska and Stora Enso. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Through streamlined automated analysis that helps architects, engineers, contractors and building product manufacturers use data-driven design, cove.tool is making the built world sustainable and efficient in the fight against climate change,” Ahuja said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impressively, Cove.tool says it has offset 28.5 million tons of carbon this year, the equivalent of planting and growing 450 million trees for 10 years. The startup plans to use its new capital to expand its suite of products, keep adding to its 60-person team and provide carbon reduction analysis for the architecture, engineering and construction industries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahuja said the company’s core competitors are consultants that are performing similar work manually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our differentiator is the ability to democratize access to data and be able to do something in 30 minutes that once took 2-4 weeks,” she added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the company is not yet profitable, it could be if it stopped scaling operations, according to Ahuja.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the months to come, we will further expand our product suite, offering integrations across the AEC ecosystem, making performance data even more accessible. We see that the carbon problem is a data problem,” she told TechCrunch. “By using API frameworks we can significantly simplify the practice of analyzing building data and sharing that data with the many professionals across the building and design process, ultimately, empowering seamless collaboration and improving project outcomes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also plans to scale its sales and marketing efforts within the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and the EU.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert Downey Jr., founder of FootPrint Coalition, noted that the construction and operation of buildings accounts for 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By combining energy efficiency, design and transparency for material selection cove.tool addresses this massive problem,” he wrote via email. “It’s a prime example of a scalable business that employs machine learning and principled leadership to literally build a better future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coatue Partner David Cahn said his firm believes sustainable construction is one of the most important environmental challenges today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cove’s software-driven approach has the potential to make architecture both easier and cleaner,” he wrote via email.</span></p>

A &#8220;social branding&#8221; app for creative teens and twenty-somethings, Tagg is announcing a $2 million seed round today from Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, Facebook’s former VP of International Growth Ed Baker, TripAdvisor founder [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gen Z <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/facebook-files-show-growth-struggles-as-young-users-in-u-s-decline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn&#8217;t satisfied</a> with the social media they grew up with, so they&#8217;re <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/flox-an-app-to-help-friend-groups-meet-each-other-is-wooing-college-students-in-nyc/">building the apps</a> that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/blue-fever-an-anonymous-social-network-acquires-gen-z-founded-trill/">they want to use</a>. A &#8220;social branding&#8221; app for creative teens and twenty-somethings, <a href="https://www.tagg.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tagg</a> is announcing a $2 million seed round today from Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, Facebook’s former VP of International Growth Ed Baker, TripAdvisor founder Stephen Kaufer, Pillar VC and more.</p>
<p>Founded by recent alumni of Brown University and the neighboring Rhode Island School of Design, Tagg is still in private beta with thousands of users, and thousands more on a waitlist. It&#8217;s like a link-in-bio service, but with a social element that encourages young creatives to connect, collaborate and develop friendships.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the digital world, the more authentic your brand, the more genuine your connections. Current social platforms fall short as they were not built for this evolving intersection of branding and connecting,&#8221; the company explains. &#8220;Tagg is building and growing an environment allowing for full creative expression of oneself — no restrictions, no stigma.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249115" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Depending on what you want to use your profile for (you might want a social profile, or you might want to promote your art and network), you can choose from five profile skins when you onboard into the app. From there, you can customize your page, then follow people and post content like you would on any other app. But on Tagg, there&#8217;s no like count on posts, which is an intentional design choice.</p>
<p>&#8220;W<span style="font-weight: 400;">e do not have likes &#8212; just comments, sharing and views &#8212; because we want our creatives focused on being their favorite selves with no stigma,&#8221; co-founder Victor Loolo told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Especially among the Gen Z audience that Tagg is built for, users don&#8217;t always want like counts, since they know it can encourage them to compare themselves to peers in a superficial way. Even U.S. Senators like Ed Markey (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-snap-youtube-hearing-congress/">introduced legislation</a> that would ban like counts for social media users younger than 16, because it might <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/">harm teens&#8217; mental health</a>.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2249150" style="width: 680px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249150" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2249150" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-profile_Wunmi-copy.png?w=670" alt="" width="670" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-profile_Wunmi-copy.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-profile_Wunmi-copy.png?resize=148,150 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-profile_Wunmi-copy.png?resize=296,300 296w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-profile_Wunmi-copy.png?resize=768,780 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-profile_Wunmi-copy.png?resize=670,680 670w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-profile_Wunmi-copy.png?resize=1513,1536 1513w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-profile_Wunmi-copy.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-profile_Wunmi-copy.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-profile_Wunmi-copy.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-profile_Wunmi-copy.png?resize=96,96 96w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2249150" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tagg</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tagg&#8217;s &#8220;social branding&#8221; marketing might seem counter-intuitive at first glance &#8212; the concept of branding might sound like you&#8217;re putting yourself in a box. But by design, Tagg encourages its users to grow out of their comfort zones. Even though users build their profile through using preset skins, these are only suggestions &#8212; if users want to build their profiles from a blank slate and create their own categories to organize their content with, they can do that.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Profiles can look like anything, that’s the beauty of it. We wanted to move away from the traditional, restrictive, cookie-cutter profiles that all social apps have, because as Gen Z-ers, we value freedom of expression and uniqueness a lot,&#8221; Loolo explained. &#8220;We wanted to find a happy, user-friendly medium between a traditional profile and a blank page, which would be challenging for a lot of people, so we went with profile skins.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Tagg was inspired by Loolo&#8217;s own experience as a football player at Brown, where he felt that it was difficult to define himself outside of his identity as a student athlete. That&#8217;s what inspired him to build Tagg, alongside co-founders Blessing Ubani and Sophie Chen.</p>
<p>“People are kind of put into a box. Let’s say I’m a guy who does cooking videos on TikTok &#8212; I’m the cooking video guy. But I might enjoy video games and other stuff,&#8221; Loolo told TechCrunch. &#8220;We wanted to break away from that and allow for these creatives to curate more holistic pictures of themselves.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2249157" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249157" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2249157" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/618ca8cf6e521f841cd10b97_phone-mockup.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="298" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/618ca8cf6e521f841cd10b97_phone-mockup.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/618ca8cf6e521f841cd10b97_phone-mockup.png?resize=150,66 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/618ca8cf6e521f841cd10b97_phone-mockup.png?resize=300,131 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/618ca8cf6e521f841cd10b97_phone-mockup.png?resize=768,337 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/618ca8cf6e521f841cd10b97_phone-mockup.png?resize=680,298 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/618ca8cf6e521f841cd10b97_phone-mockup.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2249157" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tagg</p></div></p>
<p>Tagg users currently earn points by engaging with the platform &#8212; while these points are currently just a vanity feature, Loolo sees this as a potential future for the app.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Tagg is not currently decentralized or tokenized, the principles of our platform mirror web3’s values,&#8221; Loolo said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of our goals is to help our creatives understand that being directly rewarded for their content sharing and community participation is the solution to the issues of creator economy, as opposed to underpaying creator funds and inconsistent brand deals.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>In the future, Tagg could move toward allowing users to earn a coin or token with value. But for now, Tagg is focused on onboarding more users from its waitlist and acquiring more users.</p>
<p>After graduating from college in 2020, the team moved to the Bay Area, where they have continued to work on the app. With its recent funding, the app is hiring to expand its team. Recently, Steven Fang joined Tagg as a CTO and co-founder, bringing 15 years of engineering experience.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Fees on the Nubank IPO were among the lowest of the year. Could it also be a sign of some of the changes we are planning to track in 2022?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fees on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/nubank-hashicorp-provide-startup-market-with-end-of-year-ipo-wins/">Nubank IPO</a> were among the lowest of the year, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-15/goldman-morgan-stanley-citi-split-meager-fees-in-nubank-s-ipo">revealed</a> this week. Of the $2.6 billion the Brazilian fintech&#8217;s parent company, Nu Holdings, raised in the operation, only 1.6% are going to its underwriters, which included Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Among 490 IPOs in the U.S. so far this year, only three paid a smaller percentage,&#8221; Bloomberg noted.</p>
<p>The Brazilian press was <a href="https://oglobo.globo.com/economia/pechincha-em-nova-york-nubank-pagou-menos-que-xp-bancos-para-abrir-capital-nos-eua-25320217">quick to report</a> that Nubank got itself &#8220;a bargain.&#8221; Their term, but it did indeed land a better deal than three other Brazilian fintechs that went public before it did: PagSeguro, which IPO&#8217;d on the New York Stock Exchange in 2018; StoneCo, which <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/buffett-backed-stoneco-sheds-22-billion-in-value-since-peaking">shed a lot of value</a> since its 2018 IPO; and broker XP, which went public in 2019.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>According to Bloomberg, these respectively paid 2.4%, 3.6%, and 4.3% in fees. The difference is also stark in absolute terms, with Nubank set to pay $41.6 million in commissions and discounts, compared to $83.2 million for XP.</p>

Let&#8217;s explore.</p>
<h2>Hot or not</h2>
<p>IPO fees are subject to market dynamics. But it’s not merely the total fee percentage that matters; other elements can also show a company’s market strength viz banks competing for its IPO business.</p>
<p>For example, when DoorDash went public just over a year ago, The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/doordash-aims-to-add-11-billion-to-its-valuation-during-public-offering/">noted that the company</a> had “no shares set aside for its underwriting banks to buy at its IPO price.” Normally, underwriting banks get the option to purchase a block of shares at a company’s final IPO price if they so choose. This gives the banks something akin to an avenue to free profit if the company they are helping take public performs well.</p>
<p>Briefly: If underwriting banks secure access to, say, 5 million shares in an IPO, and the company prices at $20 but opens at $30, the banks can lock in a neat $50 million. Obviously, it’s more complicated than that, but illustrative math can deobfuscate.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">FedEx has received its first five GM-built electric delivery vans out of an order of 500, the company announced. The move represents an important landmark for FedEx in its stated goal to be have an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fed-ex-all-electric-delivery-fleet-2040-182248046.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">all-electric delivery fleet</a> and be carbon neutral around the world by 2040.</p>
<p>&#8220;The delivery of the first BrightDrop EV600s is a historic moment, born out of a spirit of collaboration between two leading American companies,&#8221; said FedEx&#8217;s chief sustainability officer Mitch Jackson. &#8220;[T]ransforming our pickup and delivery fleet to electric vehicles is integral to achieving our ambitious sustainability goals announced earlier this year.&#8221;</p>

<p>FedEx was announced as a key customer for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-brightdrop-ev600-electric-truck-ep1-delivery-business-fedex-153325067.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">Brightdrop EV600 vans</a> and has been <a href="https://www.fedex.com/en-us/sustainability/electric-vehicles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">testing</a> Brightdrop&#8217;s electric EP1 pallets over the last while. GM, which owns Chevrolet and Cadillac, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-brightdrop-ev600-electric-truck-ep1-delivery-business-fedex-153325067.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">spun out</a> the Brightdrop business unit early this year. &#8220;The EV600 combines the best attributes of a traditional and a step-in van into one vehicle, keeping driver safety, comfort, and convenience top of mind,&#8221; said Brightdrop CEO Travis Katz. &#8220;It’s also the fastest built vehicle, from concept to market, in GM’s history.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249254" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The all-wheel-drive EV600 has 600 cubic feet of cargo space and can go up to 250 miles on a charge. Inside, drivers get a security system in the cargo area, auto-locking doors and motion-activated interior lighting. They also benefit from automatic emergency braking and parking assistance. The EP1 is a kind of trolley often found in stores an warehouses, with 23 cubic feet of space and an electric motor that makes it easier to move heavy objects.</p>
<p>The first five EV600s are being delivered to FedEx&#8217;s Express facility in Inglewood, California. To support them FedEx is building charging stations across its network of facilities, including 500 already installed across California. It&#8217;s also working with utility companies to evaluate electrical grid capacity required for its charging infrastructure.</p>
<p>While FedEx has thrown its electric delivery lot in with GM, rival UPS has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-29-ups-arrival-electric-trucks-order-investment.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">ordered</a> 10,000 electric <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/commercial-trucks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">delivery trucks</a> from <a href="https://arrival.com/news/ups-invests-in-arrival-and-orders-10000-generation-2-electric-vehicles" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">UK-based Arrival Ltd</a>.

					<description><![CDATA[The company includes a smart fridge that is stocked with meals and snacks daily, and a mobile app so that office employees can check out the contents whenever they want.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies get employees back into offices, startups like New York-based foodtech company <a href="http://fraiche.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fraîche</a> aims to be the brand feature that welcomes them back.</p>
<p>Today, the company, founded in 2019, announced $2 million in seed funding by backers that included La Boulange’s Pascal Rigo, Petrus Winery’s Jean Moueix, Bakerly’s Bruno and Julien Caron and the Newlab.</p>
<p>Fraîche (pronounced like crème fraîche), aims to bring healthier food items into workplaces. It places an auto-stocking smart fridge inside offices and teams up with eateries, like Le Botaniste, Egg Shop, Pressed and La Fermiere to provide the food. It will also offer its own private label products in the future, Tximista Lizarazu, CEO at Fraîche, told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249137" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>All companies have to do is determine how much they want to subsidize per employee, and Fraîche will stock and refill the fridge every day. Employees can also download an app to access the fridge’s contents.</p>
<p>One of Fraîche’s early investors, Romain Afflelou, co-founder of Cosmo Connected, said he liked the momentum that the company had and how it was leveraging that companies are ready to spend more money on their employees. He typically invests in companies that are connected with the world of tomorrow in terms of how people move, eat and heal.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2249139" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249139" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2249139 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/App-Products.PNG.png?w=314" alt="Fraiche" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/App-Products.PNG.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/App-Products.PNG.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/App-Products.PNG.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/App-Products.PNG.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/App-Products.PNG.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/App-Products.PNG.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/App-Products.PNG.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/App-Products.PNG.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2249139" class="wp-caption-text">Fraîche&#8217;s mobile app. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fraîche</p></div></p>
<p>“Fraîche provides all of the food options at the office, and employees can get more affordable food that is fresh and cleaner,” he added. “You can have meals Monday through Friday inside the same place and get different products each day.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, many office cafeterias shut down during the global pandemic and were unable to staff up when they could reopen, Lizarazu said. Even his own company was not immune to the effects: Fraîche initially lost all of its locations, but saw the tides turn about four months later.</p>
<p>As a result, you might think that with the Omicron variant keeping people at home a little longer, something like Fraîche would not work. However, when asked, Lizarazu said the company just needs to have 30 people in an office to make what they do work. And, if 15% to 20% of offices don’t return ever, he is still optimistic with 80% of the market remaining, he added.</p>
<p>“Companies want to make their offices a better place, want to convince people to come back,  and have more of a budget for health and wellness,” Lizarazu said. “Right now the market is shifting, and we are starting to sell more and move faster. We spent 2020 investing in technology and building the product, and now we are ready to deploy it.”</p>
<p>Though the company has only been operating for a few months, it is already seeing customers using the fridges three to four times a day to get meals and snacks. Lizarazu forecasted that companies would spend $5,000 a month, but is seeing double that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fraîche’s revenue is between $80,000 and $150,000 per machine per year, which includes servicing of the fridge and the food delivery, which he says is equivalent to what New Yorkers currently pay to order out for food and have it delivered, but in this case, with less of the friction.</p>
<p>This latest round gives the company $3 million in total funding. Workplaces including Tikehau Capital, Silverstein Properties, Newlab, Brooklyn Navy Yard, Ardian and Ogury are using Fraîche, and Lizarazu notes three more will open in January.</p>
<p>He expects to use the funding to grow Fraîche’s footprint in New York and to grow its team of eight employees, particularly in sales and marketing. He is hiring two sales reps and plans to have 20 employees overall by the third quarter of 2022. Fraîche has already signed 10 locations since the summer with plans to deploy into 30 locations in the next nine months and then grow to 100 locations by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>“It’s now a question of visibility,” Lizarazu said. “As long as our salespeople are talking to the right customers, we see the market is ready, and offices are really excited about what we are doing.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Within the past two years, Full Harvest’s impact on keeping food out of landfills grew five times, prompting the company to seek out additional capital to keep the momentum going.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Food waste is a <a href="https://www.fao.org/3/i3991e/i3991e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.6 trillion problem globally</a> as some <a href="https://wwf.panda.org/discover/our_focus/food_practice/food_loss_and_waste/driven_to_waste_global_food_loss_on_farms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40% of food is wasted annually</a>. <a href="https://www.fullharvest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Full Harvest</a> believes this is a distribution problem that can be solved by digitizing the produce supply chain.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based company’s produce business-to-business marketplace provides a way for produce buyers and sellers to quickly close deals on surplus or imperfect crops in just a few clicks. It also creates an additional revenue stream for farmers.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO Christine Moseley told TechCrunch that a majority of produce companies are still using pen, paper and fax machines to do business.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248925" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“This is one of the most important industries, and we wanted to automate and bring the industry online to solve things that haven&#8217;t been solved before,” she added. “For example, there is a ton of paperwork involved in buying and selling, but by automating the onboarding process, that process that used to take weeks now take minutes.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Full Harvest wants to fix the big farm food waste problem at source&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/14/full-harvest-is-trying-to-fix-the-big-farm-food-waste-problem/embed/#?secret=Z2FFPYl0Si" data-secret="Z2FFPYl0Si" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So Full Harvest got busy developing some technology that includes a spot marketplace with a matching algorithm and visibility so that buyers could see what suppliers had available. It also created a third-party audit and verification process to provide consistent specifications to reduce the average amount of rescued produce that is turned away. The industry average stands at 10%, while the company’s rejection average is 1% to 2%, Moseley said.</p>
<p>Within the past two years, Full Harvest’s impact on keeping food out of landfills grew five times, prompting the company to seek additional capital to keep the momentum going.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced $23 million in Series B funding. Telus Ventures led the round, with participation from new investors Rethink Impact, Citi Impact, Doon Capital, Stardust Equity and Portfolia Food &amp; AgTech Fund, and existing investors, including Spark Capital, Cultivian Sandbox, Astia Fund and Radicle Growth. As part of the investment, Jay Crone, investment director at Telus, joined Full Harvest’s board of directors.</p>
<p>It’s been a while since we checked in with Full Harvest. We <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/14/full-harvest-is-trying-to-fix-the-big-farm-food-waste-problem/">profiled the company</a> at the beginning of its journey in 2016 and then again in 2017 when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/12/full-harvest-raises-2-million-to-stop-farmers-from-tossing-ugly-fruit-and-veggies/">raised $2 million</a>. The company raised an additional $8.5 million in Series A funding in 2018. Including additional funding, the company now has $34.5 million in total funding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company works with big names in the food and beverage, processor and grower industries, like Danone North America, SVZ and Tanimura &amp; Antle.</p>
<p>“The importance of building more sustainable businesses has never been more evident, especially for those in the food and beverage space,” said Surbhi Martin, vice president of Greek yogurt and functional nutrition for Danone North America. “By sourcing produce online through Full Harvest and selecting fruit for our products that would otherwise have gone to waste, we are answering the growing consumer demand for more sustainable food options.”</p>
<p>Full Harvest’s business model is to take a percentage of every transaction made on its marketplace. Between 2020 and 2021, the company tripled its revenue as it provided transparency into the supply chain, Moseley said. Back in 2018, Full Harvest had about eight employees; that has now grown to 35. The company also expanded geographically, including Canada.</p>
<p>With the new capital, Moseley intends to invest in technology development, triple the size of Full Harvest’s technology and product teams in 2022, continue to expand its footprint in North America and advance its data and market insights offerings, like produce availability, pricing, specifications, sustainable offerings, quality and forecasting support.</p>

<p>Full Harvest is not alone in addressing food waste and raising venture-backed capital for their efforts. Just this year, we’ve seen announcements from companies like:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">TreeDots raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/singapore-based-treedots-gets-11m-series-a-to-cut-food-waste-in-asia/">$11 million in Series A capital</a> for its B2B food surplus marketplace and a social commerce feature for group buying by consumers.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Shelf Engine, working to reduce food waste in grocery stores, brought in a $41 million Series B round in March and then an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/ellen-degeneres-portia-de-rossi-shaun-white-shawn-mendes-get-behind-shelf-engine/">additional $2 million</a> in September.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Food sharing app OLIO brought in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/05/food-sharing-app-olio-raises-43m-series-b-as-the-world-switches-on-to-the-food-waste-crisis/">$43 million in Series B funding</a>.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Apeel, known for its plant-based layer covering fruits and vegetables, brought in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apeel-bites-into-another-250m-funding-round-at-a-2b-valuation-to-accelerate-fresh-food-supply-chains/">$250 million in Series E funding</a>.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Too Good to Go <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apeel-bites-into-another-250m-funding-round-at-a-2b-valuation-to-accelerate-fresh-food-supply-chains/">secured $31.1 million</a> for its marketplace enabling customers to buy food right before it goes to waste.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Martie launched in November with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/martie-launches-with-3m-to-divert-shelf-stable-food-items-from-landfills/">$3 million in seed funding</a> to divert shelf-stable items from landfills.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Imperfect Foods brought in <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/imperfect-foods-secures-95mm-series-d-investment-commitment-301212899.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$95 million in Series D</a> funding for its sustainable grocery delivery.</li>
</ul>
<p>While that list of companies is innovating technology in the produce space, Moseley considers Full Harvest unique in that its expertise is on the sustainable product side and it has proven itself as a leader in digitization of the produce supply chain, putting it ahead of the curve on both fronts.</p>
<p>Up next, the company plans to secure partnerships around logistics technology to scale further and expand on the SKUs it is able to offer.</p>
<p>“We saw significant increase in our technology and user experiences after finishing some automating processes that were previously offline for the industry,” she added. “We also expanded on our spot buy marketplace and hit a big milestone of 50 million pounds sold.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An Indian antitrust watchdog has revoked the approval it had granted for Amazon&#8217;s 2019 investment in a Future Group unit and imposed a fine of about $26.3 million to the American e-commerce giant for concealing facts.</p>
<p>The Competition Commission of India said Amazon, which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/amazon-future-coupons/"> invested in Future Coupons</a> in 2019, &#8220;suppress[ed] the actual scope and purpose of the combination&#8221; and failed to notify some of its commercial arrangements.</p>
<p>Reliance Retail, India’s largest retail chain, said a year ago it had reached an agreement with Future Group to acquire the latter’s retail and wholesaler business, as well as its logistics and warehousing business, for $3.4 billion. (CCI has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/india-approves-reliances-3-4-billion-deal-with-future-group-brings-a-new-headache-to-amazon/">approved the deal between the nation&#8217;s two largest retail chains</a>.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249234" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Things began to get complicated shortly afterwards. Amazon accused Future Group of violating its contract and approached the Singapore arbitrator to halt the deal between the Indian firms, saying it had the right for first investment in Future Group. The matter reached India&#8217;s Supreme Court, which in August <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/india-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-amazon-to-stall-3-4b-future-and-reliance-deal/">ruled in favor of Amazon to stall the deal</a>.</p>
<p>The CCI, which originally approved the deal between Amazon and Future, began reviewing it again following a complaint from Future.</p>
<p>&#8220;The conduct of Amazon in supressing relevant and material documents against the disclosure requirement under Item 8.8 of Form I is a contravention of clause (c) of sub-section (1) of Section 45 of the Act,&#8221; said CCI in a 59-page order on Friday. [H/T <a href="https://twitter.com/adityakalra/status/1471809289253654533" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters journalist Aditya Kalra</a>.]</p>
<p>Amazon, which is required to pay the fine within 60 days, said in a statement that it was reviewing the order.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are reviewing the order passed by the Competition Commission of India, and will decide on next steps in due course,&#8221; a spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The development comes days after Amazon <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/exclusive-amazon-says-india-revoking-future-deal-would-boost-reliance-hurt-2021-12-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned the Indian antitrust body</a> that revoking its 2019 deal with Future Group would send a negative signal to foreign investors and enable Reliance, the owner of India&#8217;s largest retail chain, to &#8220;further restrict competition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Confederation of All India Traders, a lobby group that represents millions of retailers in the South Asian market, said CCI&#8217;s Friday order is &#8220;a landmark order and Amazon stands fully exposed for its mal-practices, and bunch of lies at all levels together with continued violation of laws and the rules.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New <a href="https://adalytics.io/blog/adtech-not-checking-user-tcf-consent">research</a> examining what happens after Internet users in Europe land on an ad-supported website and express their &#8220;privacy choices&#8221; &#8212; using a flagship ad industry consent management platform which is supposed to allow them to control the types of ads they receive (i.e. non-tracking vs &#8220;personalized&#8221;) &#8212; has raised fresh questions over the IAB Europe&#8217;s self-styled Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF).</p>
<p>The TCF is already in hot water with privacy regulators.</p>
<p>Last month the IAB Europe announced that it&#8217;s expecting to be found in breach of the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) &#8212; and that the framework will also be found in breach. Although the IAB sought to suggest that a few tweaks will suffice to fix problems identified by the Belgian data protection authority (DPA).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248716" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We&#8217;re still waiting for publication of the final decision of the Belgian authority. But its preliminary findings &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/iab-europes-ad-tracking-consent-framework-found-to-fail-gdpr-standard/">last year</a> &#8212; highlighted a litany of GDPR failures.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="QitWOz1Fkt"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/iab-europe-tcf-gdpr-breach-belgium/">IAB Europe says it&#8217;s expecting to be found in breach of GDPR</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;IAB Europe says it&#8217;s expecting to be found in breach of GDPR&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/iab-europe-tcf-gdpr-breach-belgium/embed/#?secret=QitWOz1Fkt" data-secret="QitWOz1Fkt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Despite all that, the IAB has continued to argue the TCF is working as intending for the close to 800 adtech vendors who are thought to participate in the system, loudly rejecting criticism of it. Its CEO, Townsend Feehan, for example, pooh-poohed criticism earlier this month &#8212; telling <a href="https://www.engadget.com/europe-tracking-consent-iccl-iab-eu-gdpr-153055765.html">Engadget</a> that &#8220;none of this [tracking] happens if the user says no&#8221;.</p>
<p>However the new study throws doubt on the claim that if a user says &#8216;no&#8217; to tracking/behavioral ads via the IAB&#8217;s TCF, the adtech industry respectfully falls into line.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A key piece of this research examined how the adtech ecosystem responds to user signals that request only <em>basic</em>, i.e. non-tracking-based ads, to examine how ad vendors respond when users say no to &#8220;personalized&#8221; ads.</p>
<p>Here the researchers found evidence to suggest that many adtech vendors continue to track and profile Internet users when they have explicitly said they don&#8217;t want tracking-based ads.</p>
<p>While a number of earlier studies have found problems with how publishers in the EU have implemented cookie consents, such as tracking cookies being dropped prior to asking a site visitor for their permission, this new research, carried out by adtech researcher, <a href="https://adalytics.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adalytics</a>, aims to zero in on the TCF framework itself &#8212; by examining instances where ad-supported websites have faithfully reported users&#8217; ad choices.</p>
<p>Problematic data flows after that implicate the adtech industry itself &#8212; and the claims it makes for the TCF as a flagship compliance tool &#8212; because it suggests the framework fails to accurately reflect and <em>actually respect</em> users&#8217; &#8220;privacy choices&#8221; once they are passed to ad &#8220;partners&#8221;.</p>
<p>Listing a series of takeaways, Adalytics writes that the findings suggest:</p>
<ol>
<li>Many major ad tech vendors continue to track and profile EU users, even when an EU user has explicitly objected</li>
<li>The TCF strings that were designed by IAB Europe do not appear to be honored or parsed correctly by many ad tech vendors</li>
<li>Some ad tech vendors may not be able demonstrate they obtained user data with user consent, which may expose them to contractual compliance, investor/shareholder disclosure, and regulatory risks</li>
<li>In many instances, it is impossible for users to support media creators by allowing “basic ads” whilst disallowing tracking and behavioral profiling to protect their own privacy</li>
</ol>
<p>Although it&#8217;s important to note there are limits to what the researchers were able to observe via Chrome Developer Tools &#8212; given that any processing being done on adtech companies&#8217; own servers isn&#8217;t verifiable by such external research.</p>
<p>Understanding the full picture of what&#8217;s done with people&#8217;s data once the adtech ecosystem gets its hands on it is difficult. But that also cuts to the heart of surveillance-based advertising&#8217;s problem with complying with the GDPR &#8212; which also requires, accountability, transparency and security when processing people&#8217;s data, as well as a valid legal basis to do so.</p>
<p>Even setting those major overarching problems aside, just the fact of tracking cookies being dropped and user data being passed around when a person has explicitly said it should not be looks, well, awkward for the IAB&#8217;s TCF.</p>
<p>To study data activity at the adtech end of the framework, the researchers ran tests in a number of countries in the EU &#8212; visiting websites they manually verified had correctly configured the framework to send the user&#8217;s consent string, and selecting only basic ads; refusing personalized/tracking-based ads/profiling etc and also limited the choice of adtech processor to a single vendor.</p>
<p>The testers also made sure to object to &#8220;legitimate interests&#8221; so that their consent preferences could not be bypassed in that way.</p>
<p>If the TCF was functioning as Feehan&#8217;s remarks to Engadget earlier this month suggest &#8212; i.e. if users can just deny tracking simply by saying &#8216;no&#8217; via the TCF &#8212; the researchers would have expected to observe data flowing <em>only</em> as the individual had specified it should.</p>
<p>Instead, they found &#8212; in most cases &#8212; data flows that looked very different vs the choices that had been expressed.</p>
<p>The paper also details numerous instances of tracking cookies being set <em>prior</em> to the user&#8217;s consent choices even being signalled. (Although they say they excluded such examples from their analysis as they were specifically aiming to study what happens <em>after</em> a user has submitted their choices via the TCF.)</p>

<p>In another example, a user with a French IP address visits the news website lemonde.fr and once again &#8212; despite not consenting to any cookies or purposes offered in the consent banner &#8212; <span style="font-weight: 400;">they see HTTPS request being sent to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">id5-sync.com</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which responds by setting a cookie called “id5” for three months, and triggering a 302 HTTP redirect to sync data with rtb-csync.smartadserver.com. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This specific HTTPS request that was sent to id5-sync.com contains the previously mentioned TCF string in a query string parameter called &#8220;gdpr_consent&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; the researchers report, adding that: &#8220;The domain <em>id5-sync.com</em> belongs to ID5, a London-based “<a href="https://id5.io/platform-privacy-policy/">identity platform</a> for the digital advertising industry”.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They further note that the ID5 Universal ID is described in a github overview as a &#8220;shared, neutral identifier that publishers, advertisers, and ad tech platforms can use to recognise users&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>So, again, if the user is saying they don&#8217;t want to be identified and tracked for ads, why is the id5 cookie being dropped at all?</p>
<p>In another example detailed in the study, also involving a French IP address &#8212; this time the user visits the newspaper<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">latribune.fr &#8212; the user&#8217;s consent choices are again apparently tossed in the virtual trash. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this instance the user had specified they wanted basic ads served by US supply side platform OpenX. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Openx.net</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was observed triggering user ID syncs with &#8220;numerous other parties&#8221;, including Amazon, Google, DataXu, AppNexus, Beeswax (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bidr.io</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), Adelphic Predictive Data platform (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ipredictive.com</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), AdPilot (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">erne.co</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), Simplifi Holdings (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">simpli.fi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), and others, per the study. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another example &#8212; involving a French IP user visiting </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">atlantico.fr; and consenting to basic ads from Google only &#8212; the user sees a &#8220;lot of HTTPS requests being made with this TCF consent string, some of which appear to be user data syncing or setting tracking cookies&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers go on to note that: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A request sent to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">s.cpx.to</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> responses by setting a cookie for 1-year called “cpSess”. This domain is owned by London-based Captify, and the “cpSess” cookie </span><a href="https://www.captifytechnologies.com/data-subject-rights-request/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appears to be used</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to store and link personal information about the user&#8221; &#8212; before citing another source that suggests this cookie is &#8220;used as a tracking mechanism for [&#8230;] advertising companies&#8221; and &#8220;helps with the delivery of targeted marketing adverts whilst users browse&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>The study details numerous other examples of unexpected data flows and syncing being observed after the user has asked not to be tracked.</p>
<p>The researchers also detail results of large-scale automated tests, as well as the manual examples cited above &#8212; based on crawler data from 48,698 different publisher domains &#8212; and here they found evidence of &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of ad requests erroneously claiming the GDPR does not apply to web users who were actually in the EU&#8230;</p>
<p>Out of 35,389 publishers found to have an HTTPS request that was sent to an ad tech vendor and contained either the ‘gdpr=0’ query string parameter, or the ‘gdpr=1’ query string parameter, 28,941 (81.8%) contained at least one HTTPS request sent to an ad tech vendor, wherein the query string macro parameter “gdpr=” was set to “0” &#8212; meaning they were signalling the GDPR does not apply.</p>
<p>More from Adalytics&#8217; write up:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;According to the IAB <a href="https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20Consent%20string%20and%20vendor%20list%20formats%20v2.md#full-tc-string-passing">TCF documentation</a> and to <a href="https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/9805023?hl=en">Google’s documentation</a>, “1 indicates that GDPR applies and 0 indicates that it does not.” Many ad tech vendors were observed processing the German and Finnish user data when “gdpr=0”, despite the crawler not having clicked on the CMP consent banner. In each of these cases, the ad tech vendor could have validated that the user was in fact in the EU by performing a simple<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_geolocation"> IP address geolocation lookup</a>. However, it appears that many take this “gdpr=0” parameter at face value, without performing any additional server-side checks, prior to sending tracking cookies or performing user data syncs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>To try to verify this finding, Adalytics says it reached out to a programmatic media buyer who <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">was targeting</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> ads to users across the EU, UK, and Switzerland. This buyer had their ads served a total of 111 million times &#8212; while the “gdpr_applies” macro was set to “0” 42.3% of the time &#8212; &#8220;indicating that the ad tech company involved was claiming that the GDPR does not apply to these users&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Yet on checking where those 47M ads were served, by using</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> an IP address geo-location lookup service, Adalytics reports that the advertiser found the majority were served to users based in Spain, Croatia, Italy, France, and other EU countries, meaning the GDPR does actually apply&#8230;  </span></p>
<p>&#8220;If ad tech companies are not checking the integrity of the “gdpr_applies” strings by performing IP address geolocation checks, they may end up misleading their advertiser clients about the relevant regulations that apply to their advertising campaigns,&#8221; Adalytics goes on to warn.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">findings further highlight the scale of the problem of ad fraud &#8212; and, where the IAB Europe’s TCF framework is concerned, suggest it offers merely a veneer of legal compliance because it isn&#8217;t actually capable of doing what&#8217;s claimed on the tin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All-too-often adtech vendors have not properly implemented and deployed it, per the research findings &#8212; making the &#8220;Transparency and Consent Framework&#8221; at best, a sham; or, well, compliance theatre. </span></p>
<p>Little wonder this whole system is in regulatory hot water &#8212; although the length of time it&#8217;s taken EU watchdogs to interrogate the reality underlying the adtech industry&#8217;s claims continues to be extremely troubling for anyone who cares about democratic oversight and fundamental rights.</p>

<p>&#8220;The conclusion that we make in our study is that the adtech vendors have not taken the time, money and engineering labor hours to properly configure their servers and APIs,&#8221; Adalytics&#8217; founder Krzysztof Franaszek told TechCrunch, discussing the research. &#8220;In theory, all TCF participants&#8230; should have set up their servers and APIs in a way that checks and validates the TCF strings.</p>
<p>&#8220;If an API receives some user data, to which the TCF string shows the user has not consented, the vendor should immediately discard and avoid doing anything with that data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Franaszek noted that the researchers did observe at least one example of correct behavior &#8212; an instance where AppNexus received a TCF string that did not allow personalization, or for a vendor called Index Exchange to get the data, and &#8220;properly/rightfully configured their server to respond with an HTTP 400 error code, that says &#8216;Request failed due to privacy signals'&#8221;.</p>
<p>However he pointed out that that&#8217;s what &#8220;ALL 795 TCF companies <em>should be</em> doing&#8221;, and the study shows &#8212; on the contrary &#8212; many companies are simply not checking the strings.</p>
<p>Also commenting on the findings, Johnny Ryan, a senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties &#8212; and a long time adtech whistleblower who has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/irelands-data-watchdog-slammed-for-letting-adtech-carry-on-biggest-breach-of-all-time/">filed numerous complaints</a> over real-time-bidding&#8217;s (RTB) abuse of personal data &#8212; said the study is just the latest illustration that &#8220;the TCF was just a bad idea&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no control. No technical measure to actually control what happens to the data,&#8221; Ryan told TechCrunch. &#8220;This means the TCF can never fulfil its purported objectives of providing control and transparency.</p>
<p>&#8220;The central argument we made to the Belgian APD [DPA] is that the TCF&#8217;s inevitable failure, due to the inherent and known insecurity of RTB, means that in addition to being an unnecessary nuisance in the lives of all Europeans, the TCF also infringes the data minimization principle [of GDPR] because it processes TCF string personal data for a purpose that is impossible to achieve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ryan also pointed back to some 2017 IAB correspondence &#8212; which came to light back in <a href="https://fixad.tech/february2019/">2019</a> via FOI &#8212; in which Feehan, who was at the time seeking to lobby the European Commission on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/digging-into-googles-push-to-freeze-eprivacy/">ePrivacy rules</a>, implies consent is incompatible with RTB &#8212; attaching a paper to her email to EU lawmakers with the observation that “it is technically impossible for the user to have prior information about every data controller involved in a real-time bidding (RTB) scenario”.</p>
<p>And for consent to be valid under GDPR it must be specific, <em>informed</em>, and &#8212; indeed &#8212; freely given.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to the Adalytics study &#8212; such as the manual component being limited to a small number of publishers that &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">appear to correctly encode user consent input, in order to rule out the possibility that a publisher’s or CMP’s errors were resulting in user profiling occurring without a user’s consent&#8221;, as Franaszek puts it.</span></p>
<p>It is also not clear how many/what proportion of the 795 adtech companies using the TCF system aren&#8217;t properly respecting user choices. The instance cited above where a user denial of consent was correctly responded to shows it can happen. How often it does is a whole other matter, though.</p>
<p>In any case, those vendors observed by the researchers apparently not respecting users&#8217; denial of tracking included &#8220;several multi-billion dollar multinationals like Rubicon, Pubmatic, Amazon, Google and Trade Desk&#8221;, per Franaszek.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think if you look at the stock market capitalization of the vendors that we examined, it&#8217;s far greater than 50% of the total digital advertising industry,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>A more general caveat is that, <span style="font-weight: 400;">given the adtech industry&#8217;s highly opaque character, it&#8217;s always difficult to understand how data is or isn&#8217;t being processed &#8212; and the researchers acknowledge that a lot of &#8220;nuance&#8221; is required to interpret the data in a section of the paper discussing limitations.  </span></p>
<p>The study has also not gone through formal peer review so has not been subject to the rigorous academic process required if it had been published in a peer reviewed journal.</p>
<p>But, well, the findings sure don&#8217;t look good for adtech.</p>
<p>Per public documentation on a <a href="https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/pubvendors.json%20v1.0%20Draft%20for%20Public%20Comment.md">github repository</a> for v1.0 of the IAB&#8217;s TCF framework, the ad industry body suggested that their &#8212; at that time &#8212; incoming &#8220;technical industry solution&#8221; would allow website operators to:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Control the vendors they wish to allow to access their users&#8217; browsers (for setting and reading cookies) and process their personal data and disclose these choices to other parties in the online advertising ecosystem</li>
<li>Seek user consent under the ePrivacy Directive (for setting cookies or similar technical applications that access information on a device) and/or the GDPR in line with applicable legal requirements and signal the consent status through the online advertising ecosystem</li>
</ol>
<p>The question that naturally follows from those stated capabilities is well, what then? What happens after users&#8217; &#8216;privacy choices&#8217; are signalled to the data-gobbling adtech ecosystem? How does the TCF actually <em>ensure</em> ad vendors respect people&#8217;s choices?</p>
<p>Adalytics&#8217; research is just the latest study to suggest that industry standard pop-up &#8220;privacy choices&#8221; are a mirage; a suggestive illusion of choice wrapped in a pantomime of consent in a bid to square the impossible circle for surveillance ads: GDPR compliance.</p>
<p>Because it seems the only way to be sure the &#8220;choice&#8221; that you ask the TCF to pass on to adtech vendors will get respected is if you ask for the tracking to continue&#8230;</p>
<p>The IAB has been contacted for comment on Adalytics&#8217; research, and also with questions regarding whether it takes any steps to verify that participating ad vendors are complying with TCF strings expressing user choices.</p>
<p>We have also asked the IAB how it expects to adapt the framework &#8212; and its own activities &#8212; in order to come into compliance with GDPR, in light of the Belgian finding of a breach.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll update this report with any response.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The IAB Europe has now responded &#8212; sending this statement re: Adalytics&#8217; research:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When implemented correctly, the TCF allows internet users to communicate to websites and their vendors that they do not wish to have their data collected or processed. All vendors that are TCF participants are expected to comply with their commitments under the TCF, including not processing any data when the user has rejected or objected to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;TCF is mainly a policy and technical standard that companies can implement in their commercial relationships, but using the TCF does not alleviate any vendor from their responsibility to fully comply with the GDPR. While it is the responsibility of the vendor to make sure they are applying the TCF appropriately, IAB Europe provides support to make sure the TCF is implemented correctly and addresses non-compliance.</p>
<p>&#8220;In September, we launched a <a href="https://iabeurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/TCF_V-CMP_comms_TCFCompliance-NewVendorComplianceProgramme_260821_IABEurope.pdf">TCF Vendor compliance programme</a> that enables us to monitor Vendor compliance and enforce non-compliance. This includes enforcing against the setting of non-essential cookies without users&#8217; consent or the processing of users&#8217; personal data without legal basis, verifying the duration of cookies used by vendors and ensuring users&#8217; choices are forwarded faithfully.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Regarding the Belgian DPA&#8217;s probe of the TCF, it said it cannot comment further &#8220;on an ongoing investigation&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will work with the relevant authorities to address any issues raised with the TCF once the ruling is finalised,&#8221; the IAB added.</p>
