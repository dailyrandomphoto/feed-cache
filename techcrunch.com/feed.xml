					</ul>
	</div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Matthew Mendelsohn’s <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2021/08/24/yale-appoints-matthew-mendelsohn-chief-investment-officer#:~:text=Yale%20President%20Peter%20Salovey%20today,nine%2Dyear%20battle%20with%20cancer.">accession</a> to become Yale’s new chief investment officer marks a milestone for the rise of university endowments investing in venture capital.</p>
<p>Since joining the Yale Investments Office in 2007, one of Mendelsohn’s core focuses has been venture capital — an asset class that has gained traction among an increasing number of institutional investors in recent years — and Yale’s investment approach has long been <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/yale-endowments-venture-funds-hit-home-run-1460073499">a model</a> for other endowments.</p>
<p>But even as endowments increasingly diversify their investments, they’re facing a growing wave of pressure to consider ESG initiatives, many of which may drive the returns they’re looking for in the coming decades.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232125" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For instance, students at many universities have been pushing endowment leaders to divest from fossil fuels. Here’s another idea endowments should consider: Invest in educational opportunities to give more people pathways to careers in venture.</p>
<p>In the venture world, far too few internship or fellowship opportunities exist for prospective VC investors to get hands-on experience learning the ins and outs of working in venture. This perpetuates the remarkably closed ecosystem of hiring in VC, where jobs are seldom even posted and warm introductions are practically essential.</p>
<p>Endowments are perfectly positioned to change this. By taking a partnership approach with VCs rather than a more transactional one simply as limited partners, endowments can accomplish several things at once.</p>
<p>They can continue to invest in the funds they think are the best investments; they can support and expand opportunities for those interested in working in venture, especially diverse individuals who may not have connections to VC firms; and they can set themselves up to have close relationships with those eager learners, some of whom may want those endowments to be LPs one day.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In many cases, this could also involve greater collaboration between endowments and career centers at universities, each of which may have existing relationships with VCs, whether on the funding or educational sides.</p>
<p>If endowments partner with VCs on these initiatives, they can help shape the programs to best serve the people in them. Among the internship and fellowship programs that do exist today, many are designed around having interns or fellows be a free (or underpaid) labor force for performing due diligence and scouting startups that VC firms may want to invest in.</p>
<p>While this may not be entirely without value for those participating, programs ought to start with a give-first approach whereby they are intentionally focused on teaching and supporting participants so that they can get broad exposure to the kinds of work VCs do and are able to spend time learning directly from investors.</p>
<p>Existing programs like BLCK VC’s <a href="https://www.blckvc.org/black-venture-institute">Black Venture Institute</a>, Recast Capital’s <a href="https://recastcapital.com/enablement-program/">Enablement Program</a> and VC Include’s <a href="https://www.vcinclude.com/fellowship">fellowship</a> for first-time fund managers offer great models of effective and inclusive venture education. And a program like the <a href="https://www.bvcc.vc/summer-internships">Black Venture Capital Consortium</a>’s summer internship is exciting in the way it’s connecting undergraduate students at HBCUs to VCs for internships, but the kind of full alignment I’ve just described between endowments and VCs has the potential to create even better synergies for participant-first educational programs.</p>
<p>By working as partners on these educational programs, endowments and VCs can also start changing the makeup of venture capital to include investors from a variety of backgrounds. With <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethedwards/2021/02/24/check-your-stats-the-lack-of-diversity-in-venture-capital-is-worse-than-it-looks/?sh=40a29d28185d">93% of venture dollars currently controlled by white men</a>, the need for greater diversity in the industry could not be starker, and endowments committed to expanding the venture ecosystem are in an obvious position to be champions of these efforts.</p>
<p>This kind of partnership is a win-win situation for all involved. By supporting a path to greater diversity in venture, endowments and VCs can help usher in a new era for the industry that sees investors from a much greater variety of backgrounds identifying and backing startups that the old guard might never even come across or consider.</p>
<p>Endowments are well positioned to play such a long game, and the interests of all parties involved in these initiatives could not be better aligned.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The ability to quickly spin up a team and launch something is clearly the core of what makes startupland so special (and, candidly, fun to write about).]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During the garage-stage and Zoom-room days of a company’s life, fluidity can feel key to idea creation. The lack of contractual obligations is baked into how we understand the origin stories of the most famous startups. We celebrate rapid pivots, love scrappy MVPs over perfectly polished platforms and pay attention to repeat entrepreneurs who raise money for their next idea before they even know what it is. The ability to quickly spin up a team and launch something is clearly the core of what makes startupland so special (and, candidly, fun to write <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/co-founder-titles-arent-a-formality-theyre-a-morality/">and talk</a> about).</p>
<p>Yet, even though the amorphous beginning of a startup can feel energizing beyond belief, formality matters. There’s a difference, both in ownership and weight, between a founder, a founding team member, an adviser, an investor, an angel investor and an early employee. As shown by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/12/technology/12facebook.html">Winklevoss twins versus Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/snapchat-reggie-brown/">Reggie Brown versus Snapchat</a> and, most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/avi-dorfmans-legal-battle-to-be-named-founding-member-of-compass-has-ended-in-a-settlement/">Avi Dorfman versus Compass</a>, disputes can often arise simply because of differing definitions on all of the above.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			“I don’t think it’s the title of the agreement that is magic; I think it’s just thinking through how you’re going to deal with the different possible scenarios.”							<cite>Jonathan Harris, managing partner, law firm Harris St. Laurent &amp; Wechsler</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>While the string of high-profile legal cases shows just how pervasive, and common, founder disputes have been for years, the current startup environment makes me think that there could be a jolt of new disagreements ahead of us. Why? Well, there’s a number of factors that could spark a fire right now: frenetic funding, a wild startup formation environment and the glorification of being a disjointed team with no titles &#8212; just passion and whiteboards.</p>
<p>Startups and movements need to establish clear governance to manage expectations and avoid late-stage conflict. While this formalization is easier said than done, it’s often a process dictated by your ability to confront, have conversations and, most of all, be transparent.</p>
<h2>What else causes a rift, if not money and power?</h2>
<p>Akshaya Dinesh, the former co-founder of Ladder, once got rejected from an accelerator program because she didn’t have a good answer to who the CEO was.</p>
<p>“This was before we had even fundraised anything, and it was just the two of us working on it,” she said. “We said something like, ‘We&#8217;re very early and we&#8217;re both technical so we&#8217;re kind of doing everything together,’ but if we had to choose it would be X.” Later, the entrepreneur said, she realized that the “right answer” is to confidently give a name and give a clear distinction of what each person’s focus areas at the company are and will evolve to be.</p>
<p>“Titles are one of the biggest reasons why co-founders have conflicts, so they&#8217;re trying to assess how comfortable you are having tough conversations early,” she said. The stress test is likely why one of the classic YC interview questions is “Who’s the CEO?” (Dinesh went on to raise millions from Alexis Ohanian’s Seven Seven Six Ventures, DoorDash, Harry Stebbings, Pear VC and Forerunner).</p>
<p>Techstars investor Saba Karim agreed with the notion that, after lack of product-market fit, the biggest startup killer is co-founder conflict. “And what else do you think causes a rift, if not money and power?” he said.</p>
<p>“What you decide today may not hold true in two years, or even two months, so it’s crucial there are cliffs and vesting schedules put into place,” he said. While the investor hasn’t noticed an uptick in founder conflicts or title inflation in the current climate, he thinks written agreements are important to prioritize once there is funding or revenue in the picture.</p>
<p>Plus, somewhat counterintuitively, Karim thinks an equal split of equity between everyone on the founding team is an adverse sign.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s another launch company newly able to count itself among the small (but growing) group that has reached orbit: Astra. The Alameda-based rocket startup notched that achievement late Friday night, taking off from its launch site in Kodiak, Alaska shortly after 9 PM local time (1 AM ET).</p>
<p>This was Astra&#8217;s &#8216;LV0007&#8217; mission, the follow-up to its last try in August, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/astras-first-commercial-launch-fails-to-reach-orbit/">ended short of reaching orbit</a> after the rocket got off to a rocky start with a brief hover and sideways strafe movement just after liftoff. Astra then investigated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/astra-completes-investigation-into-august-launch-failure-aims-for-next-attempt-in-october/">the cause of the misfire (an early engine shutdown) </a>before initially setting the LV0007 launch for the end of October. That was shifted due to weather.</p>
<p>This new launch and Astra&#8217;s first successful flight to orbit comes just under a year after the company reached space with its Rocket 3.2 test launch, during a mission which surprised everyone, including Astra&#8217;s own team, with how close it came to achieving orbit.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237594" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Astra just reached orbit! 7.61km/sec at our targeted 86.0 degree inclination at an altitude of 500km. The team worked hard for this. We’re just getting started, folks. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AdAstra?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AdAstra</a> <a href="https://t.co/NiMhCEsuCI">pic.twitter.com/NiMhCEsuCI</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Astra&#8217;s approach to the launch industry fits a niche that isn&#8217;t yet satisfied, with a rapid turnaround and high-volume approach to manufacturing that it claims will be able to produce small payload rockets at prices that make it possible for even more companies to get their cargo to space on dedicated missions, rather than relying on rideshare models on larger vehicles like SpaceX&#8217;s Falcon 9, or paying a relatively high price for something like Rocket Lab&#8217;s Electron.</p>
<p>Astra&#8217;s Benjamin Lyon, the company&#8217;s Chief Engineer, will be joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#tickets">TC Sessions: Space this year</a>, and we&#8217;ll be sure to talk about this milestone win.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The TechCrunch Experts program had an active week!</p>
<p>Joey Noble, community manager for Demand Curve, returned with a teardown of Customer.io&#8217;s homepage with insights you can apply to your own company&#8217;s website, and Jonathan Martinez shared his essentials for creating an optimal growth marketing tech stack.</p>
<p>With the new year almost upon us, I interviewed several of the experts we&#8217;ve identified through the Experts program and asked each of them how they&#8217;d manage a small Q1 2022 marketing budget, and on Wednesday, Senior Editor Walter Thompson hosted a Twitter Space with Octane.ai co-founder Ben Parr to discuss using zero-party data for personalization.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237149" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Our coverage this week also includes notes on how DevOps efforts are supporting recent and upcoming trips to space. Find a full recap below.</p>
<h2>Software consulting</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/devops-transformation-taking-edge-computing-and-continuous-updates-to-space/">DevOps transformation: Taking edge computing and continuous updates to space:</a> Fred Simon, co-founder and chief data scientist at JFrog, wrote about the field&#8217;s contributions in the past two years to space exploration.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the great revelations of the new space industry is that it’s being eaten alive by software,&#8221; says Simon. &#8220;Software is getting smarter, better and easier to update; however, the amount of compute power needed to execute software commands in space is growing exponentially.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are plans to launch as many as 40,000 satellites in the next few years, but how do we transform the way we continually update software that runs in space?</p>
<blockquote><p>My personal view is that we need to create a new way of performing continuous delivery and continuous updates in space. On Earth, many organizations use an orchestrator to handle the continuous update processes — automated configuration, management and coordination of systems, apps and services to help IT teams manage complex tasks and workflows efficiently. As of now, there is no equivalent to this for use with satellites in space, and those that exist are extremely limiting.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Growth marketing</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/growth-marketing-experts-survey-how-would-you-spend-a-25000-budget-in-q1-2022/">(TechCrunch+) Growth marketing experts survey: How would you spend a $25,000 budget in Q1 2022?:</a> Miranda Halpern spoke with seven marketers that we&#8217;ve come to know through our TechCrunch Experts program. The question each expert was asked to answer was, &#8220;If you only had a $25,000 marketing budget for Q1 2022, how would you spend it?&#8221; Read the full article to see how these marketers break down their &#8220;budget.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/a-lean-startups-growth-marketing-tech-stack/">A lean startup&#8217;s growth marketing tech stack</a>: Without a robust marketing growth stack, startups can&#8217;t easily integrate the myriad work that goes into building a customer base. According to paid acquisition expert Jonathan Martinez, here are its main components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer data platform (CDP).</li>
<li>Mobile measurement partner (MMP).</li>
<li>Data warehouse.</li>
<li>Business intelligence tool (BI).</li>
<li>Customer engagement tools.</li>
<li>A/B testing/experimentation tools.</li>
<li>Acquisition mediums.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford and Rivian have abandoned a plan they had to jointly develop an EV together. In an interview with <a href="https://www.autonews.com/automakers-suppliers/ford-rivian-cancel-plans-jointly-develop-ev" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>Automotive News</ins></em></a>, Ford CEO Jim Farley said the automaker will go it alone as it aims to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-600000-electric-vehicles-2023-061606689.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><ins>produce 600,000 vehicles</ins></a> per year by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>When the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-24-ford-invests-500-million-in-rivian-for-ev.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><ins>invested $500 million</ins></a> in Rivian in 2019, the two said they would work together to produce a Ford-branded EV featuring the startup&#8217;s &#8220;skateboard&#8221; powertrain. In early 2020, the two, citing the pandemic, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lincoln-cancels-rivian-based-ev-004105043.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><ins>canceled a Lincoln-branded EV</ins></a>. At the time, they said they still planned to go forward with an &#8220;alternative vehicle&#8221; based on Rivian&#8217;s technology. Now, that project won&#8217;t go forward either.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, we have growing confidence in our ability to win in the electric space,&#8221; Farley told <em>Automotive News</em>. &#8220;When you compare today with when we originally made that investment, so much has changed: about our ability, about the brand&#8217;s direction in both cases, and now it&#8217;s more certain to us what we have to do.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237580" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to Farley, part of the reason Ford and Rivian decided not to move forward with the project is the complexities of marrying their hardware and software together. The companies say the decision has not affected their relationship.</p>
<p>&#8220;As Ford has scaled its own EV strategy and demand for Rivian vehicles has grown, we&#8217;ve mutually decided to focus on our own projects and deliveries,&#8221; a spokesperson for Rivian told Engadget. &#8220;Our relationship with Ford is an important part of our journey, and Ford remains an investor and ally on our shared path to an electrified future.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Confluent's approach of growing from open source to commercial product has worked out well — the company defied conventional wisdom and still ended up thriving.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s common these days to launch an enterprise startup based on an open source project, often where one the founders was deeply involved in creating it. The beauty of this approach is that if the project begins to gain traction, you have the top of the sales funnel ready and waiting with potential customers when you move to commercialize your business.</p>
<p>In the past, this often meant providing help desk-style services for companies who appreciated what the open source software could do but wanted to have the so-called &#8220;throat to choke&#8221; if something went wrong. Another way that these companies have made money has been creating an on-prem version with certain enterprise features, particularly around scale or security, the kind of thing that large operations need as table stakes before using a particular product. Today, customers typically can install on-prem or in their cloud of choice.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;A key aspect of these kinds of technology-developer data products is they have to have a combination of bottom-up adoption and top-down SaaS, and you actually have to get both of those things working well to succeed.&#8221;							<cite>Jay Kreps</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In recent years, the model has shifted to building a SaaS product, where the startup builds a solution that handles all the back-end management and creates something that most companies can adopt without all of the fuss associated with installing yourself or trying to figure out how to use the raw open source.</p>
<p>One company that has flirted with these monetization approaches is <a href="http://confluent.com">Confluent</a>, the streaming data company built on top of the open source <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka project</a>. The founding team had helped build Kafka inside LinkedIn to move massive amounts of user data in real time. They open sourced the tool in 2011, and CEO and co-founder Jay Kreps helped launch the company in 2014.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Confluent raised $450 million as a private company with a final private valuation in April <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/confluent-lands-another-big-round-with-250m-series-e-on-4-2b-valuation/">of $4.5 billion</a> before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/confluents-ipo-brings-a-high-growth-high-burn-saas-model-to-the-public-markets/">going public in June</a>. Today, it has a market cap of over $22 billion, not bad for less than six months as a public company.</p>
<p>Last month at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/confluent-ceo-jay-kreps-is-coming-to-tc-sessions-saas-for-a-fireside-chat/">TC Sessions: SaaS</a>, I spoke to Kreps about how he built his open source business and the steps he took along the way to monetize his ideas. There&#8217;s certainly a lot of takeaways for open source-based startups launching today.</p>
<h2>Going upmarket</h2>
<p>Kreps said that when they launched the company in 2014, there were a bunch of enterprise-size companies already using the open source product, and they needed to figure out how to take the interest they had been seeing in Kafka and convert that into something that the fledgling startup could begin to make money on.</p>
<p>&#8220;There have been different paths for different companies in this space, and I think it&#8217;s actually very dependent on the type of product [as to] what makes sense. For us, one of the things we understood early on was that we would have to be wherever our customers had data,&#8221; Kreps said.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/flytrex-raises-40m-to-build-its-drone-based-delivery-service-across-suburbs-in-the-u-s/"><strong>Bring on drone deliveries:</strong></a><strong> </strong>An Israeli drone company (Flytrex) is teaming up with U.S. chains (Walmart, Chili’s) to test deliveries in one state (North Carolina). Amazon has worked on drone deliveries, as have other companies. Flytrex just raised $40 million for its efforts. Given how little interest we have in <em>driving</em> to get things, here’s hoping the experiment works this time.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/as-sequoia-changes-its-model-other-permanent-capital-vcs-weigh-in/">The changing structure of venture capital:</a></strong> News that U.S. venture giant Sequoia was shaking up its operating model was big news when it landed. But after looking at a few examples from other markets, there’s precedent for a more permanent capital model. Our next question is which venture capital firm is next.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/as-crypto-unicorns-multiply-the-us-stands-out-as-ground-zero-for-blockchain-winners/"><strong>Crypto unicorns multiply:</strong></a><strong> </strong>It’s no surprise that with more and more venture funds built to invest in them, crypto-focused startups are having a busy year. But you might be surprised regarding just how many new crypto unicorns were born this year and where they are based. A new data set also details where the crypto unicorns are focused, and, yes, NFTs do come up.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/nym-raises-13m-from-a16zs-crypto-fund/">Speaking of crypto startups, Nym raises $13M:</a></strong> Based in Switzerland — quickly becoming a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/the-anoma-protocol-raises-26m-for-its-work-to-undefine-money/">domiciling hub for crypto projects</a> — Nym has raised fresh capital from the a16z crypto fund to, in TechCrunch’s words, “commercialize an old idea for privacy-centric infrastructure (mixnets) by combining it with buzzy crypto incentives.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/mmhmm-eats-macro/"><strong>Mmhmm buys Macro:</strong></a> Video-focused startup mmhmm has made a purchase, snagging video-chat filter service Macro. Given that both work in making video-based communications a bit more snazzy, they fit together well on paper.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/sudowrite-fundraising/"><strong>Sudowrite will help you write a zillion words:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Our own Haje Jan Kamps has a fascinating look at a writing tool that leverages GPT-3 to attack writer’s block. It’s not the first writing-focused service built atop GPT-3 that we’ve covered, and we doubt that it will be the last. But this does appear to be the most, ahem, wordy. Sudowrite recently raised $3 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/foodtech-amara-infant/"><strong>Amara’s high-density baby food attracts $12M Series A:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Feeding your little kiddo isn’t easy. Between picky eating and a plethora of foods on offer that are less than winsome for their growing bodies, it can be hard to get the right foodstuffs into your pantry. Amara is taking on the issue with a Series A that values its healthy kid food business at $100 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/kettle-books-25m-for-its-reinsurance-platform-against-fire-and-other-catastrophes/"><strong>Startups are taking on reinsurance, too:</strong></a><strong> </strong>By now we’re familiar with a number of insurtech models. Root, Metromile, Hippo and others are taking on familiar insurance products. Zebra and its rivals are building insurance marketplaces. But reinsurance? That’s rarer. Kettle just raised $25 million to take on the business of insuring the insurers. Let’s see how its economics play out.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/primer-sazze-partners-closes-127m-second-fund-aimed-at-south-korean-entrepreneurs/"><strong>VC focused on Korean startups raises $127M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Thanks to the sharp eyes of our own Kate Park, TechCrunch has news up today discussing Primer Sazze Partners, a San Jose-based venture capital firm that wants to “invest in startups founded by Korean entrepreneurs in Asia and North America.” It’s not the biggest fund we’ve heard of, but we don’t know of that many venture firms taking on its exact remit, so it stood out from the mix.</li>
<li>If you need a little something to take your mind off the weekend, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/co-founder-titles-arent-a-formality-theyre-a-morality/">Equity has a fun episode out</a> taking on the week’s news, from OpenSea to edtech. If that’s not enough, the other flagship TechCrunch podcast Found <a href="https://pod.link/found/episode/69e59707f7641ecae0537f0513d9eeff">has a great episode out this week</a> with recent TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield winner Nabiha Saklayen that I cannot recommend enough.</li>

<h2>Making the case for IVP: Initial viable product</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2236746" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/making-the-case-for-ivp-initial-viable-product/"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236746" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2236746 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-86298178.jpg" alt="Hand placing cherry on top of cup cake" width="1024" height="816" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-86298178.jpg 1939w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-86298178.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-86298178.jpg?resize=300,239 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-86298178.jpg?resize=768,612 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-86298178.jpg?resize=680,542 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-86298178.jpg?resize=1536,1225 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-86298178.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2236746" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.gettyimages.in/search/photographer?family=creative&amp;photographer=Flashpop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flashpop <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a> / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>As a concept, minimum viable product (MVP) has given founders maximum flexibility.</p>
<p>The goal is to keep shipping until you reach product-market fit, but there’s a catch: “Minimal is a sliding scale that will always slide onto you,” according to Aron Solomon, head of strategy at Esquire Digital.</p>
<p>Instead of putting MVP on a pedestal, he proposes adding an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/making-the-case-for-ivp-initial-viable-product/">initial viable product (IVP) to the roadmap.</a></p>
<p>“If your IVP is your presentation of an unbaked pepperoni pizza, your MVP is when you present a can of sauce, a package of cheese, a Slim Jim, and a pencil sketch of an oven.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Let's look at why BNPL is becoming a more attractive payment option for big e-commerce companies like Amazon and Walmart, as well as merchant marketplaces like Square and Shopify.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this week, Amazon announced that it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/amazon-says-it-will-stop-accepting-uk-issued-visa-credit-cards-on-january-19th/">stop accepting Visa credit cards</a> issued in the U.K. due to high interchange fees on transactions. The company gave a deadline of January 19 and is offering consumers who primarily use Visa cards £20 off a purchase as an incentive to update their preferred payment method.</p>
<p>The move followed similar efforts by Amazon to curtail the use of Visa-issued credit cards in Singapore and Australia, markets where the e-commerce giant introduced a <a href="https://www.paymentsdive.com/news/amazon-takes-visa-battle-to-australia/606055/">0.5% surcharge</a> on <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/amazon-to-introduce-05-surcharge-for-visa-credit-card-transactions-in-singapore">transactions made with those cards</a>. In both cases, Amazon also offered customers gift cards to encourage them to switch payment methods.</p>
<p>While Amazon is asserting its market dominance in an effort to lower transaction fees &#8212; which a company spokesperson said “[continue] to be an obstacle for businesses striving to provide the best prices for customers” &#8212; it is hardly alone in its desire to ween customers off high-cost payment methods.</p>
<p>For merchants, the introduction of “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) payment options, the rise of digital wallets and a broader push toward ACH or account-to-account (A2A) transactions are all part of a strategy to reduce consumers’ overreliance on credit cards.</p>
<p>For today, let’s focus on BNPL and why it is becoming a more attractive payment option for big e-commerce companies like Amazon and Walmart, as well as merchant marketplaces like Square and Shopify.</p>
<h2>Not just bigger shopping carts</h2>
<p>For years, the key selling point of BNPL services like Affirm, Afterpay and Klarna was that they allowed merchants to increase the average order value while also reducing cart abandonment.</p>
<p>Affirm’s merchant transaction fees vary depending on the structure of the installment offering, which takes into account things like the cart size, length of term and whether those loans are offered to the consumer as 0% APR or interest-bearing installments.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This is a fantastic time to found a startup, but unless you plan to bootstrap it, you will still need to go through the laborious exercise of crafting a pitch deck.</p>
<p>With so much riding on the outcome, this can be an extremely stressful process — a convincing deck requires you to come up with data-driven answers for existential questions:</p>
<p><em>Can you lay out your plan for tripling revenue YoY? What’s your ideal product use case?</em></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237284" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<hr />
<p>It’s tempting to make overly sunny projections or copy what’s worked for others, but your pitch isn’t meant to impress — it’s supposed to show how well you understand the business you’re building and the space in which you’re operating.</p>
<p>According to Jose Cayasso, CEO and co-founder of pitch deck design agency Slidebean, there are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/5-critical-pitch-deck-slides-most-founders-get-wrong/">five slides where pretty much all founders miss the mark</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go-to-market</li>
<li>Use case/audience</li>
<li>TAM</li>
<li>Possible outcomes</li>
<li>Team</li>
</ul>
<p>Using examples from Airbnb, Uber and others, he shares several strategies for avoiding the most common pitfalls, along with the pitch deck framework Slidebean uses with most of its clients.</p>
<p>“Remember, a pitch deck needs to achieve two things: tell your company story and convince the investor that they can make money with this,” says Cayasso.</p>

<p>As a concept, minimum viable product (MVP) has given founders maximum flexibility.</p>
<p>The goal is to keep shipping until you reach product-market fit, but there’s a catch: “Minimal is a sliding scale that will always slide onto you,” according to Aron Solomon, head of strategy at Esquire Digital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead of putting MVP on a pedestal, he proposes adding an initial viable product (IVP) to the roadmap.</p>
<p>“If your IVP is your presentation of an unbaked pepperoni pizza, your MVP is when you present a can of sauce, a package of cheese, a Slim Jim, and a pencil sketch of an oven.”</p>

<p>The concept of MLOps gained traction as a few specific best practices for working with machine learning (ML) models, but it is maturing into a standalone approach for managing the ML lifecycle.</p>
<p>This evolution has played a key role in helping companies adopt and employ ML and AI, according to Ashish Kakran, principal at Thomvest Ventures.</p>
<p>In a TechCrunch+ post, Kakran lays out several challenges companies can address using MLOps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross-team collaboration to deploy ML</li>
<li>Integration with ML tools</li>
<li>Model lifecycle management</li>
<li>Bringing ML models to production</li>
<li>Regulation and compliance</li>
<li>Accelerating AI adoption</li>

<p>Despite the fact that Americans are famous for failing to eat their vegetables, salad chain Sweetgreen is seeing a lot of success on the public markets.</p>
<p>The company priced its IPO above its planned range at $28 per share and was trading at nearly double that price soon after it debuted.</p>
<p>That pricing and the resulting ~9x multiple reflects the fact that the market now considers tech-enabled businesses like Sweetgreen, Allbirds and Rent the Runway to be around the same value as software businesses in 2015, writes Alex Wilhelm.</p>

<h2>4 strategies for setting marketplace take rates</h2>

<p>E-commerce platform founders may be tempted to set transaction fees just a little higher than they initially planned, but greed isn’t always good.</p>
<p>Boosting take rates by a point or two could raise early revenue when it’s needed most, but there’s an opportunity cost, since “a higher take rate typically leads to lower transaction volume,” according to angel investor and product manager Tanay Jaipuria.</p>
<p>Take rates should directly reflect the stage of your business, he advises, since platforms with higher rates see lower transaction volumes.</p>
<p>To learn how different companies use this lever, Jaipuria studied take rates for more than 25 marketplaces, including Apple, Shutterstock and OpenSea.</p>
<p>“It’s important for founders to remember that maximizing the take rate of the platform is not the goal,” he says.</p>

<p>San Francisco is an outlier, but a walk through its residential neighborhoods shows how successful Instacart became during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Nearly every restaurant has a hand-lettered “Instacart pickup here” sign, and its drivers now deliver everything from Safeway groceries to Walgreens prescriptions. On more than one occasion, I’ve seen neighbors accepting boba tea deliveries.</p>
<p>But after The Information reported that the delivery platform’s growth plateaued in 2021, Alex Wilhelm gathered data from competitors Amazon, Walmart, DoorDash and Uber to see if they are “snacking on Instacart’s core business.”</p>

<p>North America’s legal cannabis industry is about a decade old, but many stakeholders are developing a framework “to make sure that for once, an industry starts off on the right path,” reports Jesse Klein.</p>
<p>Twenty companies have formed a coalition to promote sustainability practices aimed at reducing energy and water usage, along with emissions. To “green it up,” they’re studying new tech like LEDs, as well as traditional agricultural practices.</p>
<p>“They’re making pretty good margins and they’ve kind of got a PR problem,” said Stephen Doig, senior research and strategy adviser at Dartmouth’s Arthur L. Irving Institute for Energy and Society.</p>
<p>“Getting it right, right now [will] make a big difference.”</p>

<p>In the software space, even the tiniest difference in metrics can affect a company’s fortunes once it goes public.</p>
<p>Braze and UserTesting both provide ways to centralize and optimally use customer data, and their growth metrics are quite evenly matched. Yet, when they went public earlier this week, Braze priced above its price range and UserTesting priced below.</p>
<p>“It appears that those metrics — software TAM is so large these days that we’re not going to compare vanity metrics for the sake of being kind to S-1 scribblers — are enough to give it the revenue multiple differential that we see, and thus explain the difference in the two companies’ IPO pricing runs,” writes Alex Wilhelm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.mmhmm.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mmhmm</a> has perhaps the noisiest take on the future of video-conferencing: virtual meetings will be fun, flexible and, as shown by its most recent acquisition, emotive. The video-conferencing software startup, founded by Evernote creator Phil Libin, announced today that it has bought <a href="https://www.macro.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Macro</a>, a company that has created filters, reactions and tools to take the pressure off of virtual meetings (and bring the relationship-building energy back).</p>
<p>The talks between Macro and Mmhmm started in late September, with the deal closing just weeks later. The terms of the transaction were undisclosed, but given Mmhmm’s recent $100 million raise, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/the-mmhmm-story-and-how-it-plans-to-spend-its-100m/">it’s clear that the early-stage company had some capital to spare.</a></p>
<p>Macro was founded in 2019 by Ankith Harathi and John Keck, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/macro-just-raised-4-3m-to-make-your-never-ending-zoom-calls-more-useful/">soon raised $4.3 million in venture capital</a> from investors such as FirstMark Capital, General Catalyst and Underscore VC. Unlike Mmhmm, which focuses on customizing user’s video feeds, Macro changes the actual interface that users are working from.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237389" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For example, a key characteristic of Macro is the Airtime feature, which helps participants understand who is speaking the most within a certain meeting. Video sizes adjust based on each person&#8217;s engagement, which can help teams better distill influence and figure out who may need extra nudges to speak up.</p>
<p>Other features include custom windows to &#8220;unbox&#8221; yourself on the screen and filters. To promote ease of use, Macro is able to be used with MacOS and any Zoom client, even if everyone else is on Zoom.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kvi27jmMKEg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>After Macro’s first fundraise, Harathi explained that he and his co-founder had to decide if they should keep building, raise another round or join forces with another company. Competition from other Zoom clients was heating up, a demand that was great for validation, but difficult for development. They realized that Mmhmm had a lot of the functionality they felt was imperative to being successful in the video-conferencing space.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“How do you make meetings more human? How do you make them adapt to the people we are, as opposed to putting identity-driven and expressive organisms into constrained boxes,” Harathi said, of his early talks with Libin’s team. “They were debating going down this camera route, or the client route, and they chose one, we chose the other.”</p>
<p>“We really think that the company that is going to win this video 2.0 world is the product that goes seamlessly between asynchronous and synchronous,” Libin said. “Letting you shift between recorded and live, and doing that smoothly is the near term of what video is going to be.” Harathi added that the winning app needs to solve for all the ways people will communicate in the distributed world, from on the fly phone calls to deep-thinking sessions to high-stakes presentations.</p>

<p>The big vision for Mmhmm, as Libin’s been clear about from the start, is to redefine video as a medium for expression and building relationships. It’s a type of trust that is hard to build, literally. He hopes that by offering more surface area in Zoom rooms, using Mmhmm and Macro, there is more room to understand who you are speaking with.</p>
<p>“What room did they choose? What effects are they doing? It gives everyone more opportunity to be creative and customize how they’re appearing,” he said. “And it becomes a little closer to you and I hanging out in person and getting to know each other. The foundation is far more expressive.”</p>
<p>Macro is Mmhmm’s second acquisition to date. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/23/mmhmm-phil-libins-new-startup-acquires-memix-to-add-enhanced-filters-to-its-video-presentation-toolkit/">Mmhmm announced its buy of Memix</a>, a San Francisco-based startup that offers a series of filters that can be applied to both pre-recorded and live videos to tweak stuff like lighting, details in the background, or what appears across the entire screen. Libin says that Memix’s technology now makes up the core of Mmhmm’s offering.</p>
<p>Macro will be sunset by the end of November. All seven members of Macro’s team have decided to join Mmhmm to keep on building.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">VinFast, the Vietnamese automaker under Vingroup, was one of the LA Auto Show&#8217;s numerous newcomers this year aiming to make an impression with consumers.</p>
<p>The company showed off two all-electric crossovers at the show. And like so many new entrants to automotive &#8212; or in VinFast&#8217;s case, new to the United States &#8212; the vehicles are not yet in production.</p>
<p>VinFast shared few details on the specs of the vehicles, which are due to show up in the U.S. in late 2022. Visitors to the show could sign up via Typeform to be among the first to &#8220;experience&#8221; the vehicles and indicate purchasing interest.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237269" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Right now we want people to register. So we want to &#8230; collect and build up the database so that we know where customers are, you know, who is interested. And then, we will keep them updated on the progress that the products and the service here that we are going to offer,&#8221; VinFast US CEO Van Anh Nguyen said in an interview with TechCrunch on Thursday.</p>
<p>Customers who are interested can put down a $500 deposit to reserve their vehicle of choice in one of eight colors in the first quarter of 2022. According to Nguyen, when the vehicles become available a few months later, interested customers can test drive and determine if they want to convert that deposit into a purchase. While specs and details are thin, VinFast appears to be moving quickly with plans to enter the U.S. market.</p>
<h2>A factory, HQ and 60 stores</h2>
<p>VinFast&#8217;s plans for the United States extend well beyond selling some electric crossovers. The company announced ambitious plans to invest more than $200 million to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vinfast-officially-announces-us-headquarters-in-los-angeles-301426252.html">open a U.S. headquarters</a> based in Los Angeles. The company also plans to open more than 60 sales locations, multiple service centers and some mobile service sites by 2022. A factory is also on the list, although that is not slated to open until the second half of 2024.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fast run-up for VinFast that will require significant capital and staff.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nguyen has been in the states just 14 months, she said, working to put together the team that will bring VinFast models to the U.S. market. She would not disclose where that manufacturing facility might be located, however.</p>
<p>VinFast <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/vietnams-vinfast-plans-us-listing-couple-years-ceo-2021-11-17/">also told Reuters</a> recently that the company plans to list on the U.S. stock market in the next few years.</p>
<p>While other Asian auto manufacturers like Korean-owned Hyundai and Kia and Japanese-owned Toyota, Subaru and Mazda have all cracked the U.S. market, VinFast is the first Vietnamese company to make the attempt. Chinese companies like BYD have tried and failed to break into the U.S. market.</p>
<h2>What is VinFast?</h2>
<p>VinFast is a part of the Vingroup, a private Vietnamese conglomerate started in 1993 that dabbles in everything from real estate and hospitality to industrials, technology and even education.</p>
<p>VinFast, the automotive arm, announced its first internal combustion engine vehicles at the 2018 Paris Motor Show, a pair of luxury sedans that used BMW engines. They quickly followed up with the launch of a number of e-scooters, Lux SUVs and cars specifically for the Vietnamese market. Within a year, the company says its vehicles became the <a href="https://vinfastauto.us/story">fastest-selling in Vietnam</a>.</p>
<p>Just this year, the company launched an all-electric bus and more scooters in Vietnam, as well as the two SUVs it pulled the cover off of at the LA Auto Show on Wednesday, the VinFast VFe35 and VFe36, which the company says will be global vehicles. In many ways, VinFast seems similar to a Hyundai Group in that the automotive business makes up a very small portion of the other main businesses.</p>
<p>Vingroup also owns VinAI, which, according to a small display off to the side of the two new SUVs VinFast unveiled at the show, is a separate legal entity that is working on what appears to be an in-car AI that can track your movements in the driver&#8217;s seat to determine whether you&#8217;re paying attention, looking at your phone or drowsy. The system also uses sensors and cameras to determine obstacles like pedestrians and scooters outside the vehicle and help avoid crashes.</p>
<h2>Two electric SUVs for the global market</h2>
<p>The VinFast VFe35 and VFe36, both electric vehicles, will be built in VinFast&#8217;s massive, 90% automated manufacturing facility in Vietnam. The two vehicles were designed in partnership with automotive brand Pininfarina. That name likely sounds familiar &#8212; Pininfarina is known for designing classic Ferraris as well as the Pininfarina Battista, an electric sports car that costs $2 million.</p>
<p>VinFast said that the SUVs will be able to travel around 300 miles on a charge, though it did not reveal any charging or capacity details on Wednesday. Nguyen added that there will be two versions of each vehicle, the Eco and Plus models. She said that the VFe35 will have a range of around 285 miles in the Eco model and 310 miles in the Plus model. The larger VFe36 Eco model will get around 310 miles and the Plus will get around 420 miles of range, she said.</p>
<p>The two SUVs on the stage at the LA Auto Show are both prototypes, and the spec sheet shows that the VFe35 and VFe36 prototypes appear to have 402 hp and 472 lb-ft of torque, a variety of airbags, a virtual assistant, &#8220;remote control by VinFast App,&#8221; an e-commerce service, video game, in-car office and something called location-based and behavioral advertising.</p>
<p>Nguyen said that VinFast is working closely with a number of partners. While she wouldn&#8217;t disclose the battery supplier, she said the cells are from a &#8220;very, very famous company.&#8221;</p>
<p>The battery packs will be made at VinFast&#8217;s facility in Vietnam. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been working closely with our battery partners like ProLogium and few others as well,&#8221; she added. &#8220;We have selected very good and experienced partners on battery technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>ProLogium is a solid-state battery manufacturer based in Taiwan.</p>
<p>VinFast says that the two vehicles will have a suite of standard advanced driver assistance systems, a full-color head-up display, and a 15.5-inch touchscreen that can be changed to display your favorite photo in &#8220;zen mode&#8221; with a swipe of your finger.</p>
<p>We weren&#8217;t allowed to open the doors of either vehicle on the floor at the LA Auto Show. The smaller VFe35 had what appeared to be a real interior, but no digital cluster in front of the steering wheel, while the VFe36 had no interior.</p>
<p>VinFast plans to sell only electric vehicles in the U.S., and its rapid four-year path to vehicle production is almost unheard of in the automotive industry. The company said that deliveries of vehicles will start at the end of 2022. We&#8217;ll have to wait until next year to see just how it all shakes out.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Pentagon announced a limited request for bids for a new cloud initiative today that replaces the cancelled $10 billion, decade-long JEDI contract initiative. You may recall (or not) that it previously ran a winner-take-all bid it had dubbed JEDI (short for Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure). The new initiative goes by the much less catchy [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Pentagon <a href="https://sam.gov/opp/dbc25be4a53746a19ecf7ed14863ffdd/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a limited request for bids</a> for a new cloud initiative today that replaces <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nobody-wins-as-dod-finally-pulls-the-plug-on-controversial-10b-jedi-contract/">the cancelled $10 billion</a>, decade-long JEDI contract initiative. You may recall (or not) that it previously ran a winner-take-all bid it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/15/why-the-pentagons-10-billion-jedi-deal-has-cloud-companies-going-nuts/">dubbed JEDI</a> (short for Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure). The new initiative goes by the much less catchy name, Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability, or JWCC for short.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the RFP, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Oracle have been invited to bid. That multi-vendor approach is markedly different from the JEDI RFP, where just a single vendor was going to walk away with the prize. In fact, the Pentagon makes clear that while it favors Amazon and Microsoft, any of the qualified (invited) vendors could get a piece of this deal.</p>
<p>As the RFP states, &#8220;The Government anticipates awarding two IDIQ contracts &#8212; one to Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) and one to Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) &#8212; but intends to award to all Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) that demonstrate the capability to meet DoD’s requirements.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237292" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It appears it limited the number of vendors involved because after researching its requirements, the Pentagon found that there were a limited number of companies out there capable of meeting them. &#8220;Market research indicates that a limited number of sources are capable of meeting the Department’s requirements. Currently, the Department is aware of only five U.S.-based hyperscale CSPs (cloud service providers). Furthermore, only two of those hyperscale CSPs &#8212; AWS and Microsoft &#8212; appear to be capable of meeting all of the DoD’s requirements at this time, including providing cloud services at all levels of national security classification.&#8221;</p>
<p>The government is still working out the pricing for this one, but with multiple vendors involved, it&#8217;s entirely possible that it will exceed the $10 billion price tag of the now-defunct JEDI contract. &#8220;The Department is still evaluating the contract ceiling for this procurement, but anticipates that a multi-billion dollar ceiling will be required. The contract ordering ceiling will be included in any directed solicitations issued to vendors.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that each company that wins an award under the terms of the RFP will get a three-year contract for its piece, with two one-year option periods.</p>
<p>JEDI was mired in controversy from the start as top cloud vendors jockeyed for position, and lesser ones also tried to get into the act. There was much drama, complaints <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-04/oracle-s-catz-is-said-to-raise-amazon-contract-fight-with-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the president</a>, complaints <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/president-throws-latest-wrench-in-10b-jedi-cloud-contract-selection-process/">from the president</a>, complaints <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/in-latest-jedi-contract-drama-aws-files-motion-to-stop-work-on-project/">about presidential interference</a>, formal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/dod-inspector-general-report-finds-everything-was-basically-hunky-dory-with-jedi-cloud-contract-bid/">inquiries galore</a> and several <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/oracle-loses-10b-jedi-cloud-contract-appeal-yet-again/">lawsuits</a>. In the end, in spite of everyone believing that Amazon would win the bid, it didn&#8217;t. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/25/in-a-victory-over-amazon-microsoft-wins-10b-pentagon-jedi-cloud-contract/">Microsoft did</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But that wasn&#8217;t the end, and the two companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/microsoft-and-aws-exchange-poisoned-pen-blog-posts-in-latest-pentagon-jedi-contract-spat/">went to the mat</a> over the decision, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/judge-halts-microsoft-work-on-jedi-contract-after-aws-request/">ending up in court, </a>of course. Eventually the Pentagon tired of the whole thing and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nobody-wins-as-dod-finally-pulls-the-plug-on-controversial-10b-jedi-contract/">decided to scrap the project</a> altogether.</p>
<p>That didn&#8217;t mean, however, that the military&#8217;s requirement to modernize its computing systems went away just because the contract did. That&#8217;s why today, the Pentagon announced the new initiative to push technology modernization involving cloud infrastructure back to the forefront.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that <a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/amazon-microsoft-google-grab-the-big-numbers-but-rest-of-cloud-market-still-grows-by-27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Synergy Research</a>, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/cloud-infrastructure-market-hits-180b-run-rate-in-q3-as-even-chip-shortages-cant-slow-it-down/">of Q3 earnings reports</a>, the top three vendors &#8212; Amazon, Microsoft and Google account for 70% of the market share. Amazon leads the cloud infrastructure market with 33% market share, Microsoft follows with around 20% and Google is in third with 10%. Oracle is in the low single digits, according to Synergy.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Did you know your company’s data privacy practices can be a competitive differentiator? Usually, we think of competitive differentiators around the level of service you provide, the quality of your products or even the price point for your solutions.</p>
<p>However, no matter the industry, if you participate in the ecosystem of personal data, how you handle that data could make or break your business — literally — which means it can also help set you apart from competitors.</p>
<p>Consumers today <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/the-consumer-data-opportunity-and-the-privacy-imperative">mistrust</a> how companies use their data and will only share personal information for transactions they view as important, such as those in the healthcare or financial services industries.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236555" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But winning the trust of consumers often goes hand-in-hand with winning their business: <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/the-consumer-data-opportunity-and-the-privacy-imperative">87% of surveyed U.S. consumers</a> said they would not do business with a company if they had concerns with its privacy practices. Amid this lack of trust, companies like Google and Apple are taking proactive steps to position themselves favorably with consumers: Third-party cookies going by the wayside and the release of iOS 15 are two stark examples of this.</p>
<p>For other players in the data landscape, it’s critical to reevaluate your practices as well. Whether your company is just starting out or has an established market presence, there are specific actions you can take to position your company for success, and it all starts with developing and publishing a data ethics framework.</p>
<h2>Assess how customers want their data treated</h2>
<p>A data ethics framework is a set of guiding principles for how your company collects, stores, uses and deletes data. This framework will differ for each individual company based on the industry it sits in and the customers it interacts with, but at the most basic level, it must consist of what you believe and how you act.</p>
<p>The first step in creating this framework is understanding what the expectation is from your customers and data subjects around how they want their data treated. We call this the Platinum Rule: treating people’s data the way <em>they</em> want it to be treated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What consents have they provided? Are there any gaps in how you communicate how their data is used? Do you have processes in place for not only ethically collecting data but deleting it as well?</p>
<p>Evaluate your privacy policies and the experience consumers have with them (i.e., if they’re easy to comprehend) to understand at a granular level how consumers want their data treated.</p>
<h2>Hire a chief data ethics officer</h2>
<p>Hiring a chief data ethics officer (CDEO) to steward the creation of a data ethics framework is also a key step. Unlike a chief data officer, who must manage data and draw business value from it, the CDEO is primarily responsible for ensuring data is used ethically by all employees and partners.</p>
<p>By dedicating a member of the executive team to this specific task, your company is showing that you’re not just talking about data ethics because it’s the right thing to do &#8212; you’re making an investment to ensure data ethics are upheld.</p>
<p>Part of the CDEO’s mandate will be to create the data ethics framework, but it shouldn’t just be up to them — your entire executive team, including the CEO, CISO, CMO, head of product and engineering, and chief data scientists must be involved. Each of these stakeholders plays a role in the data ecosystem and must be part of the development of data ethics principles so there’s buy-in from all parts of the organization. Privacy practices are a core concern that each of these players is typically involved with; now, they must be involved with data ethics as well.</p>
<h2>Evaluate your organization’s data practices</h2>
<p>When the team is assembled that will contribute to crafting your organization’s data ethics framework, it’s now time to get a granular understanding of your data inventory process: what you collect, how you collect it and where you store it.</p>
<p>This technical understanding of what you do with data is something your company should already understand from a legal perspective. Ensure that all stakeholders are clear and aligned with this process.</p>
<p>However, if processes must be changed, now is the time to do so. For example, if you review your privacy policies and realize they’re too lengthy, difficult to understand or something users just click through without absorbing the information, it may be necessary to redesign how you present privacy consent forms.</p>
<p>Rather than sharing a big block of text filled with legal jargon, consider a layered approach that uses colloquial language and visuals, organizing the information in a more digestible way. By presenting this information to users in a way they can understand, your company is on its way to operating more ethically.</p>
<h2>Operationalize your data ethics framework</h2>
<p>Now it’s time for your executive team to align on how your company acts and, at a philosophical level, what you want it to become or do — this is the basis of your framework.</p>
<p>You should outline specific actions your company takes to uphold ethical data practices today by publishing data ethics principles. But remember: The data landscape is constantly evolving, which means your data ethics framework should as well. Creating a set of guiding principles that can be revised and refined over time is key.</p>
<p>These principles must be disseminated to all internal and external stakeholders for your framework to take effect. Make prospective job applicants aware of your data ethics principles through the job description or other means so that before they even start working for your company, they understand how critical ethical practices are.</p>
<p>Once candidates are hired, ensure data ethics discussions are part of onboarding. Provide ongoing training on a company and department level and make data ethics a foundational matter of employee conduct. It’s not enough to just make the principles available to read — every employee from the CEO to interns should be accountable for ethical data practices.</p>
<p>Your partners, suppliers, data processors and customers should be aware of these practices as well. By making ethical data management part of any business discussion, you can set expectations and ensure your company aligns itself with other players in the industry who operate ethically. And when data ethics principles are readily available for any customer or partner to access, you’ll be operating in a transparent way, which demonstrates nothing nefarious is happening behind the scenes.</p>
<h2>Don’t wait to get started</h2>
<p>It’s never too late to create and implement a data ethics framework, but the best step a company can take is implementing this framework from the outset of the business.</p>
<p>For early-stage startups, this is good news — it can be very difficult to insert this framework into business functions that are already in motion. For more established brands, it may be trickier to implement, but the sooner you do, the better off your company will be.</p>
<p>Once a data ethics framework is in place, remember to continuously evaluate the accuracy and quality of your data. If you leverage outdated, incomplete or inaccurate data, you could risk losing customer trust, undermining all the work your company has done to operate more ethically.</p>
<p>With continuous improvement and accountability, businesses can win trust and be set up for long-term success.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Funding for startups is on fire. But sometimes to get that funding, particularly after the seed round, startups need to have their financial house in order.</p>
<p>In the early stages, leaders are usually laser-focused on three key areas: developing their product or service, getting sales and generating cash flow. They can’t afford to invest in the wrong areas, including the wrong people and positions. Most don’t see hiring a CFO as a burning need yet, since an experienced CFO can command a big salary.</p>
<p>Fractional CFOs are the answer for a growing number of small companies. By bringing on a part-time CFO, a startup can get the benefits of having a veteran finance leader they likely couldn’t afford or even attract at such an early stage.</p>
<p>Typically, a business will bring on a fractional CFO for a limited time frame, often to help it mature its finance operations and secure its next round of funding. After that point, the company might hire an in-house CFO and accounting team.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Fractional CFOs are a short-term bridge, and they generally aren’t angling for a full-time job.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Now that so many companies have adjusted to working remotely, some are keeping fractional CFOs on longer. For example, one of our customers, Countsy, provides outsourced CFOs and entire accounting and HR departments for startups and growing companies in the technology and life-science industries. Its business is booming right now.</p>
<p>Whether a fractional CFO is hired for the short term or for an extended stay, companies are seeing that bringing in this expertise early on can truly change their trajectory.</p>
<p>Working with businesses in a variety of industries, I see those that bring in a fractional CFO benefit in three key ways:</p>
<h2>1. Expertise and connections</h2>
<p>It often makes sense for ambitious companies to look for outside expertise to get their finances in order while they focus on building products and ramping up sales. Most fractional CFOs have served as a company CFO in the past, and many have a background in private equity or venture capital and have steered startups to successful exits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Data Protection Board (EDPB), an expert steering body which advises EU lawmakers on how to interpret rules wrapping citizen&#8217;s personal data, has warned the bloc&#8217;s legislators that a package of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">incoming digital regulations</a> risks damaging people&#8217;s fundamental rights &#8212; without &#8220;decisive action&#8221; to amend the suite of proposals.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The reference is to draft rules covering digital platform governance and accountability (the Digital Services Act; DSA);</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> proposals for ex ante rules for internet gatekeepers (the Digital Markets Act; DMA), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/europe-sets-out-the-rules-of-the-road-for-its-data-reuse-plan/">the Data Governance Act</a> (DGA), which aims to encourage data reuse as an engine for innovation and AI; and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">Regulation on a European approach for Artificial Intelligence</a> (AIR), which sets out a risk-based framework for regulating applications of AI. </span></p>
<p>The EDPB&#8217;s analysis further suggests that the package of pan-EU digital rules updates will be hampered by fragmented oversight and legal inconsistencies &#8212; potentially conflicting with existing EU data protection law unless clarified to avoid harmfully inconsistent interpretations.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237189" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Most notably, in a <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-11/edpb_statement_on_the_digital_services_package_and_data_strategy_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> published today following a plenary meeting yesterday, the EDPB makes a direct call for EU legislators to implement stricter regulations on targeted advertising in favor of alternatives that do not require the tracking and profiling of internet users &#8212; going on to call for lawmakers to consider &#8220;a phase-out leading to a prohibition of targeted advertising on the basis of pervasive tracking&#8221;.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the EDPB statement urges that the profiling of children for ad targeting should &#8220;overall be prohibited&#8221;.</p>
<p>As it happens, the European Parliament&#8217;s internal market and consumer protection (IMCO) committee was today <a href="https://multimedia.europarl.europa.eu/en/committee-on-internal-market-and-consumer-protection_20211119-1000-COMMITTEE-IMCO_vd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holding a hearing</a> to discuss targeted advertising, as MEPs consider amendments to a wider digital regulation package known as the Digital Services Act (DSA).</p>
<p>There has been a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/">push by a number of MEPs</a> for an outright ban on tracking-based ads to be added to the DSA package &#8212; given rising concern about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/international-coalition-joins-the-call-to-ban-surveillance-advertising/">myriad harms flowing from surveillance-based ads</a>, from ad fraud to individual manipulation and democratic erosion (to name a few).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="rRwXoTOyoJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/">Inside a European push to outlaw creepy ads</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Inside a European push to outlaw creepy ads&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/embed/#?secret=rRwXoTOyoJ" data-secret="rRwXoTOyoJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>However MEPs speaking during the IMCO committee hearing today suggested there would not be overall support in the Parliament to ban tracking ads &#8212; despite compelling testimony from a range of speakers articulating the harms of surveillance-based advertising and calling out the adtech industry for misleading lobbying on the issue by seeking to conflate targeting and tracking.</p>
<p>While retail lobbyist Ilya Bruggeman did speak up for tracking and profiling &#8212; parroting the big adtech platforms&#8217; claim that SMEs rely on privacy invasive ads &#8212; other speakers at the committee session aligned with <a href="https://twitter.com/ka_iwanska/status/1461708650897190927" target="_blank" rel="noopener">civil society</a> in challenging the line.</p>
<p>Johnny Ryan, a former adtech industry insider (now a fellow at the <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICCL</a>) &#8212; who has filed numerous GDPR complaints against real-time bidding (RTB)&#8217;s rampant misuse of personal data, dubbing it the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/irelands-data-watchdog-slammed-for-letting-adtech-carry-on-biggest-breach-of-all-time/">biggest security breach in history</a> &#8212; kicked off his presentation with a pointed debunking of industry spin, telling MEPs that the issue isn&#8217;t, as the title of the session had it, &#8220;targeted ads&#8221;; rather the problem boils down to &#8220;tracking-based ads&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can have targeting, without having tracking,&#8221; he told MEPs, warning: &#8220;The industry that makes money from tracking wants you to think otherwise. So let&#8217;s correct that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The direction of travel of the European Parliament on behavioral ads (i.e. tracking-based targeting) in relation to another key digital package, the gatekeeper-targeting DMA, also looks like it will eschew a ban for general users in favor of beefing up consent requirements. Which sounds like great news for purveyors of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/01/wtf-is-dark-pattern-design/"> dark pattern design</a>.</p>
<p>That said, MEPs do appear to be considering a prohibition on tracking and profiling of minors for ad targeting &#8212; which raises questions of how that could be implemented without robust age verification also being implemented across all Internet services&#8230; Which, er, is not at all the case currently &#8212; nor in most people&#8217;s favored versions of the Internet. (The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/">U.K. government might like it though</a>.)</p>
<p>So, if that ends up making it into the final version of the DMA, one way for services to comply/shrink their risk (i.e. of being accused of ad-targeting minors) could be for them to switch off tracking ads for all users by default &#8212; unless they really have robustly age-verified a specific user is an adult. (So maybe adtech platforms like Facebook would start requiring users to upload a national ID to use their &#8220;free&#8221; services in this version of the future&#8230; )</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In light of MEPs&#8217; tentativeness, the EDPB&#8217;s intervention looks significant &#8212; although the body does not have lawmaking powers itself.</p>
<p>But by urging EU co-legislators to take &#8220;decisive action&#8221; it&#8217;s firing a clear shot across the Council, Parliament and Commission&#8217;s bows to screw their courage to the sticking place and avoid the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/digging-into-googles-push-to-freeze-eprivacy/">bear-pit of lobbying self-interest</a>; and remember that alternative forms of (contextually targeted) online advertising are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/data-from-dutch-public-broadcaster-shows-the-value-of-ditching-creepy-ads/">available</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/on-a-growth-tear-duckduckgo-reveals-it-picked-up-100m-in-secondary-investment-last-year/">And profitable</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our concerns consist of three categories: (1) lack of protection of individuals’ fundamental rights and freedoms; (2) fragmented supervision; and (3) risks of inconsistencies,&#8221; the Board writes in the statement, going on to warn that it &#8220;considers that, without further amendments, the proposals will negatively impact the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and lead to significant legal uncertainty that would undermine both the existing and future legal framework&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;As such, the proposals may fail to create the conditions for innovation and economic growth envisaged by the proposals themselves,&#8221; it also warns.</p>
<p>The EDPB&#8217;s concerns for citizens&#8217; fundamental rights also encompass the Commission&#8217;s proposal to regulate high-risk applications of artificial intelligence, with the body saying the draft AI Regulation does not go far enough to prevent the development of AI systems that are intended to categorize individuals &#8212; such as by using their biometrics (e.g. facial recognition) and according to ethnicity, gender and/or political or sexual orientation, or other prohibited grounds of discrimination.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EDPB considers that such systems should be prohibited in the EU and calls on the co-legislators to include such a ban in the AIR,&#8221; it writes. &#8220;Furthermore, the EDPB considers that the use of AI to infer emotions of a natural person is highly undesirable and should be prohibited, except for certain well-specified use-cases, namely for health or research purposes, subject to appropriate safeguards, conditions and limits.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Board has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/ban-biometric-surveillance-in-public-to-safeguard-rights-urge-eu-bodies/">reiterated its earlier call</a> for a ban on the use of AI for remote biometric surveillance in public places &#8212; following a joint statement with the European Data Protection Supervisor back in June.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/european-parliament-backs-ban-on-remote-biometric-surveillance/">MEPs have also previously voted for a ban</a> on remote biometric surveillance.</p>
<p>The Commission proposal offered a very tepid, caveated restriction which has been widely criticized as insufficient.</p>
<p>&#8220;[G]iven the significant adverse effect for individuals’ fundamental rights and freedoms, the EDPB reiterates that the AIR should include a ban on any use of AI for an automated recognition of human features in publicly accessible spaces &#8212; such as of faces but also of gait, fingerprints, DNA, voice, keystrokes and other biometric or behavioural signals &#8212; in any context,&#8221; the Board writes in the statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The proposed AIR currently allows for the use of real-time remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement in certain cases. The EDPB welcomes the recently adopted EP Resolution where the significant risks are highlighted.&#8221;</p>

<p>On oversight, the EDBP sounds concerned about data protection bodies being bypassed by the bloc&#8217;s ambitious flotilla of digital regulations updates &#8212; urging &#8220;complementarity in oversight&#8221; to enhance legal certainty, as well as emphasizing the need for DPAs to be provided with &#8220;sufficient resources to perform these additional tasks&#8221;. (A perennial problem in an age of ever bigger data.)</p>
<p>Legal certainty would also be improved by including explicit references to existing data protection legislation (such as the GDPR and ePrivacy Directive), it argues, to avoid the risk of incoming data packages weakening core concepts of the GDPR such as consent to data processing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It also creates the risk that certain provisions could be read as deviating from the GDPR or the ePrivacy Directive. Consequently, certain provisions could easily be interpreted in a manner that is inconsistent with the existing legal framework and subsequently lead to legal uncertainty,&#8221; the Board warns.</p>
<p>So far from the EU&#8217;s much vaunted digital regulation reboot strengthening protections for citizens &#8212; to boost their trust in data-driven services &#8212; there is, failing some very key amendments, a risk of death by a thousand cuts (and/or regulatory complexity) to foundational fundamental rights, with potentially ruinous consequences for the bloc&#8217;s much proclaimed &#8220;European values&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In January, <a href="https://www.sabre.com/insights/releases/sabre-forges-10-year-partnership-with-google-to-build-the-future-of-travel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sabre</a>, the travel technology company that probably managed at least some aspects of your last flight and hotel bookings, announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/google-cloud-lands-lufthansa-group-and-sabre-as-new-customers/">10-year partnership with Google Cloud</a> that would see it spend about $2 billion on Google&#8217;s cloud platform over that time. Sabre, like so many companies of its size, has long operated its own data centers, so any shift to the cloud would be a major undertaking. But while the story for a lot of big enterprises is all about being multi-cloud, Sabre is squarely betting on a single partner.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joedifonzo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe DiFonzo</a>, Sabre&#8217;s CIO, told me that this is the result of quite a bit of learning. When he joined Sabre in 2017, the company&#8217;s leadership had already decided on moving more workloads to the cloud. For Sabre, with its eight mainframes and more than 35,000 servers, that was never going to be a trivial undertaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was this whole element of how we operate our software, how we deploy our products, how we deliver service to customers, that was very much still sort of stuck in the traditional models, [including how you] run your own data center and the massive supply chain management issues around that, how we deploy software and package it, this notion of physical machine environments, that sort of thing,&#8221; he explained.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236668" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6LcRTPw25M"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/google-cloud-lands-lufthansa-group-and-sabre-as-new-customers/">Google Cloud lands Lufthansa Group and Sabre as new customers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google Cloud lands Lufthansa Group and Sabre as new customers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/google-cloud-lands-lufthansa-group-and-sabre-as-new-customers/embed/#?secret=6LcRTPw25M" data-secret="6LcRTPw25M" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With buy-in from the leadership, he set to move the company to not only the cloud but also a modern development model. And like so many other companies, Sabre started making deals with a number of cloud providers, mostly because the team wasn&#8217;t sure yet who to bet on &#8212; or whether to opt for a multi-cloud approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were able to start making that journey, but we had not done a lot in the cloud before. So, originally, we went on path where we made deals with all the major cloud providers. We were thinking: well, let&#8217;s go down the multi-cloud path until we see if there&#8217;s something better, because, quite frankly, we didn&#8217;t know what we didn&#8217;t know and we didn&#8217;t want to make the mistake of committing to anybody too early.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while the leadership was behind the move, DiFonzo felt like he had to get an early win, in part because the company&#8217;s customers also had to be on board. For that, the team picked one of Sabre&#8217;s most important and most CPU-intensive services: its shopping application, which previously ran in its own Tulsa, Oklahoma data center. That&#8217;s where a lot of revenue for Sabre&#8217;s customers is generated, so by being able to show improved performance and stability for this service, the team was able to build up credibility for the rest of its roadmap.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But by mid-2018, the team realized that using multiple clouds became a limiting factor. While all of the different providers offered a plethora of interesting services, being multi-cloud meant the team had to limit itself to the lowest common denominator across the different providers.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you didn&#8217;t take the least common denominator approach, then you&#8217;d have this massive problem of having to train your entire staff on three different sets of architectures, three different groups of databases, three different types of messaging mechanisms, and on and on and on,&#8221; DiFonzo said. &#8220;So we really came back to, &#8216;hey, given where the cloud vendors are today &#8212; and this is two years from the initial point &#8212; do we really have a lack of confidence that any one of them really could fulfill our needs?'&#8221;</p>
<p>After an extensive search, the team decided to go with Google Cloud, based on its technology offerings and road map, but also because of Google&#8217;s acquisition of ITA, which gave it unique insights into how the travel space operates. Sabre was also interested in Google&#8217;s AI technologies, as well as Apigee&#8217;s ability to help Sabre manage its APIs &#8212; and, as DiFonzo noted, both companies also had similar engineering mindsets.</p>
<p>Even with hindsight, more than two years later and with new multi-cloud tools available like Google&#8217;s own Anthos or Microsoft&#8217;s Azure Arc, DiFonzo believes he would make the same decision. Indeed, Sabre actually uses parts of Anthos to manage its applications inside of Google&#8217;s environment. But maybe most importantly, DiFonzo argues, going with a single vendor allows its engineering teams to focus.</p>
<p>So far, Sabre has trained more than 3,600 employees on Google Cloud (and those employees have consumed over 67,000 hours of learning content on Coursera alone).</p>
<p>At this point, about 15% of Sabre&#8217;s mid-range workloads have been migrated to Google&#8217;s cloud, including 100% of its Hotel Customer Reservation System and Travel Solutions airfare shopping service.</p>
<p>That may be slower than some expected. A report in The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-a-2-billion-google-cloud-contract-has-generated-only-10-million-in-revenue-so-far" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier this year</a> noted that Sabre had only spent about $10 million on Google Cloud so far. But DiFonzo argues that nobody should be surprised by this, and that the last year was all about laying the foundations, with the move now accelerating. Indeed, he expects that 75% of Sabre&#8217;s total compute capacity will be powered by Google Cloud by the end of next year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It took the time of training and building all the infrastructure &#8212; because our goal isn&#8217;t to just move machines immediately, it&#8217;s to be more efficient at the end of the day. All of the automation work and all of the planning work that went into this is now helping us move forward faster,&#8221; he said. That also means that the team is decomposing old applications into microservices, for example &#8212; which itself means that engineering and operations teams have to learn new skills. So it&#8217;s not just about containerizing existing applications, but also moving some applications to a serverless architecture using Google Cloud Functions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to take a little bit more work on our part to validate all that &#8212; performance and operation and scale, etc. But certainly, that just goes to the next level of how we continue to virtualize away a lot of the routine day-to-day management activities we have to deal with today,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>As for bringing more AI-powered services to its customers, DiFonzo noted that he doesn&#8217;t want to have to build all of the infrastructure to do so. Together, Saber and Google are developing a new AI-driven platform to bring more of this technology to Sabre&#8217;s product portfolio. Sabre is also in the process of moving 11 petabytes from its core data sets to Google Cloud (with all data migrating by 2023), and it&#8217;s about to launch a new market intelligence product that uses BigQuery and Looker to predict travel demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to stand on the shoulders of giants,&#8221; DiFonzo explained. &#8220;They have tens of thousands of engineers figuring out all this cool stuff. And I just want to put it to use as quickly and safely as we can here at Sabre.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hulu is getting a sizable upgrade starting next month that will give its Live TV subscribers access to both the Disney+ and ESPN+ streaming services as part of their plan. Beginning on December 21, 2021, Hulu + Live TV subscriptions across both its ad-free and ad-supported tiers will bundle in access to Disney&#8217;s other streaming services for a small &#8212; but not optional &#8212; upcharge.</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/how-much-does-hulu-cost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plans</a> will increase by $5 per month, the company says.</p>
<p>That means the Hulu + Live TV Ad-Supported plan will now be $69.99 per month instead of $64.99 per month, while the Hulu +  Live TV No Ads plan will now be $75.99 per month, instead of $70.99 per month.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236903" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While generally, streaming subscribers don&#8217;t appreciate the constant fee hikes they&#8217;ve been seeing, a $5 increase to add on two more major streaming services may be viewed a bit differently. By itself, a Disney+ subscription would have otherwise cost either $7.99 per month or $79.99 per year. Meanwhile, ESPN+ is priced at either $6.99 per month, or $69.99 per year. If you subscribed to at least one of those separately from your Hulu + Live TV plan, you&#8217;ll be saving money.</p>
<p>Before this change, all three services had been separately marketing <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/disney-hulu-espn-bundle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the &#8220;Disney bundle,</a>&#8221; which combined Disney+ and ESPN+ with Hulu&#8217;s regular ad-supported or ad-free plan for $13.99 per month or $19.99 per month, respectively. However, this combo had left out Hulu + Live TV subscribers from accessing a similar bundle discount.</p>
<p>Of course, the current Disney bundle is something consumers can opt into if they want to combine multiple services onto one bill. Hulu + Live TV is being upgraded automatically.</p>
<p>Despite the combination, users will still need different apps. While ESPN+ content <a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/hulu-disney-espn-bundle#watch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was already made available</a> in the Hulu app, users will still need to visit a separate app to access Disney+. Hulu will email users an activation link for adding Disney+, it says, and will include this link in users&#8217; account settings for easy access.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company also notes that existing subscribers will not need to cancel Disney+ or ESPN+, if they were already subscribed. As long as the email addresses on file for both accounts are the same &#8212; and they&#8217;re paying through Hulu (not a carrier) &#8212; the subscriptions will be connected automatically. For applicable subscribers, Hulu will issue a credit for the retail value of each existing subscription on their first regular billing cycle on or after December 21.</p>
<p>Disney has been working to further capitalize on its Hulu investment since its 2019 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/20/disney-closes-it-71-3b-fox-acquisition/">acquisition</a> of Fox and subsequent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/15/hulu-buys-back-atts-minority-stake-in-streaming-service-now-valued-at-15-billion/">buyback</a> of AT&amp;T&#8217;s 9.3% stake <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/hulu-disney-comcast/">gave it full operational control</a> of Hulu. In the time since, it&#8217;s changed the organizational structure, raised prices and combined some content libraries.</p>
<p>Last year, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/03/hulu-restructures-under-disney-ceo-randy-freer-departs/">restructured</a> Hulu to streamline executives&#8217; reporting structure to be directed to Disney&#8217;s Direct to Consumer and International chairman, which was then Kevin Mayer. (Mayer shortly thereafter left to run TikTok in the U.S., then <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-ceo-kevin-mayer-resigns-control-acquisition-bytedance-zhang-yiming-2020-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quit</a> amid the Trump-induced &#8220;TikTok ban&#8221; drama. <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/leaders/rebecca-campbell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebecca Campbell</a> <a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/rebecca-campbell-disney-kevin-mayer-direct-to-consumer-international-1234611583/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">succeeded</a> him at Disney.)</p>
<p>Disney this year <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/disney-phase-out-hotstar-us-espn-hulu-bundle-1235050111/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made the decision</a> to fold in Hotstar&#8217;s South Asian sports and entertainment programing into ESPN+ and Hulu, and shutter the standalone Hotstar U.S. service in 2022. The company also pushed price increases across its service, hiking Hulu + Live <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/hulu-will-increase-the-price-of-its-live-tv-service-again-on-december-18th/">by $10 more per month last December,</a> and <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/09/hulu-raises-prices-disney-ad-supported-premium-streaming-1234827203/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later</a> bumping up the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22661241/hulu-plans-ads-dollar-price-increase-monthly-subscription-disney" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hulu + Live service</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348169/disney-price-increase-united-states-bundle-date" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disney+</a>, ESPN+ and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348169/disney-price-increase-united-states-bundle-date" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disney bundle</a> by $1 more per month in 2021.</p>
<p>Today, Disney+ is larger and growing faster than the Hulu business. As of Disney&#8217;s fiscal Q4 2021 <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/app/uploads/2021/11/q4-fy21-earnings.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earnings</a>, Disney+ had 118.1 million subscribers, up 60% year-over-year, while Hulu combined business had 43.8 million subscribers, up 20% year-over-year. Hulu&#8217;s Live TV business is the smallest tier of Hulu, with just 4 million subscribers. That&#8217;s down from 4.1 million year-over-year &#8212; an indication that today&#8217;s consumers may see a declining value in live TV content. (It&#8217;s still larger than Sling TV, however, which <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/dish-network-dish-q3-earnings-145702640.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has 2.56 million</a> subscribers.)</p>
<p>This new bundle could give Hulu + Live TV&#8217;s numbers a boost, if it incentivizes upgrades or new sign-ups, as Disney hopes. Or it may end up being one price hike too many, leading to further cancellations as users drop down to the more affordable Disney bundle, which doesn&#8217;t have live TV.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The market for crypto-focused investing is growing rapidly. News that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/crypto-vc-firm-paradigm-debuts-monster-2-5-billion-fund/">Paradigm put together a $2.5 billion fund</a> the other day is a reminder of the scale of funds now available to startups looking to build on the blockchain. Andreessen Horowitz <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/andreessen-horowitz-triples-down-on-blockchain-startups-with-massive-2-2-billion-crypto-fund-iii/">has a mega-fund in the market as well</a>, while Coinbase Ventures is <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase-ventures/recent_investments">setting a blistering pace</a> for a corporate venture firm.</p>
<p>The result of the run-up in capital availability has led to, as in many other venture markets, larger and more rapid-fire rounds &#8212; and more unicorns.</p>
<p>While the now-dated unicorn valuation threshold of $1 billion is losing some of its salience in a market where there are hundreds of unicorns globally, inside a single niche the metric can still prove useful. The crypto market is one such place.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/">The Block</a>, a crypto-focused publication <a href="https://www.theblockresearch.com/">and research operation</a>, has <a href="https://www.theblockresearch.com/mapping-out-the-blockchain-unicorns-124025">a new data collection</a> out this morning that highlights just how rapidly the unicorn cohort is expanding in the crypto space. The data set also details where unicorns are being formed, in both focus terms &#8212; exchanges, NFT platforms, etc. &#8212; and geographically.</p>
<p>Key takeaways today are that the United States, despite certain domestic complaints that it is hostile to the crypto economy, is by far the dominant single market for crypto unicorn creation, and that the business-model mix of crypto unicorns is broader than I anticipated. Let&#8217;s dig in!</p>
<h2>Money</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s the perfect moment to discuss crypto unicorns, and not because Paradigm just secured billions to invest. Furthermore, rumor is out that OpenSea, an NFT platform, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/co-founder-titles-arent-a-formality-theyre-a-morality/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">considering raising capital at a $10 billion valuation</a>. The company was last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/nft-market-opensea-hits-1-5-billion-valuation/">valued at $1.5 billion earlier this year</a>. <em>That&#8217;s</em> the sort of valuation appreciation that some crypto startups are enjoying today.</p>
<p>The result? There are now 64 total crypto unicorns. And, per The Block Research, that figure has grown by 39 so far in 2021. Simply: More than half of the global crypto unicorns reached the $1 billion threshold this <em>year</em> alone.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why. Crypto trading has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/coinbase-crushes-q2-expectations-notes-q3-trading-volume-is-trending-lower/">proven to be nearly comedically lucrative</a>, leading to a number of exchanges <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2021/11/18/gemini-raises-400-million-to-protect-the-metaverse-from-meta-facebook/?sh=57e516b25f57">raising what we might describe as <em>hella bank</em></a>. But more than that, crypto assets themselves have proven to be profitable trades to host. NFT marketplaces are minting cash, adding more unicorns to the tally.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s The Block&#8217;s breakdown of today&#8217;s crypto unicorn model makeup:</p>
