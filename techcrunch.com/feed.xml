										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the prevalence of shopping malls and the emergence of VC-backed e-commerce companies like Jumia, informal retail in Africa is still king.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A <a href="https://www.pwc.co.za/en/assets/pdf/retail-in-africa.pdf">2016 study</a> by PwC states that 90% of sales in Africa&#8217;s major economies come through informal channels &#8212; markets and kiosks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This presents a large market ripe for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digitization,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and over the past five years, African startups have risen to the challenge, raising millions of dollars in the process. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, <a href="https://www.omnibiz.com/">Omnibiz</a>, a Lagos-based startup, joins the fray and has raised a seed round of $3 million to expand into new markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omnibiz is a B2B e-commerce platform that connects fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) manufacturers to retailers by digitizing the supply chain stakeholders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform offers a mobile app, WhatsApp channel and a phone number that retailers can use to stock their shops</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omnibiz says in a statement that retailers &#8220;can place orders at their convenience and have goods delivered to their doorstep at no cost</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omnibiz </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepankarrustagi">Deepankar Rustagi</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Indian founder and CEO who has stayed in Nigeria for over two decades started his first startup, VConnect, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2011 as an online marketplace and search engine to find local professionals for service needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform connected individuals with more than 100 services and over</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 500,000 listed businesses across the country before shutting down in 2017, Rustagi claims.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post-VConnect, Rustagi consulted for multiple FMCG brands</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He figured a need existed for manufacturers and retailers of goods to digitize their processes leading to the launch of Omnibiz in late 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omnibiz operates an asset-light retail distribution model. When a retailer makes an order on the Omnibiz platform, it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is requested</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from partner distributors who store goods on behalf of manufacturers and are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">traditionally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> known to help out with warehousing and transportation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Omnibiz, these distributors can focus </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">solely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on warehousing and pass on the responsibility of transporting goods to Omnibiz&#8217;s third-party logistics providers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drivers of these logistics providers use Omnibiz to efficiently distribute the orders to the retailers within</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 24 hours</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We work with manufacturers to provide visibility. Then buy goods from them and keep them in partner hubs that act as warehouses and distributors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, use the services of drivers that work with third-party logistics drivers who get paid on every delivery made,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; Rustagi told TechCrunch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digitizing this value chain helps retailers save working capital while Omnibiz connects them with more than 20 brands, including Coca-Cola, Nestlé, Kellogg&#8217;s, Unilever, Procter &amp; Gamble and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kimberly-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The B2B e-commerce retail company is currently in four cities across Nigeria &#8212; Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, and Kaduna</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company will add two more cities, Ibadan and Kano, before the end of August, Rustagi adds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Rustagi&#8217;s account, Omnibiz will feed off his experience at VConnect, his prior business that struggled to monetize and scale despite the huge traction it got as a popular local marketplace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We knew about small businesses and what sort of technology they like. That was our specialization, but our business model didn&#8217;t work. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in this case [Omnibiz], the monetization happens on our platform, and there&#8217;s money to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the small business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We&#8217;ve been growing 30% month-on-month for the last 12 months,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The B2B informal e-commerce market has seen a resurgence in the last couple of years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Kenya&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/tradedepot-adds-10-million-to-add-financial-services-to-its-supply-chain-services-for-african-smbs/">Sokowatch</a> and <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2020/10/30/kenyan-agri-tech-startup-twiga-foods-secures-29-4m-ifc-debt-funding-to-assist-its-farmers/">Twiga</a>, Nigeria&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/23/sokowatch-raises-14m-to-digitize-africas-informal-b2b-supply-chain/">TradeDepot</a> and Egypt&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/maxab-the-egyptian-b2b-food-and-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-40m-for-expansion/">MaxAB</a> have longed vied for market-leader positions in their respective markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic spiked more interest in their activities as all the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aforementioned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> startups have raised money this past year, including newcomers Kenya&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/kenyas-marketforce-raises-2m-plans-to-focus-on-its-b2b-retail-marketplace-rejareja/">MarketForce</a> and now Omnibiz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some operate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">asset-light models, while others take up the responsibility of managing the end-to-end digitization process. Rustagi believes the former is perfect for the company because </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it helps distributors expand their reach rather than eliminate them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> scaling in one city with assets is not that difficult. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you have to scale in 20, 24 cities in a country like Nigeria or Ghana, or Ivory Coast or East Africa, the investment required will be very high.&#8221; Rustagi continued.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> without significant investment in assets, we will be able to scale much faster. And since we took the tech-first approach, we have good control over the business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we&#8217;re in the right space and the right time with the right model.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omnibiz&#8217;s seed round </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was led by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> V&amp;R Africa, Timon Capital and Tangerine Insurance. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round also included Lofty Inc., Musha Ventures, Sunu Capital, Launch Africa, and Rising Tide Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It takes the company&#8217;s total investment to $4 million. Rustagi also disclosed that the company also got funding from Seedstars and will participate in the accelerator&#8217;s growth program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Omnibiz will be the role model for B2B retail in Africa and can scale well into other emerging markets. We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and happy to be supporting Omnibiz in all ways beyond </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> providing capital,&#8221; Raj Kulasingam and Vishal Agarwal of V&amp;R Africa said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next few months, Omnibiz will use the investment to expand in other West African cities outside Nigeria &#8212;  Abidjan, Takoradi, Kumasi and Accra. Food, non-alcoholic beverages, personal care, and baby care products are the top categories on the Omnibiz platform. The company is planning to expand into new categories like alcoholic beverages and OTC pharmaceutical products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omnibiz will also use the investment </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to create new tech products that will enhance value for the retailers. The company will work with partners to increase the working capital availability for the retailers and digital tools to manage their business more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">efficiently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the key things we intend to do is to bring on medium-scale manufacturers who find it difficult to get the last-mile delivery to reach customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We want to scale them so they can reach a large number of retailers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s something we are rolling out so we can onboard more and more manufacturers,&#8221; said the CEO on Omnibiz&#8217;s next plans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robosoft Technologies, an India-headquartered app development studio, said on Tuesday it has reached a definitive agreement to sell the business to Japan’s IT services firm TechnoPro for $108 million.</p>
<p>Founded in 1996 in Udupi, a small town in the Southwest Indian state of Karnataka, <a href="https://www.robosoftin.com">Robosoft</a> Technologies started its journey as a software development firm.</p>
<p>It was one of the earliest firms globally to be certified as Mac OS developer by Apple and has been recognized by the iPhone-maker several times in the decades since.</p>
<p>“We knew mobile was going to be big with the launch of iPhone and the App Store ecosystem. We began building mobile apps for clients across the globe and there’s been no looking back,” the companies describes on its website.</p>
<p>Robosoft, which counts Ascent Capital and Kalaari Capital among its investors, has courted clients operating in several categories including games, news, sports, utilities and lifestyle and expanded its offerings to include product advisory, and tools for design, engineering and analytics.</p>
<p>The original app for the Indian news network NDTV, for instance, was developed by Robosoft. Some of its other clients include media giant Viacom and McDonald&#8217;s India. It has clients in the U.S. and Middle East as well.</p>
<p>In a statement on Tuesday, Robosoft said its current management team will continue to lead the firm. “Robosoft has had a phenomenal journey over the last two decades and has grown by leaps and bounds during this period. The partnership with Ascent Capital and Kalaari Capital heralded a strong growth era for us and I am very happy that we are handing over the reins of the Company to a global player like TechnoPro,” said Rohith Bhat, Founder and Managing Director of Robosoft.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We look forward to a close collaboration with Robosoft in the company’s next phase of growth and see tremendous synergies between TechnoPro and Robosoft,” said Takeshi Yagi, President and Representative Director and CEO of Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed firm TechnoPro.</p>

In 2003, FreshBooks’ co-founder Mike McDerment was running a small design agency. When it came to billing clients, he found Word and Excel frustrating to use and felt like they weren’t built to create professional-looking invoices. So he coded his own solution that became the foundation of what is now FreshBooks. The company was self-funded until </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2014, when McDerment decided to bring on outside investors and raised $30 million from Oak Investment Partners, Accomplice and Georgian Partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Don Epperson joined FreshBooks as executive director before transitioning to the role of CEO this year. McDerment, who previously held the position, remains as executive chair of the company.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FreshBooks has 500 employees in Canada, Croatia, Mexico, the Netherlands and the United States &#8212; hiring over 100 people in the past year. Also in the last year, the company entered the LatAm market </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">after acquiring Mexico-based e-invoicing company </span><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/09/23/2098093/0/en/FreshBooks-acquires-Mexico-Based-E-Invoicing-Company-Facturama-Further-Expanding-Its-International-Presence.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facturama in September 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an effort to expand its audience in Spanish-speaking markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FreshBooks plans to use its new capital toward sales and marketing, research and development and additional strategic acquisitions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company will also use its new funding toward investing in markets that are becoming more regulated and helping owners manage their finances through &#8220;simplistic workflows,&#8221; according to Epperson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, he said, more business owners are working to become digitally enabled to meet local tax and invoice compliance systems. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;The need for owners to manage their business digitally has accelerated, and this has changed how small business owners work with bookkeepers and accountants,&#8221; Epperson told TechCrunch. <span style="font-weight: 400;">“The funding comes as an injection of confidence in our mission to digitally enable small businesses.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187689" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187689" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2187689 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FreshBooks.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="419" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FreshBooks.jpg 726w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FreshBooks.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FreshBooks.jpg?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FreshBooks.jpg?resize=680,419 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FreshBooks.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187689" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> FreshBooks</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to growth metrics like year-over-year revenue percentage growth, the exec </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was tight-lipped, saying only that FreshBooks has “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seen significant growth” in the number of new customers since last year, in part fueled by a pandemic-driven increase in new small businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic also uncovered the need for us to understand how seismic events affect our customers, Epperson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After analyzing FreshBooks’ own proprietary data, we learned that businesses owned by women were taking three times longer to recover in the U.S. versus businesses owned by men,” Epperson said. “This stat laid the foundation for conducting more research into how the pandemic was affecting businesses across multiple industries and entering into</span><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/press/releases/freshbooks-announces-data-sharing-partnership-with-ontario-government-to-provide-insight-into-how-small-businesses-fared-during-covid-19"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> data-sharing partnerships with local governments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help policymakers enact change in the support available to small business owners.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Fagnan, founder and managing partner at Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Accomplice, is clearly bullish on FreshBooks’ potential, saying of his firm’s continued investments in the Canadian company over the past seven years: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more people choosing self-employment, the FreshBooks team fundamentally believes in the growth of small businesses, and the importance of helping these businesses scale. As insiders, we have better context for how the company is scaling and how the market is growing, and this is why FreshBooks is our largest investment to date.”</span></p>
<p>FreshBooks is the latest in a growing number of Toronto-based unicorns. Late last month, 1Password raised $100 million in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/1password-raises-100m-at-a-2b-valuation/">a Series B round of funding</a> that doubled the company’s valuation to $2 billion. 1Password first became a unicorn in 2019.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roughly a year ago, <a href="https://latentai.com/">Latent AI</a>, a now three-year-old, Menlo Park, Ca.-based startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/startup-battlefield-session-2-latent-ai/">pitched</a> a handful of investors during TechCrunch&#8217;s Battlefield competition. It <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/winner-startup-battlefield-disrupt-2020-200226359.html">didn&#8217;t win</a> that contest, but that hasn&#8217;t kept it from winning the interest of investors elsewhere. It just closed on $19 million in Series A funding in a round co-led by Future Ventures and Blackhorn Ventures, with participation from Booz Allen, Lockheed Martin, 40 North Ventures, and Autotech Ventures. The company has now raised $22.5 million altogether.</p>
<div>What are these backers funding exactly? The company says it makes software designed to train, adapt and deploy edge AI neural networks, irrespective of hardware constraints or the inexpensive chips that are typically found in edge devices. It also says it can compress common AI models by ten times without a noticeable change in accuracy, partly through an “attention mechanism” that enables it to save power and run only what is needed based on environment and operational context. Not last, it promises its users (who are edge device developers) that its software can do all of this with nearly zero latency (thus the company name).</div>
<p>Steve Jurvetson, the veteran investor and cofounder of Future Ventures, says of possible applications, &#8220;Think of face-detection algorithms running locally within security cameras or appliances, or Siri-like voice interfaces working instantly, even when there&#8217;s no network connectivity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Certainly, there&#8217;s a growing market for the kind of tech that Latent AI is developing. Indeed, though in an interview earlier today, cofounder and CEO Jags Kandasamy declined to delve into specifics, he suggested that the U.S. government is already a customer, thanks in part to strategic investors like Booz Allen. (In a press release last month about Booz Allen&#8217;s investment in Latent AI, an SVP at the government services agency noted that the “ability to collect, analyze and quickly act on data is at the core&#8221; of the U.S.&#8217;s national defense strategy.)</p>
<p>Another strategic investor, Lockheed Martin, is very focused on finding ways that AI technologies can help the U.S. military improve on situational awareness across land, sea, air, space, cyber and electromagnetic spectrum domains, so it&#8217;s easy to appreciate its attraction to the startup.</p>
<p>Kandasamy also talked this afternoon about an unnamed ski manufacturer that it is using Latent AI&#8217;s tech in its Google Glass-like augmented reality goggles, and he suggested that Latent AI sees a world of opportunities in the commercial market, too.</p>
<p>Of course, given that the world is now rife with data-collecting-devices and that there&#8217;s an enormous interest in making that data actionable without having to send it back and forth to a distant cloud, there are many other companies and projects with the same objective as Latent AI. Among them are open source tools like TensorFlow, hardware vendors like Xilinx, and rival startups like <a href="https://octoml.ai/">OctoML</a> and<a href="https://www.deeplite.ai/"> Deeplite</a>.</p>
<p>Kandasamy insists that all fall short in some way. Of TensorFlow, he says that developers have only community support when it comes to production deployment. Of the chipmakers of the world, they&#8217;re focused on their own hardware and not vertically integrated. And what of those rivals? They&#8217;re either focused on compression or compiling and not both, says Kandasamy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Either way, Latent AI has the kind of backstory that investors like. After Kandasamy, a serial entrepreneur, sold his last startup to Analog Devices, he headed to SRI International in 2018 as an entrepreneur-in-residence. There, he was quickly wowed by tech being developed by Sek Chai, who was the research institution&#8217;s technical director for nearly a decade, and who specialized in low-power high performance computing, computer vision, and machine learning. Soon after, Kandasamy had Chai had formed Latent AI and begun smoothing out some of the kinks.</p>
<p>Now, with fresh funding and a small but growing customer base that pays Latent AI on a subscription basis to access to its tools (then deploy them on premise), the question is whether the 15-person outfit is coming along far enough, fast enough, to get ahead of its current and future rivals.</p>
<p>Jurvetson plainly thinks it&#8217;s well-positioned. He says he has been an advisory board member for SRI International for more than a decade and seen a good many technologies like Siri develop and then spin out of the organization.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the only one I have invested in,&#8221; he says.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">With the fourth quarter now upon us, every industry faces a challenge in managing a holiday production calendar that will deliver the goods. The key for startups looking to defend the quarter from disruptions is to adopt a proactive, data-driven approach to inventory management.</p>
<p>Here are five methods we’ve been counseling clients to adopt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use data and analytics to identify and map out the inventory being affected by the global shipping crisis. If you don’t have the data about what is on a ship transporting your materials, then use this crisis as an opportunity to justify prioritizing supply chain digital transformation with data, IoT and advanced analytics (e.g., machine learning and simulation). You need to know the location of your goods all times if you are going to successfully gauge what impact a shortage will have on your operation. 	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Ultimately, AI will help startups understand how myriad disruptions affect their supply chain so they can better respond with a Plan B when the unthinkable happens.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</li>
<li>If you don’t have the data readily available, then you need to partner with a vendor and use a secure environment to share second-party data to deliver AI-driven actionable insights on the business impact on all parties involved, from startup to retailer to the consumer.</li>
<li>Simulate and forecast the impact of these supply-side issues on the demand side. Conduct scenario planning exercises and inform critical business decisions. If this ability is not in place, an emergency like a pandemic, civil unrest or an uncontrollable rate hike will wreak havoc on your business plan. Use this situation as an opportunity to put a disaster management program in place to prepare for the potential risks.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/car-sharing-startup-turo-has-filed-confidentially-for-an-ipo/">Turo is taking its car rental business public:</a> </strong>Turo, a well-known U.S. startup that allows folks to rent their car to other folks, has privately filed to go public. Oh boy are we curious what its numbers show. Not only because it’s an S-1 that we’ve wanted to read for some time, but also because we’re incredibly curious about how the company navigated the pandemic and the changing world of transit during the last 18 months or so. More when it files publicly, you know, to go public.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/the-china-tech-crackdown-continues/">China’s tech crackdown continues:</a> </strong>Another weekend, another set of regulatory actions from China’s government. Tencent and the larger gaming world could be in trouble next. The turbulence was enough for NetEase, a major gaming company in China, to delay the Hong Kong listing of its music business. Recall that Tencent Music is publicly listed.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/spacex-to-acquire-satellite-connectivity-startup-swarm-technologies/">SpaceX buys Swarm Technologies:</a></strong> After seeing a friend get hooked up to Starlink the other day, what SpaceX does in the connectivity space is now more real to your humble scribe than theoretical. So the news that the space launch company is buying Swarm Technologies caught my eye. What does Swarm do? Per TechCrunch, it “operates a constellation of 120 sandwich-sized satellites as well as a ground station network.” Precisely how that may or may not link up to current SpaceX efforts is unclear.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a brace of unicorn stories and then delve into some earlier-stage startup news, yeah?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/india-upgrad-enters-unicorn-club-with-185-million-fundraise/">Indian edtech is still hot:</a></strong> Another day, another edtech unicorn. This time it’s UpGrad, a Bangalore-based startup that “specializes in higher education and upskilling courses.” It just raised $185 million at a $1.2 billion valuation. Temasek led the round. Notably, it was a two-part affair, with an earlier tranche worth $120 million first valuing UpGrad at a price of around $600 million.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/turkeys-first-decacorn-trendyol-raises-1-5b-at-a-16-5b-valuation/">Turkey’s first $10B startup:</a></strong> $1 billion isn’t cool. You know what is? $10 billion. I suppose that that means that Turkish e-commerce platform Trendyol is cool? At least General Atlantic and SoftBank Vision Fund 2 think that it is cool enough to be worth $16.5 billion. Per our reporting, the company serves around 30 million shoppers who generate around 1 million packages per day. That’s a lot of shipping.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let’s talk about some younger startups:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/rentcheck-raises-millions/"><strong>RentCheck wants you to get your dang deposit back:</strong></a><strong> </strong>And it has raised $2.6 million to power its efforts. Everyone knows what the problem space is here, so we care a bit more about how the company intends to tilt the rental market more toward renters themselves. Per TechCrunch, the company’s software “works by providing a way for property managers to facilitate and conduct remote, guided property inspections.” So long as more of us get our dang money back, cool.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/canopy-raises-15m-series-a/"><strong>Canopy raises $15M for loan-servicing software:</strong></a> Sure, the back end of the financial world isn’t super fun to think about, but it is <em>huge</em> and potentially lucrative. Canopy Servicing is attacking the fintech market with a focus on building software that will help companies better offer and service loans. Credit is a massive problem space, and with $15 million new dollars, it will be interesting to see how quickly this API-delivered startup can grow.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/commandbar-raises-4-8m-to-make-web-based-apps-searchable/"><strong>Meta app search, hell yeah:</strong></a> Today CommandBar left its beta period and announced that it has raised $4.8 million. The company’s tech is a search layer that sits atop web apps, making them easier to, well, search. Frankly, this kicks butt. Why? Because finding what you need inside of web apps can be an enormous hassle if you are in a hurry and not fluent in the application you are presented with. Which happens to everyone. Every day.</li>

<h2>Early-stage brands should also unlock the power of influencers</h2>
<p>Before you hire a marketing consultant who doesn&#8217;t understand your products or commit to a CMO who has several years of experience — but none in your sector — consider influencer marketing.</p>
<p>If the phrase evokes images of celebrities hawking hard seltzer, think again: An influencer can be as humble as an enthusiastic Reddit user who manages your Telegram channel.</p>
<p>According to Uber growth marketing manager Jonathan Martinez:</p>
<p>“ … You don’t need to find influencers with millions of followers. Instead, lean toward microinfluencers for testing, which will bring cost efficiency and the ability to sponsor a diverse range of people.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ariana Grande strutted and soared around a candy-colored series of Fortnite sets in Epic&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/fortnite-ariana-grande-rift-tour/"> latest major in-game live music event</a>. The multi-day &#8220;tour&#8221; offered gamers and Grande fans alike plenty to enjoy while showcasing Epic&#8217;s impressively smooth and visually inventive vision for live events that millions of people can enjoy simultaneously.</p>
<p>Fortnite players have known an Ariana Grande event was in the works for a while, and the concert followed previous in-game events featuring rapper Travis Scott and Marshmello. Scott&#8217;s in-game performance saw <a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/travis-scott-fortnite-record-viewers-live-1234589033/">12.3 million live viewers</a>, a number that the Ariana Grande event is likely to top, given that it ran over multiple days.</p>
<p>Epic put up a video of the concert that&#8217;s well worth checking out, if only to marvel at the kind of stuff that&#8217;s possible in gaming worlds these days. Experiencing the event live in the game is obviously ideal, but the video captures the experience pretty well, minus the sense of presence from having an avatar zooming around the space with grande Grande.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gGYElBtjytU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>This time around, the show featured a handful of mini-games that gave players more to do than just flying around while a gigantic virtual pop star does her thing. The sequence kicked off with players surfing a rainbow racetrack, hitting power ups in a cross between Mario Kart and Splatoon to &#8220;Come &amp; Go&#8221; by Juice WRLD and Marshmello. The racetrack sequence was followed by bouncing players through a Dr. Seuss-style landscape with candy-pink trees and giant floating eyeballs before dropping them into a mini-game shooting down the game&#8217;s Storm King boss to Wolfmother&#8217;s &#8220;Victorious.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grande made her Fortnite debut a few songs in with the 2019 hit &#8220;7 Rings,&#8221; streaking across the sky and materializing on top of a planet suspended in a sea of stars. Later she soared through the clouds with angelic wings as players followed, suspended in rainbow bubbles. In the coolest portion, a skyscraper-high Grande ascended a series of Escher-esque staircases with a giant diamond mallet before slinging it to shatter the sky, shotput-style.</p>
<p>Fortnite&#8217;s latest event didn&#8217;t have any huge surprises, but that&#8217;s only because Epic sets the bar so high. Getting dressed up in your favorite skin to sail around a skyscraper-tall pop star along with millions of people around the world might not be everyone&#8217;s vision for the metaverse, but Fortnite&#8217;s wildly imaginative live events are a taste of the future that here&#8217;s right now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.match.com/">Match</a> today is introducing new features that aim to address some of users&#8217; complaints with modern-day dating apps &#8212; like how much time it takes to find a relevant match and how frustrating it is when users ghost one another after the initial conversation fades. As part of a new strategy to better position Match for more &#8220;emotionally mature&#8221; singles (read: adults), the company says it will begin beta testing a recommendation system called &#8220;Matched by Us,&#8221; which may pave the way for a broader matchmaking service in the future. It&#8217;s also testing an anti-ghosting feature that pushes users to either continue a conversation or unmatch the recipient instead of leaving them hanging.</p>
<p>The features are designed to address the challenges that face Match&#8217;s older demographic. Match users tend to be in their 30s and up, and have full lives. They&#8217;re generally ready to find relationships and settle down with a partner. That&#8217;s a different life phase than those using other Match dating apps, like Tinder, where younger users are still in a more exploratory phase and enjoy going on many dates, including casual dates.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we talk to our members, we hear a lot of frustration around [there being] a lot of swiping, a lot of messaging back and forth &#8212; that&#8217;s happening in the dating world more broadly,&#8221; explains Dushyant Saraph, Match’s chief product officer. &#8220;When we think about folks on our product, who don&#8217;t have a ton of time, that&#8217;s where &#8216;Matched by Us&#8217; came from. Our singles don&#8217;t want to swipe through hundreds of profiles,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187490" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187490" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2187490" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MatchedbyUs2.png?w=340" alt="" width="340" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MatchedbyUs2.png 432w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MatchedbyUs2.png?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MatchedbyUs2.png?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MatchedbyUs2.png?resize=340,680 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MatchedbyUs2.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187490" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Match</p></div></p>
<p>The new feature, which is made available to free and paid users alike, will present one, free customized match every week, where both users can see each other and no longer have to wait for a &#8220;like&#8221; back in order to engage in a conversation.</p>
<p>The system works to find compatible matches by algorithmically examining a new set of preferences around users&#8217; personalities, based on responses to questions posed in users&#8217; Match bios.</p>
<p>For example, questions may ask about users&#8217; five-year plans, their favorite weekend activities, or whether they&#8217;re open to moving somewhere new if they find the right person. The latter has become especially relevant in the new age of remote work, driven by the pandemic, which no longer requires people to live in the bigger cities where their company may be headquartered, Saraph notes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2187488" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187488" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2187488" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MatchedbyUs.png?w=340" alt="" width="340" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MatchedbyUs.png 432w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MatchedbyUs.png?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MatchedbyUs.png?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MatchedbyUs.png?resize=340,680 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MatchedbyUs.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187488" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Match</p></div></p>
<p>Currently, the system will recommend a match based on a holistic view of users&#8217; preferences, as determined by an algorithm, but the company has been internally testing adding a layer of human curation to its suggestions, as well.</p>
<p>In other words, Match is testing an actual match-making service.</p>
<p>For the time being, however, the human curation team inside Match is working in more of an R&amp;D capacity, Saraph says.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been flexing how many experts we need as we&#8217;re testing kind of different concepts &#8212; everything from coaching to expert picks, where we&#8217;re doing human curation,&#8221; he says. The team also works on other features, like suggesting conversation starters to keep conversations going.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Running a queer dating startup amid a pandemic and racial justice uprising&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/running-a-queer-dating-startup-amid-a-pandemic-and-racial-justice-uprising/embed/#?secret=HM3wOzfLdU" data-secret="HM3wOzfLdU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Long-term we expect to be flexible, depending on which of these [products] is most interesting to our members, and scaling up our expert team accordingly. Right now, human curation is one area that we&#8217;re really excited about and want to crack, and I think you&#8217;ll hear more about that in the coming months,&#8221; Saraph adds.</p>
<p>Another new feature aimed at helping adults to stop waste their time on dating apps involves how Match will handle matches&#8217; conversations. Typically, conversations either take off leading to real-world dates, or slowly fade away, until communication stops altogether. Sometimes, the other party simply &#8220;ghosts,&#8221; and never responds at all.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187491" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187491" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2187491" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Prompts.png?w=340" alt="" width="340" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Prompts.png 432w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Prompts.png?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Prompts.png?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Prompts.png?resize=340,680 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Prompts.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187491" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Match</p></div></p>
<p>Users told Match that their main issue with ghosting is the uncertainty around what it means.</p>
<p>Did the person they matched with just get busy, or did they decide they weren&#8217;t interested?, users wonder.</p>
<p>A new feature aims to keep conversations&#8217; momentum going by nudging users when a conversation is about to &#8220;expire&#8221; &#8212; that is, when it will be archived into a new section of the inbox for inactive conversations.</p>
<p>And if you are in the app, you can visit the conversation to get suggestions of conversation starters to help you pick things back up, or you can tap a button to unmatch the other user. The latter would send a more explicit signal to the recipient that there was a lack of interest, though it won&#8217;t actually push a notification that tells the user they&#8217;ve been unmatched. (That can sometimes lead to safety issues, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-20/rejection-violence-in-dating-apps/13253626">particularly for women</a> who have received threats from men they&#8217;ve rejected.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187487" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187487" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2187487" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AdultsDateBetter_CRM.png?w=340" alt="" width="340" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AdultsDateBetter_CRM.png 432w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AdultsDateBetter_CRM.png?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AdultsDateBetter_CRM.png?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AdultsDateBetter_CRM.png?resize=340,680 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AdultsDateBetter_CRM.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187487" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Match</p></div></p>
<p>Match says it&#8217;s currently testing the right number of days to elapse before it nudges users to either re-engage or end their conversations with an unmatch. But the right amount of time seems to be in the three to five-day range, Saraph says.</p>
<p>The new features are rolling out to some portion of Match&#8217;s U.S. user base in beta, as the company kicks off a new brand campaign targeting adult daters. The campaign&#8217;s message is that Match understands what modern adult singles are looking for in order to date better, and these features are an example of that understanding being put into practice.</p>
<p>The beta tests are rolling out across all Match platforms, including iOS, Android, mobile web and desktop over the next few months, starting in the U.S.</p>
<p>The news follows a mixed earnings report from the dating app giant, Match Group, which owns top brands including Match, Tinder, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, Hinge and others. The company saw the impact of a pandemic recovery in the second quarter, with 15 million paying customers across its brands, up from 13 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenue was $707.8 million, topping analyst projections of $694 million. But Match Group <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/match-sales-grow-faster-than-expected-as-u-s-dating-scene-recovers-but-earnings-miss-hits-stock-11628021471">missed on earnings</a>, with net income of $140.9 million, or 46 cents a share, when analysts expected 49 cents per share.</p>

<p>The company also spoke in detail about its plans for social networking app maker Hyperconnect, a company Match bought for $1.73 billion earlier this year.

<p>Match&#8217;s dating app is among those that will benefit from Hyperconnect integrations, Saraph told TechCrunch, as Match plans to explore &#8220;building out live experiences.&#8221; The company expects these to be added around year end toward the beginning of 2022, we&#8217;re told.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">They’ve made waves on every screen and have been sponsored by nearly every major brand, from Charli D’Amelio x Hollister to MrBeast x Honey. And they’re only multiplying.</p>
<p>If influencers aren’t part of your early-stage growth marketing plan, it’s time to get on board. When companies think of how to rapidly increase their reach and revenue, paid acquisition is always at the top of the list. But there are other important pillars in a growth marketing engine, such as leveraging lifecycle marketing, cultivating organic reach via SEO and doing later-stage brand marketing.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">

			Influencer marketing isn’t solely for big brands; it’s for every brand. If influencers aren’t part of your growth marketing plan, it’s time to get on board.					</blockquote>

	</p>
<p>However, an often overlooked tactic for new brands is influencer marketing. If the value and power of influencer marketing were widespread knowledge, we would see more of an uptick. And it doesn’t help that we have a supply-constrained pool of marketers who understand how to unlock this lever.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187318" style="width: 586px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187318" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2187318" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/influencer-1.png" alt="" width="576" height="556" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/influencer-1.png 576w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/influencer-1.png?resize=150,145 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/influencer-1.png?resize=300,290 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/influencer-1.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/influencer-1.png?resize=50,48 50w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187318" class="wp-caption-text">Influencer marketing spending from 2016 to 2021 (predicted). <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jonathan Martinez</p></div></p>
<p>This marketing tactic is only growing. So let’s demystify influencer marketing, learn how to couple it with a little-known paid marketing hack and uncover the numerous mediums to leverage influencer assets. After three years at Postmates (which nailed influencer marketing), being a YouTuber myself in 2008 and advising startups, I’ve unlocked the power of influencer marketing and want everyone to do the same.</p>
<h2>Starting out</h2>
<p>If there’s one key piece of advice to take from this column, it’s that influencer marketing isn’t solely for big brands. It’s for every brand. As you start to formulate your growth strategy, make sure to include an influencer pillar as part of the plan.</p>
<p>When reaching out to influencers, it’s a sheer numbers game in capturing their attention and pitching your brand, but there are myriad ways to increase response conversion. Below are the cold message components you must nail down before reaching out to influencers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your brand pitch.</li>
<li>An enticing offer.</li>
<li>Clear next steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>The one constant with influencers is the high number of messages they receive from fans and brands alike. If you’re at the marketing stage, nailing your pitch should hopefully be natural at this point, so utilize what you’ve crafted and condense it down to a sentence or two.</p>
<p>What are your brand’s key value propositions, and why should influencers care? To show them, relate your brand to their category, to their style and to the content that they post.</p>
<p>After the pitch, an irresistible offer needs to follow — something that’s the opposite of this: “I’ll send you a few samples of our protein bars.” The conversion rate will be a freakishly low tenth of a percent with that offer. Instead, make your offer enticing and utilize one of these structures: fixed fee, fixed fee + performance or performance.</p>
<p>Depending on budget and risk tolerance, there are a few ways to structure an influencer offer: paying a one-time fixed fee, paying for each conversion (CPA performance basis) or a hybrid of the two.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A major UN scientific report has concluded that human activity is changing the climate at an unprecedented rate. The report has been describe as a “code red for humanity&#8221; by its authors.</p>
<p>The UN&#8217;s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is stern and blunt in its conclusions: “It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, oceans, and land,” it says.</p>
<p>The IPCC — a grouping of scientists whose findings are endorsed by the world&#8217;s governments — warns of increasingly extreme heatwaves, droughts, and flooding and a key temperature limit being broken inside the next decade.</p>
<p>This “means that the world will hit one-and-a-half degrees warming much earlier than expected, possibly the middle of 2034” says the report.</p>

<p>The IPCC says going past 1.5 C will create more intense and more frequent heat waves.</p>
<p>Prof. Ed Hawkins, from the University of Reading, U.K., one of the report&#8217;s authors said: &#8220;It is a statement of fact, we cannot be any more certain; it is unequivocal and indisputable that humans are warming the planet.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, the scientists say a catastrophe can be avoided if the world acts fast, and, with deep cuts to the emissions of greenhouse gases, could stabilize rising temperatures.</p>
<p>And scientists are hopeful that global emissions can be cut by 2030 and reach net zero by the middle of this century.</p>
<p>The report is the first major review by the IPCC since 2013 and comes less than three months before the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.</p>

<h2>IPCC report key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>1.5 C will be reached by 2040 in all scenarios unless emissions aren&#8217;t slashed in the next few years.</li>
<li>Keeping to 1.5 C will require “immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions” in emissions and slower action leads to 2 C and more suffering for all life on Earth.</li>
<li>Human influence is &#8220;very likely&#8221; (90%) the main driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease in Arctic sea ice.</li>
<li>Heat waves have become more frequent and more intense since the 1950s, while cold events have become less frequent and less severe.</li>
<li>There will be likely increases in &#8220;fire weather&#8221; in many countries.</li>
<li>Drought is increasing in more than 90% of regions.</li>
<li>Global surface temperature was 1.09 C higher in the decade between 2011-2020 than between 1850-1900.</li>
<li>The past five years have been the hottest on record since 1850.</li>
<li>The recent rate of sea-level rise has nearly tripled compared with 1901-1971.</li>
<li>A rise of around 2 meters in sea levels by 2100 cannot be ruled out — and neither can a 5-meter rise by 2150, threatening millions of people in coastal areas.</li>
<li>Extreme sea-level events that occurred once a century are projected to occur at least annually.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under all the emissions scenarios considered in the report, all targets for reductions targets will be broken this century unless huge cuts in carbon emissions take place.</p>
<p>Solutions proposed by the scientists include using clean technology, carbon capture and storage, or planting trees.</p>
<p>Another co-author, Prof. Piers Forster from the University of Leeds, U.K., was quoted as saying: “If we are able to achieve net-zero, we hopefully won&#8217;t get any further temperature increase; and if we are able to achieve net-zero greenhouse gases, we should eventually be able to reverse some of that temperature increase and get some cooling.&#8221;</p>
<p>The IPCC report found that 2,400 billion tonnes of CO2 have been emitted by humanity since 1850, and that we can only leak another 400 billion tonnes to have a 66% chance of keeping to 1.5 C.</p>
<p>This means the planet has spent 86% of its carbon &#8220;budget&#8221; already.</p>
<p>Furthermore, no one is safe from the effects of climate change.</p>
<p>“We can no longer assume that citizens of more affluent and secure countries like Canada, Germany, Japan, and the U.S. will be able to ride out the worst excesses of a rapidly destabilizing climate,” says Prof. Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy. “It’s clear we’re all in the same boat — facing a challenge that will affect every one of us within our lifetimes.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When George Floyd was murdered in May 2020, it set off a firestorm of protests and shed a bright hot spotlight on the issues of racism in America and elsewhere. As a response, many companies gave messages of support to people of color, yet have failed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/blendoor-data-lets-you-know-if-companies-are-living-up-to-diversity-pledges/">to make substantive change</a> since that time. One company that is attempting to move beyond lip service and diversity quotas is Twilio, whose CEO Jeff Lawson has made a commitment to work toward being an anti-racist company.</p>
<p>As part of that commitment, he hired Lybra Clemons, who has years of experience in corporate diversity jobs, as chief diversity officer and the two of them have worked together with the rest of the executive team to try and execute the company&#8217;s anti-racist vision.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a complex and challenging task to parse personal bias and institutional and societal racism and try to build a company that actively works to combat all of this, but Lawson and Clemons seem determined to be an example to all tech companies.</p>
<p>As part of this effort, the company published <a href="https://www.twilio.com/the-current/dei-report-2021">a diversity report recently</a>, partially to document its progress and partly to share some of the lessons it has learned as it goes on this journey to build a better and more inclusive company.</p>
<p>I spoke to both executives to learn about their efforts and how they think about anti-racism, deal with it on multiple levels from personal to business to societal &#8212; and how the work is never really done.</p>
<h2>Making the effort</h2>
<p>Clemons said that when she came on board in September 2020, it was part of an overall effort on the part of Lawson and the executive team to commit to being anti-racist, and part of her job was to help define what that meant. In part, it was an effort to move beyond some of &#8220;the perfunctory responses&#8221; from other companies, but also an honest attempt at trying to do something different to improve how they hired people, and the systems they put in place to make people feel welcome and succeed, regardless of who they were, what they looked like or where they came from.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying that all companies are like that, but there were a lot of perfunctory responses [after George Floyd was murdered],&#8221; Clemons told me. &#8220;I do believe that there was a full-on commitment [at Twilio] to figure out what it means to become an anti-racist company, [figuring out what] anti-racism means &#8212; which we are grappling with right now &#8212; and, if we use that lens, how we&#8217;ll be able to approach diversity, equity and inclusion in a different way.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What to consider before publishing your diversity memo&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/what-to-consider-before-publishing-your-diversity-memo/embed/#?secret=Zhb0zRdWru" data-secret="Zhb0zRdWru" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lawson says that this isn&#8217;t something he just picked up on in the wake of George Floyd&#8217;s murder. He has been thinking about this for a long time. One of Twilio&#8217;s early backers was Kapor Capital. The firm&#8217;s principals, Mitch Kapor and Freada Kapor Klein, who have been preaching about diversity and inclusion for decades, encouraged Lawson to come to meetings with other founders to discuss diversity in the early days of the company, which was founded in 2008.</p>
<p>In an interview in 2017, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/25/theres-a-better-way-to-build-your-startup/">Kapor Klein told TechCrunch</a> about the importance of establishing a positive culture as early as possible in a startup&#8217;s evolution because it becomes much harder, the larger you get as a company.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s almost impossible to overemphasize the importance of intentionally building a positive culture from the start. Finding time to articulate values, principles and how you want to be known is critical. There’s always too much to do, but retrofitting culture or diversity and inclusion in a big company is much harder,” she said at the time.</p>
<p>Lawson says these early meetings with the Kapors and other startup founders helped plant the seeds about the kind of company he wanted to build. He realized at the time that as focused as he was on building the successful business his startup would become, there was no perfect time to start thinking about DEIB (diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging), and it was his responsibility as the leader of his startup to begin thinking about it right then and there, before, as he said, &#8220;the company was a thousand white men.&#8221;</p>
<p>That thinking evolved over the last year on how to build an anti-racist company, a concept he picked up by reading the book &#8216;<a href="https://www.ibramxkendi.com/how-to-be-an-antiracist">How To Be An Antiracist&#8217; by Ibram X. Kendi</a>, and he is committed to that approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anti-racism just speaks to the fact that there are systems, institutionalized systems in any society … that biases certain people over others, and that can be done intentionally or unintentionally, and the work of anti-racism is to say, let&#8217;s try to do the work and to identify what those systems are, and then ask how we can combat that,&#8221; Lawson said.</p>
<h2>Using data to move, not prove</h2>
<p>Clemons says that throughout the mid-2000s, the standard way of looking at diversity was simply to look at the data and pat yourself on the back if you reached your diversity goals, but she said that she wanted to help Twilio use the data to move beyond that approach to use data to drive substantive change at the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;The data is helping us understand that either we increased or we didn&#8217;t increase in this particular demographic or population. So how do we use the data to actually move and make some changes or shifts to our policies or practices and so forth,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a full journey of really understanding the history of the U.S., the history of the world as it relates to racism, colonialism, all of the -isms, colorism and homophobia, and addressing that. Figuring out what our choices are, our individual stakes in them and then using that as a way to build out anti-racist policies and practices to actually start to make some shifts in our diversity, equity and inclusion strategy.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a story earlier this year about Valence, a startup with the goal of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/valence-unveils-training-program-to-help-build-pipeline-of-black-execs/">advancing Black professionals in the workplace</a>, company CEO Guy Primus said he wants to help companies move beyond the numbers game that Clemons referenced.</p>
<p>&#8220;People want the numbers to go up, and there’s [this notion of] recruit, retain and promote. The problem is that everyone is focused on the recruiting pipeline, but they’re not focused on retention and promotion, which ultimately affects recruiting. So it’s an ecosystem problem, not a pipeline issue,” Primus told TechCrunch at the time.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s an area where Twilio is moving into actionable programs to help move beyond simply recruiting, although that&#8217;s clearly part of it, and helping build a company where every employee feels appreciated, that they can succeed based on their skills, and that they truly belong.</p>
<p>The Twilio report cites a number of specific programs to help make this happen.</p>
<p>One is called Hatch, which launched in 2017. Hatch looks for folks from non-traditional backgrounds who have been through a coding boot camp and puts them in a six-month apprenticeship program. The program is designed to teach them more advanced coding skills and learn what it takes to be a successful coder with coaching and mentorship.</p>
<p>Lawson says that as of last year, 93% of the folks who came through this program are still with the company. That&#8217;s a track record that suggests people are coming into the company, which is putting systems in place to help ensure their success.</p>
<p>Other programs include Rise Up, which helps Black and Latinx employees move into management positions via a leadership development program, and Twilio Unplugged, which teaches candidates from historically excluded backgrounds how to succeed in a tech company interview process to get through that initial step to get hired.</p>
<p>These and so many more programs are designed to help achieve the company&#8217;s anti-racism goals. Lawson is the first to admit that it is not a perfect system, and that with the help of Clemons and others, he and the rest of the executive team are still working and learning and trying to build a company where everyone can succeed and everyone feels a part of the team.</p>
<p>Twilio is still 60% male and just over 38% female, a number that was up 6% in 2020. The overall racial and ethnic makeup of the company is around 51% white, 26% Asian, 6.5% Latinx and 5.5% Black. While the ratio of whites to nonwhites is quite favorable, with a large percentage of Asians, it still has work to do when it comes to other historically excluded groups.</p>

<p>The company certainly understands that. Lawson says that by working on an individual, company and societal level, Twilio hopes to do its part to improve its own record and continue to get better at this. Part of that is sharing what they&#8217;ve learned in the report, not to pat themselves on the back, but to bring the conversation outside the company.</p>
<p>As Clemons said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R09-tnTanE&amp;t=287s">in the video that accompanied the company&#8217;s diversity report</a>: &#8220;Everyone has their experience. Everyone comes in with all types of experiences, whether good or bad, and we cannot change that, but what Twilio can do is provide a space for those to feel like they are part of something, and it goes back to this anti-racist framework of ensuring that there&#8217;s equity for all people to feel like they can have a great career and a great career journey at Twilio.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Turo, the peer-to-peer car-sharing startup, has initiated the confidential process of filing for an initial public offering with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>The number of shares to be offered in the IPO and the price range have not yet been determined, the company said in a statement. Turo declined to provide additional information to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The eleven-year-old Turo’s marketplace is analogous to Airbnb, letting car owners post an ad to rent out their vehicle on its app and website. Cars are available to rent in more than 5,500 cities across three countries. Turo was in Germany after<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/turo-raises-92m-and-acquires-daimlers-croove-car-sharing-business/"> taking over</a> Daimler AG’s car-sharing subsidiary Croove alongside an investment deal. The company is no longer in Germany.</p>
<p>The company had a $250 million Series E in July 2019, which pushed the company into unicorn status and “past the billion-dollar valuation mark,” CEO Andre Haddad said in a <a href="https://turo.com/blog/news/iac-invests-250-million-in-turo">blog post</a>. Turo followed that up with a $30 million extension round the following February, bringing its total funding to date to over $500 million.</p>
<p>Turo did not have a completely smooth ride during the pandemic; like other transportation startups Bird and Getaround, Turo laid off 30% of its workforce, or 108 employees, in March 2020 according to <a href="https://layoffs.fyi/2020/04/21/turo-laid-off-108-employees/">data tracker Layoffs.fyi</a>.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Sexual harassment is, unfortunately, always in the news. Of late, it’s revelations at gaming giants and governments. Yet despite how prevalent harassment is, companies often adopt an “it can’t happen here” stance &#8212; until it does, and then there are knee-jerk reactions and crisis communications.</p>
<p>A better approach: recognizing how pervasive it is and planning with that in mind.</p>
<p>When I first started <a href="http://www.goethena.com/">Ethena</a>, I explained the concept of innovative harassment prevention training to my father. Like any good parent, he thought my entrepreneurial genius was actually a terrible idea and advised me to stay put at my job. But when he finally accepted that I was going to start this company, he said, “Make sure you don’t have harassment at your company. That would be bad.”</p>
<p>He’s not wrong. My team provides a modern compliance training platform. Since our first product was harassment prevention training, it would be pretty bad if we were talking the talk without walking the walk.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Train your team members to better understand inclusion and recognize what harassment looks like so the bar is set higher than “let’s just not get sued.”					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>If I could prevent workplace harassment on optimism alone, I absolutely would. But I’ve seen the data on the prevalence of workplace harassment.</p>
<p>A 2018 <a href="https://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/04/03161853/Pew-Research-Center-Sexual-Harassment-Report-April-2018-FINAL.pdf">Pew survey,</a> for example, found that 59% of women and 27% of men reported experiencing sexual harassment. And the rise of remote work hasn’t changed things. In fact, there are some indications that harassment is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/08/us/workplace-harassment-remote-work.html">on the rise</a> thanks to “keyboard courage.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Knowing that, I’ve come to terms with the fact that these are issues we’ll likely face, so I want us to be prepared. Today’s workplace demands that leaders acknowledge gray areas and engage with uncomfortable topics; it’s how companies grow in new and healthy directions. Here’s how we think about that growth.</p>
<h2>Plan for it</h2>
<p>As a Floridian, I grew up assuming hurricanes would hit my house. We always had some plywood and canned food because when you know something is going to happen, you plan for it.</p>
<p>Unlike prepared Floridians, startups tend to adopt an ostrich approach when it comes to harassment. Instead of stocking the pantry, so to speak, companies wait until they’re already in a storm.</p>
<p>Early on, a startup is a small group of (usually homogeneous) friends, and it’s uncomfortable to acknowledge that bad things could happen. It’s much easier to hope that building a team of stellar humans is enough.</p>
<p>But, unfortunately, bad things do happen, because sometimes harassment is not as cut-and-dried as we are led to believe. Rather, harassment often grows from the complexities of human interactions — intent, perception, privilege and context, to name a few. It can start with a few small jokes, a colleague who gets drunkenly inappropriate every Friday, or a team that never seems to hire anyone outside of their social circle.</p>
<p>Then, things can escalate, and people start to realize that what they’re actually experiencing is a hostile work environment. Unfortunately, at that point, it’s really hard to right the ship because the company is suddenly 600 people and change gets harder as companies grow.</p>
<p>Knowing that problems are more likely as companies scale, it’s vital that teams prepare by learning how to identify warning signs early. At a bare minimum, train your team members to recognize what workplace harassment looks like and better understand inclusion so that the bar is set higher than “let’s just not get sued.”</p>
<p>Out of everyone at the company, managers really need to get the memo. As a company scales, senior leaders have a limited span of control, so frontline managers become the most crucial employees in either promoting or preventing inclusive workplaces. It just so happens that training is legally required in states like <a href="https://www.goethena.com/post/california-sexual-harassment-training-requirements">California</a> and <a href="https://www.goethena.com/post/new-york-sexual-harassment-training-requirements">New York</a>.</p>
<h2>Make feedback, not just “tell HR,” an option</h2>
<p>The traditional way that harassment is talked about is very binary. Either a workplace is perfectly inclusive or it’s a toxic cesspool. Obviously, it’s important to take these issues seriously, but the problem with treating every act as either fine or serious, capital-H harassment is that it gives employees a choice between bad and worse.</p>
<p>Let’s say Elena is on an engineering pod with Jonah, and Jonah occasionally does small things that cause her to feel less than included.</p>
<p>For example, they’re hiring for a new front-end engineer and Jonah always refers to this future hire as “he.” In the traditional, frowny-faced lawyer version of harassment, Elena has two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do nothing: Bad because Jonah is going to keep doing it.</li>
<li>Tell HR: Also bad. Elena doesn’t want to get Jonah fired. She just wants him to be more inclusive.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, if training teaches Elena &#8212; and, ideally, everyone else on her team &#8212; to say something in the moment, Elena now has a tool she can actually use.</p>
<p>Next time Jonah says, “OK so when he joins … ” Elena can jump in with, “Unless you&#8217;re psychic, which seems unlikely given how poorly you did in Fantasy Football, please use ‘they’ to refer to our new hire, since we don’t know their gender.”</p>
<p>Did Elena <em>need</em> to insert the burn? Probably not, but humor can diffuse a tense situation so sure, why not? Regardless, once Elena says something, it’s on Jonah to accept her feedback and make a change; and, if team values are clear, hopefully Jonah’s colleagues will hold Jonah accountable, too.</p>
<h2>Accountability is everything</h2>
<p>This last lesson is only applicable after something at the company happens. Let’s say Jonah’s comments escalate, even after Elena gives feedback. Jonah consistently excludes Elena and other women from key meetings, talks over them, and when confronted, says, “Look, we all know they’re only here for diversity stats.”</p>
<p>If Jonah’s manager at this fictitious, problematic company does nothing, that’s the ballgame. There’s literally no amount of workshops, training, blog posts or all-hands meetings that can convince Elena that the company cares. Actions speak loudest.</p>
<p>The best possible version of dealing with an issue involves transparency so that people can learn from what happened and see that the company does care. Obviously, it’s hard when issues involve private information and protecting those who reported the issues, but to the extent possible, it’s crucial to have accountability.</p>
<p>Of course, my dad is right: Harassment at my company would be bad. But we’re preparing for it because scaling a company means rapidly increasing the number of human interactions.</p>
<p>Thankfully, building an inclusive company looks a lot like building a good company — preparation, feedback and accountability are managerial best practices that should be put in place early.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is further investing in its e-commerce business, Instagram Shops, with the launch of a new advertising product, Ads in Instagram Shop. The company says it&#8217;s currently testing the new format, which includes both single images and the option for an image carousel, with select U.S.-based advertisers ahead of an expansion to other markets in the months to come.</p>
<p>The company first introduced<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/facebook-shops/"> Instagram Shops</a> last year as part of a larger effort at Facebook to make its social platforms not just a place to connect with friends and follow favorite brands, but also an online shopping destination with an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/instagram-launches-its-redesigned-shop-now-powered-by-facebook-pay/">integrated checkout experience</a>. Naturally, this type of initiative also lends itself to Facebook&#8217;s advertising model, as brands looking to connect with consumers could pay for expanded reach.</p>
<p>Like Instagram&#8217;s other advertising products, Ads in Instagram Shop will launch with an auction-based model, the company says. The ads will only appear on mobile, as the Instagram Shop tab is a mobile-only feature. However, how many ads an individual consumer sees will be based on how they use Instagram and how many people are shopping in the Instagram tab. The company plans to monitor consumer sentiment on this point, in order to balance ads and content.</p>
<p>Initially, Instagram is working with a handful of U.S. advertisers who will test the product and provide feedback, including Away, Donny Davy, Boo Oh, Clare paint, JNJ Gifts, DEUX and Fenty Beauty. These brands encompass some of the more popular categories of goods Instagram users like to shop for, including beauty, home décor, pet products, travel and more.</p>
<p>The company hasn&#8217;t yet disclosed an exact time frame for rolling out the ads more publicly, but says the plan is to expand the new format to advertisers in other, non-U.S. markets over the next several months.</p>
<p>The Instagram Shop tab has been one of the app&#8217;s more controversial additions in recent years, as it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/instagram-swaps-out-its-activity-tab-for-shop-in-new-global-test/">replaced the popular &#8220;Activity&#8221; tab (heart button)</a> in the bottom navigation row &#8212; a change that made the app feel more commercially driven than in the past and alienated some users. Today, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/08/instagram-artists-leaving-social-media-tiktok-shopping">creative community is weighing its options</a> as Instagram distances itself further from its photo-sharing roots with other new additions, like its TikTok clone Reels, as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX will be acquiring satellite connectivity startup Swarm Technologies, the first such deal for the 19-year-old space company headed by Elon Musk.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.swarm.space">Swarm</a> operates a constellation of 120 sandwich-sized satellites as well as a ground station network. The deal would transfer control of Swarm’s ground and space licenses to SpaceX, in addition to any licenses pending before the commission. If the transaction is approved, the startup would become a “direct wholly-owned subsidiary” of the larger company.</p>
<p>The acquisition, which was reported in <a href="https://fcc.report/IBFS/SAT-T-C-20210806-00096/12345289">under-the-radar filings</a> with the Federal Communications Commission, marks a sharp departure from the launch giant’s established strategy of internally developing its tech.</p>
<p>The deal was reportedly reached between the two companies on July 16. The FCC filings do not disclose any financial details or terms of the transaction. Neither SpaceX nor Swarm could be reached for comment.</p>
<p>“Swarm’s services will benefit from the better capitalization and access to resources available to SpaceX, as well as the synergies associated with acquisition by a provider of satellite design, manufacture, and launch services,” the companies said in the filing. For SpaceX’s part, the company will “similarly benefit from access to the intellectual property and expertise developed by the Swarm team, as well as from adding this resourceful and effective team to SpaceX.”</p>
<p>What this means for SpaceX’s operations, particularly its Starlink satellite network, is unclear, as these satellites operate in a different frequency band from that of Swarm. In the short term, Swarm CEO Sara Spangelo told TechCrunch last month that the company is “still marching” toward its goal of operating a 150-satellite constellation.</p>
<p>Compared to SpaceX, Swarm is a relatively new company. It raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/24/swarm-technologies-raises-25m-to-deploy-its-own-150-satellite-constellation/">$25 million Series A</a> almost exactly three years ago, in August 2018, but it only went commercially live with its flagship product earlier this year. That product, the Tile, is a small modem that can be embedded in various connectivity devices and linked to the satellite network to allow users a low-cost way to power Internet of Things devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s decision to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/facebook-ad-observatory-nyu-researchers/">close accounts connected to a misinformation research project</a> last week prompted a broad outcry from the company&#8217;s critics — and now Congress is getting involved.</p>
<p>A handful of lawmakers criticized the decision at the time, slamming Facebook for being hostile toward efforts to make the platform&#8217;s opaque algorithms and ad targeting methods more transparent. Researchers believe that studying those hidden systems is crucial work for gaining insight on the flow of political misinformation.</p>
<p>The company specifically punished two researchers with <a href="https://cybersecurityfordemocracy.org/">NYU’s Cybersecurity for Democracy project</a> who work on <a href="https://adobserver.org/">Ad Observer</a>, an opt-in browser tool that allows researchers to study how Facebook targets ads to different people based on their interests and demographics.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">After years of abusing users&#39; privacy, it&#39;s rich for Facebook to use it as an excuse to crack down on researchers exposing its problems. I&#39;ve asked the FTC to confirm that this excuse is as bogus as it sounds. <a href="https://t.co/eHuPiVYFe9">https://t.co/eHuPiVYFe9</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In a new letter, embedded below, a trio of Democratic senators are pressing Facebook for more answers. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Chris Coons (D-DE) and Mark Warner (D-VA) wrote to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg asking for a full explanation on why the company terminated the researcher accounts and how they violated the platform&#8217;s terms of service and compromised user privacy. The lawmakers sent the letter on Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we agree that Facebook must safeguard user privacy, it is similarly imperative that Facebook allow credible academic researchers and journalists like those involved in the Ad Observatory project to conduct independent research that will help illuminate how the company can better tackle misinformation, disinformation, and other harmful activity that is proliferating on its platforms,&#8221; the senators wrote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Lawmakers have long urged the company to be more transparent about political advertising and misinformation, particularly after Facebook was found to have distributed election disinformation in 2016. Those concerns were only heightened by the platform&#8217;s substantial role in spreading election misinformation leading up to the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, where Trump supporters attempted to overturn the vote.</p>
<p>In a blog post defending its decision, Facebook cited compliance with FTC as one of the reasons the company severed the accounts. But the FTC called Facebook&#8217;s bluff last week in a letter to Zuckerberg, noting that nothing about the agency&#8217;s guidance for the company would preclude it from encouraging research in the public interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, the FTC supports efforts to shed light on opaque business practices, especially around surveillance-based advertising,&#8221; Samuel Levine, the FTC&#8217;s acting director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection, wrote.</p>

It claims to have evolved from marketplace to “superapp” by combining its marketplace platform (which is powered by Trendyol Express, its own last-mile delivery solution) with instant grocery and food delivery through its own courier network (Trendyol Go), its digital wallet (Trendyol Pay), consumer-to-consumer channel (Dolap) and other services.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trendyol founder Demet Suzan Mutlu said the new capital will go toward expansion within Turkey and globally. Specifically, the company plans to continue investing in nationwide infrastructure, technology and logistics and toward accelerating digitalization of Turkish SMEs. She said the company was founded to create positive impact and that it intends to continue on that mission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evren Ucok, Trendyol&#8217;s chairman,  added that part of the company’s goal is to create new export channels for Turkish merchants and manufacturers.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melis Kahya Akar, managing director and head of consumer for EMEA at General Atlantic, said that Trendyol’s marketplace model &#8212; ranging from grocery delivery to mobile wallets &#8212; “brings convenience and ease to consumers” in Turkey and internationally.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Turkey is one of the fastest growing economies in the world and benefits from attractive demographics, with a young population that is very active online,&#8221; wrote General Atlantic&#8217;s Kahya Akar via e-mail. &#8220;We expect its already sizable e-commerce market –$17 billion in 2020 – to continue to grow meaningfully on the back of growing online penetration. We think Trendyol is ideally positioned to meet the needs of consumers in Turkey and around the world as the company expands.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2020 </span><a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/merchant-services/insights/reports/turkey-2020"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report by JPMorgan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e-commerce represented only 5.3% of the overall Turkish retail market at the time but that Turkish e-commerce had notched impressive leaps in revenues in recent years: 2018 alone saw the market jump by 42%, followed by 31% in 2019. As of 2020, 67% of the Turkish population were making purchases online.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve all been there. (Or at least I have.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re getting ready to vacate a property you’ve rented, only to be told by the landlord that you won’t be getting your security deposit back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This happened to me the first time I ever rented a place in the late 90s. I was shocked, but more than anything, I was angry at the injustice because I knew that what the landlord claimed was not true. It was her word against mine and my roommate’s. Still, we took her to small claims court, not so much over the $800 she was trying to keep but more to prove her wrong. In the end, we won.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it was a lot of work, and a lot of time spent. If only there was some kind of technology available to have helped us make our case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, today there is. <a href="https://www.getrentcheck.com/">RentCheck</a>, a startup that is out to help solve the &#8220;he said, she said&#8221; challenge in these situations with an automated property inspection platform, has recently raised $2.6 million in seed money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lydia Winkler and Marco Nelson started the company in mid-2019 after Winkler experienced a similar situation to mine and ended up suing her landlord in small claims court. She was working on getting her JD/MBA at Tulane University at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was an injustice for me not to pursue it,” she told TechCrunch. “I took meticulous photos of the move-out condition of my apartment. The process took 18 months. But not everyone has the time or knowledge to fight in court.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She then met Nelson, who had bought several properties that he ended up renting out. He had issues with security deposits too, but the opposite ones. He had to settle disputes over deposits, and found himself documenting properties’ condition at the time of move-out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I met Lydia and we realized we were passionate about the same problem,” Nelson recalled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so New Orleans-based RentCheck was born.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187000" style="width: 253px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187000" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2187000 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg?w=200" alt="" width="243" height="365" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg 3813w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0011.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187000" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> RentCheck; Co-founders Marco Nelson and Lydia Winkler</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are an estimated 48 million rental units in the U.S., with an average deposit of $1,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A good chunk of that is being fought after on aggregate,” Winkler said. “And so many need that money to put down a deposit on another unit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To address the problem, RentCheck built a web app for property managers that they believe also benefits tenants. The company’s digital platform works by providing a way for property managers to facilitate and conduct remote, guided property inspections. For obvious reasons, the company saw increased demand upon the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, considering that the platform was automated and contactless. It saw 1,000% &#8212; mostly organic &#8212; growth in terms of the number of properties on the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we do is, using a guided inspection process, prompt users and guide them room by room, telling them exactly what to take photos of so that floors, ceilings, windows and walls are all accounted for,” Winkler said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything is done within the app so that users can&#8217;t upload photos that were previously on their camera roll “to ensure the integrity of the inspection” and that  everything is time stamped. Once the inspection is complete, whoever does it signs off on it that they completed it accurately and honestly. Then the property manager can also sign off on it so both parties can agree on the move-out condition.</span></p>
<p>The company operates as a SaaS business, and charges property management companies a subscription fee based on the number of properties that they have on the RentCheck platform. They can then conduct &#8220;as many inspections as they want,&#8221; Nelson says, &#8220;whether the residents are doing them, their internal teams are doing them, or a third-party vendor, or a hybrid of the three.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187001" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187001" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2187001 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0007.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0007.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0007.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0007.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0007.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0007.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0007.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0007.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BryceEllPhotography-0007.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187001" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> RentCheck/Bryce Ell Photography</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has attracted some large-name investors since its inception, first catching the attention of James &#8220;Jim&#8221; Coulter, the founder of TPG Capital, when the company won New Orleans Entrepreneurship Week. Coulter subsequently became one of the company’s first investors in its $1 million pre-seed round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s seed round included participation from Cox Enterprises, for its operations in the multifamily housing space, and angels such as Jim Payne, who previously sold MoPub to Twitter, and MAX to AppLovin; Ken Goldman, the former CFO of Yahoo, and who currently runs Hillspire, Eric and Wendy Schmidt’s family office; Mark Zaleski and John Kuolt of BCG Digital Ventures, and Brian Long, the founder of Attentive, who previously sold TapCommerce to Twitter. It also included institutional investors such as Irongrey, Context Ventures and Techstars. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we love about RentCheck is that it’s using very clever technology to automate and solve arguably the industry’s biggest problem in terms of money and time for both property managers and tenants,” said Kuolt, former managing director at BCG Digital Ventures and an early RentCheck investor. “The deposit deduction issue needs a technology-based solution, and almost everyone, at some time, has felt like they’ve been screwed over on their deposit by a landlord. When you see and use RentCheck’s solution, it makes you think: ‘Why didn’t I think of this?’ ” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roku this morning announced an expansion of its original content lineup, with the addition of 23 new Roku Original programs that will debut on August 13 on The Roku Channel free streaming hub. The new programing &#8212; which also hails from Roku&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/roku-acquires-quibis-content/">acquisition</a> of failed streamer Quibi&#8217;s catalog &#8212; will supplement the initial slate of 30 originals which were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/roku-launches-an-original-programming-lineup-fueled-by-quibis-content/">first released in May</a>. Among the new programs are four shows that had not yet gone live on Quibi&#8217;s service before Roku purchased the content catalog for its own originals business.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vhv6DAdEJJ4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>These unreleased programs include &#8220;<a href="https://blog.roku.com/new-roku-original-eye-candy-josh-groban">Eye Candy,</a>&#8221; a &#8220;Nailed It!&#8221;-like competition series hosted by Josh Groban and inspired by Japan&#8217;s &#8220;Sokkuri Sweets;&#8221; &#8220;<a href="https://blog.roku.com/squeaky-clean-the-roku-channel">Squeaky Clean</a>,&#8221; a cleaning competition series hosted by Leslie Jordan; Season 2 of pay-it-forward reality show &#8220;Thanks a Million,&#8221; executive produced by Jennifer Lopez; and 10-part docuseries &#8220;<a href="https://blog.roku.com/new-what-happens-in-hollywood">What Happens in Hollywood</a>,&#8221; directed by Marina Zenovich, which details some of the industry&#8217;s most controversial secrets.</p>

<p>Other programs now arriving include: &#8220;&amp;Music,&#8221; &#8220;The Andy Cohen Diaries,&#8221; &#8220;Benedict Men,&#8221; &#8220;Elba vs Block,&#8221; &#8220;Fierce Queens,&#8221; &#8220;Floored,&#8221; &#8220;Gone Mental with Lior,&#8221; &#8220;Mapleworth Murders,&#8221; &#8220;Memory Hole,&#8221; &#8220;Nice One!,&#8221; &#8220;Nikki Fre$h,&#8221; &#8220;Run this City,&#8221; &#8220;The Sauce,&#8221; &#8220;Sex Next Door,&#8221; &#8220;Singled Out,&#8221; &#8220;Skrrt with Offset,&#8221; &#8220;The Stranger,&#8221; &#8220;Survive&#8221; and &#8220;Wireless.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roku had praised the performance of its original lineup during its second quarter earnings last week, saying the new catalog had demonstrated &#8220;good performance,&#8221; without sharing specific metrics.</p>
<p>The company also said it would continue to invest in originals, but downplayed the size of their role in its larger strategy for The Roku Channel, where original programming is a smaller fraction of the content Roku offers its customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Noted Roku CEO Anthony Wood, The Roku Channel&#8217;s catalog consists mainly of content that comes from the licensing deals Roku strikes with various partners.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xBVAezL73M"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/roku-launches-an-original-programming-lineup-fueled-by-quibis-content/">Roku will launch original programming fueled by Quibi&#8217;s content on May 20</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Roku will launch original programming fueled by Quibi&#8217;s content on May 20&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/roku-launches-an-original-programming-lineup-fueled-by-quibis-content/embed/#?secret=xBVAezL73M" data-secret="xBVAezL73M" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a portfolio approach and the originals are part of that portfolio,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The primary source of content is still licensing, but originals have benefits, as well. And as part of the portfolio, they&#8217;re a great addition,&#8221; Wood added. He also was careful to explain that the addition of originals wouldn&#8217;t have any impact on the gross margins related to The Roku Channel&#8217;s ad-supported video on demand (AVOD) business model. Instead, the expansion into originals, which has also included Roku&#8217;s purchase of &#8220;This Old House,&#8221; is more about user acquisition and its ad business.</p>
<p>&#8220;The other advantage of the originals is, of course, there&#8217;s a halo effect. So it&#8217;s helpful with the upfronts, it&#8217;s helpful with our advertising business and it&#8217;s helpful for bringing in new customers into The Roku Channel,&#8221; Wood said.</p>
<p>The company explained that originals drove more engagement among users, which then drove more advertisers &#8212; including new advertisers &#8212; and that gives Roku more money to invest in more content and further scale its business. Roku said that more than 42% of its advertisers were first-time upfront advertisers with the company, which had a lot do with its ability to offer original programming on The Roku Channel.</p>
<p>Overall, however, Roku saw a mixed Q2. The company <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/04/roku-q2-2021-earnings.html">beat Wall Street expectations</a> with earnings per share of $0.52 versus estimates of $0.13, and revenue of $645 million versus estimates of $618 million, but reported a decline in streaming hours. Roku said streaming hours decreased by 1 billion from the first quarter of 2021, but attributed this to the pandemic, as more people were leaving their homes for activities like dining, entertainment and travel. Shares fell by more than 8% after the earnings report, despite Roku reporting that streaming hours had grown year-over-year by 19% worldwide.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/xayn-is-privacy-safe-personalized-mobile-web-search-powered-by-on-device-ais/">December 2020 we covered</a> the launch of a new kind of smartphone app-based search engine, <a href="https://www.xayn.com/">Xayn</a>.</p>
<p>“A search engine?!” I hear you say? Well, yes, because despite the convenience of modern search engines’ ability to tailor their search results to the individual, this user-tracking comes at the expense of privacy. This mass surveillance might be what improves Google’s search engine and Facebook’s ad targeting, to name just two examples, but it’s not very good for our privacy.</p>
<p>Internet users are admittedly able to switch to the U.S.-based <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>, or perhaps France’s <a href="https://www.qwant.com/">Qwant</a>, but what they gain in privacy, they often lose in user experience and the relevance of search results, through this lack of tailoring.</p>
<p>What Berlin-based Xayn has come up with is personalized, but a privacy-safe web search on smartphones, which replaces the cloud-based AI employed by Google et al. with the innate AI in-built into modern smartphones. The result is that no data about you is uploaded to Xayn’s servers.</p>
<p>And this approach is not just for &#8220;privacy freaks&#8221;. Businesses that need search but don’t need Google’s dominant market position are increasingly attracted by this model.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Xayn is privacy-safe, personalized mobile web search powered by on-device AIs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/xayn-is-privacy-safe-personalized-mobile-web-search-powered-by-on-device-ais/embed/#?secret=tROtDh42Xx" data-secret="tROtDh42Xx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And the evidence comes today with the news that Xayn has now raised almost $12 million in Series A funding led by the Japanese investors Global Brain and KDDI (a Japanese telecommunications operator), with participation from previous backers, including the Earlybird VC in Berlin. Xayn’s total financing now comes to more than $23 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It would appear that Xayn’s fusion of a search engine, a discovery feed and a mobile browser has appealed to these Asian market players, particularly because Xayn can be built into OEM devices.</p>
<p>The result of the investment is that Xayn will now also focus on the Asian market, starting with Japan, as well as Europe.</p>
<p>Leif-Nissen Lundbæk, co-founder and CEO of Xayn said: “We proved with Xayn that you can have it all: great results through personalization, privacy by design through advanced technology and a convenient user experience through clean design.”</p>
<p>He added: “In an industry in which selling data and delivering ads en masse are the norm, we choose to lead with privacy instead and put user satisfaction front and center.”</p>
<p>The funding comes as legislation such as the EU’s GDPR or California’s CCPA have both raised public awareness about personal data online.</p>
<p>Since its launch, Xayn says its app has been downloaded around 215,000 times worldwide, and a web version of its app is expected soon.</p>
<p>Over a call, Lundbæk expanded on the KDDI aspect of the fund-raising: “The partnership with KDDI means we will give users access to Xayn for free, while the corporate &#8212; such as KDDI &#8212; is the actual customer but gives our search engine away for free.”</p>
<p>The core features of Xayn include personalized search results; a personalized feed of the entire internet, which learns from their Tinder-like swipes, without collecting or sharing personal data; and an ad-free experience.</p>
<p>Naoki Kamimeada, partner at Global Brain Corporation said: “The market for private online search is growing, but Xayn is head and shoulders above everyone else because of the way they’re re-thinking how finding information online should be.”</p>
<p>Kazuhiko Chuman, head of KDDI Open Innovation Fund, said: “This European discovery engine uniquely combines efficient AI with a privacy-protecting focus and a smooth user experience. At KDDI, we’re constantly on the lookout for companies that can shape the future with their expertise and technology. That’s why it was a perfect match for us.”</p>
<p>In addition to the three co-founders (Leif-Nissen Lundbæk, chief executive officer, Professor Michael Huth, chief research officer, and Felix Hahmann, chief operations officer), Dr Daniel von Heyl will come on board as chief financial officer. Frank Pepermans will take on the role of chief technology officer and Michael Briggs will join as chief growth officer.</p>
