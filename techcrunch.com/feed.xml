										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There is a prevailing notion that while the cloud infrastructure market is growing fast, the vast majority of workloads remain on prem. While that could be true, <a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/2020-the-year-that-cloud-service-revenues-finally-dwarfed-enterprise-spending-on-data-centers">new research from Synergy Research</a> Group found that cloud infrastructure spending surpassed on prem spending for the first time in 2020 &#8212; and did so by a wide margin.</p>
<p>&#8220;New data from Synergy Research Group shows that enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure services continued to ramp up aggressively in 2020, growing by 35% to reach almost $130 billion. Meanwhile enterprise spending on data center hardware and software dropped by 6% to under $90 billion,&#8221; the firm said in a statement.</p>
<p>While the numbers have been trending toward the cloud for a decade, the spending favored on prem until last year when the two numbers pulled even, according to Synergy data. John Dinsdale, chief analyst and research director at Synergy says that this new data shows that CIOs have shifted their spending to the cloud in 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Where the rubber meets the road is what are companies spending their money on, and that is what we are covering here. Quite clearly CIOs are choosing to spend a lot more money on cloud services and are severely crimping their spend on on-prem (or collocated) data center assets,&#8221; Dinsdale told me.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127540" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127540" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2127540 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ent-Spending-2020.jpg?w=680" alt="Chart comparing on prem spending to cloud infrastructure spending from Synergy Research." width="680" height="433" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ent-Spending-2020.jpg 1207w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ent-Spending-2020.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ent-Spending-2020.jpg?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ent-Spending-2020.jpg?resize=768,489 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ent-Spending-2020.jpg?resize=680,433 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ent-Spending-2020.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2127540" class="wp-caption-text">Chart: Synergy Research Group</p></div></p>
<p>The total for on prem spending includes servers, storage, networking, security and related software required to run the hardware. &#8220;The software pieces included in this data is mainly server OS and virtualization software. Comparing SaaS with on-prem business apps software is a whole other story,&#8221; Dinsdale said.</p>
<p>As we see on prem/cloud numbers diverging in this way, it&#8217;s worth asking how these numbers compare to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-10-20-gartner-says-worldwide-it-spending-to-grow-4-percent-in-2021">research from Gartner</a> and others that the cloud remains a relatively small percentage of global IT spend. As workloads move back and forth in today&#8217;s hybrid world, Dinsdale says that makes it difficult to quantify where it lives at any given moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I’ve seen plenty of comments about only a small percentage of workloads running on public clouds. That may or may not be true (and I tend more towards the latter), but the problem I have with this is that the concept of “workloads” is such a fungible issue, especially when you try to quantify it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the pandemic has led to companies moving to the cloud much faster than they might have without a forcing event, but Dinsdale says that the trend has been moving this way over years, even if COVID might have accelerated it.</p>
<p>Whatever numbers you choose to look at, it&#8217;s clear that the cloud infrastructure market is growing much faster now than its on premises counterpart, and this new data from Synergy shows that CIOs are beginning to place their bets on the cloud.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.fetcher.ai/">Fetcher</a>, a startup that promises to make the recruiting process easier while also diversifying the candidate pool, is announcing that it has raised $6.5 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/21/scout-recruiting/">Originally known as Scout</a>, the New York startup was founded by CEO Andres Blank, CPO Chris Calmeyn and engineering directors Javier Castiarena and Santi Aimetta.</p>
<p>Blank told me that Fetcher automates parts of recruiters&#8217; jobs, namely finding job candidates and sending the initial outreach emails. When I wondered whether that just leads to more spammy recruiting messages, he said that Fetcher emails actually result in &#8220;a very good response rate&#8221; because they&#8217;re targeted at the right candidates.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The reality is that if you’re looking for a job, you don’t need an email to be so amazing,<br />
and if you’re a recruiter, you don’t want to spend 10 minutes thinking about what to write to each candidate,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He also described Fetcher&#8217;s approach as a &#8220;human in the loop&#8221; approach. Yes, the initial outreach is automated, but then the recruiter handles the conversations with candidates who respond.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127573" style="width: 637px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127573" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2127573" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fetcher-EmailCustomization.png?w=627" alt="Fetcher screenshot" width="627" height="550" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fetcher-EmailCustomization.png 627w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fetcher-EmailCustomization.png?resize=150,132 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fetcher-EmailCustomization.png?resize=300,263 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fetcher-EmailCustomization.png?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2127573" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fetcher</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;By automating both the sourcing [and] outreach sides of recruiting, Fetcher reduces the amount of time a recruiter spends in front of a computer searching for candidates, making a recruiter’s job more balanced, strategic and impactful, all while continuing to build a robust, diverse pipeline for the company,&#8221; Blank wrote in a follow-up email.</p>
<p>He also suggested that automated sourcing allows recruiters to reach a much more diverse candidate pool than they would through traditional methods. For example, he sent me a case study in which Fetcher helped <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/frame-io-camera-to-cloud/">video collaboration startup Frame.io</a> hire 11 new employees in less than 12 months, nine of whom were women and/or underrepresented minorities.</p>
<p>“Fetcher has freed up time and given us the capacity to diversify our pipeline more organically,&#8221; said Anna Chalon, Frame.io&#8217;s senior director of talent and diversity, equity and inclusion, in a statement. &#8220;This has allowed us to make some incredible hires, mostly from underrepresented groups, over the last year.”</p>
<p>Blank added that after Fetcher has seen its revenue increase every month since July of last year, owing to shrinking recruiting teams needing to be able to do more with fewer resources, as well as a greater corporate focus on the aforementioned diversity, equity and inclusion.</p>
<p>Fetcher has now raised a total of $12 million. The Series A was led by G20 Ventures, with participation from KFund, Slow Ventures and Accomplice. Blank said he&#8217;s planning to double the employee count (currently 80) by the end of the year and to build out additional analytics (including diversity analytics) and CRM tools.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brian Brackeen, the founder and former CEO of facial recognition startup <a href="https://www.kairos.com/">Kairos</a>, has made his way back to the company following his ouster in 2018. Brackeen is now chairing the company&#8217;s scientific advisory board, where he&#8217;ll help to address and eliminate issues of racial bias from the technology.</p>
<p>While that’s not the company’s explicit mission — it’s to provide authentication tools to businesses — algorithmic bias has long been a topic the company, especially Brackeen, has addressed.</p>
<p>But what happened in the time leading up to his ouster and the events that followed was quite the whirlwind.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In 2018, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/27/facial-recognition-startup-kairos-founder-continues-to-fight-attempted-takeover/">Kairos&#8217; board of directors forced Brackeen out of his role as CEO, citing willful misconduct as the cause for his termination</a>. In addition to forcing him out of the company he founded, Kairos sued Brackeen, alleging the misappropriation of corporate funds and misleading shareholders.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/27/facial-recognition-startup-kairos-founder-continues-to-fight-attempted-takeover/">At the time</a>, Brackeen referred to the events as &#8220;a poorly structured coup,&#8221; and denied the allegations. Then, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/16/kairos-founder-countersues-for-10-million/">Brackeen countersued</a> Kairos, alleging the company and its CEO Melissa Doval intentionally destroyed his reputation through fraudulent conduct. In 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/31/facial-recognition-startup-kairos-settles-lawsuits-with-founder-and-former-ceo-brian-brackeen/">Brackeen and Kairos settled the lawsuits.</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/31/facial-recognition-startup-kairos-settles-lawsuits-with-founder-and-former-ceo-brian-brackeen/">Brackeen then went on to start Lightship Capital with his wife, Candice Brackeen</a>.</p>
<p>Since returning to Kairos, Brackeen has already directed Kairos to focus on what it&#8217;s calling the Bias API. The API is designed to make it easier for companies and firms to detect and address any algorithmic biases, according to Brackeen.</p>
<p>Brackeen is not back on a full-time basis, as he has his hands pretty full with Lightship Capital, but he said he&#8217;s generally tasked with steering the ship during quarterly meetings.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facial recognition startup Kairos founder continues to fight attempted takeover&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/27/facial-recognition-startup-kairos-founder-continues-to-fight-attempted-takeover/embed/#?secret=ckUNckx3h2" data-secret="ckUNckx3h2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Despite the drama of the past, Brackeen told TechCrunch he still considers Kairos to be his baby. It&#8217;s also worth noting that folks like Doval, who was appointed to CEO following Brackeen&#8217;s ouster, and Mary Wolff, the former COO who spearheaded the lawsuit, are gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;First, I will always feel a responsibility to the team, investors and fans of Kairos,&#8221; Brackeen said as to why he&#8217;s returned. &#8220;Many of whom I was singularly responsible for. Secondly, as a society, bias can be found in everything from Twitter image cropping to air dryers not turning on for Black hands. It’s a painful reminder of a society that’s not fair for all. The challenge is that as AI gets to be imbedded in more and more products, we will see bias in all kinds of products. Kairos with its large data set and years of IP, must be the firm that saves us from that dystopian future. I am uniquely situated to lead that strategy.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/poshmark/">Poshmark</a> has come a long way over the last decade. Launched in 2011, the social fashion marketplace has raised upwards of $150 million, and has now listed on the public markets. It&#8217;s valued at $3.5 billion.</p>
<p>But well before all the success, Mayfield&#8217;s <a href="https://www.mayfield.com/goshposh-its-been-a-ten-year-journey-to-ipo-tales-from-partnering-with-poshmark/">Navin Chaddha saw the potential</a>, leading the Series A for the company.</p>
<p>On our next episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>, we&#8217;ll sit down with Chaddha and Poshmark founder and CEO Manish Chandra to discuss going from Series A to public company. (Registration info is at the bottom of this post.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Chandra is a triple-threat executive. He has degrees in marketing, business and computer science, and is a serial entrepreneur who sold his previous company, Kaboodle, to Hearst in 2007. The introduction of the iPhone inspired him to think about the coming shift in consumer behavior, paving the way for an idea like Poshmark to thrive. As is so often the case, what seems obvious in hindsight was incredibly insightful at the time.</p>
<p>The brilliance wasn&#8217;t at all lost on Chaddha, an entrepreneur in his own right. Now, Chaddha leads Mayfield, a firm with $2.5 billion in assets under management. Of the 50 companies he&#8217;s invested in during his venture capital career, 17 have gone public and 24 have been acquired. In other words, it makes sense that he has made an appearance on the Forbes Midas list 12 times.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk to Chandra and Chaddha about the process of fundraising from the early stage to the growth stage and beyond. But more importantly, we&#8217;ll talk about how a company has to adapt in order to be successful over time.</p>
<p>Plus, Chandra and Chaddha will take a look at pitch decks submitted by the audience and give their live feedback. If you&#8217;re wondering how to perfect your deck, there may be no more valuable resource than the advice of this founder/investor duo.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Once the path less traveled, bootstrapping today has become a much more viable and common approach to building a startup. By not taking venture capital dollars early, bootstrapping can force founders to remain disciplined in serving their paying customers well. It’s also a pretty compelling way to minimize dilution for founders and early employees. No wonder then that a crop of unicorn enterprise startups has taken this road these past years.</p>
<p>Few companies in that emerging crop though have reached quite the stature of Atlanta-based <a href="https://calendly.com">Calendly</a>. The company is not just on everyone’s calendars (literally), but has also become a $3 billion unicorn behemoth with $70 million in subscription revenue in 2020.</p>
<p>To get Calendly started, CEO and founder Tope Awotona raised $550,000 (which included his life savings) to get the company off the ground, and remained bootstrapped for about seven years <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/how-atlantas-calendly-turned-a-scheduling-nightmare-into-a-3b-startup/">before inking a $350 million venture round with OpenView’s Blake Bartlett earlier this year along with Iconiq</a>. OpenView happened to be one of the few investors in the company’s single seed round as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bootstrapping is a continuous commitment to not take venture capital for an extended period of time. Why make that commitment? How does a founder build the fortitude to resist the lucre of VC when it can make so many things easier? What are the advantages to bootstrapping, and when does the calculus switch from avoiding VC to embracing it?</p>
<p>I’m excited to talk about those questions and more with Awotona and Bartlett at our upcoming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=calendlypost">Early Stage — Operations &amp; Fundraising event</a>, where we explore how to answer the strategic and tactical questions that founders must make in the course of leading their startups.</p>
<p>Not only will we be getting Awotona’s deep perspective as a founder, but we’re also going to dig into Bartlett’s long-time relationship with Calendly and how he assiduously built a partnership there over many years to “win” what was one of the marquee deals of the year.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Bartlett has backed a variety of major enterprise startups, such as Expensify (which has also demurred from the high stakes world of big-dollar VC), Highspot, Postscript and others, and I’m curious to see how he thinks about companies that go big with venture versus those who want to go big without it.</p>
<p>While many decisions when building a startup can be delayed, how you fund your startup (and therefore, how you fund your employees and growth) is one that must be made early and consistently. Join us and learn more about the different paths to financing startups, and how one calendar company timed its approach to greatness.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=calendlypost">TC Early Stage</a> curriculum is being spread across two events, with fundraising and operations represented on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=calendlypost">April 1 and 2</a> and fundraising and marketing deep dives on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?promo=calendlypost">July 8 and 9</a>. Folks who buy a ticket to just one event will get three months of Extra Crunch for free, and folks who buy a dual-event ticket will get six months of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/subscribe">Extra Crunch membership</a> for free.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Per a new dataset I spent this morning chewing on, VCs are firing cannons of capital into the AI startup world while exits reach new records.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Recently public unicorn Upstart announced earnings that blew the socks off of Wall Street this week. After closing on Wednesday at around $61 per share, Upstart wrapped Thursday worth $115 per share. It turns out that all the blather we&#8217;ve had to endure about artificial intelligence (AI) in the past decade is coming true, at least in certain applications for select companies.</p>
<p>But Upstart&#8217;s blockbuster guidance for 2021 is just a sliver of the story. The AI-powered fintech is projecting a year so good that its valuation nearly doubled yesterday, but there are other shoots of life in the AI world worth discussing, and investors are taking note.</p>
<p>Per a new data set I spent this morning chewing on, VCs are firing cannons of capital into the AI startup world while exits reach new records.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Real-world financial output coupled to historically strong venture capital activity &#8212; and new technologies dripping into the tech upstart world at a record clip &#8212; are creating whole cloth new use cases for AI tied to lots of capital access. It&#8217;s all very exciting.</p>
<p>This morning, I want to discuss Upstart and its quarterly results. I spoke with CEO Dave Girouard yesterday, which yielded some notes on AI-powered tech adoption rates among more conservative companies. Then, we&#8217;ll peek into <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q4-2020-emerging-tech-research-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning">PitchBook data</a> on global AI-focused startup fundraising and their exit market.</p>

Sure, we&#8217;re not as laser focused today as we are most mornings, but the AI world has me jazzed, so I can&#8217;t help but talk about it. Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<h2>Upstart expects 114% YOY growth in 2021</h2>
<p>In its first <a href="https://ir.upstart.com/news-releases/news-release-details/upstart-announces-fourth-quarter-2020-and-fiscal-year-2020">earnings report</a> as a public company &#8212; you can read The Exchange&#8217;s coverage of its IPO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/inside-fintech-startup-upstarts-ipo-filing/">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/upstart-and-wish-price-their-debuts-as-the-2020-ipo-cycle-slows/">here</a> &#8212; Upstart reported Q4 2020 revenues $86.7 million (up 39% on a year-over-year basis), while its 2020 revenues totaled $233.4 million (up 42% on a year-over-year basis).</p>
<p>The quarter was a strong revenue beat, and a beat on adjusted profits. But it&#8217;s what the company has coming next that really stuck out.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this month, Los Angeles became the latest city to task its various departments with prepping a feasibility study for deploying new software and monitoring technologies to better account for its carbon footprint.</p>
<p>LA&#8217;s city council initiative, led by council member Paul Koretz, follows a push from the state legislature to mandate that all businesses operating in California that gross over $1 billion annually disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and set science-based targets to reduce those emissions.</p>
<p>California is far from the only state in the U.S. that&#8217;s feeling the disastrous effects of global climate change, but it&#8217;s among the most aggressive in trying to address the causes. Whether that&#8217;s a dramatic effort to remove fossil fuels from its power supply or the proposal to make businesses accountable for their contributions to climate change, California has been a leader in trying to encourage the adoption of new technology and services that can mitigate the impact of climate change and reverse course on the production of greenhouse gas emissions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With this move, Los Angeles wants to hitch its wagon to this momentum and is actively looking for tech businesses that can help with carbon accounting.</p>
<p>That means good things for companies like <a href="https://carbonchain.com/">CarbonChain</a>, <a href="https://www.persefoni.com/">Persefoni</a>, <a href="https://www.climateview.global/">ClimateView</a> and <a href="https://www.sinaitechnologies.com/">SINAI Technologies</a>, which all have offerings meant to help with carbon accounting and management.</p>
<p>It shows that some of the largest cities, with billion dollar budgets, will open their wallets to pay for the tools they need to get a better handle on how they&#8217;re contributing to the climate change that threatens their own citizens.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, the city council tasked the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation and chief legislative analyst to report back on the feasibility of developing or buying technology to provide a more accurate accounting of the city&#8217;s carbon footprint.</p>
<p>“The City provides a number of services — from lighting and maintaining municipal buildings, facilities and streetlights, to paving roads and operating a transit fleet, and delivering water and operating reclamation facilities — all of which come with environmental impacts,&#8221; said council member Koretz in a statement earlier this month. &#8220;If we’re going to take our carbon reduction goals seriously, and make a real difference in the lives of frontline communities near LAX and the Port of Los Angeles, we need a better, more consistent, and more transparent accounting of our emissions.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles has steadily worked to give climate change and climate friendly policies a more central role in political discussions. Roughly two years ago, in July 2019, <a href="https://www.theclimatemobilization.org/blog/2019/07/07/los-angeles-moves-toward-mobilization-in-response-to-the-climate-emergency/">Los Angeles set up an office of climate emergency</a> and earlier this year Mayor Eric Garcetti <a href="https://www.lamayor.org/mayor-garcetti-launches-climate-emergency-mobilization-office">launched the climate emergency mobilization office</a> to coordinate activity between civic leaders, the mayor&#8217;s office and the city council. </span></p>
<p>Budget hasn&#8217;t been allocated for the accountability plan, but people familiar with the city council&#8217;s plan expect that implementation could begin in the 2021-2022 budget cycle.</p>
<p>Los Angeles has tried to address its carbon footprint in the past, but the efforts weren&#8217;t very successful. The study was conducted using historical emissions data and did not include the &#8220;scope three&#8221; emissions, which refer to the greenhouse gas emissions created by service providers for the city&#8217;s operations.</p>
<p>As the City of Angels looks to improve its ability to provide accountability and metrics on its contribution to climate change, it could do worse than look at the standard that&#8217;s been set by New York City. Under the Bloomberg Administration, carbon accounting and resiliency measures became a priority &#8212; even before Hurricane Sandy made clear that the city was highly exposed to climate and weather-related disasters.</p>
<p>That 2012 storm inflicted nearly $70 billion in damage and killed 233 people across eight countries from the Caribbean to Canada.</p>
<p>The disaster only furthered New York&#8217;s resolve to be more aggressive with its climate action. The city <a href="https://nyc-ghg-inventory.cusp.nyu.edu/#about">has a robust accounting program</a> for emissions from its operations and is moving forward with policies across the city to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the built environment, transportation and industry.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Data drives decision-making and without data, we cannot chart a path toward a zero-emission future,&#8221; said council member Joe Buscaino. &#8220;Today&#8217;s generation of leaders must continue to address climate change with urgency and be held accountable to the goals we set for Los Angeles, and this motion sets us on the path to do just that.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has completed what&#8217;s known as the &#8216;stacking&#8217; of its first Super Heavy prototype, the extremely large next-generation first-stage rocket booster that it will eventually use to propel its Starship spacecraft to orbit and beyond. The Super Heavy Booster is about 220 feet tall – which is roughly the wingspan of a Boeing 747, or a bit taller than the Cinderella Castle at Walt Disney World in Florida.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s without Starship on top, which will add around another 160 feet. Super Heavy will undergo its own testing prior to flying with Starship, however, and a lot of that will be focused on assuring its fuel tanks can handle the pressurization and extreme temperatures required for keeping all that ignitable material stable prior to when the engines actually fire.</p>
<p>Super Heavy uses the same engines as Starship — Raptor engines, to be specific, which SpaceX created new for this generation of launch vehicle. The final version will have a total of 28 Raptor engines, but this first prototype will likely be outfitted with far fewer, and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has confirmed that it&#8217;ll also remain grounded, as it&#8217;s intended to be use only for testing things like build and transportation mechanics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes, Booster 1 is a production pathfinder, figuring out how to build &amp; transport 70 meter tall stage. Booster 2 will fly.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1372695421487824903?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 18, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>He did say the next prototype will fly, and while he isn&#8217;t always accurate about timelines, the Starship upper stage (i.e., the one that looks like a big grain silo with fins) is progressing quickly in its development, including with a recent test flight that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/spacexs-starship-prototype-flies-to-32000-feet-and-sticks-the-landing-in-third-flight-test/">ended with a near-perfect landing — minus the subsequent explosion that took out the prototype rocket entirely a few minutes after it had touched down successfully</a>.</p>
<p>Musk clearly wants to move fast with Starship and Super Heavy, in part because of ambitious goals it has of serving as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/spacex-blue-origin-and-dynetics-will-build-human-lunar-landers-for-nasas-next-trip-back-to-the-moon/">provider to NASA for future human lunar landing missions as part of the Artemis program</a>, and also because it&#8217;s still planning to fly the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/spacexs-first-paying-moon-flight-customer-wants-to-give-away-eight-seats-aboard-his-spaceship/">first commercial tourist flight of a Starship in just two short years in 2023</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As WhatsApp spends months to address users’ concerns and confusion about its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/elon-musk-dunks-on-facebook-and-recommends-signal-in-wake-of-u-s-capitol-insurrection-attempt/">planned policy update</a>, there is evidently one entity it hasn’t had much luck making inroads with: The Government of India.</p>
<p>The Indian government alleged on Friday that WhatsApp’s planned privacy update, which goes into effect in two months, violates local laws on several counts.</p>
<p>In a filing to the Delhi High Court, the federal government also asked the court to prevent Facebook-owned messaging app from rolling out the update in India, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/youtube-and-whatsapp-inch-closer-to-half-a-billion-users-in-india/">WhatsApp’s biggest market by users</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Social media in recent years has been used by billions of people around the world and millions of Indians today are dependent on WhatsApp. Therefore, information that is generally personal is shared at an enormous level. This information is susceptible to being misused if the social media giant decides to either sell or exploit the information, sensitive to the users, to any third party,” the government wrote in the filing.</p>
<p>The filing suggests that WhatsApp hasn’t been able to assuage concerns of New Delhi, which first raised issue about the planned policy update in January.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, India’s IT ministry had written to Will Cathcart, the head of WhatsApp, to express its “grave concerns” about the update and its implications and had “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/india-asks-whatsapp-to-withdraw-new-privacy-policy-expresses-grave-concerns/">called upon to withdraw the proposed changes</a>.”</p>
<p>A WhatsApp spokesperson declined to comment.</p>
<p>The Indian government’s unchanging stand &#8212; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/whatsapp-faces-legal-challenge-over-privacy-in-its-biggest-market/">ongoing legal case</a> &#8212; on WhatsApp’s forthcoming terms and conditions change is the latest headache for the popular instant messaging firm, which is also grappling with a forthcoming guideline from New Delhi that could require WhatsApp to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">compromise end-to-end encryption it offers on its service</a>.</p>
<p>Used by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/whatsapp-hits-2-billion-users-up-from-1-5-billion-2-years-ago/">over 2 billion users</a>, WhatsApp has been sharing some information with parent firm Facebook since 2016. The company, which hasn’t substantially updated its terms of service since, said last year that it will be making some changes to share a set of personal data about users such as their phone number and location with Facebook.</p>
<p>Through an in-app alert earlier this year, WhatsApp asked users to share their consent for the new terms in January, which prompted an immediate backlash from some users. Following the backlash &#8212; which saw tens of millions of users explore competing services such as Signal and Telegram &#8212; WhatsApp said it will give users <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/whatsapp-delays-new-data-sharing-policy-enforcement-to-may-15/">three additional months to review its new policy</a>. (On a side note, Signal mobile apps had crossed 100 million monthly active users in February, according to a popular mobile insight firm.)</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> were all here to chat through the week’s biggest tech happenings. This time around we had whatever passes for a quiet week as far as news volume. But that still meant we had to cut stuff and move the rest around. But, once we got done editing the notes doc down, here&#8217;s what was leftover:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/snap-is-taking-a-significant-step-into-fashion-e-commerce-with-its-acquisition-of-fit-analytics/">Snap acquires Fit Analytics</a>, a fitting technology startup: A far-past TechCrunch Disrupt alone has found a new home inside of the LA&#8217;s social leader. No price on this one, but a fun thing to talk about all the same.</li>
<li>eToro is <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/etoro-said-near-10-billion-232111712.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosprorata&amp;stream=top">going public via a SPAC</a> (cool), and as it competes with Robinhood it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/?p=2126915&amp;preview=true">gave us a chance to dig into the market</a>. And frankly there&#8217;s a lot to like about eToro. And thus Robinhood? Probably.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/riva-health-wants-to-turn-your-smartphone-into-a-blood-pressure-monitor/">co-founder of Siri and a scientist have teamed up to create Riva Health</a>, a software solution that hopes to turn your phone into a blood pressure monitor accurate enough for clinical use.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/gpt-3-powered-copy-ai-raises-2-9m-in-a-round-led-by-craft-ventures/">Copy.ai raised $2.9 million</a>, a round that Alex would not shut up about because of GPT-3. More on that tech here.</li>
<li>The future of cannabis is in the hands of retail shops, or at least thats what Dutchie, a Bend, Oregon-based startup, believes. The cannabis management startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/in-new-round-dutchie-focused-on-smoother-cannabis-retail-sees-its-valuation-soar-by-eight-times/">raised $200 million at a $1.7 billion valuation</a> this past week.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/airtable-is-now-valued-at-5-77b-with-a-fresh-270-million-in-series-e-funding/">Airtable raised another round</a>. A huge one. Again. This time it was $270 million at a $5.77 billion valuation. How much more money could it need? Who knows!</li>
<li>Squarespace, everyone&#8217;s favorite podcast sponsor, has raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/squarespace-raises-300m-at-staggering-10b-valuation/">$300 million at a steep, $10 billion valuation. </a>The news broke nearly two months since Squarespace filed confidentially for IPO.</li>
<li>And we closed on how unequal the venture capital world really is. It&#8217;s super embarrassing to report on, but knowing the numbers is better than not. So we wrote about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The show wraps with a teaser for next week that we won&#8217;t spoil here.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Igor Marinelli and Gabriel Lameirinhas were raised around manufacturing plants. Marinelli&#8217;s father worked for International Paper in a plant outside of São Paulo, while Lameirinhas&#8217; father worked in a cement plant. </span></p>
<p>Throughout their lives, the two friends had heard their parents complain about the sorry state of maintenance and monitoring of the heavy equipment that their factories depended on to stay up and running.</p>
<p>So the two men decided to do something about it, and set about to develop the technology that would become <a href="https://tractian.com/">Tractian</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Friends from their days at University of São Paulo, Lameirinhas and Marinelli kept in touch as Marinelli pursued a career in the U.S. as an entrepreneur. They reconnected in Brazil after the collapse of Marinelli&#8217;s attempt to launch a predictive chronic health condition service called BlueAI.</p>
<p>Marinelli spent some time working in a paper plant himself and became a software engineer for the facility. It was there that he saw the shoddy state of affairs of industrial monitoring tools.</p>
<p>Together with Lameirinhas he determined that there could be a better way. Factories in Brazil aren&#8217;t equipped with Wi-Fi or gateways or other networking technologies that the newest solutions from companies like Siemens or Schneider Electric require. Integrations with existing enterprise resource planning software from companies like SAP present another headache, said Marinelli.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only industries with huge capital can go through that mess,&#8221; Marinelli said.</p>
<p>Tractian&#8217;s sensors measure four things: vibration, temperature, energy consumption and a horometer to measure how long a machine has been up and running. The company has also developed software that can analyze the data coming off of the sensors to predict when a machine might need maintenance.</p>
<p>Y Combinator found the software and hardware package compelling and so did investors like Soma Capital, Norte Ventures, and angel investors including Alan Rutledge and Immad Akhund.</p>
<p>Tractian&#8217;s tech costs $90 for the sensors and the analysis and software is another $60 per month, per sensor. Marinelli claims that the service can pay for itself in less than two months. Already, the company has signed up AB InBev as an initial customer and has roughly 30 buyers in total using its sensors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As indoor farming expands, a number of new companies are cropping up to provide better data and monitoring tools for the businesses aimed at improving efficiencies and quality of indoor crops. </span></p>
<p>One of these companies, the Copenhagen-based <a href="https://www.nordetect.com/">Nordetect</a>, is entering the U.S. market with around $1.5 million in funding from government investment firms and traditional accelerators like SOSV, with a tech that the company claims can give vertical farms a better way to monitor and manage nutrients and water quality.</p>
<p>Controlled agriculture, whether in greenhouses or warehouses, benefits from its ability to administer every aspect of the inputs to ensure that plants have the optimal growing conditions. It is, however, far more expensive than just seeding the ground.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Proponents say that these farms can overcome the additional expense by improving efficiency around water use, reducing the application of pesticides and fertilizer, and cultivating for better, tastier produce.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where Keenan Pinto and Palak Sehgal&#8217;s Nordetect comes in. The two co-founders have known each other since they were undergraduates in India eight years ago. They went on to do their masters&#8217; work together and after working in bioengineering plants &#8212; Sehgal focused on flowering systems in plants and Pinto focused on roots &#8212; they both went into more digital fields &#8212; but maintained their fascination with plants and kept in touch with each other.</p>
<p>Professional work in medical diagnostics for Sehgal and lab instrumentation for Pinto kept both busy, but they continued their discussions around plant science and soil health.</p>
<p>Roughly three years ago, the two hit on the idea for a combined toolkit for water quality monitoring and soil health. Sehgal left the India Institutes of Technology, where she had been working, and joined Pinto in Copenhagen to begin developing the tech that would form the core of Nordetect&#8217;s business proposition.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s technology consists of an analyzer and a cartridge, a microfluidic chip that users can insert into their water tank to take a sample. From the data that the device collects, farmers can control the nutrients they put into the water to optimize for traits like color and flavor, Pinto said.</p>

<p>The company was accepted into SOSV&#8217;s Hax accelerator in 2017 and the two first-time founders moved from Denmark to Shenzhen to begin developing the business. In late 2018 the company moved back to Denmark and raised a small amount of additional capital from SOSV and <a href="https://www.rockstart.com/">Rockstart</a>.</p>
<p>By 2020, watching the expansion of vertical farming, the company took what had initially been a soil-monitoring tool and added water-quality monitoring features to support indoor farming. That&#8217;s when the business started taking off, according to Pinto.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the interesting things is when I consider the outdoor versus the indoor markets. The outdoor felt a bit conservative… the indoor seems much more forthcoming… and that traction allowed us to pull together this funding round $1.5 million,&#8221; Pinto said. </span></p>

<p>The new round came from Rockstart, Preseed Ventures, SOSV, the government of Denmark&#8217;s growth fund, and <a href="https://luminate.org/">Luminate</a>, a Rochester, New York-based accelerator that focuses on optical electronics technology.</p>
<p>Luminate&#8217;s participation is one reason why Nordetect is coming to the U.S., but it&#8217;s hardly the only reason. There&#8217;s also the capital that has come in to finance indoor ag companies. The two largest vertical farming companies in the U.S., Plenty and Bowery Farming, have raised $541 million and $167 million, respectively.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The vertical movement has put people into the position where they are what I call data farmers,&#8221; said Pinto. &#8220;Each batch of produce is being used to learn and the data is more important than the output. We used this market as a beachhead.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The private equity giant <a href="https://www.blackstone.com/">Blackstone</a> is today announcing the final close of its first growth equity fund &#8212; Blackstone Growth &#8212; with $4.5 billion in capital commitments from a wide range of family offices, entrepreneurs, endowments, strategic institutional investors, pension funds and other big wheels.</p>
<p>The outfit says it&#8217;s the &#8220;largest first-time growth equity private fund raised in history.&#8221;</p>
<p>We knew this was coming back in the fall of 2019, when we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/20/want-to-crush-competitors-forget-softbank-blackstone-suggests-it-can-write-500-million-checks-too/">first talked</a> with Jon Korngold, the head of the new fund. At the time, he was a recent hire, having joined that same year from General Atlantic, where he spent the previous 18 years of his career, including as a managing director and a member of its management committee.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Korngold was also in building mode, trying to assemble a team, and writing some early checks off of Blackstone&#8217;s sizable balance sheet. (The company had assets under management at the time of roughly $500 billion; it now manages just north of $600 billion.)</p>
<p>Because a lot has transpired since that conversation &#8212; including a $2 billion bet on the dating app Bumble that&#8217;s currently worth a stunning $7 billion &#8212; we asked Korngold to catch us up on the team, what size investments they are making and whether Blackstone views blank-check companies as growing competition.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">TC: Brass tacks, how many people are now investing this $4.5 billion alongside you?</strong></p>
<p>JK: We&#8217;ve got about 30 people full-time dedicated to Blackstone Growth, in addition to the obviously hundreds of, if not a thousand, people more generally available to us within the Blackstone family. We&#8217;ve got people now in San Francisco, New York and in London. It&#8217;s has a global mandate.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What size checks does your team tend to write?</strong></p>
<p>JK: Our average investment might be $200 million to $400 million.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And how much of this debut fund has been invested already?</strong></p>
<p>JK: In the beginning, we were using other pools of capital before this pool of capital was available to us. Now that we&#8217;ve got this, we&#8217;ve got a handful of investments and invested a pretty significant portion of our capital already. It&#8217;s probably north of 25% at this stage.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you reserve upwards of half for follow-on funding? How does a fund of this size even work?</strong></p>
<p>JK: Anytime we invest, we always expect and hope that we will continue to support our companies throughout. Fortunately, we never have a problem of running out of money. But we do reserve a significant portion of it to fund the ongoing growth of the companies.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Want to crush competitors? Forget SoftBank, Blackstone suggests; it can write $500 million checks, too&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/20/want-to-crush-competitors-forget-softbank-blackstone-suggests-it-can-write-500-million-checks-too/embed/#?secret=9DktICvLrW" data-secret="9DktICvLrW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The good news is many of our companies are already profitable. If you recall from we spoke last time, one of the things that we&#8217;ve tried to do is look for companies that are at the upper end of the growth equity spectrum, both in terms of some of the maturity of the business, and even their growth ambitions where they may have outgrown a lot of traditional growth equity, but they haven&#8217;t yet outgrow Blackstone. As result, fortunately, we have the luxury of not needing to reserve as much because we think our companies are going to run out of capital. That&#8217;s never really the problem.</p>
<p><strong>TC: One of your most notable deals was in Bumble, into whose parent company you reportedly invested<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-takes-controlling-stake-in-owner-of-dating-app-bumble-11573225201"> $2 billion at a $3 billion valuation</a> for a controlling stake in late 2019. Given your other options, why did you decide to do this deal?</strong></p>
<p>JK: First, we knew that dating is not a fad. People will date in bull markets and recessions and, we&#8217;ve learned in hindsight, in quarantine. Even before the pandemic, 40% of all new relationships that started began online. It&#8217;s become much, much more mainstream on the back of mobile phone penetration, and it&#8217;s a global phenomenon.</p>
<p>The second thing we really liked was the opportunity to back [founder and CEO] Whitney Wolfe Herd. She is an exceptional entrepreneur and partner and really embraced the full set of resources that Blackstone was in a position to help give. It&#8217;s been just a phenomenal partnership.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;ve talked in the past about all the might that Blackstone brings to a deal. What did you do for Bumble?</strong></p>
<p>JK: First was cementing Whitney&#8217;s leadership of the overall company. Historically, there were two parts of the business: it was Badoo and Bumble, and they were largely run separately [and now] Whitney is the single CEO of both companies together.</p>
<p>The second thing we did was really augment the management team. We brought in 10 C-level executives alongside Whitney &#8212; the majority of the Bumble team is female &#8212; [and] we brought in six independent directors, [and now] eight of its 11 board members are women.</p>
<p>We also consolidated the product development teams between Badoo and Bumble, and the marketing teams. We meaningfully upgraded the technology infrastructure &#8212; we put in a lot more around reporting and repeatability to make sure the company was going to be a great public entity. We consolidated their real estate footprint [as] they had multiple disparate units in London and Texas and elsewhere, and we centralized that to ensure the culture remained much more consistent. And we got the company ready to be public in terms of [Sarbanes-Oxley] compliance and prepping the company as to what to expect as a public business.</p>
<p>We also massively invested in product, one of which is video chat. Before the quarantine, we introduced video dating before any other platform, and that turned out to be a phenomenal boon for our growth across quarantine, where video usage was up 80% on the platform.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Did your current investors in the fund benefit from Bumble&#8217;s success?</strong></p>
<p>JK: Yes they did.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) weren&#8217;t being used much in 2019 when you struck your deal with Bumble. Do you think if they had, Bumble might have skipped the Blackstone round and just gone public sooner? Do see SPACs as a threat to your work? </strong></p>
<p>JK: I don&#8217;t really view SPACs as competitors. It&#8217;s easy to crap on SPACs but there is a role for them, it&#8217;s no longer the dirty four-letter word it was years ago now that you see many more credible sponsors behind these SPACs.</p>
<p>I do think there will be many more SPACs than good deals to actually invest in, especially when the perverse incentive is: you&#8217;ve got 24 months to invest the money [so] it&#8217;s better to do a bad deal than no deal at all. There is a fundamental misalignment in the current model of SPAC that has led to an arbitrage that we haven&#8217;t seen in many, many, many years.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a place for them, but like direct listings that [prompted people to believe the] IPO model is going to go away, the practical reality is that there have been four or five total direct listings in history. So I don&#8217;t see SPACs displacing IPOs, and I certainly don&#8217;t see them displacing growth equity.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round was co-led by African early-stage VC firm <a href="https://www.future.africa/">Future Africa</a> and Japanese but Africa-focused VC <a href="https://kepple-africa-ventures.com/home_eng">Kepple Africa Ventures</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investors include Acuity Ventures, Aidi Ventures, Assembly Capital, Kairos Angels, Nama Ventures, RallyCap Ventures and Remapped Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angel investors like Ham Serunjogi, co-founder and CEO of Chipper Cash; Josh Jones, former co-founder and CTO, Dreamhost; and Tayo Oviosu, co-founder and CEO of Paga also participated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/gboladeemmanuel">Gbolade Emmanuel</a> and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/ayomide-awe">Ayomide Awe</a> launched Termii after Emmanuel&#8217;s experience as a digital marketer helped him recognize the need for businesses to have exceptional communication channels</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO consulted for these companies and leveraged emails to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">retain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> customers, but as he found out that this process was lethargic, he sought other channels as a replacement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That got me to start thinking about multichannel messaging. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What it meant was that we needed to find how to allow companies to use WhatsApp, voice, SMS </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">effectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; he said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And we had to make the process simple because in the African market, you can&#8217;t do complex stuff. You have to be as simple as possible</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">officially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched and subsequently secured investment from Lagos-based VC <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/early-stage-african-vc-firm-microtraction-reports-portfolio-boom-despite-the-weight-of-covid-19/">Microtraction</a>. Emmanuel says the company found product-market fit two years later after </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">collating enough data from companies in different industries to understand what they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wanted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Termii found out that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to assisting businesses to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">retain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> customers, there was a clear need to verify, authenticate and engage them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Many of these businesses we started engaging said they required tools to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">effectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> communicate and verify customers because they were losing money at those points</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For us, we saw it was a bigger problem,&#8221; Emmanuel added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After making some tweaks, the team began to see an increase in customer numbers, especially amongst fintech startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positioning itself in the fast-moving space, Termii created an API-based communication infrastructure that caters to more than 500 fintech startups across the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s not all. More than 1,000 businesses and developers are also using Termii&#8217;s API</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playing in a $3.6 billion B2C communications market </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to grow 6% </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">annually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Termii runs a B2B2C model</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But how does it make money? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a subscription-based model would&#8217;ve made sense, the two years spent by the company trying to find PMF made them think otherwise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the company leverages a virtual wallet system </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tied</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a bank account and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> customers can make payments to the platform using mobile money, bank transfer and credit cards</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup charges these wallets on a per-message basis. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also does the same on every successful customer verification made toward customers&#8217; contacts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Image Credits: Termii</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In early 2020, Termii started seeing immense progress and this coincided with their acceptance into Y Combinator</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growth continued throughout the year, growing its messaging transactions by 1,000% and experiencing a 400% increase in its ARR</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spilling into this year, Emmanuel says the company&#8217;s revenue is growing 60% month-on-month as a result of the surge in online financial transactions, which to date makes up for 68% of the company’s total messaging transactions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seed investment that is coming a year after Termii graduated from YC will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for expansion and launch more messaging offerings across Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emmanuel says the company has its sights set on North Africa with a physical presence in Algeria for the expansion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason lies behind the fact that in this quarter, Nigeria has accounted for 76% of the company’s messaging transactions, while Algeria currently accounts for 15%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this new fundraising, the company plans to tap into the wealth of experience from some of its new investors like Oviosu and Serunjogi, who have also taken local companies into expansion phases</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Termii&#8217;s round is also noteworthy because it strays away from the usual fintech, mobility, agritech and cleantech sectors that investors typically notice</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, there are only a handful of venture-backed communications platform-as-a-service companies on the continent. A notable example is Kenya&#8217;s Africa Talking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might be a stretch to say </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we might</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> see more funding activity from this segment, but one thing is apparent &#8212; investors are willing to place bets on less popular sectors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p>Another highlight of Termii&#8217;s investment is that while foreign investors continue to dominate rounds in African tech startups, local and Africa-focused firms are beginning to step up by leading some, which is a good sign for the bubbling ecosystem.</p>

<p>This round is also a big step for Future Africa. <span style="font-weight: 400;">According to publicly available information, the firm is leading a million-dollar round for the first time since officially launching last year. This achievement is a continuation of its work over the past three quarters, having</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> invested in more than 10 African startups in the last three quarters and 30 startups in general. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kepple Africa Ventures, the co-lead, is also an active investor and can be argued to be the most early-stage VC firm on the continent &#8212; in terms of the number of deals made. So far, the firm has invested in 79 companies across 11 countries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking on the investment for Kepple Africa, Satoshi Shinada, a partner at the firm, said, &#8220;Fragmented and unstable communication channels are one of the biggest challenges for the digitization of businesses in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emmanuel has proven that with his visionary goals and solid implementation of iterations on the ground, his team </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is unparalleled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to build an innovative solution in this space</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For small and mid-sized restaurants in Nigeria and most of Africa, food procurement can be a complex process to manage</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The system is such that a business can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">easily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> run out of money or have considerable savings. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most restaurants don&#8217;t have access to deal </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with farms to get better deals because they lack the staffing to chase them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, they also don&#8217;t have the aggregation pull as single entities to directly get good value from the farms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerian startup <a href="http://vendease.com">Vendease</a> solves this problem by building a marketplace that allows restaurants to buy </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from farms and food manufacturers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/tunde-kara-a0345121">Tunde Kara</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/olumide-fayankin-3a450339">Olumide Fayankin</a>, <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/gatumialiyu">Gatumi Aliyu</a>, and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/waleoyepeju">Wale Oyepeju</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea for Vendease came when founders who have been friends for more than five years noticed their favorite restaurants in cities like Lagos and Accra shutting down</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inquisitive, they asked the owners who were acquaintances why, and the problems boiled down to the unreliable and expensive nature of food procurement in the cities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some months later they saw a hotel manager </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">openly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> complain to a vendor about the unsteady supply of produce the hotel was getting. It sparked an idea in the founders&#8217; minds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The established processes involved staff or a contract employee going to the market or using third-party vendors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders saw that these processes were often unreliable from the two unrelated events, and restaurants lost a lot of money from price inflation and bad produce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We thought to ourselves that if restaurant owners and hotel managers have these problems, let us actually do some research and find out if it is a problem we can solve the problem at scale and make money while doing it,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; Kara said to TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, Kara, the CEO, and Fayankin, the COO, held the respective positions at a Pan-African media consulting company called RED Media</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aliyu, the chief product officer (CPO), also held a similar role at another Lagos and San Francisco-based, YC-backed startup, 54gene</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Oyepeju, the CTO, was working on a couple of technology projects for corporates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Vendease, they had founded an adtech startup for ride-hailing companies, which didn&#8217;t survive for long</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this was another shot at another entrepreneurial journey, and after two and half months of iteration, the founders decided to launch the company in January 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They also closed an undisclosed pre-seed round to kickstart operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On its website, it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is described</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as &#8220;a procurement platform that provides a transparent process for hotels and restaurants to get the best quality products at the best possible price</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; But Kara has a more fanciful description: The Amazon Prime for restaurants in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers can order anything ranging from bread to grains and meat to vegetables on the website. The order notification goes to the farms or food manufacturers, gets processed, and delivery is done within 24 hours. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why we call ourselves that is because we are deliberate about fulfilling our orders to restaurants and hotels in less than 24 hours</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As most of us know, this is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how Amazon Prime prioritizes delivery,&#8221; he commented.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The speed and timely manner in which Vendease carries out its operations are such that it currently completes 80% of on-time and one-time deliveries across all orders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127339" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127339" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2127339" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vendease_landing_page_1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vendease_landing_page_1.png 1084w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vendease_landing_page_1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vendease_landing_page_1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vendease_landing_page_1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vendease_landing_page_1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vendease_landing_page_1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2127339" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vendease</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To further highlight how effective the company has been thus far, Kara claims that a good number of the 100 businesses using Vendease went from procuring only one type of produce to 80% of their catalog in two months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as Vendease helps restaurants a lot, it also looks out for the vendors and farmers involved in the supply chain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Typically it takes two to three months for these set of customers to get the payments </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and this happens because</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> restaurants and hotels take too long to balance their books before making payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In effect, farmers and vendors mark up their prices to mitigate losses, making products more expensive for restaurants and hotels</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But now, Vendease is helping these customers reduce the waiting time to days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While growing up, Kara and Fayankin were on both sides of the vicious cycle. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up on a farm and helping his parents with livestock and crop care, Kara knows what it means to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be owed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a long time</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Those experiences help fuel what I do right now. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, we had a problem selling our products and most times we ended up consuming them because we didn&#8217;t have enough off-takers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Even when you did, they&#8217;ll owe for six months. And this problem still exists to date.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side of the marketplace is Olumide, who grew up in a hotel and restaurant business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He runs and handles procurement activities and his experience is vital to how Vendease handles issues around unreliable and expensive supply of food produce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although they would&#8217;ve wanted to solve these problems earlier, their careers strayed toward media and energy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it has brought them back, and they&#8217;re solving </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> problems they didn&#8217;t recognise in the past</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They soon figured that customers couldn&#8217;t track most of their orders and be certain of what they got alongside the supply and cost issues</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vendease has built all that to help these businesses digitize, track and automate their procurement and inventory management processes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also helps with logistics, warehousing, quality control and financing where restaurants can</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> buy goods and pay later</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the next five years, the one-year-old company wants to be the &#8220;operating system for food supplies in Africa.&#8221; Kara talks of plans to expand to other African cities in the coming months but is tight-lipped on the names. As Demo Day approaches, the team will be looking to raise some money </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and follows Egypt&#8217;s Breadfast as the only restaurant-focused companies from Africa (although they have very different business models) that the accelerator has funded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Across the street from Suzhou North, a high-speed railway station in a historic city near Shanghai, a futuristic M-shaped building easily catches the eye of anyone passing by. It houses the headquarters of the five-year-old Chinese autonomous driving startup, Momenta.</p>
<p>Like other major Chinese cities, Suzhou, which is famous for its serene canals and classical gardens, offers subsidized offices and policy support to attract high-tech firms. It seems to have chosen well. Momenta exceeded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/momenta-profile/">$1 billion in valuation</a> in two years and became one of the most-funded driving companies in China. The startup has a dazzling list of investors, from Kai-Fu Lee&#8217;s Sinovation Ventures and the government of Suzhou, to Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler.</p>
<p>Momenta recently closed another massive round, which nears $500 million and lifts its total funding to more than $700 million. The investment marks an important step toward the firm&#8217;s international expansion, its chief of business development Sun Huan told TechCrunch. In a few months&#8217; time, Sun will head to Stuttgart, the German hometown of Mercedes-Benz, and open Momenta&#8217;s first European office.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funding, a Series C round, was led by Chinese state-backed automaker SAIC Motor, Toyota and Bosch, an indication of the traditional auto monoliths&#8217; conviction to smart driving.</p>
<p>&#8220;The auto industry needs to develop more advantages when confronting Tesla&#8217;s marketing today, so they are paying more attention to autonomous driving,&#8221; Momenta&#8217;s founder and CEO Cao Xudong told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Financial investors leading the round were the Singaporean sovereign fund Temasek and Alibaba founder Jack Ma&#8217;s Yunfeng Capital. Other participants included Mercedes-Benz AG, Xiaomi founder Lei Jun&#8217;s Shunwei Capital, Tencent, Cathay Capital and a few undisclosed institutions. It&#8217;s rare to see Tencent and Alibaba (or their affiliates) co-invest.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ethics in the age of autonomous vehicles&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/26/ethics-in-the-age-of-autonomous-vehicles/embed/#?secret=MrmD5vCgo8" data-secret="MrmD5vCgo8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>Be pragmatic</h2>
<p>Despite the sizable financial injection, Cao said that &#8220;autonomous driving companies can no longer rely solely on fundraising to burn cash.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mega-fundraising has become common in the capital-intensive autonomous vehicle world. Momenta&#8217;s Chinese rivals Pony.ai has amassed over $1 billion within five years and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/weride-200-million-funding/">four-year-old WeRide.ai</a> has raised over $500 million. Like Momenta, the two firms have nabbed investments from big automakers. Pony.ai also counts Toyota as an investor, and WeRide is backed by Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi.</p>
<p>Momenta declined to disclose its latest valuation. For reference, Pony.ai hit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/06/chinese-autonomous-vehicle-startup-pony-ai-hits-5-3-billion-valuation/">$5.3 billion</a> in its November fundraising round.</p>

<p>Momenta prides itself on what it calls a &#8220;two-legged&#8221; business model. Unlike some peers that concentrate resources on &#8220;Level 4,&#8221; or real driverless passenger cars, Momenta is selling semi-automated driving software to carmakers while investing in more advanced tech that is years from mass adoption.</p>
<p>It also tries to cap expenses by crowdsourcing data from auto partners instead of building its own car fleets, which helps save billions of dollars, the company has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/momenta-profile/">reiterated</a>. By accumulating driving data at scale, Momenta gets to finetune its algorithms through a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/momenta-robotaxis/">self-correcting system</a>. The more data it has, the better its machine becomes at driving.</p>
<p>&#8220;It works like a flywheel,&#8221; Cao said, using a tech industry jargon first <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/the-aws-ipo/">popularized by Jeff Bezos</a> to explain Amazon&#8217;s growth.</p>
<h2>Driver&#8217;s habit</h2>
<p>During a test ride TechCrunch went on, where a safety driver was present but did not intervene, a Momenta-powered Lincoln maneuvered through a neighborhood of Suzhou dotted by jaywalkers, unleashed dogs, speeding scooters and reckless truck drivers. When the sedan slowed down at a highway entrance ramp, other cars zipped past us. It felt as if we were going too slowly, but in fact all the human-steered cars were going well above the 40km/h speed limit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some drivers may want the autonomous driving car to be more aggressive, so we are also exploring a system that learns from individual style,&#8221; said Jiang Yunfei, an R&amp;D engineer at Momenta who went on the ride. &#8220;Of course, on the condition that the car is obeying traffic rules.&#8221;</p>
<p>A tablet next to the dashboard showed what our car was capable of seeing and predicting on the road with a set of mass-produced sensors. &#8220;Prediction relies on data,&#8221; noted Sun. &#8220;If we build our own car fleets, it will be very costly to keep the data-driven approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>Momenta has joined the ranks of companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/autox-removes-safety-drivers/">piloting robotaxis on China&#8217;s urban roads</a>. It aims to remove some safety drivers from its robotaxis, which it jointly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/momenta-robotaxis/">operates with auto partners</a>, in 2022, and expects all of its vehicles to go driverless in 2024. By then, the company will have significantly reduced labor costs and reached a positive operating margin per vehicle.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Daimler-backed Momenta says its robotaxis will be fully driverless and profitable in 2024&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/momenta-robotaxis/embed/#?secret=tjG9c0gTBi" data-secret="tjG9c0gTBi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>Automate globally</h2>
<p>Momenta has kept a quiet public profile since its inception and rarely talked about its customers except for its partnership with Toyota on <a href="https://medium.com/@momentaai2016/momenta-reaches-strategic-cooperation-with-toyota-to-provide-hd-mapping-related-autonomous-driving-6602a1a0129e">high-definition maps</a>, which predated the investment. What Cao could say was the company has fostered &#8220;deep collaborations&#8221; with carmakers and Tier-1 suppliers across China, Germany and Japan.</p>
<p>By the end of 2021, multiple customers will start mass-producing mid-to-high-end cars equipped with Momenta&#8217;s software. And by 2024 or 2025, Momenta&#8217;s solutions could be powering millions of vehicles, which should provide a steady stream of driving data to the startup.</p>
<p>&#8220;Electrification is no longer enough to differentiate one high-end car brand from another because the motors and batteries they used are quite similar. The key differentiator now is intelligence,&#8221; said the founder.</p>
<p>When asked whether Momenta worries about challenges faced by Chinese firms amid geopolitical tensions and continuing U.S.-China technological decoupling, Jijay Shen, who recently joined Momenta as vice president of sales and marketing, said such situations are &#8220;uncontrollable&#8221; and &#8220;regulatory compliance&#8221; is the priority for entering any new market.</p>
<p>&#8220;The human race was able to achieve significant technological progress in the last 10 years exactly because tech companies from different countries are building on top of each other,&#8221; said Shen, who spent over a decade at Huawei and was formerly CEO of the telecoms giant&#8217;s Ireland business.</p>
<p>&#8220;But because of geopolitical factors, many markets will begin to consider self-subsistence in the short term&#8230; I can&#8217;t conclude what is better, but I think the whole ecosystem and supply chain need to think what&#8217;s better &#8212; self-subsistence or interdependence.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/wF5ykfTe4KE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s stipulate the storm of user media (social audio, newsletters, live streaming) is evidence of something real and lasting. When this citizen media migrates to small business and the enterprise, we see that as confirmation, validation. Most of these efforts are in the investment phase, where startups and platforms consolidate ecosystems around the various disruptions.</p>
<p>Clubhouse is moving to a more careful onboarding process that eschews mandatory gobbling of your contacts data and your phone number as a requirement for invitations. Twitter is surprisingly far along on integrating a suite of pilot projects — its Clubhouse clone Spaces, the Revue newsletter creation and distribution tool, and whatever happens to the Periscope live video streaming services the company has abandoned as a standalone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As the smoke clears, what emerges is a hybrid of work from anywhere and post-pandemic digital collaboration solutions. At the top of the stack, social audio delivers some real leadership in the casual way it captures user attention. While commuting listening is proscribed for at least the next quarter, exercise and mental health breaks pick up a lot of that deficit. Some of the resulting content is appointment focused, keynote events with industry leaders and celebrities. Smaller sessions are organized around self- and group-help concerns, and the usual assortment of get-rich schemes. Much of this competes directly with cable news and podcasts, and will likely absorb the older networks into the new paradigm over time.</p>
<p>You can see this at play in the streaming realignment, where cable-cutting is driving us toward broadband-based consumption of so-called linear television programming. Last night, we ended up switching from Comcast&#8217;s video access to CBS&#8217;s Grammy coverage in favor of IP streaming via the CBS All Access app (now renamed Paramount +.) The Comcast CBS channel was full of glitches and pixillation; the streaming version rock solid with what seemed like better video and audio quality. On the appointment television side of the equation, old-style network shows like This Is Us and Grey&#8217;s Anatomy are finding it more difficult to compete with Netflix, Prime, and other streaming originals. And then there are the kids, who refuse to even recognize anything they can&#8217;t stream as relevant.</p>
<p>Moving down the stack from streaming audio (I like that better than social audio as a thing) to the newsletter services, we discover what happens when fragmentation of the media produces too much content and not enough loyalty to a manageable number of suppliers. That loyalty thing is perhaps the new eyeballs, where the stickiness of the relationship is much more desirable for its ongoing lifetime value. Newsletters at their inception were aggregators built to skim the cream of relevant media, in effect replacing the home page and adding a social layer of authority. Now the glut has moved from posts and podcasts to the newsletters themselves.</p>
<p>To differentiate and encourage paid subscriptions, creators are now being wined and dined with tools for managing these microapp sites and competing with magazines and publishers for marquee authors. Newsletter stars start appearing on streaming audio in much the same way that Washington Post and New York Times reporters populate the CNN and MSNBC roundtables. Newsletter&#8217;s role as a blend of must reads is shifting to original material and a marketing channel for influence with the streaming audio communities. Twitter&#8217;s Revue newsletter tool already lets you drag and drop tweets into the latest issue. It seems a small tweak to use the newsletter as a calendar for upcoming Spaces notifications of events. The company has announced plans for Super Followers who can produce and receive subscribed content via this path between the platform and satellite services.</p>
<p>Twitter hasn&#8217;t been Super Clear on how or what video services they will maintain after they sunset Periscope, but closing the loop between streaming audio and on demand video programming gives Twitter a powerful advantage over services like Clubhouse that have fewer pieces of the puzzle. On the other hand, Twitter has to demonstrate newfound ability to launch and integrate the pieces to stay competitive with competitors both visible and in stealth. They include Facebook, Amazon and its growing ad platform, and streaming &#8220;Plus&#8221; services at a time where subscribers are dropping subscriptions to add new offerings from Disney, Apple, HBO Max, Paramount, and the cheaper free ad-supported streaming TV (FAST) networks like Peacock and Hulu.</p>
<p>Working from anywhere is accelerating the streaming media transition. News becomes a notification-driven stream to dip in and out of as the vaccines begin to take hold. Work promotes attention and care of our values, while home brings a time of relearning how to breathe, treasuring our family and friends, and putting time into exploring things we have been fighting to keep alive: the rhythms of history, genealogy, climate change, the possibility that government can work for a change. As our anxiety moderates, we can dip into music, movies, sports, and other expressive uses of the powerful network we turned on to survive. Turn on, tune in, stay home.</p>
<p>Streaming audio can work for marketing, learning, sharing, and monetizing. It can also work for extending our collaboration with music, painting, storytelling, a kind of virtual comedy club, book club, and debating society. I can imagine the return of liner notes to the music experience, a kind of Prairie Home Companion writ small. The Grammys last night were awkward, strained by the exigencies of the virus. But the performances were bunched together, with the wonderful touch of the group of artists sitting on stools campfire-style after their song to listen and rock to the music of their fellow nominees. Clubhouse style.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re on the cusp of a powerful change in the way we live and work. Not just out of necessity but of a desire to fulfill the promise of global communication. We&#8217;ve laid the tracks of this new age of collaboration. Now we have to figure out what to do with it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There’s been quite a bit of movement in the additive manufacturing space in recent months. If I had to pinpoint a reason, I would say that &#8212; much like robotics (another space I follow fairly closely) &#8212; the category has gotten a boost in interest from the pandemic. Medical applications are understandably of interest lately, as is alternative manufacturing.</p>
<p>Desktop Metal, Markforged and new-comer Mantel have all made pretty big announcements in recent weeks, and now Fortify is making the round with a significant raise. The Boston-based startup announced a <a href="https://3dfortify.com/fortify-secures-20m-series-b/">$20 million Series B equity round</a>, led by Cota Capital with additional participation from Accel Partners, Neotribe Ventures and Prelude Ventures.</p>
<p>Fortify is attempting to stake out a claim in material deposits. Using digital light processing (DLP) tech, the company can mix and print in a variety of different materials, with a wide range of properties. The list includes some useful traits, including electromagnetic and thermal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Like Mantel, the company looks to be targeting manufacturing tools, including injection molding.</p>
<p>“Fortify has been focused on proving the viability of our product and market opportunity over the past 18+ months, and exceeded our goals set at the beginning of 2020,” CEO Josh Martin said in a release. “This next round will expand our go-to-market footprint in key verticals such as injection mold tooling while enabling us to capture market share in end-use electronic devices.”</p>
<p>Recent months have also found the company enlisting other 3D printing vets. Paul Dresens (ex Desktop Metal) signed on as VP of Engineering, while former GrabCad (a Stratasys acquisition) market exec Rob Stevens has signed on as an advisor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford said Thursday that some Ford F-150 pickup trucks and Edge crossovers will be built without certain electronic modules due to a twofold punch of a global semiconductor shortage and a lack of parts caused by a winter storm.</p>
<p>Ford said it will <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/03/18/ford-global-semiconductor-update.html">build and hold the vehicles</a> for a number of weeks, then ship the vehicles to dealers once the modules are available and comprehensive quality checks are complete. The automaker also said it is canceling shifts tonight and Friday at its Louisville Assembly Plant because of the semiconductor-related part shortage. Ford said production of the Escape and Lincoln Corsair is expected to resume Monday on short shifts, with full production scheduled to resume Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ford isn&#8217;t alone in its decision to build vehicles without certain parts as the global chip shortage drags on. GM said earlier this week that certain pickup trucks would be produced <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2021/03/15/gm-pickups-chip-shortage/4708837001/">without a fuel management module</a>, a device that will prevent these vehicles from achieving top fuel economy performance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Both Ford and GM have previously issued guidance that the chip shortage will impact its financial results in 2021. Ford has said that if the semiconductor shortage scenario is extended through the first half of 2021, the shortage could lower its earnings between $1 billion and $2.5 billion, net of cost recoveries and some production make-up in the second half of the year. GM said in February that the global shortage of semiconductors will have a short-term impact on its production, earnings and cash flow in 2021.</p>
