										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the great things about editing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ec1/">all of our deep-dive EC-1 startup profiles</a> is that you start to notice patterns across successful companies. While origin stories and trajectories can vary widely, the best companies seem to come from similar places and are conceived around very peculiar themes.</p>
<p>To wit, one common theme that came from our recent profiles of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1/">Expensify</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1/">NS1</a> is the centrality of file sharing (or, <i>illegal</i> file sharing if you are on that side of the fence) and internet infrastructure in the origin stories of the two companies. That’s peculiar, because the duo honestly couldn’t be more different. Expensify is an SF-founded (now Portland-based), decentralized startup focused on building <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/expensify-ec1-business/">expense reporting and analytics software for companies and CFOs</a>. New York-based NS1 designs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-product/">highly-redundant DNS and internet traffic performance tools</a> for web applications.</p>
<p>Yet, take a look at how the two companies were founded. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/">Anna Heim on the origins of Expensify</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>To truly understand Expensify, you first need to take a close look at a unique, short-lived, P2P file-sharing company called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Swoosh">Red Swoosh</a>, which was Travis Kalanick’s startup before he founded Uber. Framed by Kalanick as his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QrX5jsiico">“revenge business”</a> after his previous P2P startup <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scour_Inc.">Scour</a> was <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/scour-sued-over-downloaded-movies/">sued</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/2000/12/scour-going-going-gone/">into oblivion</a> for copyright infringement, Red Swoosh would be the precursor for Expensify’s future culture and ethos. In fact, many of Expensify’s initial team actually met at Red Swoosh, which was eventually acquired by Akamai Technologies in 2007 for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2007/04/12/payday-for-red-swoosh-15-million-from-akamai/">$18.7 million</a>.</p>
<p>[Expensify founder and CEO David] Barrett, a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/david-barrett">self-proclaimed alpha geek</a> and lifelong software engineer, was actually Red Swoosh’s last engineering manager, hired after the failure of his first project, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070122173504/http://www.iglance.com/faq.html">iGlance.com</a>, a P2P push-to-talk program that couldn’t compete against Skype. “While I was licking my wounds from that experience, I was approached by Travis Kalanick who was running a startup called Red Swoosh,” he <a href="https://www.sramanamitra.com/2014/08/24/building-a-profitable-steady-growth-subscription-business-expensify-ceo-david-barrett-part-1/">recalled</a> in an interview.</p></blockquote>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How a band of P2P hackers planted the seeds of a unique expense management giant&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/embed/#?secret=DAg4LkXylO" data-secret="DAg4LkXylO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Then you head over to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-origin/">Sean Michael Kerner’s story on how NS1 came together</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>NS1’s story begins back at the turn of the millennium, when [NS1 co-founder and CEO Kris] Beevers was an undergrad at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in upstate New York and found himself employed at a small file-sharing startup called Aimster with some friends from RPI. Aimster was his first taste of life at an internet startup in the heady days of the dot-com boom and bust, and also where he met an enterprising young engineer by the name of Raj Dutt, who would become a key relationship over the next two decades.</p>
<p>By 2007, Beevers had completed his Ph.D. in robotic mapping at RPI and tried his hand at co-founding and running an engineered-wood-product company named SolidJoint Research, Inc. for 10 months. But he soon boomeranged back to the internet world, joining some of his former co-workers from Aimster at a company called Voxel that had been founded by Dutt.</p>
<p>The startup provided a cornucopia of services including basic web hosting, server co-location, content delivery and DNS services. “Voxel was one of those companies where you learn a lot because you’re doing way more than you rightfully should,” Beevers said. “It was a business sort of built out of love for the tech, and love for solving problems.”</p>
<p>The New York City-based company peaked at some 60 employees before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/03/internap-buys-hosting-cloud-services-company-voxel-for-up-to-35-million/">it was acquired in December 2011 by Internap Network Services</a> for $35 million.</p></blockquote>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YqrxDwntzr"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-origin/">1 napkin and 22 lines of code, or how NS1 rewrote the rules of internet infrastructure</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;1 napkin and 22 lines of code, or how NS1 rewrote the rules of internet infrastructure&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-origin/embed/#?secret=YqrxDwntzr" data-secret="YqrxDwntzr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Note some of the similarities here. First, these wildly different founders ended up both working on key internet plumbing. Which makes sense of course, since back two decades ago, building out the networking and compute capacity of the internet was one of the major engineering challenges of that period in the web’s history.</p>
<p>Additionally in both cases, the founding teams met at little-known companies defined by their engineering cultures and which sold to larger internet infrastructure conglomerates for relatively small amounts of money. And those acquirers ended up being laboratories for all kinds of innovation, even as few people really remember Akamai or Internap these days (both companies are still around today mind you).</p>
<p>The cohort of founders is fascinating. Obviously, you have Travis Kalanick, who would later go on to found Uber. But the Voxel network that went to Internap is hardly a slouch:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dutt would leave Internap to start Grafana, an open-source data visualization vendor that has raised over $75 million to date. Voxel COO Zachary Smith went on to found bare metal cloud provider, Packet, in 2013, which he ran as CEO until <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/equinix-is-acquiring-bare-metal-cloud-provider-packet/">the company was acquired by Equinix in March 2020</a> for $335 million. Meanwhile, Justin Biegel, who spent time at Voxel in operations, has raised nearly $62 million for his startup Kentik. And of course, NS1 was birthed from the same alumni network.</p></blockquote>
<p>What’s interesting to me with these two companies (and some others in our set of stories) is how often founders worked on other problems before starting the companies that would make them famous. They learned the trade, built networks of hyper-intelligent present and future colleagues, understood business development and growth, and started to create a flywheel of innovation amidst their friends. They also got a taste of an exit without really getting the whole meal, if you will.</p>
<p>In particular with file sharing, what’s interesting is the rebellious and democratic ethos that came with that world back at the turn of the millennium. To work in file sharing in that era meant fighting the big music labels, overturning the economics of entire industries, and breaking down barriers to allow the internet economy to flourish. It attracted a weird bunch of folks — the exact kind of weirdness that happens to make good startup founders, apparently. It echos one of the key arguments of Fred Turner’s book, “<a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo3773600.html">From Counterculture to Cyberculture</a>.”</p>
<p>Which begs the question then: what are the “file sharing” markets today that these sorts of individuals congregate around? One that seems obvious to me is blockchain, which has precisely that balance of rebelliousness, democratization, and technical excellence (well, at least some of the time!) And then there are the modern-day “pirates” today such as Alexandra Elbakyan who invented and has operated Sci-Hub to make the world’s research and knowledge democratized.</p>
<p>It’s maybe not the current batch of companies that we see which will become the next extraordinary unicorns. But watch the people who show up in the interesting places — because their next projects often seem to hit gold.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian food delivery startup Zomato said on Tuesday evening that it has raised $562.3 million from its anchor investors ahead of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/zomato-ipo/">IPO opening on Wednesday</a>.</p>
<p>Zomato, which counts Ant Financial  has already secured nearly 45% of the $1.3 billion it plans to raise through the IPO, the 12-year-old Gurgaon-headquartered startup <a href="https://www.bseindia.com/markets/MarketInfo/DispNoticesNCirculars.aspx?page=20210713-45">revealed</a> in a filing to local stock exchanges. The public share sale will open on Wednesday and close Friday.</p>
<p>Tiger Global, Fidelity, New World, Baillie Gifford, Government of Singapore, Canada Pension Plan, Mirae Asset, T. Rowe Price, and Steadview are among the investors that are backing the startup in the public markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The investors have subscribed the shares at Rs 76 ($1) &#8212; the upper end of the price range for Zomato&#8217; shares &#8212; giving the Indian startup an implied valuation of $8.6 billion, up from $5.4 billion in February this year.</p>
<p>The oversubscription illustrates the confidence high-profile investors are placing in the world’s second largest internet market’s first real consumer internet offering.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Zomato must possibly be the only IPO in India till date that has generated such enormous interest without spending a single ₹ <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f92f.png" alt="🤯" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>&mdash; pj (@BeingPractical) <a href="https://twitter.com/BeingPractical/status/1414990714216226820?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In a virtual press conference last week, Zomato executives said the startup, which has search and discovery in nearly two dozen markets, will focus largely on India and will explore categories such as online grocery delivery in the future.</p>
<p>The executives also dismissed Amazon as a serious competitor for now. “There’s no major impact on market share from Amazon so far,” the company’s chief financial officer said. Amazon entered the food delivery market last year and is operational in just Bangalore for now. Swiggy, backed by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Prosus Ventures, is Zomato&#8217;s chief rival in India.</p>
<p>For the financial year that ended in March this year, its revenue was down 23% to $283 million, and it also shrank its losses to $110 million, down 66% from the same period a year ago.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Technology plays a huge role in nearly every aspect of financial services today. As the world moved online, tools and infrastructure to help people manage their money and make payments have burgeoned the world over in the past decade.</p>
<p>With much of the finance world now leveraging technology to conduct business, predict trends and deliver services, financial services regulators are also developing new technologies to monitor markets, supervise financial institutions and conduct other administrative activities. The emergence of purpose-built technologies to facilitate regulator oversight has, over the past few years, garnered its own moniker of supervisory technology, or suptech.</p>
<p>Interest in suptech is proliferating across the globe thanks to a diverse set of prudential and conduct regulators. A sampling of regulators developing suptech include the FDIC, CFPB, FINRA and Federal Reserve in the U.S.; the U.K.’s FCA and Bank of England; the National Bank of Rwanda in Africa; as well as the ASIC, HKMA and MAS in Asia. Several &#8220;super regulators&#8221; are also engaged in suptech efforts such as the Bank of International Settlements, the Financial Stability Board and the World Bank.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The strides in suptech demonstrate that creative thinking coupled with experimentation and scalable, easily accessible technologies are jump-starting a new approach to regulation.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll examine a few core suptech use cases, consider its future and explore the challenges facing regulators as the market matures. The uses are diverse, so we’ll focus on three key areas: regulatory reporting, machine-readable regulation, and market and conduct oversight.</p>
<p>A quick general note: Nearly every financial services regulator is engaged in some type of suptech activity and the use cases discussed in this article are intended as a sample, not a comprehensive list.</p>
<h2>But what exactly is suptech?</h2>
<p>As a preliminary matter, we should quickly survey a few definitions of suptech to frame our understanding. Both the World Bank and BIS have offered definitions that provide useful outlines for this discussion. The World Bank <a href="https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/735871616428497205/the-next-wave-of-suptech-innovation-suptech-solutions-for-market-conduct-supervision">states</a> that suptech &#8220;refers to the use of technology to facilitate and enhance supervisory processes from the perspective of supervisory authorities.&#8221; It&#8217;s a little circular, but helpful.</p>
<p>The BIS <a href="https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/suptech_regtech.htm">defines</a> suptech as &#8220;the use of technology for regulatory, supervisory and oversight purposes.&#8221; This is a similarly loose definition that describes the broader scope better.</p>
<p>Regardless of differences on the margins, the &#8220;sup&#8221; in these suptech definitions acknowledges the primacy of the idea that regulators&#8217; objectives are to oversee the conduct, structure, and health of the financial system. Suptech technologies facilitate related regulatory supervision and enforcement processes.</p>
<h2>Regulatory reporting</h2>
<p>Regulatory reporting refers to a broad swath of activities such as financial firms providing trading data to regulatory authorities and regulators’ analysis of financial data or corporate information to determine the projected health or potential risks facing an institution or the market.</p>
<p>The MAS and FDIC are incorporating transactional and financial data reported by firms as a means to assess their financial viability. The MAS, in conjunction with BIS, has run <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2020/mas-supports-inaugural-cloud-based-g20-techsprint">tech sprints</a> soliciting new ideas relating to regulatory reporting, while the <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2020/pr20109.html">FDIC</a> has &#8220;a <a href="https://www.bis.org/fsi/publ/insights29.htm">regulatory reporting solution</a> that would allow ‘on-demand’ monitoring of banks as opposed to being constrained by ‘point-in-time’ reporting. This project is particularly targeted at smaller, community banks that provide only aggregated data on their financial health on a quarterly basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>The HKMA recently <a href="https://www.hkma.gov.hk/media/eng/doc/key-information/guidelines-and-circular/2021/20210617e1a1.pdf">outlined its three-year plan</a> for the development of suptech, which includes developing an approach to &#8220;network analysis.&#8221; The HKMA will analyze reporting data related to corporate shareholding and financial exposure to bring them &#8220;to life as network diagrams, so that the relationships between different entities become more apparent. Greater transparency of the connections and dependencies between banks and their customers will enable HKMA supervisors to detect early warning signals within the entire credit network.&#8221;</p>
<p>These reporting initiatives touch on a theme regulators have continuously struggled with: How to regulate markets and firms based on a reactive approach to historical data. Regulation and enforcement are often retrospective activities — examining past behavior and data to decide how to sanction an organization or develop a regulatory framework to govern a particular type of activity or financial product. This can result in an approach to regulation too rooted in past failures, which might lack the flexibility to anticipate or adapt to emerging risks or financial products.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The online chat platform Discord is buying Sentropy, a company that makes AI-powered software to detect and remove online harassment and hate.</p>
<p>Discord currently uses a &#8220;multilevel&#8221; approach to moderation, relying on an in-house human moderation team as well as volunteer mods and admins to create ground rules for individual servers. A Trust and Safety team dedicated to protecting users and shaping content moderation policies comprised 15% of Discord&#8217;s workforce as of May 2020.</p>
<p>Discord plans to integrate Sentropy&#8217;s own products into its existing toolkit and the company will also bring the smaller company&#8217;s leadership group aboard. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the acquisition is a sign that taking toxic content and harassment seriously isn&#8217;t just the right thing to do — it&#8217;s good business too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;T&amp;S tech and processes should not be used as a competitive advantage,&#8221; Sentropy CEO John Redgrave said in a <a href="https://medium.com/sentropy/sentropy-x-discord-1ed5c4269896">blog post on the announcement</a>. &#8220;We all deserve digital and physical safety, and moderators deserve better tooling to help them do one of the hardest jobs online more effectively and with fewer harmful impacts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Discord hasn&#8217;t always had a reputation for taking dangerous content seriously. Far-right groups with ties to real-world violence previously thrived on the platform. Discord cracked down on hate and extremism following the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, which left anti-racist protester Heather Heyer dead.</p>
<p>By February of 2018, the company was<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/2/28/17061774/discord-alt-right-atomwaffen-ban-centipede-central-nordic-resistance-movement"> purging white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups</a>, cleaning up the platform on its journey to transcend its gaming roots and grow into a mainstream social network. Now, Discord boasts 150 million monthly active users and is positioning itself as a comfy home for all kinds of communities while holding onto its core user base of gamers.</p>
<p>In a blog post, Redgrave elaborated on the company&#8217;s natural connection with Discord:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Discord represents the next generation of social companies — a generation where users are not the product to be sold, but the engine of connectivity, creativity, and growth. In this model, user privacy and user safety are essential product features, not an afterthought. The success of this model depends upon building next-generation Trust and Safety into every product. We don’t take this responsibility lightly and are humbled to work at the scale of Discord and with Discord’s resources to increase the depth of our impact.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Sentropy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/sentropy-emerges-from-stealth-with-an-ai-platform-to-tackle-online-abuse-backed-by-13m-from-initialized-and-more/">launched out of stealth last summer</a> with an AI system designed to detect, track and cleanse platforms of online harassment and abuse. The company emerged then with $13 million in funding from notable backers including Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian and his VC firm Initialized Capital, King River Capital, Horizons Ventures and Playground Global.</p>
<p>Sentropy will offer existing enterprise customers who use its software products Detect and Defend service through the end of September. The company shut down its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/sentropy-launches-tool-for-people-to-protect-themselves-from-social-media-abuse-starting-with-twitter/">free consumer dashboard, Sentropy Protect</a>, earlier this month.</p>
<p>Sentropy&#8217;s products were conceived as social network-agnostic tools rather than as platform-specific solutions. It sounds like even under Discord&#8217;s wing, the team plans to share insights on building safer online spaces with the internet at large.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to help Discord decide how we can most effectively share with the rest of the Internet the best practices, technology, and tools that we’ve developed to protect our own communities,&#8221; Redgrave said.</p>
<p>Discord&#8217;s future is looking bright. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/discord-ipo-microsoft-deal/">walked away</a> from a possible acquisition by Microsoft earlier this year that reportedly valued it at around $10 billion. Discord looks content to remain independent for now and could <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/discord-ends-deal-talks-with-microsoft-11618938806?st=566xw655qf2bo0d&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share">chart a path toward an IPO</a> in the not-too-distant future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just under a week after Beyond Meat announced that it will be releasing a reworked version of its plant-based Chicken Tenders at restaurants in the U.S., the faux meat company has returned with a potentially sizable restaurant partnership.</p>
<p>Starting July 26, select Panda Express restaurants in Southern California and New York City will offer an orange chicken dish using Beyond’s chicken product. It’s a big potential partnership for Beyond, as the Asian American fast food chain currently has 2,200 locations, largely in food courts and other high-traffic spots.</p>
<p>It could also be a big step for Panda Express, which has traditionally had fairly limited vegetarian options. You know it’s a bit dire for veggies when the press release lists “steamed white and brown rice” as two of its six “plant-based dishes.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2176943" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2176943" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2176943 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-The-Original-Orange-Chicken-Lifestyle-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-The-Original-Orange-Chicken-Lifestyle-1.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-The-Original-Orange-Chicken-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-The-Original-Orange-Chicken-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-The-Original-Orange-Chicken-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-The-Original-Orange-Chicken-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-The-Original-Orange-Chicken-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-The-Original-Orange-Chicken-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-The-Original-Orange-Chicken-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2176943" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Beyond Meat</p></div></p>
<p>Beyond Meat isn’t calling it a pilot, exactly, but notes in an email to TechCrunch, “we are confident that people will love the new menu item and we will keep our guests updated with information on additional rollouts.” One assumes a larger rollout depends on early feedback and perceived consumer demand for a non-meat-based main dish.</p>
<p>“Beyond The Original Orange Chicken is the next step in the brand’s journey to offer more diverse and plant-based options, while still delivering comfort and crave-ability in innovative ways,” Panda Express’  chef Jimmy Wang said in a release tied to the soft launch. “Creating a fresh new take on a classic favorite is a great and accessible way to introduce plant-based proteins to our guests and perhaps even drawing a new audience for Panda.”</p>
<p>Baby steps, but anything that helps reduce meat consumption is probably a net positive. . Beyond also has deals with  Pizza Hut, KFC, Denny’s and Dunkin&#8217; for its various plant-based meat substitutes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Investors are buying into a creator-led future, and<a href="https://nasacademy.com/"> Nas Academy</a> wants to turn that creator influence into a broad network of &#8220;virtual universities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Singapore startup is building out a platform for creators to monetize their knowledge, giving them the tools to create their own classes and academies that fans can attend online. The platform is founded and led by Nuseir Yassin, a video blogger and influencer whose Nas Daily social media accounts boast tens of millions of followers across platforms.</p>
<p>Nas Academy has closed an $11 million Series A led by Lightspeed Venture Partners with additional backing from Balaji Srinivasan, Emilie Choi, TechAviv Founder Partners, 500 Startups and Metapurse, among others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The platform can help creators build on-demand class portfolios or live courses, while the marketplace allows users to navigate and shop around for courses that appeal to them. Yassin hopes the platform can bring some predictability to consumers who are interested in signing up for online courses, but are wary of scams and half-baked offerings. &#8220;This market needs to have some trusted brands and quality assurances,&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> he says.</span></p>
<p>At the moment, a good chunk of the courses skew towards the business of online influence, with classes on video editing, content marketing and entrepreneurship. It&#8217;s also a pretty wide range of price points with costs for courses live on the platform now ranging from $29 to $499. Users can also pay for a bundle of courses, and Yassin says the platform has plans for a subscription offering down the road.</p>
<p>Nas Academy will monetize by taking a cut of these revenues, which may vary a bit, especially right now as the platform is invite-only for creators. As the platform opens up further, Yassin wants it to be a way for creators to find new audiences too. Course operators will have access to emails of their audience and be able to reach out to them directly outside the platform if they so desire.</p>
<p>Investors have been increasingly signing on to back startups building products in the creator economy vertical, especially in the past year. Creator platform Patreon recently raised at a $4 billion valuation. Yassin sees a massive opportunity in not only facilitating closer relationships between creators and fans but serving as an on-ramp for aspiring creators coming to their platform to learn.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think there are another 100,000 creators who will never get asked to make a Masterclass,&#8221; Yassin tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Internet skills are low in supply and high in demand.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zero Motorcycles has been around for over a decade and in that time it’s consistently improved its fleet of electric bikes. With the new FXE, the northern California company has taken the thoroughly enjoyable FXS supermoto and transformed it into something a bit more futuristic looking with a new easier-to-parse display.</p>
<p>The FXE likely isn’t a great pick for two-wheeled beginners or for folks that want a weekend cruiser, but for the experienced rider who needs a daily commuter that packs agility and power into a fun package, the 100-mile range FXE might be the best way to get to and from work. Watch our first ride video for the full story.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In the past year, many of the conversations around autonomous vehicles (AVs) have been dominated by the same question: When will self-driving cars be the norm on public roads?</p>
<p>While industry leaders talked a big game on AVs monopolizing our roads <a href="https://mashable.com/article/autonomous-car-timeline-and-tech">back in 2016</a>, today some experts have put widespread <a href="http://workofthefuture.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-Research-Brief-Leonard-Mindell-Stayton3.pdf">Level 4 adoption over a decade away</a>. However, even that timeline only works if automakers overcome significant barriers — both technical and behavioral. The challenge of bringing AVs to consumers will be tougher than anticipated, with a central part of the effort being focused on earning the public’s trust.</p>
<p>Consumer confidence and mass adoption of AVs go hand in hand. To meet the projected timelines and start building this critical trust today, automakers should accelerate the adoption of autonomous capabilities into advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The challenges facing current ADAS technologies</h2>
<p>The truth is that consumers do not yet trust the ADAS capabilities in their vehicles. A 2021 <a href="https://aaafoundation.org/users-trust-in-and-concerns-about-automated-driving-systems/">AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety survey</a> found that 80% of drivers wanted current vehicle safety systems, like automatic emergency braking and lane-keeping assistance, to work better, noting the lack of confidence consumers feel around current offerings.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			While consumers seem to be aware that AV technologies are advancing quickly, this lack of trust from users will be a major barrier to full adoption and can pose a threat to the industry — no matter how far along the technology develops.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Despite significant recent advancements in the industry, including announcements from Cruise <a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M387/K064/387064893.PDF">gaining permission</a> to give rides in driverless test vehicles to passengers in California, AAA <a href="https://aaafoundation.org/users-trust-in-and-concerns-about-automated-driving-systems/">studies</a> indicate that still only one in 10 drivers would be comfortable riding in a self-driving car. While consumers seem to be aware that AV technologies are advancing quickly, this lack of trust from users will be a major barrier to full adoption and can pose a threat to the industry — no matter how far along the technology develops.</p>
<p>To aid in building the public’s confidence, the industry must focus today on more advanced and reliable ADAS to meet consumer demands. However, current offerings face major challenges that must be resolved before the majority of consumers will get on board:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Lack of reliability in common adverse conditions: </strong>Technologies including lidar and camera are limited to what they can “see” around them. These systems can be easily obstructed by snow, dirt and debris covering the vehicle’s sensors. Additionally, without clear, crisp lane markings — in the event of snow, heavy rainfall or off-road conditions — or strong GPS signals, the typical sensors tracking vehicle location will not function properly.</li>
<li><strong>Poor detection: </strong>There have been several cases where ADAS technologies have been unable to detect degraded lane markings, pedestrians, other vehicles or common on-road objects, resulting in injury and even death for drivers and pedestrians.</li>
<li><strong>Low understanding by the general public: </strong>While some ADAS features are designed to operate independently, there is still a consistent lack of public knowledge when it comes to understanding how to best utilize the systems’ abilities to maximize safety. This lack of awareness poses an unnecessary threat to drivers who inadvertently misuse the technology as well as to those with whom they share the roads.</li>
</ol>
<p>Addressing these challenges and creating better automated driving experiences for consumers is a critical step to mass adoption of future AV technology. The most immediate opportunity to move the needle with consumer acceptance in this area is to target improving reliability and user experience — especially with dynamic vehicle safety systems. To do so, automated and autonomous vehicles need improved sensors and software that enhance today’s systems and, as a result, boost consumer confidence in the safety of automated capabilities.</p>
<h2>A fresh perspective on vehicle positioning</h2>
<p>In the last decade, the industry has made various advancements in positioning systems, which locate a vehicle to the centimeter on roadways and are critical additions to traditional hardware stacks. As a result, experts have been placing bets on technologies such as ground-penetrating radar and novel mapping techniques as the final missing piece to robust vehicle positioning due to their ability to operate in adverse driving conditions and navigate highly dynamic environments.</p>
<p>While it is clear there are different avenues AVs can take to increase their reliability on the road, automakers are still trying to determine which approach can unlock the change in performance required for broad adoption.</p>
<p>When taking a closer look at the differentiators that make these technologies stand out, a common thread is how they address three critical issues: the absence of roadside features such as on open highways, within parking lots or when a car is boxed in by trucks and vision is limited; the reliance of camera-based systems on clear, consistent lane markings; and quickly changing environments in which the scene on the surface looks different from one moment to the next and HD maps quickly become unusable. These common challenges have left consumers frustrated with inconsistent and unreliable ADAS features.</p>
<p>One way to overcome these critical gaps is to explore other avenues for reliable vehicle positioning such as ground-penetrating radar — which allows vehicles to determine their precise location in adverse weather or in rough terrain, amid poor GPS availability and other common barriers faced by automated systems today — to show improved autonomy is possible. By adding these novel approaches into vehicles, automakers can create more reliable and accurate ADAS features — safeguarding the automated driving experience.</p>
<h2>Leaning on ADAS as a vehicle for consumer confidence and mass AV adoption</h2>
<p>A recent study from Partners for Automated Vehicle Education (PAVE) found that consumers familiar with ADAS technology were more likely to feel positive about autonomous cars and that 75% who currently own a vehicle with ADAS features say they are excited about future safety technology. This shows consumer engagement in today’s ADAS features can lead to more positive attitudes on tomorrow’s AV adoption.</p>
<p>As an industry, where do we go from here? Many are finding that there is a unique opportunity to resolve the future issues of autonomous vehicle operations by attacking them head-on in present-day ADAS systems &#8212; where they will otherwise be a future problem that will block mass adoption.</p>
<p>We need to address these critical issues with ADAS technologies and create better driving experiences to earn the public&#8217;s trust. By using higher-performing ADAS as a pathway to mass AV adoption, we can arrive at the destination safely.</p>
<p>The industry, along with consumers, can build a safe autonomous future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electrify America, the entity set up by Volkswagen as part of its settlement with U.S. regulators over its diesel emissions cheating scandal, said it will double the number of its electric vehicle fast charging stations in the United States and Canada by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>The commitment, if successful, means 1,800 fast charging stations — or 10,000 individual chargers — will be installed and operational by that time. The vast majority (some 1,700 stations) will be installed in the United States with the remainder in Canada. This will build off of EA&#8217;s plans to have about 800 charging stations and about 3,500 individual chargers in the U.S. by the end of 2021.  As of today, Electrify America has installed 635 charging stations in the United States.</p>
<p>The plan is part of parent company VW Group&#8217;s announcement Monday to increase public charging infrastructure in North America, Asia and Europe. The expansion aims to increase the number of 150 and 350 kilowatt chargers, or fast chargers. VW nor EA disclosed how much money would be spent to meet this new plan. However, an EA spokesperson did confirm that the company would be spending more than the $2 billion it previously committed to invest into clean energy infrastructure over a 10-year period that kicked off in 2017.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The decision to double its charging infrastructure in North America was prompted by the rapid growth expected of electric vehicles by virtually all the auto manufacturers, according to a statement by Electrify America president and CEO Giovanni Palazzo.</p>
<p>The EV market was once the primary domain of Tesla, the Nissan Leaf and GM&#8217;s Chevrolet Bolt EV. And while the majority of vehicles on the road today are gas and diesel-powered, an increasing number of other EV models have, or are about, to come to market, including the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Porsche Taycan and the Cross Turismo variant, Hyundai Kona Electric, Jaguar I-Pace, Rivian R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV and the VW ID. 4.</p>
<p>Electrify America&#8217;s initial plan was to invest more than $2 billion over a 10-year period into clean energy infrastructure and education. Of that funding, some $800 million was earmarked for California, the largest EV market in North America. This latest boost will be used to increase chargers in established EV regions in the U.S. such as California as well as push into new states, including Hawaii, North Dakota, South Dakota, West Virginia, Wyoming and Vermont.</p>
<p>The company is also adding chargers to a stretch of highway in the upper Midwest, following similar efforts to promote cross-country travel. The subsidiary Electrify Canada will expand its network to nine provinces, including Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. Electrify Canada will also add more stations to British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, the four provinces where it already has a presence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The addition of MagSafe to the iPhone 12 line introduced all manner of fun avenues for accessory makers, but there’s a strong case (so to speak) to be made that a snap on battery pack might be the most useful of all. A number of third-parties (notably Anker and Mophie) have introduced their own versions, and now <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJWY3AM/A/magsafe-battery-pack">Apple’s getting in on the action</a>.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2176873,2176872,2176871,2176870"]</p>
<p>The simply-named MagSafe Battery Pack went up for pre-order on Apple’s site today for $99, with an estimated arrival of July 19. The new pack comes in white (with a subtly gray Apple logo on the back to let people know you went first-party) and provides up to 15W of wireless charging, per the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other details are scarce at the moment, including  precisely how many phone charges you’ll get out of the pack. Eagle-eyed viewers noticed on the rear of the device, fine-print noting the 1,460 mAh size. The pack itself charges via Lightning port, and users can plug it in with the phone attached to get a quicker charge to both the pack and battery at once.</p>
<p>The price is a premium, compared to Anker and Mophie’s products, which run around the $45-50 range for a 5,000 mAh battery.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">There’s a reason startup compensation packages usually include equity, or stock options. For one, it’s a way for startups to remain competitive in the job market and attract top talent. But it’s also a way to reward those employees who join early and give them a tangible reason to stay incentivized to grow the company.</p>
<p>The problem is that while many employees do understand that their equity compensation could mean a big payday in the future — and, in 2021, that’s more likely than ever — they don’t often understand the inevitable complexities of their stock options. That puts employees at risk of not getting the most value after an IPO or, worse, losing them.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever been confused about your equity, or haven’t thought much about it, you’re not alone. That’s why I’m going to share three things all employees joining a startup should do with their equity:</p>
<h2>Understand how to value your equity — and when it can change</h2>
<p>While many startups are getting better at proactively communicating the value of your equity package upfront, some are still figuring out the best way to do it. That’s because, unlike the more straightforward number of a salary, stock options are more nuanced — they’re a living, breathing type of compensation.</p>
<p>The most important pieces of information to pay attention to are your 409A valuation, your strike price, the type of options you were granted and the preferred share price.</p>
<p>The 409A valuation is based on your company’s valuation. This is also referred to as the fair market value (FMV). The 409A valuation can, and does, often change &#8212; they have to be updated at least once a year by a third-party valuator in order to meet tax rules. The 409A also changes during a fundraising event. Investors involved in the funding round determine how they value the company and are given options, at that valuation, in exchange for cash.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The most important pieces of information to pay attention to are your 409A valuation, your strike price, the type of options you were granted and the preferred share price.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Since the company has now been valued higher, the 409A changes for everyone. It’s also possible for the 409A to go down if, for any reason, the company is now valued at a lower amount. This is known as a “down round.” Airbnb had a notable down round during the pandemic, though it eventually recovered and went public.</p>
<p>Your strike price is the price at which you can buy your stock options (also known as exercising). Yes, buy. You are given the option to buy them, which is why they are called stock options. But know that your strike price will likely never change. However, if you’re ever given more stock options (perhaps as a future bonus), this would be a separate grant and the strike price could be different. Companies are legally required to issue stock options at the most recent 409A price (or higher).<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite studies, statistics and oh-so-many pledges, a vast number of companies continue to struggle with recruiting diverse talent. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/examining-the-pipeline-problem/">Some say that it’s not the pipeline problem</a>, it’s an issue with how recruitment rounds and technical interviews are conducted. Others point to success with hiring entry-level diverse talent, but then companies fail to retain and reinvest in those individuals as they progress through their career.</p>
<p>While entrepreneurs continue to poke at the gap between talented, diverse individuals and scaled recruiting, a new merger today between two venture-backed companies paints an ambitious picture of what a promising solution could look like.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.wayup.com/">WayUp</a>, a sourcing platform for diverse candidates, announced that it is merging with <a href="https://yello.co/">Yello</a>, a recruitment software company. The two HR tech companies will operate under Yello as a legal entity but continue to keep their independent branding with a now combined 200 employees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We can send all the diverse applicants into applicant tracking systems or CRMs, but if companies don’t have the automation workflow, and the tools and analytics that they need to make sure that those candidates are truly making their way through, then these candidates are sitting in a black hole,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethwessel">Liz Wessel</a>, co-founder and CEO of WayUp, said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Wessel’s realization of the &#8220;black hole&#8221; that candidates fell into soon turned into conversations with Yello, which she describes as the “most robust [candidate relationship management solution] in the market for early career.”</p>
<p>Now, by combining forces, the startups will be able to create an end-to-end recruitment tool that helps aggregate a group of diverse candidates who have varied backgrounds from across core and non-core schools, ethnicity, majors, location, gender and ethnicity, and then place them with recruiters into a software-powered job funnel.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As the economy reopens, startups are uniquely positioned to recruit talent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/as-the-economy-reopens-startups-are-uniquely-positioned-to-recruit-talent/embed/#?secret=K1ggDZgGJb" data-secret="K1ggDZgGJb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>Data-driven diversity</h2>
<p>Wessel has spent the past seven years building up WayUp around the concept of “data-driven diversity.” The platform differentiates from other sourcing and job platforms by asking candidates to self-report race, ethnicity, gender and veteran status. As a result, employers, which are WayUp’s clients, can prioritize diversity when hiring, while early-career professionals can explore curated opportunities based on their profiles.</p>
<p>More recently, WayUp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/wayup-diversity-dashboard/">launched a dashboard</a> to help employers see where their recruiting process loses diverse candidates. While that dashboard was WayUp’s first foray into the world of candidate recruitment management, today’s merger with Yello suggests it was just foreshadowing the partnership to come.</p>
<p><a href="https://yello.co/">Yello</a> handles recruitment processes for companies, from top of funnel events such as career fairs through virtual candidate engagement and interview scheduling. The company has landed clients like Johnson &amp; Johnson, Tableau, eBay and Adobe for its sourcing, engaging and placing software.</p>
<p>“They provide a ton of automation workflow to make it so that companies can significantly, quickly, efficiently and easily get applicants through in a fair and equitable way,” Wessel said. “Companies often don’t struggle with, ‘how do I get more applicants’ at the early career stage, it’s really, ‘how do I get the most qualified, diverse talented candidates hired’.”</p>
<p>Yello’s been working on a sourcing arm for years in its campus recruiting solution. Now, with WayUp, the database will grow to over 6 million candidates across 7,000 campuses. Candidates, while self-reported, are 71% Black, Hispanic or female, along with “tens of thousands” of veterans, a statement about the merger disclosed.</p>
<p>“In addition to offering a powerhouse of data, recruiters will benefit from the automation opportunities of two solutions from a single company,” said<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corey-ferengul-70b1/"> Corey Ferengul,</a> CEO, Yello, in a statement announcing the merger.</p>
<p>Yello, which didn’t previously have an explicit diversity angle in its software product, is now adding WayUp’s database of talent to its suite of services. And WayUp, which didn’t previously have a candidate relationship management tool, now can offer one to its talent.</p>
<h2>Handshakes</h2>
<p>Even with 6 million early market professionals in its sphere, the companies have a billion-dollar competitor worth paying attention to. Handshake, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/handshake-raises-80m-at-a-1-5b-valuation-as-its-diversity-focused-recruitment-network-for-grads-passes-18m-users/">which last raised money at a $1.5 billion valuation</a>, is a networking and recruitment platform for college students. The job recruiting tool recently passed 18 million users across thousands of universities, including some 120 minority-serving institutions, which include Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Hispanic Serving Institutions in the U.S., as well as community colleges. Handshake’s focus on diversity isn’t as marketed as WayUp’s, but its footprint, as well as a curated network that brings HBCUVs into conversations with its 550,000 employer clients, shows its commitment to underrepresented groups. Canvas, another venture-backed startup in the HR tech world, similarly offers a recruiting platform that is based on self-reported data, aimed at helping diverse candidates land jobs.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RScJqAPiic"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/canvas-lands-20m-so-techs-biggest-companies-can-find-diverse-talent/">Canvas lands $20M so tech&#8217;s biggest companies can find diverse talent</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Canvas lands $20M so tech&#8217;s biggest companies can find diverse talent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/canvas-lands-20m-so-techs-biggest-companies-can-find-diverse-talent/embed/#?secret=RScJqAPiic" data-secret="RScJqAPiic" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With WayUp joining Yello’s brand, it is strengthening its competitive advantage over Handshake, Canvas and other competitors by adding software services to its recruiting tool. It’s been almost four years since both Yello and WayUp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/23/wayup-gets-18-5-million-more-to-help-college-grads-find-jobs/">last raised</a> venture capital money, but the move to merge doesn’t appear to be a lifeboat, as Wessel pointed out that her company beat sales expectations four quarters in a row.</p>
<p>“Yello isn&#8217;t competitive to Handshake at all,” Wessel said over e-mail. “I’ve never heard of one of them winning a deal over the other and we only compete with Handshake if a company isn&#8217;t prioritizing D&amp;I as their main goal. [For what it’s worth], we’ve yet to lose an RFP for D&amp;I sourcing.”</p>
<p>Long-term, it&#8217;s unclear what’s stopping more companies from combining CRM tools with talent tools, Handshake included.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s really hard,” Wessel said. “We have both an Enterprise-grade software that took a decade to build to get it where it is today.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AttackIQ, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> startup that provides organizations with breach and attack simulation solutions, has raised $44 million in Series C funding as it looks to ramp up its international expansion.</p>
<p>The funding round was led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/atlantic-bridge/">Atlantic Bridge</a>, Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures (SAEV), and Gaingels, with existing vendors — including Index Ventures, Khosla Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, and Telstra Ventures — also participating.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> The round brings the company&#8217;s total funding raised to date to $79 million. </span></p>
<p>AttackIQ was founded in 2013 and is based out of San Diego, California. It provides an automated validation platform that runs scenarios to detect any gaps in a company’s defenses, enabling organizations to test and measure the effectiveness of their security posture and receive guidance on how to fix what&#8217;s broken. Broadly, AttackIQ’s platform helps an organization&#8217;s security teams to anticipate, prepare, and hunt for threats that may impact their business, before hackers get there first.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its Security Optimization Platform platform, which supports Windows, Linux, and macOS across public, private, and on-premises cloud environments, is based on the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org">MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework</a>, a curated knowledge base of known adversary threats, tactics, and techniques. This is used by a number of cybersecurity companies also building continuous validation services including FireEye, Palo Alto Networks, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/cymulate-nabs-45m-to-test-and-improve-cybersecurity-defenses-via-attack-simulations/">Cymulate</a>.</p>
<p>AttackIQ says this latest round of funding, which comes more than two years after its last, arrives at a “dynamic time” for the company. Not only has cybersecurity become more of a priority for organizations as a result of a major uptick in both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/kaseya-hack-flood-ransomware/">supply-chain attacks</a>, the company also recently accelerated its international expansion efforts through a partnership with technology distributor Westcon.</p>
<p>The startup says it’s planning to use these new funds to further expand internationally through its newfound partnership with Atlantic Bridge, which will also see Kevin Dillon, the company’s co-founder and managing director, join the AttackIQ board of directors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“AttackIQ has established itself as a category leader with a formidable enterprise customer base that includes four of the Fortune 20,” said Dillon. “We believe deeply in the company’s vision and potential to become the next billion-dollar cybersecurity software company and look forward to helping the company turn early traction in Europe and the Middle East into robust, long-term expansion.”</p>
<p>Brett Galloway, CEO of AttackIQ, said the round &#8220;reaffirms the strength&#8221; of its platform.</p>
<p>As well as enabling organizations to review the robustness of their security defenses, the startup also runs the AttackIQ Academy, which provides free entry-level and advanced cybersecurity training. It has accumulated 17,200 registered students to date across 176 countries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to big SaaS products, few are bigger than Google Workspace (formerly known as GSuite). So it&#8217;s maybe no surprise that one of the first people we contacted to speak at our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=javiersoltero&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=javierpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SaaS conference on October 27</a> was Google&#8217;s Javier Soltero.</p>
<p>Today, Puerto Rico-born Soltero is Google&#8217;s VP and GM in charge of Workspace, which has well over 2 billion users. Today, it consists of products like Gmail and Google Calendar, Docs, Sheets, Slide Meet, Chat and Drive. Currently, Workspace is going through what may be one of its most important periods of change, too, with extensive new collaboration features and, for the first time, a <a href="https://workspace.google.com/individual/?utm_source=the_keyword&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=FY21-Q3-GWSforeveryone&amp;utm_content=signup#individual-pricing-card">paid individual plan</a>. All of this, of course, is happening against the backdrop of the pandemic, which made remote collaboration tools and video chat services like Meet more important than ever.</p>
<p>All of that would be enough to make Soltero a good conversation partner for a SaaS event, but his background goes much further than that. He actually started his career as a software engineer at Netscape in the late 90s and after a few other engineering positions, co-founded launched his first startup, the monitoring service Hyperic, in 2004. Hyperic then merged with SpringSource, which was acquired by VMware, landing Soletro in the position as VMware&#8217;s CTO for its SaaS and Application Services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s likely his next startup, the mobile-centric email startup Acompli, though, that you remember. Founded in mid-2013, Microsoft quickly acquired Acompli in late 2014 and then essentially turned into Outlook Mobile. At Microsoft, Soltero rose through the ranks to become a corporate VP for its Office group and Cortana, before decamping to Google in 2019. Since then, he&#8217;s become the public face of GSuite/Workspace and we&#8217;ll use our time with him to talk about the joys and challenges of managing a massive SaaS product, but also about what he learned from building products from the ground up.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=javiersoltero&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=javierpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Register today</a> with a $75 early bird ticket and save $100 before tickets go up. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=javiersoltero&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=javierpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS</a> takes place on October 27 and will feature the chats with the leading minds in SaaS, networking, and startup demos.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is tinkering around with a new test feature that changes the way users reshare content they like to their Stories.</p>
<p>The test, which will only appear for a subset of users, lets users see a collection of content they&#8217;ve viewed recently when they&#8217;re in the Stories section of the app. That content will be collected under a new reshare sticker, which can be found in the sticker tray when creating a Story. Posts and Reels viewed in the last hour will appear here along with recently created posts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that people sometimes find reshared content less engaging, personal, and fun,&#8221; an Instagram spokesperson said of the test. &#8220;We hope that with this new test experience, people are encouraged to be more intentional and deliberate when sharing things that matter to them.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Content reshared through the sticker will appear against the backdrop of an existing Story, which could encourage more personalization. As it stands now, when users add a post of Reel to their Story, that content generally stands alone against a plain background. The new reshare Sticker adds a new way for people to contextualize content they&#8217;re resharing and makes those posts feel a bit less static (think retweets with comment rather than straight up retweeting a stranger into your feed).</p>
<p>The test isn&#8217;t guaranteed to make it into the full app, but Instagram will use feedback from the new reshare feature to see if it ups the quality of reshared posts. By letting people review what the&#8217;ve seen after the fact rather than just sharing on the fly, the feature could also encourage users to reshare more through their Stories — or at least reshare more thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Instagram tests new features all the time. And while test features don&#8217;t always make it into the final product, they do give an indication of what the company is thinking about when it comes to reshaping the app — and the behavior of the more than one billion people who use it on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Other recent Instagram tests have toyed with the idea of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/instagrams-new-test-lets-you-choose-if-you-want-to-hide-likes-facebook-test-to-follow/">hiding Like counts</a> and experimented <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/instagram-suggested-posts-test-topics/">with mixing algorithmic recommendations into the app&#8217;s main feed.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/">Sourcegraph</a>, a late stage startup that wants to bring the power of search to code, announced a $125 million Series D investment today on a $2.625 billion valuation, a 3x growth from its previous valuation in December 2020, according to the company.</p>
<p>The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz with participation from Insight Partners, Geodesic Capital and other existing investors. The company has now raised almost $225 million, according to Crunchbase data.</p>
<p>Company CEO and co-founder Quinn Slack says that we know by now that every company is building software, and as they do, they are generating tons of code. &#8220;They&#8217;re all drowning in code, and we help solve that. Our product is universal code search, which helps developers search, understand and automate code,&#8221; Slack explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says that companies use Sourcegraph to find problems and vulnerabilities they might not otherwise see. Developers and site reliability engineers may see that there&#8217;s a problem, but getting to the specific part of the code where it&#8217;s happening requires a specialized tool, he says. Some of the large companies might build their own tools for this purpose, but most companies don&#8217;t have the resources and this puts code search within reach of many more developers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Universal code search that we built &#8212; and we spent a lot of time building it &#8212; is the first kind of code search that actually understands code as code and all the connections, that graph of code. And that means that if you&#8217;re a developer, you can get to that answer of how do I do this thing or how do I fix this or if I change this what&#8217;s going to break, in way less time and that&#8217;s why you need a purpose-built code search tool,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>He says that the company was founded in 2013, but it took almost five years to build a product of this sophistication. The startup was able to get funding initially based on the potential of a tool like this. Now investors are seeing the traction they envisioned early on.</p>
<p>Today they have 800,000 developers using the product over the last 12 months and Slack says that they have indexed over 54 billion lines of code. Paying customers include Plaid, Uber, GE and Atlassian. The company has around 160 employees and expects to increase that to 250 by the end of the year with all of this new capital.</p>
<p>The company made the fortunate decision to go fully remote in January of 2020 just a couple of months before offices shut down in the U.S., and his plan is to continue to be remote even after offices fully reopen.</p>
<p>Slack doesn&#8217;t shy away from the IPO question, saying it&#8217;s definitely something they think about. &#8220;We want to be a public company eventually, so that we can show that we&#8217;re going to be around forever. This funding certainly shows that we are growing, and that we are going to stick around and we&#8217;re going to be vendor independent, so you know that&#8217;s that&#8217;s definitely an important part of our strategy.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oakland-based </span><a href="http://mightybuildings.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mighty Buildings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is on a quest to build homes using 3D printing, robotics and automation, has raised a $22 million extension to its Series B round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The additional capital builds upon a $40 million a raise the company announced earlier this year, bringing its total funding since its 2017 inception to $100 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mighty Building’s self-proclaimed mission is to create “beautiful, sustainable and affordable” homes.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims to be able to 3D print structures “two times as quickly with 95% less labor hours and 10-times less waste” than conventional construction. For example, it says it can 3D print a 350-square-foot studio apartment in just 24 hours.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Execs say the new capital will go toward </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">making supply chain improvements and moving up research and development timelines. The money will also go toward </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">helping it achieve a new goal of achieving Net-Zero carbon neutrality by 2028 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">– which it says is 22 years ahead of the construction industry overall. </span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>“As a founding team, we have long been passionate about solving productivity for construction in a sustainable way,&#8221; said co-founder and CEO Slava Solonitsyn. &#8220;We have spent four years figuring out what it takes to achieve that. We believe that we have a master plan now that can work.&#8221;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its launch, the company has produced and installed a number of accessory dwelling units (ADUs).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam Ruben, co-founder and Chief Sustainability Officer of Mighty Buildings, said the new funds will also go toward </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">kicking off development of the startup’s multi-story offering. The multi-story efforts will likely initially focus on 2-3 story single family homes and townhouses with an eye towards expanding into low-rise apartment buildings.  The company hopes to have at least a prototype multi-story offering in late 2022 or early 2023, according to Ruben.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Along with the sustainability improvements already captured by our new formula, this will allow us to develop our next generation material to get us even closer to our goal of being carbon neutral by 2028,” Ruben said. “It will also give us opportunities to implement improvements in our existing design by reducing the impact of our foundations and other, non-printed elements.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, Mighty Buildings plans to speed up its carbon neutrality roadmap by building “high-throughput, sustainable” micro factories, forming strategic supply chain partnerships, accelerating ”blue skies” technology research and developing new composite materials produced from recycled or bio-based feedstock. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The micro factories, according to the company, will be able to produce 200 to 300 homes per year in locations where housing gaps exist. Mighty Buildings plans to create single family residential developments with its panelized “Mighty Kit System.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mighty Buildings has seen quarter over quarter growth in sales, Ruben said, with the company seeing a record of over $7 million in total contracted revenue in the second quarter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is also excited about its new fiber reinforced printing material, which is currently undergoing testing with certification expected to be completed later this year. Mighty Buildings claims that its new formula shows “over 50% improvement” in embodied carbon from its original material and a strength profile similar to reinforced concrete, with more than 4 times less weight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round extension was supported by a few new and existing investors including ArcTern Ventures, Core Innovation Capital, Decacorn Capital, Gaingels, Khosla Ventures, Klaff Realty, MicroVentures, Modern Venture Partners, Polyvalent Capital, Vibrato Capital and others.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to bug bounties, Facebook lags behind the likes of Microsoft and Google in terms of overall payouts and volume of tips received: last year, Microsoft and Google respectively paid out <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/07/08/microsoft-bug-bounty-programs-year-in-review-13-6m-in-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$13.6 million</a> and <a href="http://security.googleblog.com/2021/02/vulnerability-reward-program-2020-year.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$6.7 million</a>; Facebook meanwhile paid out just $1.98 million as of <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/11/bug-bounty-program-10th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November</a>.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, Facebook&#8217;s a younger company and is working on improving its system to keep it on bounty hunters&#8217; radar. In the latest development, Facebook today said that it would be adding a new set of bonus rewards when it pays out on a report if more than 30 days have passed since Facebook first received it.</p>
<p>The Payout Time Bonus, as Facebook is calling it, will work on a sliding scale, where payouts made between 30-59 days will get a 5% bonus; payouts made between 60-89 days will get a 7.5% bonus; and payouts made after 90 days or more will get a 10% bonus. Facebook doesn&#8217;t specify what the base amount is, but in its <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/11/bug-bounty-program-10th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last round of bounties</a>, its highest payouts per bug were as much as $80,000 and $60,000 with some $40,000 paid out in its existing bonus program. But payments might be as low as $500.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">The extra money will work as a kind of incentive to bounty hunters who make a living from these tips, so that when delays happen with Facebook paying out for legitimate tips, the bug hunters know they&#8217;ll get a more lucrative reward for their work in the end — rather than get turned off from working on Facebook-property bugs altogether.</p>
<p>Bug hunting has become a big business for security researchers, with some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/oversecured-mobile-app-security-bug-bounty/">making upwards of $1 million annually</a> from the programs. But bounty hunting is a double-edged sword: it definitely focuses top minds on to specific platforms, but in doing so, they spend more time there than looking for vulnerabilities in some places than others. That leads the biggest platforms to ensure that they are making their bug-ridden environments more, or as, &#8220;attractive&#8221; as others to get people to contribute to their work.</p>
<p>Facebook says that it determines&nbsp;bounty&nbsp;amounts based on a variety of factors, including (but not limited to) impact, ease of exploitation, and quality of the report. &#8220;If we pay a&nbsp;bounty, the minimum reward is $500,&#8221; they told me.</p>
<p>&#8220;We reward researchers based on the maximum possible impact of their report that we find during our own internal investigation of each&nbsp;bug, rather than based on the impact reported initially by the researcher,&#8221; they continued. &#8220;Sometimes our impact investigations can lead tosignificantly higher&nbsp;bounties&nbsp;for researchers, but they can also sometimes take more time to complete. The Payout Time Bonus is meant to also reward our researchers for their patience during this process.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our ongoing&nbsp;payout guideline series, shares more details to help external researchers better understand our payout decisions. We have published three guidelines so far and will publish more in the future.&#8221;</p>

<p>In addition to sizes, there’s a pretty massive gulf in pricing here. Joining the $299 Portrait is the $3,000 4K and $17,500 8K. The pricing difference is all the more pronounced given that the tech essentially offers the same underlying technologies for producing and consuming 3D content.</p>

<p>“Volume is a part of it,” CEO Shawn Frayne tells TechCrunch. “There are actually very few 8K displays out in the world at this size that folks are driving. While we expect the sale of that to be quite profound over the next few years, in the early phases we’re just not making the same scale as the Portrait.”</p>
<p>The company considers the Portrait a kind of ambassador for its technology &#8212; especially over the past year, when getting the systems in front of potential buyers was next to impossible. Having seen a number of Looking Glass’ older systems in person, I can attest to the fact that the effect really isn’t the same over Zoom. Looking Glass says it has sold 11,000 units and is shipping “thousands” a month as it works to fulfil demand and navigate global supply chain issues.</p>

<p>“I think of it as their first opportunity to get their own holographic display without needing their boss’s approval,” said Frayne. &#8220;Someone is curious about it and they get it, and it lives up to or exceeds expectation and they go from there. The quality level is very high for the Portrait, and the bigger units are a bigger format version of that quality.&#8221;</p>

<p>The new models will be replacing their predecessors, which were effectively developer units, rather than mainstream consumer products (though the company will continue to offer support). In addition to lower cost, the second-gen units are lighter and offer improved visual fidelity over their processors &#8212; particularly around the edges, where holographic displays can encounter issues.</p>
