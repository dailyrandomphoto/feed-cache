										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While Apple, Microsoft and the like were scrambling to bring their respective developer conferences online, Google made the executive design to just scrap I/O outright last year. It was a bit of an odd one, but the show went on through news-related blog posts.</p>
<p>While we’re going to have to wait another year to darken the doors of Mountain View’s Shoreline Amphitheater, the company has opted to go virtual for the 2021 version of the show. Understandably so. Google apparently has a lot up its sleeves this time.</p>
<p>Last month, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai teased some big news on the tech giant’s investor call, noting, “Our product releases are returning to a regular cadence. Particularly excited that our developer event &#8212; Google I/O &#8212; is back this year, all virtual, and free for everyone on May 18th-20th. We’ll have significant product updates and announcements, and I invite you all to tune in.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>From the sound of it, next week’s event will find Google returning to form following what was a rough year for just about everyone. So, what can we expect from the developer-focused event?</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141775" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141775" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2141775" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="651" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg 2171w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg?resize=768,489 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg?resize=680,433 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg?resize=1536,977 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg?resize=2048,1303 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141775" class="wp-caption-text">Forest Row, East Sussex, UK &#8211; July 30th 2013: Android figure shot in home studio on white. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> juniorbeep / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>Android 12 is the biggie, of course. From a software development standpoint, it’s a lynchpin to Google’s ecosystem, and for good reason has pretty much always taken centerstage at the event.</p>
<p>The developer version of Google’s mobile operating system has been kicking for a while now, but it has offered surprisingly little insight into what features might be coming. That’s either because it’s going to be a relatively minor upgrade as far as these things go or because the company it choosing to leave something to the imagination ahead of an official unveiling.</p>

<p>What we do know so far is that the operating system is getting a design upgrade. Beyond that, however, there are still a lot of question marks.</p>
<p>Google Assistant is likely to get some serious stage time, as well, coupled with some updates to the company’s ever-growing Home/Nest offerings. Whether that will mean, say, new smart displays on Nest speakers is uncertain. Keep in mind, hardware is anything but a given. The big Pixel event, after all, generally comes in the fall. That said, June is an ideal mid-marker during the year to refresh some other lines.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1897335" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1897335" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-1897335 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EG7Nr6_XUAEyZk_.jpeg" alt="Google Pixel buds" width="1024" height="577" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EG7Nr6_XUAEyZk_.jpeg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EG7Nr6_XUAEyZk_.jpeg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EG7Nr6_XUAEyZk_.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EG7Nr6_XUAEyZk_.jpeg?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EG7Nr6_XUAEyZk_.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EG7Nr6_XUAEyZk_.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1897335" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The likeliest candidate for new hardware (if there is any) is a new version of the company’s fully wireless earbuds &#8212; which the company has <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/04/google-pixel-buds-a-series-tweet/">accidentally leaked out once or twice</a>. The Pixel Buds A are said to sport faster pairing, and if their name is any indication, will be a budget entry.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google denies Pixel 5a 5G cancelation, confirming it’s coming this year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/google-denies-pixel-5a-5g-cancelation-confirming-its-coming-this-year/embed/#?secret=GMfSq373vo" data-secret="GMfSq373vo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Speaking of which&#8230; earlier this year, Google made the rather unorthodox announcement confirming that the Pixel 5a 5G is on the way. Denying rumors that have been swirling around the Pixel line generally, the company told TechCrunch in a statement, “Pixel 5a 5G is not cancelled. It will be available later this year in the U.S. and Japan and announced in line with when last year’s a-series phone was introduced.” Given that the 4a arrived in August, we could well be jumping the gun here. Taken as a broader summer time frame, however, it’s not entirely out of the realm of possibility here.</p>

<p>Wear OS has felt like an also-ran basically for forever. Rebrands, revamps and endless hardware partners have done little to change that fact. But keep in mind, this is going to be Google’s first major event since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/googles-fitbit-acquisition-is-official/">closing the Fitbit acquisition</a>, so it seems like a no-brainer that the company’s going to want to come on strong with its wearable/fitness play. And hey, just this week, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/12/galaxy-watch-4-wear-os-expansion-report/">rumor broke</a> that Samsung might be embracing the operating system after years of customizing Tizen.</p>
<p>Things kick off Tuesday morning <strong>May 18 at 10 a.m. PT, 1 p.m. ET</strong> with a big keynote.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/stripe-closes-600m-round-at-a-95b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$600 million fundraise earlier this year</a>, payments giant <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a> has been on an acquisition march to continue building out its business. In the latest development, the company has acquired <a href="https://www.getbouncer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bouncer</a>, a startup based in Oakland that has built a platform to automatically run card authentications and detect fraud in card-based online transactions. Its technology is tailored for mobile transactions and includes a flow to help users authenticate themselves if they are mistakenly flagged, to come back into an app legitimately (hence the name).</p>
<p>Terms of the deal are not being disclosed, but Stripe is acquiring both Bouncer&#8217;s technology and the team, which will be integrated into Stripe Radar. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/18/stripe-debuts-radar-anti-fraud-ai-tools-for-big-businesses-says-it-has-halted-4b-in-fraud-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Started in 2018</a>, Radar is Stripe&#8217;s AI-based anti-fraud technology toolset, and most of the tech &#8212; which is focused around preventing fraudulent transactions on the Stripe platform &#8212; has been built in-house up to now. Stripe says that Radar already prevents &#8220;hundreds of millions of dollars of fraud for businesses&#8221; each year.</p>
<p>“Bouncer is a great tool for modern internet businesses. It allows them to quickly identify stolen cards, while also ensuring legitimate customers can transact without being blocked,” said Simon Arscott, business lead for Stripe Radar, in a statement. “We’re thrilled to welcome the Bouncer team, and their years of experience building payment authentication software for businesses, to Stripe and to enable their technology for Radar users. With the addition of advanced card scanning capabilities, Stripe Radar will be able block more fraud and further increase revenue for millions of businesses around the world who rely on Stripe.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The deal comes a couple of weeks after Stripe announced the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/stripe-acquires-taxjar-to-add-cloud-based-automated-sales-tax-tools-into-its-payments-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisition of TaxJar</a> to bring cloud-based sales tax calculating tools into its payments platform.</p>
<p>Like Stripe itself, Bouncer was incubated at Y Combinator, in its case as part of its <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/bouncer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer 2019 cohort</a>. In addition to YC, it had raised funding from Commerce Ventures and the Pioneer Fund, but had never disclosed how much it had raised in total.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with the Polish marketing technology startup <a href="https://www.usebouncer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bouncer</a>, which provides bulk email verification, Oakland Bouncer was co-founded by Will Megson (CEO) and Sam King (chief scientist), who between them have an interesting pedigree when it comes to identity verification, from academia to working at fast-scaling companies in categories that have been some of the biggest adopters of verification technology.</p>
<p>Both previously worked for years at on-demand transportation service Lyft in fraud, identity and payment management. Before that, Megson was at Groupon; and King, in addition to holding a position as an associate professor of computer science at UC Davis, worked at Twitter on account security, founding the fake accounts team.</p>
<p>Groupon is among the customers that Bouncer currently works with, alongside OfferUp, ibotta and Dealerware. Bouncer will keep its current service and customers up post-deal.</p>
<p>Radar is <a href="https://stripe.com/gb/pricing#radar-pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently sold in a number of tiers</a> ranging from free to 6p per screened transaction, depending on how it is being used (there is a more basic machine learning tier, and an enhanced tier for fraud teams, and the price varies also depending on whether customers are using Stripe&#8217;s standard pricing fees or something else). Stripe also offers a chargeback protection service priced at 0.4% per transaction, as well as analytics tools for Radar customers to get an overview of what is going on.</p>
<p>Stripe says that Radar has blocked more than $1 billion in fraudulent transactions since it was launched.</p>
<p>Bouncer is also <a href="https://www.getbouncer.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently priced at different tiers</a>, ranging from free to $.15/scan for its basic solution, or a custom price for its more tailored services.</p>
<p>Integrating Bouncer&#8217;s card scanning and risk technology into the Radar stack will both sweeten the deal for people to buy those services from Stripe, but also make the tools more effective.</p>
<p>As Stripe describes it, when Radar flags a transaction, Bouncer&#8217;s card screening and verification technology will kick in as a &#8220;dynamic intervention&#8221; to confirm whether or not a customer had a legitimate card at the time of the transaction. This is done to help reduce false positives, which are more frequent in high risk transactions (such as those for big-ticket items, or if a person has been making several transactions in quick succession, or other payment activity that just comes up as unusual in systems).</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been in a wave of new authentication technology that includes things like biometrics and other innovations, but Bouncer takes an approach that is less high-tech at the point of ingestion &#8212; needing only a phone&#8217;s camera and the card that the customer is using. When a transaction is flagged up and sent to Bouncer for verification, Bouncer works by requesting a picture of the payment card (which can be based on any payment card type and can be a low-light picture).</p>
<p>It then runs that through its PCI- and GDPR-compliant system to see if it&#8217;s stolen or real. If it&#8217;s real, the transaction continues; stolen and the transaction is cancelled. The whole process can take less than a second (not including the time it takes you to take a picture, of course).</p>
<p>For Bouncer, the idea is that Stripe&#8217;s machine learning engine will in turn help Bouncer become more effective.</p>
<p>“I’m excited that we’ll be able to scale our advanced card-verification technology across the Stripe network to help businesses grow their revenue while further reducing fraud behind the scenes,” said Will Megson, CEO of Bouncer, in a statement. “The same signals that Radar learns from will make Bouncer more effective, and Bouncer will, in turn, make Radar more effective. We couldn’t be more excited to join the Radar team.”</p>
<p>Stripe has made a number of acquisitions over the years to bring in key pieces of technology, and in one case &#8212; when it acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayStack in Lagos</a> (another YC alum) &#8212; to help Stripe enter and serve merchants in Africa and more emerging markets overall.</p>
<p>At least two of these have been made in aid of bringing on technologists and technology to build out its compliance and authentication tools. In <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/stripe-acquires-teapot--3c1237bf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 Stripe quietly acquired Teapot</a>, a Silicon Valley startup that had been working on APIs for identity verification, trust, credit and other tools needed in financial transactions. Its co-founders spent some years at the company before moving on to other things.</p>
<p>In 2019, Stripe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/stripe-acquires-touchtech-updates-apis-to-prep-for-strong-customer-authentication-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired a startup out of Ireland called Touchtech</a> to bring in technology to prepare for Strong Customer Authentication regulations in Europe.</p>
<p>The need for better, more sophisticated tools to ensure online transactions are legit is not going anywhere fast. Malicious hacking &#8212; and the consequences that has for obtaining personal data that can be used in consumer fraud &#8212; continues to be a persistent threat. And in the meantime, e-commerce continues to become an ever-more mainstream activity, widening the pool of consumers and the chances of things going wrong.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">There’s a lot of noise out there. The ability to effectively communicate can make or break your launch. It will play a role in determining who wins a new space &#8212; you or a competitor.</p>
<p>Most people get that. I get emails every week from companies coming out of stealth mode, wanting to make a splash. Or from a Series B company that’s been around for a while and hopes to improve their branding/messaging/positioning so that a new upstart doesn&#8217;t eat their lunch.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			You have to stop thinking that what you are up to is interesting.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>How do you make a splash? How do you stay relevant?</p>
<p>Worth noting is that my area of expertise is in the DevOps space and that slant may crop up occasionally. But these five specific tips should be applicable to virtually any startup.</p>
<h2>Leverage your founders</h2>
<p>This is especially important if you are a small startup that not many people know about. Journalists don’t want to hear opinions from your head of marketing or product &#8212; they want to hear from the founders. What problems are they solving? What unique opinions do they have about the market? These are insights that mean the most coming from the people that started the company. So if you don’t have at least one founder that can dedicate time to being the face, then PR is going to be an uphill battle.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean there isn’t plenty to do to support these efforts. Create a list of all the journalists that have written about your competitors. Read those articles. How can your founder add value to these conversations? Where should you be contributing thought leadership? What are the most interesting perspectives you can offer to those audiences?</p>
<p>This is legwork and research you can do before looping founders into the conversation. Getting your PR going can be like trying to push a broken-down car up the road: If the founders see you exerting effort to get things moving on your own, they&#8217;re more likely to get beside you and help.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example: It may be unreasonable to ask a founder to sit down and write a 1,000-word thought leadership piece by the end of the week, but they very likely have 20 minutes to chat, especially if you make it clear that the contents of the conversation will make for great thought leadership pieces, social media posts, etc.</p>
<p>The flow looks like:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>You</em> come up with topic ideas based on research.</li>
<li>The founder picks their favorite.</li>
<li>You and the founder schedule a 20-minute chat to get their thoughts on paper.</li>
<li><em>You</em> write up the content based on those thoughts.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook has failed in its bid to prevent its lead EU data protection regulator from pushing ahead with a decision on whether to order suspension of its EU-U.S. data flows.</p>
<p>The Irish High Court has just issued a <a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2021-05/High%20Court%20Judgement%202021-05-14.pdf">ruling</a> dismissing the company&#8217;s challenge to the Irish Data Protection Commission&#8217;s (DPC) procedures.</p>
<p>The case has huge potential operational significance for Facebook, which may be forced to store European users&#8217; data locally if it&#8217;s ordered to stop taking their information to the U.S. for processing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling/">September </a>the Irish data watchdog made a preliminary order warning Facebook it may have to suspend EU-U.S. data flows. Facebook responded by filing for a judicial review and obtaining a stay on the DPC&#8217;s procedure. That block is now being unblocked.</p>
<p>We understand the involved parties have been given a few days to read the High Court judgement ahead of another hearing on Thursday &#8212; when the court is expected to formally lift Facebook&#8217;s stay on the DPC&#8217;s investigation (and settle the matter of case costs).</p>
<p>The DPC declined to comment on today&#8217;s ruling in any detail &#8212; or on the timeline for making a decision on Facebook&#8217;s EU-U.S. data flows &#8212; but deputy commissioner Graham Doyle told us it &#8220;welcomes today’s judgment&#8221;.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook told it may have to suspend EU data transfers after Schrems II ruling&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling/embed/#?secret=pMTvicyeM3" data-secret="pMTvicyeM3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Its preliminary suspension order last fall followed a landmark judgement by Europe&#8217;s top court <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">in the summer</a> &#8212; when the CJEU struck down a flagship transatlantic agreement on data flows, on the grounds that U.S. mass surveillance is incompatible with the EU&#8217;s data protection regime.</p>
<p>The fall-out from the CJEU&#8217;s invalidation of Privacy Shield (as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/europes-top-court-strikes-down-safe-harbor-data-transfer-agreement-with-u-s/">an earlier ruling striking down its predecessor Safe Harbor</a>) has been ongoing for years &#8212; as companies that rely on shifting EU users&#8217; data to the U.S. for processing have had to scramble to find valid legal alternatives.</p>
<p>While the CJEU did not outright ban data transfers out of the EU, it made it crystal clear that data protection agencies must step in and suspend international data flows if they suspect EU data is at risk. And EU to U.S. data flows were signalled as at clear risk given the court simultaneously struck down Privacy Shield.</p>
<p>The problem for some businesses is therefore that there may <em>simply</em> <em>not be</em> a valid legal alternative. And that&#8217;s where <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook/">things look particularly sticky for Facebook</a>, since its service falls under NSA surveillance via Section 702 of the FISA (which is used to authorize mass surveillance programs like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/07/ecj-ag-prism-opinion/">Prism</a>).</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>So what happens now for Facebook, following the Irish High Court ruling?</p>
<p>As ever in this complex legal saga &#8212; which has been going on in various forms since an original 2013 complaint made by European privacy campaigner Max Schrems &#8212; there&#8217;s still some track left to run.</p>
<p>After this unblocking the DPC will have two enquiries in train: Both the original one, related to Schrems&#8217; complaint, and an own volition enquiry it decided to open last year &#8212; when it said it was pausing investigation of Schrems&#8217; original complaint.</p>
<p>Schrems, via his privacy not-for-profit noyb, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/facebook-eu-us-data-transfer-complaint-schrems-gets-a-judicial-review-of-the-irish-dpcs-procedure/">filed for his own judicial review of the DPC&#8217;s proceedings</a>. And the DPC quickly agreed to <a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2021-05/Settelement%20-%20DPC%20-%20Schrems.pdf">settle</a> &#8212; agreeing in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">January</a> that it would &#8220;swiftly&#8221; finalize Schrems&#8217; original complaint. So things were already moving.</p>
<p>The tl;dr of all that is this: The last of the bungs which have been used to delay regulatory action in Ireland over Facebook&#8217;s EU-U.S. data flows are finally being extracted &#8212; and the DPC must decide on the complaint.</p>
<p>Or, to put it another way, the clock is ticking for Facebook&#8217;s EU-U.S. data flows. So <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/facebook-denies-it-will-pull-service-in-europe-over-data-transfer-ban/">expect another wordy blog post from Nick Clegg very soon</a>.</p>
<p>Schrems <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">previously told TechCrunch</a> he expects the DPC to issue a suspension order against Facebook within months &#8212; perhaps as soon as this summer (and failing that by fall).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Nz3q3sgbyu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/31/tech-companies-we-see-through-your-flimsy-privacy-promises/">Tech companies, we see through your flimsy privacy promises</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tech companies, we see through your flimsy privacy promises&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/31/tech-companies-we-see-through-your-flimsy-privacy-promises/embed/#?secret=Nz3q3sgbyu" data-secret="Nz3q3sgbyu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a statement reacting to the Court ruling today he reiterated that position, saying: &#8220;After eight years, the DPC is now required to stop Facebook&#8217;s EU-US data transfers, likely before summer. Now we simply have two procedures instead of one.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Ireland (finally) decides it won&#8217;t mark the end of the regulatory procedures, though.</p>
<p>A decision by the DPC on Facebook&#8217;s transfers would need to go to the other EU DPAs for review &#8212; and if there&#8217;s disagreement there (as seems highly likely, given what&#8217;s happened with draft DPC GDPR decisions) it will trigger a further delay (weeks to months) as the European Data Protection Board seeks consensus.</p>
<p>If a majority of EU DPAs can&#8217;t agree the Board may itself have to cast a deciding vote. So that could extend the timeline around any suspension order. But an end to the process is, at long last, in sight.</p>
<p>And, well, if a critical mass of domestic pressure is <em>ever</em> going to build for pro-privacy reform of U.S. surveillance laws now looks like a really good time&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;We now expect the DPC to issue a decision to stop Facebook&#8217;s data transfers before summer,&#8221; added Schrems. &#8220;This would require Facebook to store most data from Europe locally, to ensure that Facebook USA does not have access to European data. The other option would be for the US to change its surveillance laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook has been contacted for comment on the Irish High Court ruling.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The company has now sent us this statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today’s ruling was about the process the IDPC followed. The larger issue of how data can move around the world remains of significant importance to thousands of European and American businesses that connect customers, friends, family and employees across the Atlantic. Like other companies, we have followed European rules and rely on Standard Contractual Clauses, and appropriate data safeguards, to provide a global service and connect people, businesses and charities. We look forward to defending our compliance to the IDPC, as their preliminary decision could be damaging not only to Facebook, but also to users and other businesses.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you’re head-down and nose to the grindstone — I’m looking at all you hard-working early-stage startup founders — it’s easy to miss a deadline for an outstanding opportunity. Case in point: competing in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/">Startup Battlefield</a> at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> in September.</p>
<p>We want every game-changing, innovative startup — from anywhere around the world — to have a shot at massive exposure to investors, media and other influential unicorn-makers. The $100,000 in equity-free prizemoney would be nice, too, right? That’s why we’re extending our application deadline for another full week.</p>
<p>It won’t cost you a thing to apply or to participate, so don’t let this trajectory-changing opportunity slip past you. <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/zM4H0xNn">Apply to Startup Battlefield here</a> before <strong>May 27 at 11:59 p.m. (PT)</strong>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The TechCrunch editorial team will vet every application and ultimately choose roughly 20 startups to go head-to-head. Each team receives weeks of free, rigorous coaching from our seasoned Battlefield team. Your pitch, presentation skills and business model will reach new heights of excellence. You’ll also be ready to deftly handle all the questions you’ll receive from our expert VC judges.</p>
<p>Startup Battlefield plays out over several rounds, with the field progressively narrowing. Each time you make the cut, you’ll repeat your pitch-and-answer session to a new set of judges. All that training, prep and focus leads to a final showdown and one last grab for the brass ring. And then it’s up to the judges to decide which stand-out startup wins the championship and that huge check.</p>

<p>While only one startup wins the money and the title, every team that competes benefits from standing in a global spotlight. Sean Huang, co-founder of Matidor, competed in Startup Battlefield at Disrupt 2020. His team was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/and-the-winner-of-startup-battlefield-at-disrupt-2020-is-canix/">one of the five finalists</a>. Here’s what he said about his experience:</p>
<p>&#8220;Going through Startup Battlefield helped us simplify and improve our pitch. It helped us not only with brand messaging, but also to win other pitch competitions after Battlefield. By pitching in the finals, we booked a demo with one of the final panelists. We received inbound investment interest from 12 Tier-1 investors, and eight potential key clients came to our website for a demo session. We also received an endorsement letter for our Y Combinator application from a fellow Battlefield participant, with whom we formed a great connection.&#8221;</p>
<p>You’re head down and focused — that’s why we’re giving you a one-week extension. So&#8230; stop, look up and grab this opportunity to take your startup to whole new levels. Get your nose off that grindstone and <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/zM4H0xNn">apply to Startup Battlefield here</a> before <strong>May 27 at 11:59 p.m. (PT).</strong></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">While the COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on countless businesses across the globe, the $118 billion gaming industry not only survived, it thrived, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215786/video-games-covid-19-animal-crossing-among-us">55%</a> of American consumers turning to gaming for entertainment, stress relief, relaxation and a connection to the outside world amid lockdowns.</p>
<p>This drove a 20% boost in gaming sales globally and created nearly 20,000 jobs in 2020 alone. And it’s not expected to stop any time soon: According to research company <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/video-games-industry/">IBISWorld</a>, the industry is set to grow again in 2021, adding to the year-over-year growth the industry has seen in the preceding half-decade.</p>
<p>This is great news for the growing gaming industry and especially those looking to score a job at a company developing the next blockbuster. The unemployment rate is <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/employment/video-games-united-states/">already near zero</a> for those with gaming development and design skills, which means there is an unprecedented opportunity to join the field.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

			The unemployment rate is already near zero for those with gaming development and design skills, which means there is an unprecedented opportunity to join the field.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Gamesmith, a digital community dedicated to the gaming industry, currently has more than 5,750 open jobs posted on its site, with roles in design, engineering and animation leading the way. In other words, if you never considered a career in the gaming industry &#8212; or thought that your skill set wouldn’t translate &#8212; this expanding job market needs employees from all types of backgrounds. Chances are one of your interests &#8212; besides gaming, of course &#8212; can act as a conduit into finding a career.</p>
<p>One career path for those with art skills &#8212; particularly with a talent for digital art tools like Autodesk Maya and Adobe Photoshop &#8212; is animation. An animator can do any number of jobs at a gaming company or studio, from building immersive landscapes and cities to modeling what a certain character will look like to designing user interfaces and navigational components. There is significant growth here, too: According to a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210121005429/en/Global-Animation-VFX-Video-Games-Market-Report-2021-Strategies-Trends-Opportunities-2020-2025---ResearchAndMarkets.com">recent study</a>, most sectors of the animation industry are growing 2% to 3% year over year. According to Gamesmith, the average 30-year-old female artist or animator makes a salary of just under $90,000 a year.</p>
<p>If you’re a whiz with words and witty dialogue, then you might consider applying for a job as a writer at a studio. Writers are responsible for writing everything from the profanity-laced shouts heard in the background in the Grand Theft Auto series to the long speeches in epic adventures like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Employers are looking for writers with a flair for crafting stories and understanding characters, so even if you’re not a career writer, highlight the work you’ve done that fits in the mold of what game publishers are looking for.</p>
<p>One of the most important segments of the industry &#8212; and one of the fastest-growing &#8212; is developing and designing the gaming experiences themselves. The job market for these roles is predicted to grow by 9.3% between 2016 and 2026, <a href="https://www.neit.edu/blog/video-game-designer-job-outlook#:~:text=Video%20Game%20Designing%20is%20one,9.3%25%20between%202016%20and%202026.">according to the New England Institute of Technology</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span> and the breadth of jobs in this wing of the industry range from level designers to lead designer and developers.</p>
<p>Gamesmith calculated that these jobs account for 16% of the available openings, but make up only 5% of all applications. While you will need at least a computer science degree and an understanding of the fundamentals of programming to land one of these jobs, the payoff for the time spent hitting the books is worth it. Gamesmith estimates that the average 28-year-old male engineer earns a salary north of $100,000.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t have any of these skills to help design a game from the ground up, there are still plenty of ways to break into the industry. No matter how good a game is, it will only be a success if people know about it, so the marketing and promotions teams at studios play a crucial role in making sure that consumers purchase the latest release and that it gets written about. If you have great communication skills and can work through people’s problems, companies always need customer service representatives.</p>
<p>Across all sectors of the gaming world, companies are looking to diversify their workforce and move away from an image as a job sector solely populated by white men in their early to mid-30s. Gamesmith research found that currently 74% of the industry’s workforce is male and 64% is white.</p>
<p>But that is changing. While in 2020, only 24% of studios invested moderate resources into diversity initiatives, out of those studios that did invest those resources, 96% reported at least moderately successful results and improvements to company culture. It may seem slow, but there does seem to be a recognition that the gaming industry needs a more diverse workforce as a way not just to bring more equity to their offices, but to make better games in the future and make the industry look more like the people who play games.</p>
<p>“Diversity isn’t a nicety; it’s a necessity if the industry is going to grow, thrive and truly reflect the tens of millions of people who play games every day in this country,” said Jo Twist, the CEO of the U.K.-based gaming trade association Ukie. “A diverse industry that draws on myriad cultures, lifestyles and experiences will lead to more creative and inclusive games that capture the imagination of players and drive our sector forward.”</p>
<p>Between the push to diversify the industry and a slew of new opportunities in the field, the key takeaway is that there are a wide range of possible careers in the industry and, even if you don’t think they do, your skills probably translate into one of the many roles that a gaming company needs to fill. Avid gamers know that you’re not going to beat a game the first time you turn on your console. So hone your skills, build up your experience and continue your quest to land a job in the industry of your dreams.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last call, y’all. Today’s the final day to keep more money in your pocket and still enjoy three opportunity-packed days at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> on September 21-23. Our super early-bird price — $99 — disappears <strong>tonight, May 14 at 11:59 p.m. (PT)</strong>.</p>
<p>Get your click on, avoid the price hike and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">buy your pass right here, right now</a>. Unless, of course, you enjoy paying more than necessary. Hey, we don’t judge.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about just some of the reasons why <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TC Disrupt</a> ranks as the must-attend event for anyone within the early-stage startup ecosystem. Connection is key to growth, and you’ll connect with thousands of attendees from around the world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>An all-virtual Disrupt means you can build relationships and collaborate with Silicon Valley movers and shakers no matter where Google Map pins you. And you never know where in the world you might find the perfect partner or eager investor.</p>
<p>Networking at Disrupt is practically an Olympic sport, and now you have two ways to make those vital connections. First up, here’s what Ada Lau, the manager of market development at Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation, had to say about networking on the fly:</p>
<blockquote><p>The virtual platform’s chat feature made it easy to connect with participants. People got creative using it to promote their business, like posting a LinkedIn profile or offering 15-minute time slots to review business pitches. I even saw a product-naming competition. You could find lots of opportunity rolling through the chat area.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you want to target people based on shared business goals, you’ll love CrunchMatch, our AI-powered platform. Answer a few quick questions during registration, and you can schedule one-on-one meetings with the people who can help you move forward — pitch investors, demo products, interview tech talent, build important relationships.</p>
<p>Jessica McLean, the director of marketing and communications at Infinite-Compute, shared this about her networking experience:</p>
<blockquote><p>CrunchMatch made networking easy. We sent quick introductions, scheduled meetings with investors and other smart people who could add value to our company. A person we connected with at Disrupt is currently helping us with marketing, which is fantastic.</p></blockquote>
<p>Beyond networking, you’ll find plenty of possibilities in our expo area. Hundreds of early-stage startups in the Startup Alley ready to showcase their tech products, services and platforms.</p>
<p>You won’t want to miss any of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#eb919231-f3e4-4def-8dd0-afb0bc7c9c6e">incredible speakers</a>, interviews, presentations and panel discussions — and thanks to the combination of livestreaming and video-on-demand with your complementary three-month Extra Crunch membership, you can catch them all at your convenience.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> takes place on September 21-23, but today is the last day you can attend all three days for less than $100. Don’t miss out on serious savings. Stop what you’re doing right now and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">buy your pass your TC Disrupt 2021</a>. The deadline expires tonight, <strong>May 14 at 11:59 p.m. (PT).</strong></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Similar to how telehealth faced declines as patients returned to in-person care, edtech will face similar drops as schools become a safer option for students and teachers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After years in the backwaters of venture capital, edtech had a booming 2020. Not only did its products become must-haves after schools around the globe went remote, but investors also poured capital into leading projects. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/how-is-edtech-spending-its-extra-capital/">There was even some exit activity</a>, with well-known edtech players like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/5-takeaways-from-the-coursera-ipo-filing/">Coursera going public</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>But despite a rush of private capital &#8212; which has continued into this year, as we’ll demonstrate &#8212; edtech stocks have taken a hammering in recent weeks. So while venture capitalists and other startup investors are pumping more capital into the space in hopes of future outsize returns, the stock market is signaling that things might be heading in the other direction.</p>
<p>Who’s right? One investor that The Exchange spoke to noted that market turbulence is just that, and that he’s tuning into activity but not yet changing his investment strategy. At the same time, the recent volatility is worth tracking in case it&#8217;s a preview of edtech&#8217;s slowdown.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the changing value of edtech stocks in recent months, parse some preliminary data via <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook</a> that provides a good feel for the directional momentum of edtech venture capital, and try to see if there’s irrational exuberance among private investors.</p>
<p>You could argue that it’s public investors who are suffering from irrational pessimism and that private-market investors have the right of it. But since public markets price private markets, we tend to listen to them. Let’s go!</p>
<h2>Falling shares</h2>
<p>We’re sure that you want to get into the private-market data, so we’ll be brief in describing the public-market carnage. What follows is a digest of edtech stocks and their declines from recent highs:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Compared to its 52-week high, <strong>Chegg</strong> stock has lost over a third of its value.</li>
<li aria-level="1">After reaching $62.53 per share in April, <strong>Coursera</strong> has shed about half of its value and is trading close to its $33 IPO price.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>2U</strong> closed at $33.92 per share yesterday, its shares also losing half of their value compared to their 52-week high.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Staying on that theme, <strong>Stride</strong> (K12) closed at $26.77 per share yesterday, which is about half of its 52-week high.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://cisco.com">Cisco</a> has been busy on the acquisition front this week, and today the company announced it was buying threat assessment platform <a href="https://www.kennasecurity.com/">Kenna Security</a>, the third company it has purchased this week. The two companies did not disclose the purchase price.</p>
<p>With Kenna, Cisco gets a startup that uses machine learning to sort through the massive pile of threat data that comes into a security system on a daily basis and prioritizes the threats most likely to do the most damage. That could be a very useful tool these days when threats abound and it&#8217;s not always easy to know where to put your limited security resources. Cisco plans to take that technology and integrate into its SecureX platform.</p>
<p>Gee Rittenhouse, senior vice president and general manager of Cisco’s Security Business Group, <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/news/364250">wrote in a blog post</a> announcing the deal with Kenna that his company is getting a product that brings together Cisco&#8217;s existing threat management capabilities with Kenna&#8217;s risk-based vulnerability management skills.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;That is why we are pleased to announce our intent to acquire Kenna Security, Inc., a recognized leader in risk-based vulnerability prioritization with over 14 million assets protected and over 12.7 billion managed vulnerabilities. Using data science and real-world threat intelligence, it has a proven ability to bring data in from a multi-vendor environment and provide a comprehensive view of IT vulnerability risk,&#8221; Rittenhouse wrote in the blog post.</p>

<p>The security sphere has been complex for a long time, but with employees moving to work from home because of COVID, it became even more pronounced in the last year. In a world where the threat landscape changes quickly, having a tool that prioritizes what to look at first in its arsenal could be very useful.</p>
<p>Kenna Security CEO Karim Toubba gave a typical executive argument for being acquired: it gives him a much bigger market under Cisco than his company could have built alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now is our opportunity to change the industry: once the acquisition is complete, we will be one step closer to delivering Kenna’s pioneering Risk-Based Vulnerability Management (RBVM) platform to the more than 7,000 customers using Cisco SecureX today. This single action exponentially increases the impact Kenna’s technology will have on the way the world secures networks, endpoints and infrastructures,&#8221; he wrote <a href="https://www.kennasecurity.com/blog/evolving-vulnerability-management-cisco-announces-intent-to-acquire-kenna-security/">in the company blog</a>.</p>
<p>The company, which launched in 2010, claims to be the pioneer in the RBVM space. It raised over $98 million on a $320 million post-money valuation, according to PitchBook data. Customers include HSBC, Royal Bank of Canada, Mattel and Quest Diagnostics.</p>
<p>For those customers, the product will cease to be standalone at some point as the companies work together to integrate Kenna technology into the SecureX platform. When that is complete, the standalone customers will have to purchase the Cisco solution to continue using the Kenna tech.</p>
<p>Cisco has had a busy week on the acquisition front. It announced its intent to acquire <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/corporate-strategy-office/acquisitions/sedona-systems.html">Sedona Systems</a> on Tuesday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/cisco-to-acquire-indy-startup-socio-to-bring-hybrid-events-to-webex/">Socio Labs on Wednesday</a> and this announcement today. That&#8217;s a lot of activity for any company in a single week. The deal is expected to close in Cisco Q4 FY 2021. Kenna’s 170 employees will be joining the Security Business Group led by Rittenhouse.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>The fully vaxxed and officially fully immune took over the podcast this week, with <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a> co-hosting the show while the inimitable <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> is out from Shot No. 2. <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris, </a>as always, were behind the scenes making sure we sound pretty and don&#8217;t fall down too many punny board game rabbit holes after vacation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s the rundown of what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/05/13/tesla-and-ethereum-billionaires-spark-shock-300-billion-crypto-price-crash-as-bitcoin-and-dogecoin-suddenly-plummet/?sh=35c7582f34f6">Crypto crashed &#8212;</a> thanks to either<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/elon-musk-bitcoin-crash-tesla-cryptocurrency-b1846650.html"> Elon</a> or the guy who created Ethereum and then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/vitalik-buterin-donates-1-billion-worth-of-meme-coins-to-india-covid-relief-fund/">donated some to relief efforts for COVID-19. </a>We debated how signals gets lost and rediscovered and lost again in this news cycle, and what that means for anyone in tech trying to get a pulse of what&#8217;s actually happening.</li>
<li>One symptom of market craze and disconnected booms? A startup named <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/is-buying-and-selling-short-positions-in-private-companies-next-this-fintech-startup-is-banking-on-it/">Caplight that wants more people to buy and sell short positions on private startups. </a></li>
<li>We then pivoted into the last bit of our &#8220;The World Is Melting&#8221; section to talk about home ownership and the slow stink of real estate stocks right now. On top of that, Better.com, a digital mortgage lender, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/digging-into-digital-mortgage-lender-better-coms-huge-spac/">decided to SPAC</a> after reportedly tabling an IPO.</li>
<li>A mention of SPACs obviously opened up a can of worms, or should I say, oasis of woods.</li>
<li>The world might be melting, but SoftBank could be having the last word. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/softbank-joins-top-corporate-earners-with-its-37-billion-vision-fund-profit.html">The Japanese conglomerate shut us up</a> with its recent profits &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/softbank-and-the-late-stage-venture-capital-j-curve/">proving Danny&#8217;s point in an old EC piece</a><em> (use code EQUITY for a discount).</em></li>
<li>We switched gears and talked about a neat new $20 million fund coming out of the Midwest, Sixty8 Capital, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/briannegarrett/2021/05/10/the-talent-is-here-black-women-led-vc-firm-sixty8-capital-launches-first-20-million-fund-to-invest-in-underrepresented-midwestern-founders/amp/?__twitter_impression=true">its plan to invest in underrepresented founders</a>.</li>
<li>The show ended as chaotically focused as it began with a round robin of the most interesting funding rounds of the last week, not limited to but including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/blind-raises-37m-to-double-down-on-workplace-gossip-and-career-advice/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Blind&#8217;s $37 million raise</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/the-last-gameboard-raises-4m-to-ship-its-digital-tabletop-gaming-platform/">The Last Gameboard&#8217;s $4 million check</a>, <a href="https://www.insider.com/just-womens-sports-funding-wnba-uswnt-stars-kevin-durant-2021-5">Just Women&#8217;s Sports</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/morressier-wants-academic-conferences-to-feel-cutting-edge/">Morressier&#8217;s $18 million Series A.   </a></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While modern machine learning systems act with a semblance of artificial intelligence, the truth is they don&#8217;t &#8220;understand&#8221; any of the data they work with — which in turn means they tend to store even trivial items forever. Facebook researchers have proposed <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/teaching-ai-how-to-forget-at-scale">structured forgetfulness</a> as a way for AI to clear the decks a bit, improving their performance and inching that much closer to how a human mind works.</p>
<p>The researchers describe the problem by explaining how humans and AI agents might approach a similar problem.</p>
<p>Say there are 10 doors of various colors. You&#8217;re asked to go through the yellow one, you do so and then a few minutes later have forgotten the colors of the other doors — because it was never important that two were red, one plaid, two walnut, etc., only that they weren&#8217;t yellow and that the one you chose was. Your brain discarded that information almost immediately.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But an AI might very well have kept the colors and locations of the other nine doors in its memory. That&#8217;s because it doesn&#8217;t understand the problem or the data intuitively — so it keeps all the information it used to make its decision.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t an issue when you&#8217;re talking about relatively small amounts of data, but machine learning algorithms, especially during training, now routinely handle millions of data points and ingest terabytes of imagery or language. And because they&#8217;re built to constantly compare new data with their accrued knowledge, failing to forget unimportant things means they&#8217;re bogged down by constant references to pointless or outdated data points.</p>
<p>The solution hit upon by Facebook researchers is essentially — and wouldn&#8217;t we all like to have this ability — to tell itself how long it needs to remember a piece of data when it evaluates it to begin with.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2151984" style="width: 702px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/expirespan-1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2151984" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2151984" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/expirespan-1.gif" alt="Animation showing 'memories' of an AI disappearing." width="692" height="368" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2151984" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Each individual memory is associated with a predicted expiration date, and the scale of the memory depends on the task,&#8221; explained Angela Fan, a Facebook AI researcher who <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/research/publications/not-all-memories-are-created-equal">worked on the Expire-Span paper</a>. &#8220;The amount of time memories are held depends on the needs of the task — it can be for a few steps or until the task is complete.&#8221;</p>
<p>So in the case of the doors, the colors of the non-yellow doors are plenty important until you find the yellow one. At that point it&#8217;s safe to forget the rest, though of course depending on how many other doors need to be checked, the memory could be held for various amounts of time. (A more realistic example might be forgetting faces that aren&#8217;t the one the system is looking for, once it finds it.)</p>
<p>Analyzing a long piece of text, the memory of certain words or phrases might matter until the end of a sentence, a paragraph or longer — it depends on whether the agent is trying to determine who&#8217;s speaking, what chapter the sentence belongs to or what genre the story is.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Le7rbbFP18"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/deep-vision-announces-its-low-latency-ai-processor-for-the-edge/">Deep Vision announces its low-latency AI processor for the edge</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Deep Vision announces its low-latency AI processor for the edge&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/deep-vision-announces-its-low-latency-ai-processor-for-the-edge/embed/#?secret=Le7rbbFP18" data-secret="Le7rbbFP18" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This improves performance because at the end, there&#8217;s simply less information for the model to sort through. Because the system doesn&#8217;t know whether the other doors might be important, that information is kept ready at hand, increasing the size and decreasing the speed of the model.</p>
<p>Fan said the models trained using Expire-Span performed better and were more efficient, taking up less memory and compute time. That&#8217;s important during training and testing, which can take up thousands of hours of processing, meaning even a small improvement is considerable, but also at the end user level, where the same task takes less power and happens faster. Suddenly performing an operation on a photo makes sense to do live rather than after the fact.</p>
<p>Though being able to forget does in some ways bring AI processes closer to human cognition, it&#8217;s still nowhere near the intuitive and subtle ways our minds operate. Of course, being able to pick what to remember and how long is a major advantage over those of us for whom those parameters are chosen seemingly randomly.</p>

<p>But Jan Masters, a security researcher at Pen Test Partners, found that Echelon&#8217;s API allowed him to access the account data — including name, city, age, sex, phone number, weight, birthday and workout statistics and history — of any other member in a live or pre-recorded class. The API also disclosed some information about members&#8217; workout equipment, such as its serial number.</p>
<p>Masters, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-bug-account-data-leak/">if you recall</a>, found a similar bug with Peloton&#8217;s API, which let him make unauthenticated requests and pull private user account data directly from Peloton&#8217;s servers without the server ever checking to make sure he (or anyone else) was allowed to request it.</p>
<p>Echelon&#8217;s API allows its members&#8217; devices and apps to talk with Echelon&#8217;s servers over the internet. The API was supposed to check if the member&#8217;s device was authorized to pull user data by checking for an authorization token. But Masters said the token wasn&#8217;t needed to request data.</p>
<p>Masters also found another bug that allowed members to pull data on any other member because of weak access controls on the API. Masters said this bug made it easy to enumerate user account IDs and scrape account data from Echelon&#8217;s servers. Facebook, LinkedIn, Peloton and Clubhouse have all <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/tour-de-peloton-exposed-user-data/?=050420210000">fallen victim to scraping attacks</a> that abuse access to APIs to pull in data about users on their platforms.</p>

<p>Ken Munro, founder of Pen Test Partners, disclosed the vulnerabilities to Echelon on January 20 in a Twitter direct message, since the company doesn&#8217;t have a public-facing vulnerability disclosure process (which it says is now &#8220;under review&#8221;). But the researchers did not hear back during the 90 days after the report was submitted, the standard amount of time security researchers give companies to fix flaws before their details are made public.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Echelon for comment, and was told that the security flaws identified by Masters — which <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/echelon-pii-leak-and-disclosure-fail/?=13052021000">he wrote up</a> in a blog post — were fixed in January.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hired an outside service to perform a penetration test of systems and identify vulnerabilities. We have taken appropriate actions to correct these, most of which were implemented by January 21, 2021. However, Echelon’s position is that the User ID is not PII [personally identifiable information],&#8221; said Chris Martin, Echelon&#8217;s chief information security officer, in an email.</p>
<p>Echelon did not name the outside security company but said while the company said it keeps detailed logs, it did not say if it had found any evidence of malicious exploitation.</p>
<p>But Munro disputed the company&#8217;s claim of when it fixed the vulnerabilities, and provided TechCrunch with evidence that one of the vulnerabilities was not fixed until at least mid-April, and another vulnerability could still be exploited as recently as of this week.</p>
<p>When asked for clarity, Echelon did not address the discrepancies. &#8220;[The security flaws] have been remediated,&#8221; Martin reiterated.</p>
<p>Echelon also confirmed it fixed a bug that allowed users under the age of 13 to sign up. Many companies block access to children under the age of 13 to avoid complying with the Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, a U.S. law that puts strict rules on what data companies can collect on children. TechCrunch was able to create an Echelon account this week with an age less than 13, despite the page saying: &#8220;Minimum age of use is 13 years old.&#8221;</p>

<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One. That&#8217;s the number of African tech companies that have gone public on the NYSE in the last 10 years. Two, if you&#8217;re counting local exchanges. The former is African-focused e-commerce company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/jumia-co-ceo-jeremy-hodara-talks-african-e-commerce-and-his-companys-path-to-profitability/">Jumia</a> and the latter is Egyptian fintech company Fawry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a tech company, Fawry&#8217;s listing on the Egyptian Stock Exchange is a rarity. Typically, most exchanges in emerging markets like Africa, India, and Latin America are filled with traditional companies in age-old sectors like banking, telecoms, manufacturing, and energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Fawry, what you see these days are new-age tech companies from these markets going public abroad, especially in the U.S. Due to the friendly nature of U.S. exchanges such as Nasdaq and the NYSE, and their history building up the FAANG and other multibillion-dollar companies, they have become the top destination for IPO-ready companies in emerging markets.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the U.S. IPO market was caught in a frenzy with a different way of going public: via special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). Although these acquisition vehicles have been around for quite some time, they&#8217;ve lacked the sensational attributes we&#8217;ve now become accustomed to. Public and influential entrepreneurs from Chamath Palihapitiya to Richard Branson have made sure that SPACs &#8212; which many have called a fad &#8212; are here to stay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/beyond-the-fanfare-and-sec-warnings-spacs-are-here-to-stay/">issues with the SEC</a> as a liquidity option, SPACs have continued to remain popular for many companies because they have less completion time and regulatory hurdles than a traditional IPO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;ve covered a lot on this subject within the past year, and this</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/almost-everything-you-need-to-know-about-spacs/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does a good job explaining SPACs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. alone, there are <a href="https://stockmarketmba.com/listofshellcompanies.php#:~:text=List%20of%20Shell%20Companies%20or%20Special%20Purpose%20Acquisition%20Companies%20(',These%20securities%20are%20common%20stocks.">more than 300 SPACs</a>. Last year, more than 85% of deals completed were executed with companies in the country, per Bloomberg. With fewer targets to acquire, an increasing number of SPACs are eyeing startups in other markets like <a href="https://braziljournal.com/por-que-o-ipo-da-mosaico-foi-coisa-de-nasdaq">Asia</a> and <a href="https://neofeed.com.br/negocios/spacs-a-brasileira-devem-captar-mais-de-us-11-bilhao-e-essa-febre-esta-so-no-comeco/">Latin America</a>, with the same endgame: take them public in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Africa cannot be compared to these other regions in terms of technology and investment activities, it has some success stories. Companies like Jumia, GetSmarter, Paystack and Flutterwave are bright examples from the continent. But except for Tidjane Thiam&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/spac-freedom-acquisition-i-led-by-the-former-ceo-of-credit-suisse-files-for-a-%24250-million">$300 million blank-check company Freedom Acquisition I Corp</a> (which has found no fintech target yet), there&#8217;s practically no SPAC targeting African tech companies.</span></p>

<h2>Not SPACworthy?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/eaboyeji">Iyinoluwa Aboyeji</a>, founder and general partner at Future Africa, an early-stage VC firm, told TechCrunch that SPAC targets are most often billion-dollar companies. &#8220;The way the economics of a SPAC work, you want a billion-dollar company, and that&#8217;s a very short list in Africa. You can&#8217;t SPAC anything less than a billion dollars as you wouldn&#8217;t make enough money for it to be worth your while,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are only a handful of African tech companies worth that much. Just recently, Flutterwave joined the illustrious club that includes Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch. If what Aboyeji said is anything to go by, SPACs can only target <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Flutterwave</a> and Interswitch. Yet, the chances of this happening are quite slim because the pair have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/why-covid-19-could-delay-interswitch-africas-next-big-ipo/">expressed interest in going public via IPOs</a> on local and international exchanges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, where exactly does it leave the continent if there are no billion-dollar companies to SPAC? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aboyeji thinks SPACs could narrow down targets to companies that could become unicorns with their next rounds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/eghosaomoigui&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjF-Y2H2cjwAhVC8hQKHe1vBmAQjjgwAXoECAMQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw3lwmwAJ4Me433EE6NvPUd9">Eghosa Omoigui</a>, managing partner at EchoVC Partners, an early-stage VC firm focused on sub-Saharan Africa, shares this view and adds that selecting these companies will boil down to the thrill they offer blank check companies should they choose to look Africa&#8217;s way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When you think about it, there&#8217;s only a small number of startups on the continent that have enough traction or excitement to be [packaged] in a SPAC,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a neutral lens, some companies fit into this box of attractive African-focused companies with unicorn potential. A few of them, including Andela, Branch, Gro Intelligence and TymeBank, are worth more than $500 million and can easily double that with any SPAC activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Omoigui believes a large number of these startups aren&#8217;t ready to go public yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The real question I think is, even if you file for a SPAC and merge it with an African target, is that company ready to be public? The truth of the matter is that the valuations they get when private are much better than what they&#8217;ll get in the public markets.&#8221; </span></p>
<h2>Private capital seems sufficient&#8230; for now</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The continent&#8217;s tech ecosystem is still very much nascent. In 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/did-african-startups-raise-496m-1b-or-2b-in-2019/">African startups raised a total of $2 billion</a>, which is the peak of investments to have flowed in a year so far. That same year, Indian startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/29/indian-tech-startups-funding-amount-2019/">raised $14.5 billion</a>. This disparity in investments is one reason there are few unicorns and acquisitions in the region. So it pretty much shows that there&#8217;s still a lot of ground to cover for African startups before thinking of going public. Maybe this is why SPACs aren&#8217;t targeting African startups now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The way I see it, African startups are not ready yet to go public,&#8221; Aboyeji remarked. &#8220;They still need more time in the private markets. If you&#8217;re pursued by private capital and you see what happened to the likes of Jumia that went public, your inclination is just to take the private capital.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to that, private equity is catching up with what public financing can offer. Startups globally are staying private longer than ever. In the U.S., the number of publicly listed companies has</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/business/company-ipo-buyout-private.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">dropped by 52%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the late 1990s to 2016. It&#8217;s a trend that has been passed to other markets, so it&#8217;s likely that African companies might stay private for the foreseeable future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, Omoigui is optimistic that this situation might change in fewer than three years. In his opinion, SPACs will run out of interesting targets in other emerging markets and might start broadening their scope to include African companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EchoVC managing partner added that the continent could do well with more SPACs from indigenous personalities like Thiam while waiting for those from foreign entities. This will build more excitement on the continent because in most cases, it isn&#8217;t the target that people usually get enthusiastic about but the vehicle itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sometimes you realize that it&#8217;s not really the startups that need to be hot and exciting; it is the SPAC sponsor. That&#8217;s what people are hopping on the bandwagon for.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before running Future Africa full-time, Aboyeji had stints with Andela as a co-founder and as CEO of Flutterwave. The startups are still private to date but are on anyone&#8217;s cards to go public within this decade. For Aboyeji, however, make that three as the entrepreneur-cum-investor wants to take his investment firm public, maybe via a SPAC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m definitely going to exit on the public market with Future Africa. That&#8217;s my goal. I would consider a SPAC as an entrepreneur, but it&#8217;s likely that I&#8217;ll decide to directly list as well,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andela CEO <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremiahjohnson&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi3vInK2cjwAhVHDGMBHWb9BGAQjjgwC3oECCcQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw2wwr5LN0nekteWuTupA8qq">Jeremy Johnson</a> told me SPACs are here to stay, and most African startups will go public that way. However, he didn&#8217;t say if there was any chance his company would do the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the benefits is that they allow you to talk about the future, and Africa&#8217;s growth rate means its future is going to be brighter than the past,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think African startups will end up going public via this route.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="epi-fontLg bwalignc">Electric car startup Fisker signed an agreement with Foxconn, the Taiwanese company that assembles iPhones, to co-develop and manufacture a new electric vehicle. Production on the car, which will be sold under the Fisker brand name in North America, Europe, China and India, will begin in the U.S. by the end of 2023.</p>
<p class="epi-fontLg bwalignc">Numerous details, including the name of the car and the location of future manufacturing plants, have not been disclosed by the two companies. As for form factor, Fisker describes it as a &#8220;breakthrough new segment vehicle,&#8221; so neither a sedan nor an SUV, that&#8217;s capable of carrying five people, a Fisker spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Fisker is calling the joint program Project PEAR, which stands for Personal Electric Automotive Revolution. Fisker chairman and CEO Henrik Fisker has bragged that the PEAR vehicle will be the &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/henrikfisker/status/1392323394079580165?s=20">next big thing in car design</a>,&#8221; a car that&#8217;s both &#8220;emotionally desirable&#8221; and &#8220;eco-friendly,&#8221; meaning a car that doesn&#8217;t shout &#8220;Look at me, I&#8217;m electric!&#8221; and rather appeals to the driver moving over from gasoline vehicles, according to a spokesperson from Fisker</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The two companies had<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/apple-supplier-foxconn-reaches-tentative-agreement-to-build-fiskers-next-electric-car/"> signed a memorandum of understanding agreement</a> in February, setting the expectation that a formal agreement would be reached by this time. Included in the agreement signed on Thursday is a goal to produce 250,000 units annually across multiple sites. In January,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/foxconn-geely-team-up-to-build-electric-autonomous-and-shared-vehicles-for-automakers-startups/"> Foxconn partnered with Chinese automaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group</a> to form a joint venture that would provide car manufacturers with production and consulting services, so the deal with Fisker is one of the company&#8217;s first forays into the automotive industry.</p>

<p>The new vehicle will be priced under $30,000, according to Fisker, who touted the uniqueness and innovation of his car&#8217;s designs. Fisker will also begin production on its first model, Ocean, an electric SUV, in Europe by the end of next year. The company also intends to release a prototype of Ocean at the Los Angeles Auto Show later this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have world-class supply chains in place to support Project PEAR – in particular, securing the reliable delivery of chipsets and semiconductors,&#8221; said Young-way Liu, chairman of Foxconn, in a statement.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The debut of electric pickups signals a new EV era&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/the-debut-of-electric-pickups-signals-a-new-ev-era/embed/#?secret=Ddo3JjwEqs" data-secret="Ddo3JjwEqs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Liu noted how Foxconn would be able to connect Project PEAR with suppliers around the world through its software and hardware open platform for EVs, MIH, which aligns with the company&#8217;s &#8220;3+3&#8221; vision which symbolizes the infinite technological and industry advancements available through the platform.</p>
<p>Foxconn and Fisker are still shopping for potential U.S. manufacturing sites, so they&#8217;ve set up an office between the U.S. and Taiwan to coordinate design, engineering, purchasing and manufacturing operations.</p>

<p>I interrupt your regularly scheduled Daily Crunch to announce that your regularly scheduled writer, one <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex Wilhelm</a>, is out sick today. If the effects of his second shot subside by tomorrow, then he’ll be back with his commas. In the meantime, I have taken the reins and hope to be at least half as spirited.

<h2>TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/lemonade-insurance-bug-exposed-account-data/">Lemonade &#8220;DGAF&#8221;</a></strong>: Activist short seller <strong>Carson Block</strong> wrote a letter to the CEO of insurance marketplace <strong>Lemonade</strong> saying that he “accidentally discovered” a security flaw that exposed customers’ account data. Block told Zack that his firm is shorting the company’s stock “because it is clear Lemonade does not give a fuck about securing its customers’ sensitive personal information.” Strong words!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

Italy’s antitrust watchdog group slapped the company with a €100 million (or about US$123 million) for its Android Auto practices. Specifically, the AGCM says Google has prevented <strong>Enel X Italia</strong>, the maker of electric car charging app <strong>JuicePass</strong>, from inclusion in the platform. Google says it didn’t do anything wrong. Shrug.</p>

But he can’t wait to leave Earth. So to whet his space-travel whistle, Maezawa will head to the International Space Station as a client of <strong>Space Adventures</strong> on a Russian Soyuz rocket set to take off from Kazakhstan on December 8. And he’s taking his production assistant, Yozo Hirano, with him. That’s dedication.</p>

<h2>The hamburger model is a winning go-to-market strategy</h2>
<p>Software startups that fail to reach product-market fit simply fade away, memorialized only by an inactive Twitter account and perhaps a stenciled sign in a now-vacant co-working space.</p>
<p>All product-led growth companies will reach the stage where their founders must figure out how to crack the code that allows them to vault to the next level and become a billion-dollar company. That&#8217;s where the &#8220;hamburger&#8221; go-to-market comes in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New media poster child Substack <a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/growing-the-pie-for-writers">announced</a> today that they&#8217;ve added a small community-building consultancy team to its ranks, acquiring the Brooklyn-based startup <a href="https://www.people-and.com/">People &amp; Company</a>.</p>
<p>The small firm has been working with clients to build up their community efforts, and its team will now be tasked with building up some of the newsletter company&#8217;s upstart efforts for writers in its network.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/growing-the-pie-for-writers">blog post</a>, Substack co-founder Hamish McKenzie said that the company had previously used the People &amp; Co. team to consult on their fellowship and mentorship programs and that members of the team would now be working on a variety of new efforts, from scaling programs to help writers with legal support and health insurance to community-guided projects like workshops and meetups to help crowdsource insights.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;These people are the best in the world at what they do, and now they’re not only working for Substack, but they’re also working for you,&#8221; McKenzie wrote.</p>
<p>Beyond Substack, previous partners with People &amp; Company include Porsche AG, Nike and Surfrider.</p>
<p>Substack has been blazing ahead in recent months, adding new partners and raising cash as it aims to bring on more and more subscribers to its network. The firm shared back in late March that it had raised a $65 million round at a reported valuation around $650 million, according to earlier reporting by <a href="https://www.axios.com/substack-andreessen-horowitz-newsletter-36cb98ea-a7b3-43b1-883a-fa45586eaad4.html">Axios</a>.</p>

		Dominik Angerer is CEO and co-founder of headless CMS <a href="https://www.storyblok.com/">Storyblok</a>, which provides best practice guidance for startups on how to build a sustainable approach to marketing their content.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Search engine optimization, PR, paid marketing, emails, social — marketing and communications is crowded with techniques, channels, solutions and acronyms. It&#8217;s little wonder that many startups strapped for time and money find defining and executing a sustainable marketing campaign a daunting prospect.</p>
<p>The sheer number of options makes it difficult to determine an effective approach, and my view is that this complexity often obscures the obvious answer: A startup’s best marketing asset is its story. The knowledge and expertise of its team, together with the why and the how of its offering provides the most compelling content.</p>
<p>Leveraging this material with best practice techniques enables any startup, no matter how limited its budget, to run an effective marketing campaign.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Many startups make the mistake of choosing systems and employing procedures to solve the immediate needs of the department that requires them.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>I know this approach works, because this is exactly what I did with my co-founder Alex Feiglstorfer when we set up Storyblok. To be clear, we are developers not marketers. However, our previous experience building CMS systems taught us that the main driver of organic engagement for most businesses was customer conversations around content.</p>
<p>Specifically, sharing experiences, expertise and what we learned. We had committed nearly all of our available cash to developing our product, so we knew that the only way to market Storyblok was to do it all ourselves.</p>
<p>As a result, we focused solely on problem-solving content. This took the form of tutorials on web development and opinion pieces on headless CMS and other topics within our areas of expertise. The trick was that what we published wasn’t made just for marketing, it was based on our own internal documentation of problems we encountered as we developed our product. In essence, we were &#8220;learning in public.&#8221; Through this approach we were able to acquire thousands of customers in our first year.</p>
<p>Retelling this story isn’t to blow my own trumpet, it’s to make clear that you don’t have to be a marketer by training or commit a huge amount of time and resources to successfully market your startup. So, how do you get started?</p>
<h2>Getting your structure and technology right</h2>
<p>Although there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to how you organize your startup’s marketing function, there are some basic principles that apply in nearly every situation. A recent survey of 400+ executives from CMS Wire helpfully identified the following factors as the &#8220;top digital customer experience challenges&#8221; for businesses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Limited budget/resources.</li>
<li>Siloed systems and fragmented customer data.</li>
<li>Limited cross-department alignment/collaboration.</li>
<li>Outdated/limited technology, operations or processes.</li>
<li>Lack of in-house expertise/skills.</li>
</ol>
<p>Challenges two to four are the pitfalls that we can focus on avoiding. They are directly related to how a startup produces, organizes and distributes its content.</p>
<p>With regard to the siloing of systems and fragmentation of customer data, the overriding goal is to ensure all your systems are integrated and speak to one another. In practice, this means that the data gathered in different departments — whether its feedback from sales, engagement on your website, customer service responses or product development information — is collected in a uniform and methodical manner and is readily accessible across the business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://lambdaschool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lambda School</a> has attracted a lot of attention, and raised some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/lambda-school-raises-74m-for-its-virtual-coding-school-where-you-pay-tuition-only-after-you-get-a-job/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$130 million in venture funding</a>&nbsp;from an impressive list of investors, for its novel approach to coding education: offering six-month virtual computer science courses for $30,000, with the option of paying for the courses in installments based on a sliding scale that only kicks in after you land a job that makes at least $50,000.</p>
<p>But it turns out that the startup is attracting a lot of controversy, too. In the latest development, three students have filed lawsuits against the company in California, claiming misleading financial and educational practices.</p>
<p>The suits &#8212; which are being brought by the nonprofit <a href="https://www.defendstudents.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Student Legal Defense Network</a> on behalf of Linh Nguyen, Heather Nye and Jonathan Stickrod &#8212; go back to a period of between 2018 and 2020, and they focus on four basic claims.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>First, that Lambda School falsified and misrepresented job placement rates. Second, that Lambda School misrepresented the true nature of its financial interest in student success (specifically, there are question marks over how Lambda handles its ISA contracts and whether it benefits from those). Third, that it misrepresented and concealed a regulatory dispute in California that required the school to cease operations. And fourth, that it enrolled and provided educational services and signed ISA contracts in violation of that order.</p>
<p>The filings for the three cases are embedded below.</p>
<p>The three students are all currently on the hook for their Lambda tuitions, which they opted to pay back in installments by way of the school&#8217;s income share agreement (ISA) model. The suits do not disclose how much the three individuals are seeking in damages.</p>
<p>For those who have been following news of Lambda School over the last several years, the claims detailed in the suit will sound familiar.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/lambda-schools-job-placement-rate-is-lower-than-claimed.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inflated job placement rates</a>; and the fact that it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21131848/lambda-school-coding-bootcamp-isa-tuition-cost-free" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn&#8217;t legally allowed to operate</a>, yet was still accepting students, signing ISA deals, and teaching, for example, were all reported over that period of time, along with other criticisms about how CEO and founder Austen Allred, a self-proclaimed &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Sauce-Ultimate-Growth-Hacking/dp/1635877393" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growth hacker</a>&#8220;, leveraged his and Lambda&#8217;s other Twitter accounts to hype up the school.</p>
<p>Some of the issues that are raised in the lawsuits have also been resolved since then. For example, the prominent display of over 80% of students finding jobs can no longer be found on the Lambda site, and in California you no longer get an ISA but a retail installment contract (similar but different). But as is the way of litigation, lawsuits based on past issues from people who were impacted by them when they were still active, are, in many ways, the next logical, unsurprising step.</p>
<p>There is also a specific strategy behind these three cases being filed at the same time.</p>
<p>Alex Elson, the co-founder of the National Student Legal Defense Network, told TechCrunch in an interview that the ISA contracts that students sign at Lambda have arbitration clauses that preclude students from arbitrating against Lambda in groups, i.e. class action suits.</p>
<p>The idea is that by bringing three nearly identical individual cases simultaneously against the school, the defendants can both expose the widespread practices of Lambda, and pave the way for broader relief for others similarly impacted. (The Student Defense Network&#8217;s co-counsel in the case is CalebAndonian PLLC and Cotchett, Pitre &amp; McCarthy LLP.)</p>
<p>Originally incubated at Y Combinator and backed by a long list of investors that include GV (Google Ventures), Gigafactory (ex-Founders Fund partners), GGV and more, Lambda School has had a tough time of it in the last year, a period that has seen the COVID-19 pandemic have a disproportionate impact on some parts of the economy but not others.</p>
<p>Edtech has largely been seen as a huge growth area, but that may not have been the case for edtech startups specifically focused on vocational, technology jobs, given that the tech world has seen a lot of hiring freezes, and layoffs, as companies sought to keep down costs in the face of the unknown.</p>
<p>Lambda went through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/lambda-school-cuts-staff-and-exec-pay-amid-market-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two sets</a> of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/lambda-school-lays-off-65-employees-amid-restructuring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">layoffs</a> in the space of a year, and it seems that in one of them it also changed its teaching model, doing away with TLs (team leads), paid mentors who helped assess students, and instead moved to a model where students mentored each other and assessed themselves.</p>
<p>It has also changed the courses themselves, shortening them to six months from their original nine- and 18-month formats &#8212; but not reducing the prices for those courses.</p>

<p>And it&#8217;s not quite past all of its regulatory issues, either.</p>
<p>Just two weeks ago, California&#8217;s Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) announced a <a href="https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/539482519/lambda-school-reaches-settlement-with-dfpi-agreeing-to-end-deceptive-educational-financing-practices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">settlement</a> with the school over the language that it uses in financing contracts with students.</p>
<p>Specifically, the DFPI took issue with how it said Lambda falsely described its financial arrangement with students as a “qualified educational loan&#8230; subject to the limitations on dischargeability contained in&#8230; the United States Bankruptcy Code.”</p>
<p>(Educational loans are usually exempt from bankruptcy discharge &#8212; when a debtor is not required to pay a debt because that debtor is bankrupt, it&#8217;s a bankruptcy discharge; typically educational loans are not covered by this, so the issue here was the Lambda School was claiming that even if a student files for bankruptcy that student would still have to pay back Lambda.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The language violates the new California Consumer Financial Protection Law (CCFPL), which took effect this year and prohibits companies from engaging in practices that are unlawful, unfair, deceptive, or abusive,&#8221; the DFPI noted.</p>
<p>The settlement requires Lambda to notify students that the bankruptcy dischargeability provision language is not accurate; retain a third party to review the terms of the school’s finance contract to ensure that it complies with all applicable laws; and undergo a review of its marketing materials to ensure that the information is accurate and not likely to mislead consumers.</p>

<p>You could say that all of these issues are the table stakes of being a startup and trying something new: the school is moving fast, breaking things and iterating along the way to figure it all out.</p>
<p>But for a service that can leave students liable for paying back $30,000, it&#8217;s a big price for others to pay when those things don&#8217;t quite work as advertised.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px">Still, despite all that, Lambda also continues to have a lot of supporters and partners. Just last month, for example, it announced a </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px" href="https://lambdaschool.com/the-commons/lambda-school-launches-backend-engineering-program-amazon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new backend engineering program that it developed with Amazon</a>. And while it <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px">doesn&#8217;t seem guaranteed taking the course will get you an instant open door to a job with the tech giant, it&#8217;s a sign of how there </span>remains<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px"> interest in Lambda&#8217;s big idea.</span></p>
<p>We have also reached out to the company&#8217;s CEO and founder Austen Allred, and the company itself, for a response and we will update this post as we learn more.</p>
<p><em>Updated with Lambda&#8217;s response:&nbsp;</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Per policy, we don’t speak about individual student or alumni situations in detail publicly, but we’re of course happy to review matters directly and will review any cases that are filed. In general, though, for any student’s ISA payments to be activated, they would have first signed an ISA contract and subsequently landed a role leveraging skills learned at Lambda School that pays $50K or more in salary.</p>
<p>Our mission is to de-risk education and expand access to higher paying jobs. For that reason, our ISAs (and RICs in California) are designed with policies that are as flexible and student-centric as possible. That includes our purposely generous proration refund and proration policy for students who decide to leave the program, regardless of tuition payment method. Additionally, if an alumnus loses their job, salary, or is making under $50K a year, their payments are immediately paused. ISAs expire completely after 24 payments or 60 deferred months, even if the total paid is less than $30,000.</p>
<p>Our number one priority is student success. We stand behind the quality of our instructors and our proven student outcomes (which we go into more detail about <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/note-outcomes-data-lambda-school-austen-allred/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/note-outcomes-data-lambda-school-austen-allred/&#038;source=gmail&#038;ust=1621029363889000&#038;usg=AFQjCNHcxnGfp357SZariyNJ_PlFIC43JQ">here</a> and in our <a href="https://lambdaschool.com/reports/h2-2019-outcomes-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lambdaschool.com/reports/h2-2019-outcomes-report&#038;source=gmail&#038;ust=1621029363889000&#038;usg=AFQjCNGk_kylcFfEuavS_FbBw2VSwzcN7g">outcomes reporting</a>). While we will always strive for our students and alumni to have a positive experience and achieve their career goals, we’re also willing to work with individuals and review cases to come to a resolution.</p>

<p>Today, the Burning Man org <a href="https://here.burningman.org/event/virtualburn?utm_source=pressrelease&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=VirtualBurn">released tickets</a> for its online events taking place between August 22 and September 7.</p>
<p>There have been few illusions for attendees that a virtual event is any substitute for the real thing, but organizers have tried to get creative when it comes to the social web experiences so that attendees can reclaim some of the camaraderie. While the organization won&#8217;t be setting up an official presence, some camps have already committed to hosting an unofficial return to the desert.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last year, TechCrunch profiled the Burning Man org as they struggled to pull together a virtual event that captured the feeling of the in-person experience using virtual reality, mobile apps and virtual experimental theater.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Orbital imagery is in demand, and if you think having daily images of everywhere on Earth is going to be enough in a few years, you need a lesson in ambition. <a href="http://www.albaorbital.com">Alba Orbital</a> is here to provide it with its intention to provide Earth observation at intervals of 15 minutes rather than hours or days — and it just raised $3.4 million to get its next set of satellites into orbit.</p>
<p>Alba attracted our attention <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-1/">at Y Combinator&#8217;s latest demo day</a>; I was impressed with the startup&#8217;s accomplishment of already having six satellites in orbit, which is more than most companies with space ambition ever get. But it&#8217;s only the start for the company, which will need hundreds more to begin to offer its planned high-frequency imagery.</p>
<p>The Scottish company has spent the last few years in prep and R&amp;D, pursuing the goal, which some must have thought laughable, of creating a solar-powered Earth observation satellite that weighs in at less than one kilogram. The joke&#8217;s on the skeptics, however — Alba has launched a proof of concept and is ready to send the real thing up as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Little more than a flying camera with a minimum of storage, communication, power and movement, the sub-kilogram Unicorn-2 is about the size of a soda can, with paperback-size solar panel wings, and costs in the neighborhood of $10,000. It should be able to capture up to 10-meter resolution, good enough to see things like buildings, ships, crops, even planes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2151880" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20201002_154937.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2151880" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2151880" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20201002_154937.jpg" alt="A member of the Alba Orbital team holds a Unicorn-2 satellite." width="1024" height="716" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20201002_154937.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20201002_154937.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20201002_154937.jpg?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20201002_154937.jpg?resize=768,537 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20201002_154937.jpg?resize=680,476 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20201002_154937.jpg?resize=1536,1075 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20201002_154937.jpg?resize=2048,1433 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20201002_154937.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2151880" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alba Orbital</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;People thought we were idiots. Now they&#8217;re taking it seriously,&#8221; said Tom Walkinshaw, founder and CEO of Alba. &#8220;They can see it for what it is: a unique platform for capturing data sets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, although the idea of daily orbital imagery like Planet&#8217;s once seemed excessive, in some situations it&#8217;s quite clearly not enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;The California case is probably wildfires,&#8221; said Walkinshaw (and it always helps to have a California case). &#8220;Having an image once a day of a wildfire is a bit like having a chocolate teapot&#8230; not very useful. And natural disasters like hurricanes, flooding is a big one, transportation as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Walkinshaw noted that they company was bootstrapped and profitable before taking on the task of launching dozens more satellites, something the seed round will enable.</p>
<p>&#8220;It gets these birds in the air, gets them finished and shipped out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Then we just need to crank up the production rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>When I talked to Walkinshaw via video call, 10 or so completed satellites in their launch shells were sitting on a rack behind him in the clean room, and more are in the process of assembly. Aiding in the scaling effort is new investor James Park, founder and CEO of Fitbit — definitely someone who knows a little bit about bringing hardware to market.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the next batch to go to orbit (perhaps as soon as in a month or two, depending on the machinations of the launch provider) will be focusing on nighttime imagery, an area Walkinshaw suggested was undervalued. But as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/satellite-vus-5m-seed-round-will-fuel-the-launch-of-its-thermal-imaging-satellites/">orbital thermal imaging startup Satellite Vu has shown</a>, there&#8217;s immense appetite for things like energy and activity monitoring, and nighttime observation is a big part of that.</p>

<p>The seed round will get the next few rounds of satellites into space, and after that Alba will be working on scaling manufacturing to produce hundreds more. Once those start going up it can demonstrate the high-cadence imaging it is aiming to produce — for now it&#8217;s impossible to do so, though Alba already has customers lined up to buy the imagery it does get.</p>
<p>The round was led by Metaplanet Holdings, with participation by Y Combinator, Liquid2, Soma, Uncommon Denominator, Zillionize and numerous angels.</p>
<p>As for competition, Walkinshaw welcomes it, but feels secure that he and his company have more time and work invested in this class of satellite than anyone in the world — a major obstacle for anyone who wants to do battle. It&#8217;s more likely companies will, as Alba has done, pursue a distinct product complementary to those already or in the process of being offered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Space is a good place to be right now,&#8221; he concluded.</p>
