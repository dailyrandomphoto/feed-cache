										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two Stanford dropouts in their late teens, who have previously collaborated on a number of projects including a ride-hailing commute app for school kids, said on Sunday they have raised $60 million to disrupt India’s overcrowded and highly-competitive grocery delivery market.</p>
<p>Glade Brook Capital led the six-month-old app Zepto’s first institutional financing round, the startup’s founder and chief executive Aadit Palicha told TechCrunch in an interview. Nexus and Y Combinator as well as angel investors Lachy Groom, Neeraj Arora, and Manik Gupta participated in the round, which according to two people familiar with the matter, values Zepto between $200 million and $300 million.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zeptonow.com">Zepto</a>, which has largely operated in stealth mode until today, has been the talk of the town for the past four months. The startup, whose name <a href="https://twitter.com/pacificleo/status/1452554053603450884">playfully uses a mathematical term</a> to describe the business, offers a 10-minute grocery delivery service. It often delivers within six to eight minutes, many investors who have not backed Zepto said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226748" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To achieve this feat, Zepto has set up dark stores across the cities where it operates (Mumbai, Bangalore, and as of this week, Delhi.) 19-year-old Palicha said these dark stores, which the startup has set up and owns, are designed and optimized for fast deliveries. (Zepto’s approach, for which Palicha said he looked at other markets and spoke with the operators running those firms, is different from many Indian startups that rely on regular grocery stores for inventory.)</p>

		Kathryn Kosmides is a survivor of gender-based violence and the founder of nonprofit background check <a href="https://www.garbo.io/">Garbo</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen’s message about Instagram’s impact on teenage girls was unequivocal: Facebook’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">studies</a> found that 13% of British teens said Instagram prompted thoughts of suicide, and 17% of teen girls say Instagram makes eating disorders worse.</p>
<p>These statistics, however, are only one part of the bigger picture when it comes to the general safety of teenagers online.</p>
<p>It’s estimated that there are over <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-110hhrg38335/html/CHRG-110hhrg38335.htm">500,000 sexual predators</a> active on the internet each day. In 2020, there were over <a href="https://www.missingkids.org/gethelpnow/cybertipline">21.7 million reports</a> of suspected child sexual exploitation made to the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children’s CyberTipline. Online enticement reports &#8212; which detail when someone is communicating with a child via the internet with the intent to exploit them &#8212; increased by more than 97% from the year before.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225097" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Reports of online predators are on the rise, but predatory behavior online is as old as Netscape.</p>
<p>My family got our first PC in 1999. I started on gaming platforms like Neopets and Gaia Online. Soon, I was posting thoughts and communicating with other users on Myspace and Tumblr. As my online world expanded, I encountered old men pretending to be preteens. At one point, I began a “relationship” with a 17-year-old boy when I was just 12 years old. Of course, I didn’t talk about any of this, mostly out of shame. I didn’t know I was being groomed — I had never heard the word used until I started doing gender-based violence work myself.</p>
<p>Grooming is subtle, and for a teen unfamiliar with it, undetectable. An individual grooms to build trust and emotional connection with a child or teen so they can manipulate, exploit and abuse them. This can look like an older teen asking to webcam and slowly prodding a child or teen to do inappropriate things such as spin around for them or change clothes to something “cuter,” or a digital “friend” pressuring someone to engage in cybersex. Predators sometimes pretend to be a young person to obtain personal details such as photos or sexual history; they then weaponize this information for their own pleasure.</p>
<p>I only recently realized that there is CSAM — or child sexual abuse material — of me out there on the internet. Footage of me may still reside on someone’s old cell phone or on a hard drive collecting dust. It could one day be shared onto private Discords or Telegram channels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>My individual experience as a teen girl on the internet is part of what led me to build a nonprofit <a href="https://www.garbo.io/">online background check</a> that allows anyone to see if someone they are speaking with has a history of violence — ideally before the first in-person meeting. We recently made the decision to allow users as young as 13 to access our public records database in the future. While we may never be able to entirely stop children and teens from being exploited online, we can at least arm them with tools and technology to understand whether someone they meet online has a record of bad behavior.</p>
<p>Of course, a background check is only one tool in the safety arsenal &#8212; people frequently lie about their names and identities. If a child is being groomed, or an adult is exploiting them, they are often doing so in ways that are anonymous, isolated and secret.</p>
<p>This is why educating young people about avoiding the dangers that lurk online is key. This can involve teaching them to identify early red flags like <a href="https://www.garbo.io/blog/love-bombing">love bombing</a>, extreme jealousy, pushing boundaries, etc. We can also communicate to young people what a healthy, safe, <a href="https://www.garbo.io/blog/consent">consensual</a> relationship looks like — with “<a href="https://www.garbo.io/blog/green-flags-of-a-healthy-relationship">green flags</a>” as opposed to red ones.</p>
<p>There are various <a href="https://www.wiredsafety.com/for-teens---protecting-yourself-online">practical skills</a> that we can incorporate into kids&#8217; education as well. Teach them to be selective about what photos they share and whose follow requests they accept and to bring an adult if they meet people they know online in real life.</p>
<p>When the adults in their lives discuss the dangers of online dating and internet communication openly and consistently, children and teens learn how to recognize the risks. This can go a long way toward preventing serious trauma. Conversations about safety online, like sex education, are often left to parents, while parents assume kids are having them at school. It can be difficult to navigate these discussions, especially for parents who don’t always understand online culture, but it is essential that parents seek out resources to educate themselves.</p>
<p>As Haugen pointed out, online platforms also have a responsibility. Trust and safety departments at online platforms are relatively new, and there’s still a lot to learn and improve on.</p>
<p>On most digital platforms, content moderators are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/may/25/facebook-moderator-underpaid-overburdened-extreme-content">understaffed, underpaid and undertrained</a>. Online platforms need to put protection over profit and invest in additional training and support for the mental health of those responsible for keeping their platforms safe. By giving safety teams the tools and time they need to think critically about questionable content, they can execute on their mandate effectively and with care.</p>
<p>Though the internet can create environments that lead to abuse, it can also be a powerful tool in educating young people about early warning signs and the realities of the world, including arming them with access to information about who they&#8217;re talking to online.</p>
<p>Reactive measures to combat abuse &#8212; from the criminal justice system to platform moderators &#8212; are a Band-Aid on a bleeding wound. Preventing sexual abuse before it happens is the best protection we can give our kids. By taking responsibility — whether as platforms, politicians or parents — for the potential harm caused online, we can begin to create a safer world for all of us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Angel investing has traditionally been mostly open to men, who travel in certain circles and have access to certain networks, but Amanda Robson, a principal at Cowboy Ventures, is attempting to change that by building an informal network of women and non-binary folks who have the means to write checks, but for whatever reason have not been able to easily move into this type of investing.</p>
<p>Robson says that when it comes to angel investing, women and non-binary people have been left out. &#8220;I had a number of friends who had recently within the past couple of years become VP-level at different companies, and they had an interest in angel investing, and they had the means to at that point, but they didn&#8217;t have access,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>That was in contrast to males in a similar position. &#8220;They found that a lot of their male counterparts who were also execs or male founders were getting pinged by their VC friends to join in on deals, and they weren&#8217;t getting the same treatment,&#8221; she said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223764" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Robson says that she found this surprising at first because at her firm, they try to fill the cap table with a diverse set of angels. As she looked around, she found that wasn&#8217;t the case at all firms, but it wasn&#8217;t always because of a lack of desire to be more diverse. It was also a sourcing problem. They didn&#8217;t know where to look.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2224264" style="width: 601px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2224264" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2224264 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amanda-Robson.jpg?w=680" alt="Amanda Robson, principal at Cowboy Ventures" width="591" height="333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amanda-Robson.jpg 2100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amanda-Robson.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amanda-Robson.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amanda-Robson.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amanda-Robson.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amanda-Robson.jpg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amanda-Robson.jpg?resize=2048,1151 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amanda-Robson.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2224264" class="wp-caption-text">Amanda Robson, principal at Cowboy Ventures</p></div></p>
<p>So if you had one group looking to invest, and another looking for diverse investors, it seemed that something could be done to bridge the gap. &#8220;I just found myself in a unique position having been in venture for almost six years and having a bunch of VC relationships because of that, and then also having access to awesome female [and non-binary] founders and operators that I could kind of bridge that gap in a pretty seamless way,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Her experience is not uncommon. Diana Murakhovskaya, general partner and co-founder at the Houston-based Artemis Fund, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/the-artemis-fund-focuses-on-women-founders-in-underserved-communities/">told TechCrunch recently</a> that prior to launching the fund in 2019, she and her co-founders attended networking events in the Houston area and noticed a dearth of women. She started hosting dinners to find out why.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I said, ‘Where are all the women?’ [ … ] And so we started doing these dinners to bring together women and asking them why they’re not investing, what they’re doing. And these were all corporate women [who had the money to invest].” Like Robson, Murakhovskaya found that these women had never been invited to invest, and they started a firm to change that.</p>
<p>Robson took a different approach. She has a day job, but she knew that she could make some introductions when it made sense. &#8220;So I&#8217;m the conduit between the two [groups]. I have this database with angel investors and other VC relationships and then also deal flow that I see that will come from other angel syndicate groups or deals that Cowboy can&#8217;t invest in because we&#8217;re conflicted out, and I try to connect those two,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Robson, on her own, created this database of people, many of whom she knew previously or learned about when she put out a call for female and non-binary angel investors on Twitter. &#8220;I chatted with them and got a sense of their background and what they were interested in, if they truly understood the risks and dynamics of angel investing, and added folks that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said going outside her network would also help create a more diverse database that went beyond people she had known personally. &#8220;I also knew that my network would be limited, and the whole point of this is increasing access, so I wanted to be a little bit more public about it so folks who wanted to be angels could see those messages on Twitter and then join in,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The database includes the names, check sizes they are willing to invest, sectors they want to invest in and previous investments (if any). She says that typical check sizes are between $15,000 and $50K, but she has seen checks as small as $5K or less as she attempts to get more people involved.</p>
<p>&#8220;In some cases recently there have been newer female [and] non-binary angel investors who have wanted to write checks that are $5K, some even below, and some founders and VCs have been open to those smaller check amounts because they want to add diversity to the cap table,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Lisa Wallace, who is co-founder at pay equity startup <a href="https://www.assemble.inc/">Assemble</a>, says that she had been an angel for a couple of years when she responded to one of Robson&#8217;s tweets. She also found that when her company was raising a seed round, it was difficult to find a diverse group of angels for her cap table. She says that Robson&#8217;s network solves both problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that there&#8217;s actually two parts of the problem. First of all, I&#8217;m a diverse angel, and I want to make sure that I [can access] dealflow, selfishly. But on the other side of it, it would have been really easy had Amanda had this when I was raising my round because I would have just pinged her,&#8221; Wallace said.</p>
<p>Stella Garber is another angel in Robson&#8217;s network who is former CMO at Trello, and started angel investing in 2016. She too came across one of Robson&#8217;s tweets and says that it&#8217;s always good to find other sources of possible deals as an angel investor.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really great to see all the different types of deals that come through that channel. There&#8217;s been a mix of all types of different industries, mostly early stage I would say. But obviously as an angel, you have to do your own due diligence, but it&#8217;s just nice to have that channel to get deals from,&#8221; Garber said.</p>
<p>While these two had experience in angel investing, not everyone does, so Robson has also been helping set up workshops to explain what&#8217;s involved to those who are expressing interest and want to learn the mechanics of this type of investing.</p>

<p>Robson admits that quite a bit overhead is required to run the network because she is the sole conduit. But she says that it&#8217;s the kind of job that is hard to outsource because she has the first-hand knowledge of both firms and angels that the role requires.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do want to get some help to grow it, but I also think that there are limits to how much I can outsource any parts of this because the access piece is super important. I&#8217;ve been doing this for four to five months and I&#8217;ve only sent 18 deals through, but all of those ended up getting a lot of interest from the group because they&#8217;re highly curated.&#8221;</p>
<p>She says the ultimate purpose is to build this network of successful angels. &#8220;I want to have these rockstar angels who&#8217;ve gotten access to amazing deals and have amazing track records. And so that&#8217;s really the ultimate goal. And it&#8217;s more about that and in making these angels successful than me leading this group.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">African e-commerce fulfilment startups backed by Y Combinator seem to be piquing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investors’ interest this year for their niche e-commerce play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer batch graduate <a href="https://shipblu.com/">ShipBlu</a> is the latest on that list and confirmed to TechCrunch that it has raised $2.4 million in seed funding</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, founded by <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/alifnasser">Ali Nasser</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmad-kawass-56b65815/">Ahmed ElKawass</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdelrahmanhosny/">Abdelrahman Hosny</a> in 2020, operates a delivery and fulfilment model. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> delivers packages of all kinds for merchants and retailers &#8212; ranging from mom and pop stores and social media to fashion retailers who make thousands of shipments and international brands &#8212; to customers in Egypt.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226717" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the fulfilment side, ShipBlu stores merchants’ products in warehouses it leases. Then it connects with merchants’ online stores and monitors orders via a dashboard, so when they come in, ShipBlu picks and packs the orders from the warehouse and sends them to the customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ShipBlu charges its customers per package, depending on two standard sizes, destination and shipping speed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While these three factors are common in e-commerce and fulfilment, CEO Nasser said shipping speed is not prioritized the same way as the other two in Egypt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to him, ShipBlu is one of the few e-commerce fulfilment companies that offers that service to customers in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We let the merchant decide: Do they need to get that product to their customer overnight, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">therefore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, pay or charge the customer for overnight fees?” Nasser said to TechCrunch in an interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Or are they willing to for a more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget-friendly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> option and would like to ship that package in three to five days? We offer that option to merchants, who in turn can decide to offer that to customers. So it could be the customer’s choice or the merchants’ choice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ShipBlu only </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched this August</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Per its <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/shipblu">YC profile</a>, ShipBlu signed on more than 40 merchants during its first month. And since then, the company has managed to double its clientele while tripling revenues in the same period, said Nasser without stating hard numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the next couple of months, Nasser says he wants ShipBlu’s network and infrastructure to reach 99% of Egypt’s population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether you’re living in a small village or a large town or a large city, we want to be able to get to you and have the infrastructure in place to get to your delivery to you,” the CEO remarked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea behind such a daring move &#8212; which appears to be a bit of a stretch considering the timeline &#8212; comes from the founders’ ambition to change an industry that has lagged behind other regions in the wider GCC, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, in terms of e-commerce penetration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 100 million people live in the North African country compared to Saudi Arabia’s 30 million+ people, yet the e-commerce market in Egypt is a third of Saudi Arabia’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A significant reason this gap has always existed is that the infrastructure needed to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilitate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the process of e-commerce in Egypt is abysmal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It runs deep even on an elementary level where zip codes are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">barely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accurate or non-existent, presenting many challenges to last mile or delivery providers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The zip codes were one of the issues Nasser observed from Egypt’s fragmented e-commerce and fulfilment market during his return from the US to the country months before the pandemic broke out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As online payments boomed globally and in Egypt and upon finding out via research that the market size for last-mile delivery in MENA stands at over $3.1 billion </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">annually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Nasser and his co-founders ElKawass, Abdelrahman Hosny got together to start ShipBlu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was that period that it hit us and we realized how much more can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be done</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for delivery services in the standard of service and the features that are available today. Compared to Europe and the US and other parts of the world, there was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so much more that we could bring to the market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Egypt is an entirely different market compared to these developed regions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For instance, 40% of deliveries fail in the country, while the global benchmark for the latter is about 8%. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high rate of delivery failure makes the operating costs for over 150 providers in Egypt generally high. ShipBlu, differentiating itself</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the market, says it has developed AI and ML algorithms to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “reduce costs, meet delivery constraints, and refine its operating assumptions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO says ShipBlu’s end goal is to make customers choose a three-hour delivery window for their packages and know what date to expect them, which contrasts how most traditional e-commerce fulfilment companies function.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Roughly 56% of the time when someone in Egypt places an order online, they don’t even have a delivery date</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. After you place your order and you get an email confirmation, it’s complete silence until, on a random day, you’re going to get a call from the agent who’s on your on their way to you asking if you are available to pick up the package. We’re changing that,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ShipBlu has competition with the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/egyptian-startup-flextock-closes-3-25m-in-the-largest-pre-seed-yet-in-mena/">Flextock</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/bosta-raises-6-7m-to-expand-e-commerce-delivery-business-across-africa-and-mena/amp/">Bosta</a> in Egypt. And following the completion of its seed round, the company now has a mutual investor with Flextock in Flexport, the billion-dollar freight and logistics company YC backed in 2014. The unicorn also invested in Nigerian <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/nigerias-sendbox-raises-1-8m-to-provide-e-commerce-fulfilment-for-small-merchants/amp/">e-commerce fulfilment startup Sendbox</a> this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MENA-focused venture capital firm Nama Ventures led ShipBlu’s seed round with participation from 1984 Ventures; Orange Ventures, the venture capital arm of Orange Telecom; Starling Ventures and other VC funds and angel investors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says the investment will help grow its service offering and coverage across Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>subscribe here.</em></a></p>
<p>I spent the past month interviewing current and former employees at Ro, a health tech unicorn, about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/ro/">rising tensions within the company as it struggles to grow into its $5 billion valuation.</a> Many employees, who joined for Ro’s mission, said that the company’s execution began to struggle after raising a $500 million Series D. The co-founders began to amplify a new focus for the company: Become the &#8220;Amazon of healthcare.&#8221; Ro CEO and co-founder Zachariah Reitano, who was not made available for comment on my story, <a href="https://medium.com/@zreitano/lets-talk-about-it-growth-business-culture-at-ro-c8b0b51670c5">released a statement in response to my piece.</a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This story started because I was tipped off about a slew of departures. After conducting a few interviews, I realized that people who had joined for mission were leaving because of low morale and poor execution &#8211; different than &#39;the great resignation&#39; <a href="https://t.co/ty2qXs0ayB">https://t.co/ty2qXs0ayB</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226591" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&mdash; natasha (@nmasc_) <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1453431730933669889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>While my story gets into the specific problems that Ro is dealing with, from stagnating ARR to race-to-the-bottom competition, I want to focus on what other startups could learn from this story.</p>
<p>Let’s be clear: It’s not abnormal for a startup to go through trials and tribulations, especially in pursuit of profit and a moonshot of a vision. After all, every startup has a tipping point in which leadership has to take a step back and see what went wrong to avoid failure. The current and former employees that I spoke to for the story — as well as the more than dozen that reached out post-publication — felt like Ro needs a recalibration to truly get past its growing pains. The common solutions that came up? Transparency, more balance and openness to addressing failure so that lessons can be extracted for the future.</p>
<p>Here’s how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/ro/">one former employee put it:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>“The first year that I was there, I was like the happiest person on earth,” a recently resigned employee said. “The piece that needs to be recalibrated is &#8216;what is the end vision?&#8217; What do you mean when you say &#8216;a vertically integrated, patient-centered health system?&#8217; And are the actions moving you toward that? And that’s ultimately why I left, because I didn’t feel like what was being said externally was actually happening internally.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As more startups get ballooned by venture capital and the incentives that come alongside with it, an industrywide recalibration between the Big Pitch and the actual product strategy of companies feels imminent.</p>
<p>Founders should prepare to have conversations about distributed work’s impact on culture and venture capital’s impact on priorities. Investors will have to question the pressure they put on portfolio companies and show value through navigating ups and downs. Press will need to go deeper than the funding round story and poke holes in the narratives that decision-makers craft. And employees, more emboldened than ever, will have to make choices on balance and the importance of self-advocacy.</p>
<p>This shift fits squarely into a perspective that I’ve leaned heavily on through the pandemic: It’s okay to change your mind about what’s important and unlearn what you thought was non-negotiable.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll talk about the future of VC, the AWS of crypto and the future of farming. As always, you can follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">@nmasc_</a> or reach me on Signal (DM for number).</p>
<h2>Even PR is getting into VC</h2>

<p>VSC, a public relations firm that has helped the likes of startups such as ClearCo, Poshmark, Tonal and Tile craft their stories, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/vsc-startup-fund-climate/">has raised millions to invest in the companies they work with.</a> The move is further validation of a trend we’ve been on about in this newsletter for months: Venture is going full stack and one of the most in-demand services is storytelling.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>While VSC’s move feels warranted, it’s somewhat unprecedented. Despite the blending of media and venture, PR firms may have avoided going down this route because their clients — other startups — need them as a shoulder, not an investor. In other words, one could argue that founders may feel less incentivized to be vulnerable with a PR firm about struggles if they are also their investors, the same people they are incentivized to impress.</p>
<p>“Because we’re not the lead investor, we don’t ever put that kind of peer pressure on them,” Chattha said. “We have enough skin in the game to be honest and vulnerable with them, but not so much that we’re going to guide them into the wrong for their business.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226074" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<h3>Apple SharePlay Arrives</h3>

<p>Apple&#8217;s new FaceTime feature SharePlay wasn&#8217;t immediately available with the iOS 15 launch, as it needed a bit more polish. But with this week&#8217;s release of iOS 15.1, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/shareplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SharePlay</a> &#8212; and a number of mobile app updates ready to support it &#8212; have finally arrived. The feature makes using Apple&#8217;s video calling platform more interactive and could help to potentially lock in users to Apple&#8217;s ecosystem.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As with many Apple features, SharePlay is easy to use despite the complicated technology powering the new system that runs under the hood. With the tap of a button on FaceTime&#8217;s controls, you can start sharing your device&#8217;s screen on your call or you can just switch over to the app you want to co-watch with a friend &#8212; the app alerts you upon arrival that it supports SharePlay as well as how to get started.</p>
<p>While screen sharing, you can view your screen or other apps together. However, you won&#8217;t have a good experience trying to co-watch videos this way due to lags. Apple also smartly blocks other viewers from seeing your incoming notifications or any kind of application pop-ups or dialogs, as they may contain sensitive information. And everything is end-to-end encrypted, so you can feel comfortable screen sharing in a business setting, not just a personal one. (And this will be further improved when SharePlay arrives on macOS Monterey later this fall.)</p>
<p>If anything, the biggest obstacle to using SharePlay at launch is simply availability.</p>
<p>Apple has a robust lineup of launch partners for the new addition &#8212; but unless you&#8217;ve happened across the App Store&#8217;s editorial round-up of SharePlay-enabled apps (do a search for &#8220;shareplay&#8221; to find it), you may not know if your favorite app is &#8220;SharePlay ready&#8221; as of yet.</p>
<p>Initially, SharePlay is rolling out to apps, including Apple TV+, Apple Fitness, TikTok, NBA: Live Games &amp; Scores, Paramount+, Showtime, Kahoot!, Cameo, SmartGym, Flow, Moon FM, MUBI, Digital Concert Hall, Piano with Friends, Relax Melodies, LookUp, Heads Up!, CARROT Weather, Apollo, Night Sky and others. Disney+ will soon support SharePlay, as will ESPN, HBO Max, Hulu, MasterClass, Twitch, Pluto TV and more.</p>
<p>While that&#8217;s pretty decent right out of the gate, <strong>it is</strong> <strong>missing one key player: Netflix</strong>.</p>
<p>You have to wonder what&#8217;s going there &#8212; is it in the works? Being held back as a negotiating tactic? Is Netflix&#8230;just not interested? As you might recall, Netflix was one of the few streamers that didn&#8217;t add a native co-watching feature (or at least officially partner with another software maker) during the pandemic, while everyone else was busy building remote social experiences. Competitors like Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Plex, HBO and others rolled out co-viewing experiences. But Netflix sat out the trend, despite the growing popularity of third-party co-viewing apps like Netflix Party. With Netflix&#8217;s more recent <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/21465/global-paid-net-subscriber-additions-by-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slower growth</a> following the pandemic&#8217;s peak, you would think the company would see SharePlay as a potential source of new user acquisition.</p>
<p>After all, SharePlay can be used to offer a free user without an account a way to co-watch with a paid subscriber, if that&#8217;s what the developer wants. This, in turn, could then be used to push the free user to buy a subscription after some time has passed &#8212; like <em>after</em> they got hooked on some exclusive shows, perhaps. It seems like a no-brainer to offer support for this sort of thing &#8212; but perhaps Netflix is building out its own version where it can collect more data as a first-party experience. Time will tell.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the SharePlay feature could appeal to younger people who already use FaceTime the way older people use the Phone app, and who are comfortable multi-tasking on their devices.</p>
<h3>In-App Events Go Live</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2226494" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226494" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2226494" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-29-at-1.59.03-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="501" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-29-at-1.59.03-PM.jpg 1796w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-29-at-1.59.03-PM.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-29-at-1.59.03-PM.jpg?resize=300,221 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-29-at-1.59.03-PM.jpg?resize=768,565 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-29-at-1.59.03-PM.jpg?resize=680,501 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-29-at-1.59.03-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1131 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-29-at-1.59.03-PM.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2226494" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>A whole new way to market apps has now appeared on the App Store. On Wednesday, the first <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/in-app-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in-app events</a> began appearing on the App Store, giving users a new way to find out what&#8217;s happening inside their favorite apps and games right now. At launch, Rise of Kingdoms and Pokémon GO are promoting Halloween special events, for example, as are others. But in-app events could also be used to promote things like movie premieres or live sports in the future. When users tap a new event card on the App Store (in iOS 15 or iPadOS 15), they&#8217;ll be taken directly to the event taking place. They can also tap &#8220;Notify Me&#8221; to get alerts when upcoming events go live, share events with friends or add them to their calendar app.</p>
<p>Other games adopting the feature include Call of Duty: Mobile, PUBG Mobile, Clash Royale and Genshin Impact and soon, so will apps like Tinder, TikTok, Disney+, Hulu, Paramount+, HBO Max and ESPN.</p>

<h3><strong>Dating</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Match-owned dating app Hinge introduces a new &#8220;Voice Prompts&#8221; feature</strong> that gives users a new way to interact, by answering a prompt through a 30-second recording.

<li><strong>Chinese dating app Lesdo, designed for lesbian women, announced it was shutting down.</strong> This specific niche of online dating has failed to scale and make a profit in the country, despite a potential audience of 10 million in China. Contributing to the problem of scale is a hostile environment for the LGBTQ+ community, as Beijing has pressured charities not to work with queer activists and WeChat deactivated queer groups&#8217; public accounts, <a href="https://www.protocol.com/china/-lesdo-closure-lesbian-app-china" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Protocol reported</a>.</li>

<li><strong>This week, reps from TikTok, Snap and YouTube faced Congress to talk about how their apps are addressing kids and online safety</strong> as the U.S. considers legislation that would require tech companies to offer a safer environment for kids online. One of the highlights from the hearing was listening to senators <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/tiktok-snap-youtube-execs-grilled-impact-young-users/story?id=80793639" target="_blank" rel="noopener">try to get the companies on the record</a> as to whether or not they support specific legislation, like the upcoming COPPA revamp, which only TikTok fully said &#8220;yes&#8221; to. When asked about the KIDS Act, which would prevent manipulative marketing (like undisclosed influencer marketing), there was less support. Companies said they would be happy to &#8220;look&#8221; at the details as if the Act was new, and not something that had already been around for a while.</li>
<li><strong>TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-dodges-questions-about-biometric-data-collection-in-senate-hearing/">dodged questions</a> about its plans for biometric data collection during its first-ever Senate hearing.</strong> In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/tiktok-just-gave-itself-permission-to-collect-biometric-data-on-u-s-users-including-faceprints-and-voiceprints/">an update to the company’s U.S. privacy policy</a> in June, TikTok added a new section that noted the app “may collect biometric identifiers and biometric information” from its users’ content, including things like “faceprints and voiceprints.” The company was questioned by multiple lawmakers on this matter during a hearing conducted by the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-snap-youtube-hearing-congress/">which was focused on</a> social media’s detrimental impacts on children and teens.</li>
<li><strong>The lawmakers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/youtube-and-snapchat-were-asked-to-defend-their-apps-age-ratings-in-senate-hearing/">also asked</a> YouTube and Snap to defend their apps&#8217; age ratings on the app stores,</strong> where they were sometimes rated 13 and up or 17 and up, depending on the platform. <strong>Snap was also pressed on whether its content was even appropriate for younger teens</strong>, given the app&#8217;s Discover page contained content that Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) deemed &#8220;wildly inappropriate&#8221; for a child, like &#8220;recommendations for&#8230;an invite to play an online sexualized video game that’s marketed itself to people who are 18 and up; tips on, quote, ‘why you shouldn’t go to bars alone;’ notices for video games that are rated for ages 17 and up; and articles about porn stars,&#8221; he said.</li>
<li><strong>The senators also asked TikTok, Snap and YouTube <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/lawmakers-confront-tiktok-snapchat-and-youtube-about-eating-disorder-content/">how they handled</a> eating disorder content,</strong> after Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen‘s document leaks exposed Facebook’s knowledge that Instagram could be dangerous for teenage girls with body image issues.</li>
<li><strong>In non-hearing news, Apple is &#8220;very likely&#8221; going to face a DOJ antitrust lawsuit,</strong> <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-very-likely-to-face-doj-antitrust-suit?rc=ajsw4d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Information reported this week,</a> citing sources with knowledge of the matter.</li>

<p>Niantic&#8217;s attempt to once again replicate the success of Pokémon GO, in a way that Harry Potter: Wizards Unite <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/comment-and-opinion/76443/harry-potter-wizards-unite-failed-magic/">has not really been able to</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/pikmin-bloom-an-ar-mobile-game-is-niantics-next-collaboration-with-nintendo/">arrived this week</a>. The company announced the launch of a new AR game Pikmin Bloom in collaboration with Nintendo. The game, like Pokémon GO, encourages users to go outside and explore &#8212; but now, instead of capturing Pokémon, they&#8217;ll collect seedlings and a squad of &#8220;Pikmin&#8221; &#8212; a sort of plant-animal hybrid creature. As you walk, you&#8217;ll leave AR trails of flowers behind you. The game will also later host monthly &#8220;Community Days&#8221; for Pikmin so users can plant and play together. Overall, the game seems less competitive than Pokémon GO and may be aimed at someone who wants more casual gameplay. The game initially rolled out to Singapore and Australia, then the U.S., and will continue to roll out globally.</p>
<h3><strong>Matterport 3D Capture (Android)</strong></h3>

<p>Matterport brought its 3D capture app to Android users, which allows customers to digitize their home, office or hotel with any compatible Android device, for free. Homeowners can use the app to create a digital appraisal of their property and everything in it for insurance, space planning or just peace of mind. Meanwhile, builders can plan and manage their construction projects along with designers, contractors and clientele. And real estate agents and rental property managers can quickly capture and publish 3D virtual experiences online, then share them across websites and social networks. The <strong>Matterport App for Android</strong> is available now on Google Play and can be used with a free account.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>daily TechCrunch+ column</em></a><em> where it gets its name. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Good morning my dear friends, I trust you are well. It’s the weekend! Here’s hoping you are going to consume more sugar in the next few days than your doctor would approve of. After all, we all die in the end. And on that encouraging note, let’s get to work!</p>
<p>TechCrunch’s recurring coverage of venture capital trends has taken on an increasingly global tilt as the startup market has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">expanded to fill every geography</a>. Hence our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/investors-say-indian-startup-funding-could-get-even-hotter-after-record-q3/">ramping coverage of India’s startup scene</a>, not to mention our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/african-startups-join-global-funding-boom-as-fintech-shines/">increasing focus on the startups coming out of the African continent</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226507" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With so many startups raising so very much money, it can be hard to keep it all straight. But we’re not the only organization with its eyes on upstart technology companies busy adapting to the new global startup reality. Venture capitalists are as well.</p>
<p>We’ve seen VCs shake up their operations to better suit a flat world for technology innovation in recent years. Larger funds with more partners to spread focus, for example, or the creation of country- or region-specific funds.</p>
<p>White Star is one such firm with an increasingly broad focus. The venture group recently closed its third fund, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/fund/white-star-capital-raised-white-star-capital-fund-iii--d8476841">a $360 million vehicle</a>, and TechCrunch caught up with founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericmartineaufortin/">Eric Martineau-Fortin</a> a few days back. But instead of chatting about valuations, or sectors, we mostly talked about geographies.</p>
<p>Martineau-Fortin lives in Guernsey, a small island that sits roughly between France and the United Kingdom. Residing between two major landmasses is fitting for the investor, as his firm’s first fund focused on the United States and Europe, roughly splitting investments between the two.</p>
<p>White Star’s second fund expanded its geographical purview to include a modest Asia focus as well. The group’s third fund will split roughly 40/40/20 between America, Europe and Asia, Martineau-Fortin said.</p>
<p>Notably, the group doesn’t actively pursue the Indian market. Which stood out, given how much capital is flowing into the country, but White Star keeps its focus more on the South Korean and Japanese markets, so it can invest in Asia more broadly while not putting India atop its list.</p>
<p>I riffed with Martineau-Fortin about other markets. He had rather positive things to say about Brazil’s startup scene — not a huge surprise with Nubank’s IPO in the offing — and Mexico. More simply, the Latin American venture capital market is respected even by investors that don’t have a focus there.</p>
<p>The world’s venture market remains uneven, despite some flattening. The United States saw $72.3 billion in total VC activity in Q3 2021, <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q3-2021/">per CB Insights data</a>. Asia as a whole saw $50.2 billion. Europe managed $24.2 billion, and Latin America just $5.3 billion. That means that there’s likely arbitrage out there for the investor willing to add new time zones to their mix.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, White Star could split its investment focus into thirds among the U.S., Europe and Asia. I wonder if that will become a normal split in time. After all, the internet is everywhere at once — sans North Korea, China and a few other markets — so why not put capital into companies, well, everywhere?</p>
<h2>The future of consumer investing</h2>
<p>Taking a hard right turn this morning, let’s talk about consumer investing in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>I promise I am going somewhere with this!</p>
<p>The Exchange caught up with <a href="https://freetrade.io/">Freetrade</a> this week, auspicious timing as our call came in the wake of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/robinhoods-nasty-quarter-shows-the-ups-downs-of-trading-incomes/">Robinhood’s poor earnings report</a>. As a reminder, Robinhood shares fell after the company announced a sharp sequential-quarterly revenue decline, falling active users and slim figures on total funded accounts.</p>
<p>The short answer to what happened from Q2 2021 to Q3 2021 at Robinhood is that crypto trading fell off a cliff on its platform, leading to a lackluster revenue result. The company’s Q4 is forecasted to be even smaller than its Q3. Not good!</p>
<p>I expected the Robinhood results to prove indicative of what Freetrade was seeing amongst its own user base. But, per the <a href="https://twitter.com/doddsie">company’s CEO Adam Dodds</a>, nothing of the sort. Indeed, the company recently announced that it has reached one million users, but more importantly that it has secured 110,000 new <em>funded</em> accounts thus far in October. That’s a <em>huge</em> portion of the company’s aggregate user base in a single month!</p>
<p>That hardly bearish fact in hand, Dodds doesn&#8217;t see Freetrade’s core market of the U.K. as nearly tapped out, and the company has expansion plans involving Canada, Australia and more coming in the next few months. Along with, yes, crypto trading.</p>
<p>The other difference of note between Robinhood and Freetrade, apart from their presently disparate user growth figures, is that the latter company doesn’t engage in payment for order flow. Instead, Dodds explained, the company makes money from subscriptions, a small slice of FX transactions and interest on held user cash.</p>
<p>The subscription element is key to the company’s long-term value, I reckon. Why? Because recurring software revenues are investor catnip, and Dodds said that something akin to a quarter of folks opt to pony up for the paid version of its service.</p>
<p>If that ratio holds up — or merely experiences modest declines — Freetrade could build a huge software business. Given just how much more penetration the startup anticipates in its home market, let alone foreign shores, there’s money to be made. More when Freetrade raises again.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Authoritarian governments from twenty-one countries have deliberately shut down internet service at least fifty times this year, and the problem is only bound to get worse. As regimes such as Venezuela face elections and Cuba experience protests, they’re finding it easier to contain dissent by curtailing digital freedoms – and are becoming increasingly brazen in doing so.</p>
<p>Shutting down the internet can be as easy as flipping a switch. Hosni Mubarak’s Egypt took this approach in 2011, and ten years later, Myanmar’s daily shutdowns lasted <i>months</i> – depriving hundreds of thousands of people of the means to communicate and shrinking the country’s GDP by an estimated 2.5 percent. Just this week in Sudan, citizens are experiencing disruptions to internet access in the midst of an ongoing military coup.</p>
<p>Most governments are more nuanced, however.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226666" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-global-affairs-project/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2226330 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/global-affairs-project-sq.jpg?w=300" alt="Read more from the TechCrunch Global Affairs Project" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/global-affairs-project-sq.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/global-affairs-project-sq.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/global-affairs-project-sq.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/global-affairs-project-sq.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/global-affairs-project-sq.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/global-affairs-project-sq.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/global-affairs-project-sq.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/global-affairs-project-sq.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/global-affairs-project-sq.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/global-affairs-project-sq.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/global-affairs-project-sq.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The Iranian government was among the first to block websites, as it did in 2009 during the Green Movement. Others, like Tunisia, blocked only certain websites amidst protests demanding greater accountability this year. Increasingly, governments use their control over internet service providers to ‘throttle’, or slow down, particular domains to an unusable speed. Russia, for instance, recently throttled Twitter for refusing to remove “objectionable” content about opposition figure Alexei Navalny.</p>
<p>Governments provide myriad reasons for restricting internet access. Officials often cite national security or a fear of violence during public demonstrations. But as people live more of their lives online, governments’ ability to restrict internet access represents a grave threat to safety, freedom and well-being.</p>
<p>After all, the internet’s growth as a global, borderless network of networks has been a boon to human freedom, providing new ways to discover information and new channels to organize. But growing opposition to a truly global open internet from a surprising number of governments risks a mounting erosion of freedoms as more aspects of our lives shift online.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The problem of deliberate shutdowns has escalated – and UN Special Rapporteur Clement Voule recently<a href="https://undocs.org/A/HRC/47/24/Add.2"> warned</a> that shutdowns are getting worse and more widespread. Internet shutdowns are increasingly being used as the primary tool for governments to silence dissent and control their populations without attracting the ire of the international community.</p>
<p>Internet shutdowns affect people far beyond restricting communication: they immobilize economies by halting commerce and trade, keep people from attending school, and endanger lives. But as covert blocking techniques like throttling have become commonplace, detection of shutdowns has become more difficult. The increasing complexity of the internet makes it difficult to determine what is happening when a government limits its citizens’ access, though. And it’s impossible to condemn what you can’t see.</p>
<p>Documenting even partial internet shutdowns is a critical first step to addressing this issue globally. No government should be able to shut down the internet without the international community knowing about it. That’s why Jigsaw is working with leading researchers at Access Now, Censored Planet, Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI), and others to make information available, build understanding, and mitigate the impact of shutdowns.</p>
<p>A number of resources can reduce the impact of internet shutdowns. Mesh networks, virtual private networks (VPNs), and shared proxy servers can provide the means to help people connect to the open web during shutdowns. Implementing internet-wide standards can make domain-level throttling more difficult.</p>
<p>But technology is only one part of the solution. Preventing future shutdowns requires political action: raising the cost of such action in the eyes of the international community.</p>
<p>Grassroots efforts to highlight internet shutdowns such as the #KeepItOn movement, a coalition of more than 240 organizations from 105 countries, provides a range of advocacy, technical support, and legal interventions to prevent future shutdowns.</p>
<p>Democratic governments, too, should unite in action.</p>
<p>As the world&#8217;s most technologically advanced democracies formalize their multilateral coordination on technology issues in groupings like the T-12 or the Quad, they should prioritize internet shutdowns as a key pillar of their agenda. Through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United States and other like-minded states could build on the work of the Online Freedom Coalition, a grouping of thirty-five democracies committed to online freedom, to enhance funding efforts to understand the technical aspects of the threat and develop technical and policy responses. They could ensure concerted condemnation accompanies future shutdowns and articulate ‘red lines’ to trigger sanctions on countries violating their commitments under international human rights law.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, it is up to democracies to take up the rallying cry for a free and open internet. Only then might the promise of a universally accessible internet be fulfilled.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">My son was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder in the first grade. As a mother, it took an ecosystem of support from schools, counselors and family members to ensure that we understood his needs and provided support for his learning and personal development.</p>
<p>Through our own journey, I’ve seen firsthand the challenges that people with neurological variations like autism face on a daily basis, but perhaps one of the biggest hurdles is overcoming society’s underestimation of this incredibly gifted population.</p>
<p>In my experience, people with neurodiversity are consistently underestimated for their knowledge and skills — but if my son is any indication of the value they can bring to the tech industry, then business leaders are missing out until they prioritize cognitive diversity.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225053" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Why is neurodiversity important in the technology industry?</h2>
<p>One of the key factors in making each of us different is our neurological makeup. This difference can result in people interpreting, understanding and reacting differently in certain situations within personal and working life. And it often creates different skills and talents within people, such as heightened levels of analytical and creative processing.</p>
<p>The technology industry spans various roles and functions, from data scientists to developers, analysts and many more – not to mention the jobs that have yet to be created as we approach the Fifth Industrial Revolution and our world undergoes a significant digital transformation.</p>
<p>As an industry, we need to work harder to educate how talent can be leveraged in different ways to fulfill these roles, because employees are often a company’s greatest asset.</p>
<p>Throughout history, we’ve relied on our ability as a society to think differently in order to survive and thrive. With differences in thinking, neurodiverse people can bring alternative perspectives that may not have been explored before. It’s critical that businesses continue to prioritize cognitive diversity in their workforce, as every individual brings unique knowledge, experiences, and skills to the table and can help drive progress in technological innovation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>How can the tech sector recognize and recruit neurodiverse talent?</h2>
<p>One of the first barriers to entry for someone who is neurodiverse is the interview process. Traditional interviews take into consideration things like body language and awareness of social cues that can put a neurodiverse person at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Neurodiversity might affect the way that someone communicates; for example, the inability to read non-verbal social cues, resulting in limited eye contact and limited language softening. This behavior could lead to the removal of neurodiverse people from candidacy based on “cultural fit.&#8221; In reality, this is a much larger miscommunication that’s likely to screen out neurodiverse talent from positions in which they could excel.</p>
<p>Chemistry and character-based stages of the hiring process tend to take place first, before digging into the more technical elements of a role, where neurodiverse people can display their advanced skills. This leads us to ask: Are businesses doing enough to support diversity, equity and inclusion if they aren’t giving equal opportunity to neurodiverse people?</p>
<p>One way businesses can address this challenge is by partnering with community organizations to gain expert guidance, education, and best practices around talent acquisition and talent nurturing.</p>
<p>For example, across Stanley Black &amp; Decker, we’re collaborating with the National Organization on Disability and Autism Speaks to establish a hiring program that helps us recruit and retain talent of all abilities. As a leading global company, we have a responsibility to ensure our future is developed for everyone, by everyone, and that means taking steps to ensure our workforce is diverse and inclusive of people of all abilities, including neurodiverse people.</p>
<p>By taking steps to understand how we can all implement inclusive hiring practices, the tech industry can greatly benefit from a talent pool that might have otherwise been untapped. This could provide at least part of the solution to the technology talent shortage that continues to impact the industry.</p>
<p>Job mobility and career advancement within the neurodiverse community can also be explored and developed to ensure that career advancement is not limited to lower-skilled positions.</p>
<p>We must keep in mind the limitations on soft skills and associated characteristics stereotypically looked for in management and leadership roles, such as self-awareness and interpersonal communication.</p>
<p>When you look at case studies of neurodiverse teams, there is a distinct uplift in productivity, particularly in analytical roles. As such, I’d encourage leaders to identify opportunities for all talent to excel in their areas of expertise.</p>

<h2>Can the tech sector help optimize the future of the workplace for neurodiverse people?</h2>
<p>During the past 18 months, we have seen a dramatic shift in requirements from leadership. Employees have more autonomy than ever before, and the same goes for people who are neurodiverse.</p>
<p>They now have the ability to request workplace accommodations that might not have been considered “essential” in the past — for example, more flexible working arrangements or the availability of choices to support alternative requirements to thrive in their working day. This could include variety in their immediate work environment and spaces for limited social interaction, noise or distraction, as well as the availability of headphones to limit auditory overstimulation.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the virtual world in which we’re living presents an added opportunity for people who are neurodiverse because it requires fewer of the typical in-person social skills that were previously expected within the workplace. This means that now more than ever, there are many flexible processes and policies that organizations can put in place to meet employees where they are.</p>
<p>A great way to provide additional support to employees is by encouraging engagement in employee resource groups (ERGs). In 2018, I co-founded our Abilities Network, a global ERG committed to supporting employees with disabilities, employee family caregivers of those with disabilities and the greater global community. It provides them with an engaging environment where they can pursue advancement, bring their full selves to work and thrive.</p>
<p>It was my personal experience that inspired me to establish this ecosystem of support &#8212; I knew how essential it was in helping our family advocate for our son. I did this through charity partnerships such as Autism Speaks. First initiated in 2018, we wanted to provide guidance for our workforce and leverage the National Organization on Disabilities to enhance our education and progress in this area.</p>
<p>By developing these communities, we can open conversations around neurodiversity and create more inclusive environments in which all employees have the tools, resources and support they need to succeed.</p>
<p>This also allows us to support employees as the business adapts. For example, during the pandemic, we saw a large increase in employees suffering from anxiety. Therefore, the Abilities Network partnered with Understanding Anxiety to offer support and tools to employees who need it.</p>
<p>It’s important that we bring best practices in inclusivity to all elements of the business, from hiring to marketing and everything in between.</p>
<p>From a marketing perspective, this means creating, for example, accessible website experiences across a company’s digital platforms to ensure people of all abilities are able to access and experience the company’s information. We’ve been successful in deploying numerous digital experiences with “accessibility by design” through the support of the Abilities Network ERG.</p>
<p>By tracking the progress of the employee experience through employment statistics and employee objectives in a Disability Employment Tracker, we have seen a 54% increase in talent sourcing and a 20% increase in “people, policies and practices” leading to an overall cultural accessibility increase of 105%.</p>
<p>My son has been a tremendous help throughout this process, acting as a sounding board to help me drive toward a more inclusive future, and I’m forever grateful for his partnership. He has been the inspiration behind my passion to ensure inclusivity remains at the heart of everything that I do.</p>
<h2>Neurodiversity presents business opportunities</h2>
<p>Technology changes the world and shapes the future of all industries. As leaders in this space, we have a responsibility to ensure that this future is inclusive and representative of all of us. We must ensure diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives aid not only new talent, but the neurodiverse people already within the talent pool.</p>
<p>My son, now 19 years old, is studying biotechnology and molecular bioscience at a technology university. When he was first diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, we were met with low expectations for his personal and professional development — a collective underestimation of the value his unique skills could bring to the table.</p>
<p>This has driven my passion and efforts to ensure that we at Stanley Black &amp; Decker — and other companies — provide inclusive opportunities for all people.</p>
<p>Neurodiversity presents a huge opening for leaders to bring in unique talent with different skill sets to ultimately drive progress in the tech industry and beyond. And unless we’re tapping into this pool of talent, companies are missing out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There’s a new venture studio in the world that looks rather different from earlier venture studios from a structural standpoint. Unlike renowned outfits like Atomic or Science or Expa that create companies that then sell equity to VCs who expect that equity to rise in value, this new studio, <a href="https://www.superlayer.io/">SuperLayer</a>, plans to spin up consumer projects then instead of sell equity to VCs, it will invite the communities that use these products to invest in them by acquiring tokens, which can then be bought or sold or used to participate in other projects.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the case of SuperLayer, the tokens might all look a bit different, but they will all be tied to a blockchain network called Rally that SuperLayer’s founders created earlier and want to help popularize by creating more interesting apps atop it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s part of what early crypto adherents have labeled Web3 and describe as the<a href="https://future.a16z.com/why-web3-matters/"> internet owned by the builders and users and orchestrated with tokens</a>. It&#8217;s also a world that many venture firms continue to approach warily. But they may well miss the boat as more outfits like SuperLayer begin to emerge, many of them created by battle-tested founders.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226680" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In the case of Superlayer, that founder is Kevin Chou, who sold his gaming company, Kabam, for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/28/gaming-company-kabams-roller-coaster-ride-to-a-700-million-exit/">$800 million</a> back in 2018 and almost immediately jumped headlong into the world of blockchain technologies, which he believes can unlock new economic opportunities, including for gamers and or creators.</p>
<p>In fact, before spinning up SuperLayer, Chou cofounded the blockchain gaming startup called <a href="https://www.forte.io/">Forte</a>; he is also the cofounder of <a href="https://rally.io/">Rally</a>, a launchpad for creators to build and distribute their own digital currencies that are essentially white-labeled versions of the RLY coin, as it&#8217;s called.</p>
<p>Chou has had the support along the way of investors like Coinbase Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz, and they&#8217;ve already seen meaningful upside. Those RLY coins, worth five cents when all 15 billion of them were minted, are now trading on Coinbase and several other exchanges for roughly $.052. Investors and team members reportedly control more than three-quarters of that supply right now &#8212; so they have to hold them or tank their price &#8212; but the idea is for the community to own 70% once all are distributed over time.</p>
<p>If all goes as planned, it could make a lot of wealthy people wealthier, and enrich many less-wealthy token holders, too. Consider: just about 7% of the coins are in circulation, giving the currency a market cap of $800 million. But if all 15 billion coins were released at today’s price, the coins’ fully diluted market cap would be $7.9 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The efforts of Chou and company to decentralize its social token infrastructure is interesting on its own. Still, the real story here may be the opportunities and challenges that an organization like SuperLayer is beginning to pose to venture firms because of its relative complexity compared with traditional equity investments.</p>
<p>It’s largely why  Sequoia Capital announced earlier this week that it is becoming a registered investment advisor. As Roelof Botha, the head of Sequoia’s U.S. operations, <a href="https://medium.com/sequoia-capital/the-sequoia-fund-patient-capital-for-building-enduring-companies-9ed7bcd6c7da">wrote Tuesday</a> on Medium, becoming an RIA expands the firm’s flexibility in a number of ways; it also enables Sequoia to further increase its investments in emerging assets classes, such as cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Chou doesn&#8217;t necessarily think Sequoia is restructuring itself because of its growing interest in crypto deals. But he does think more firms will need to follow suit if they want to capitalize on endeavors like his own.</p>
<p>“In a world where there are these new types of technology platforms that are being created that are powered by these tokens with a very different business model and very different technology architecture,&#8221; smart firms recognize that &#8220;We have to do that,&#8221; says Chou.</p>
<p>By &#8220;that,&#8221; he means, evolve. One of the biggest challenges of traditional funds, notes Chou, is that once an investment becomes liquid, a firm’s obligation to its own investors is to either give them the cash from that “exit,” of distribute their shares in the entity, at which point, their investors can decide if they want to hold them or sell them.</p>
<p>But in the world of crypto, the idea is often to take the tokens acquired from one project and to use them to participate in the growth of another project. It can mean buying and selling and being both an active &#8212; and sometimes very patient &#8212; participant. And it&#8217;s work that comparatively few venture firms right now fully understand, Chou suggests.</p>
<p>They may come to regret it, as Chou hints that crypto founders are running out of patience with traditional VCs &#8212; and just as more blockchains and their applications are beginning to reach mainstream adoption. While a few years ago, entrepreneurs didn’t mind having to hold investors&#8217; hands, he says, “More and more in 2021, a founder of a cryptocurrency that’s getting some traction and is trying to raise money is not going to go to the traditional Sand Hill Road firm.”</p>
<p>It’s not worth the time and effort, suggests Chou. Many have strict limitations around tokens, and most still need a whole lot of hand-holding. He knows, having lived it. “We’ve had to spend a lot of time with finance [teams] that [have] never done a crypto investment. We&#8217;ve had to do investment committee meetings, CFO meetings, lawyer meetings &#8212; just to give them delivery of their tokens. Then [you have] to help them set up their security and operations around how does the general partnership hold the tokens and how does it disperse the tokens to their LPs&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The process, he says, is &#8220;really painful.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, a report from the EU showed that <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_269">42%</a> of companies exaggerate their level of sustainability. This &#8220;greenwashing&#8221; is now so prevalent that one organization has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/19/greenwashing-needs-to-be-abolished-says-climate-entrepreneur.html">launched a platform</a> to calculate businesses&#8217; true environmental impact and avoid misleading marketing.</p>
<p>Today’s global impact investment market is valued at <a href="https://thegiin.org/impact-investing/need-to-know/">$715 billion</a> and growing. But as VCs, angels and celebrities rush to put their dollars in businesses that do good, they&#8217;re not doing sufficient due diligence.</p>
<p>For some founders, tying themselves to impact is a way to play into trends and get noticed by investors. It&#8217;s why some people identify themselves as an &#8220;impactpreneur.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224864" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>There&#8217;s a fine line between impact and pushing a narrative for marketing purposes, and misjudging a startup&#8217;s genuineness can cost investors money as well as their reputation. During my time working with thousands of startups, I’ve picked up on these three signs that a startup is using impact to gain traction on the public stage &#8212; not make real change.</p>
<h2>They aren&#8217;t recording and tracking impact metrics</h2>
<p>If a company isn&#8217;t measuring the impact they claim to focus on, that&#8217;s a red flag. Startups that are really striving for impact will have a clear definition of what their goals are, how they&#8217;re getting there and what metrics are monitored along the way.</p>
<p>At Founder Institute, we have defined several “<a href="https://fi.co/insight/impact-kpi-assessing-startup-esg-progress">impact KPIs</a>” that help startups track their incremental impact steps.</p>
<p>For example, a women-led accelerator program that hopes to increase the number of successful female founders could have metrics around the number of female attendees per month and year, the number of attendees that launch a business and how much funding those businesses received. No impact is created overnight, but by breaking the journey into granular chunks, businesses demonstrate that they&#8217;re committed to building and refining their path to impact.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tracking metrics also forces companies to be fully accountable for the impact they advertise. The companies that publish their metrics even when they aren&#8217;t positive tend to conduct deep dives into what went wrong and put in place plans to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>A great example is Duke Energy, which shared a <a href="https://sustainabilityreport.duke-energy.com/">report</a> acknowledging that it fell short on team diversity goals last year. To<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/duke-energy-appoints-chief-diversity-190500722.html"> improve the metrics</a>, the company hired a new chief diversity and inclusion officer and committed $4 million to advocate for equality in the communities it serves.</p>
<p>We investors also have to ensure that metrics are present throughout a company &#8212; that startups practice what they preach. If a business has stated that it wants to improve access to education for more people, the founder should be able to provide metrics around in-house training programs, course offerings, development plans and promotions.</p>
<p>If they don&#8217;t have this information, that could be a sign that the company&#8217;s impact only targets lateral goals and isn&#8217;t built into internal operations.</p>
<h2>The CMO is responsible for the impact strategy</h2>
<p>Impact should ultimately fall on the shoulders of the CEO. It may sound obvious, but if the chief marketing officer is the go-to person for conversations and reporting about impact, that&#8217;s a problem.</p>
<p>When impact exists solely in the marketing realm, it can be easy for people to have accidental or convenient impact &#8212; where they retrospectively look at data and celebrate successes that weren&#8217;t the direct result of an impact strategy. For example: A startup claims that it reduced its carbon footprint by 10% in 2020, when really the drop was due to operations being shut down during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Likewise, if a startup&#8217;s impact objectives seem too good to be true, they usually are. Marketing departments go big when they want to make a splash (see: Theranos), but with impact, companies need to be acting at the ground level before they shoot for the moon.</p>
<p>Take ExxonMobil, which advertised its experimental algae biofuels as a means to reduce transport emissions. Consumers were <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/exxon-sees-green-gold-in-algae-based-fuels-skeptics-see-greenwashing-11633258802">quick to point out</a> that the company had made no pledge to net zero carbon emissions before shooting for &#8220;sexier&#8221; impact alternatives.</p>
<h2>They&#8217;re about projections, not progress</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s natural that when founders are fundraising, they emphasize their most disruptive edge. That they can end poverty, close inequality gaps or reduce the effects of climate change. These promises can raise investor eyebrows, but they have to be rooted in the <em>how</em>.</p>
<p>Every investor knows the feeling of glossing over the financial projections in a startup pitch deck. It&#8217;s not so much the figures that matter, but the process behind them. It&#8217;s exactly the same with impact.</p>
<p>If a startup&#8217;s whole identity is the future numbers of their impact goals, investors should be wary. The methodology is far more telling than the statistics.</p>
<p>For example, GSK has announced ambitious plans to be net zero carbon by 2030, but its breakdown of <a href="https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/responsibility/environment/carbon/">key activities</a> like switching to renewable electricity, electric cars and green chemistry is what confirms that the company is actually moving toward that impact. If the company doesn&#8217;t reach total net zero status, the intent is still clearly there, and progress will be made &#8212; but perhaps at a slower pace.</p>
<p>If Theranos has taught us anything, it&#8217;s that companies are wise to the allure of impact when raising funds. For investors, being able to distinguish real impact from marketing ploys not only protects them, it helps their capital go to places that can really make a difference.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Is Southeast Asia about to hit an inflection point for tech startups?</p>
<p>Four hundred million people in the region already use the internet, but by year&#8217;s end, one estimate suggests that 80% of the population over the age of 15 in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam will be digital consumers.</p>
<p>&#8220;As per Jungle Ventures’ calculations, the total value of the region’s digital companies is around $340 billion today and is estimated to grow to $1 trillion by 2025,&#8221;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/predicting-the-next-wave-of-southeast-asia-tech-giants/"> says founding partner Amit Anand</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226606" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<hr />
<p>E-commerce, fintechs and the rapid digitization of the region&#8217;s SME workforce are a few of the factors reshaping the landscape for Southeast Asia&#8217;s startups, but supply chain technology is also a major opportunity, Anand says.</p>
<p>&#8220;With new deals and intentions to list in the U.S. being announced more frequently, the region shows no sign of slowing down and the birth of many more unicorns is on the horizon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just over a tenth of Americans have jobs in food and agriculture, so it’s easy to see why many of us lack a keen awareness about what we’re eating or where it comes from.</p>
<p>Our food supply isn’t as secure or predictable as we assumed: Climate change, safety recalls, the COVID-19 pandemic and even immigration policies can directly impact what’s available at the store.</p>
<p>The technological leaps that made it possible to feed (most of) the world will not see us through the next century unless we change course.</p>
<p>Plant-based protein has gotten a lot of press, but vertical farming that leans on hardware and robotics has reached scale, reports Brian Heater, TechCrunch hardware editor.</p>
<p>In a four-part series, he explores the origins and operations of Bowery Farming, a profitable startup that has raised almost $500 million since 2015 to create new tech and facilities that raise leafy greens sold in nearly 900 markets.</p>

<p>Denver, Colorado is nicknamed the Mile High City, but enthusiastic investors don&#8217;t seem to mind the thin air.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Per a recent CB Insights report, Denver-based startups raised around $2.7 billion in all of 2020,&#8221; report Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm in today&#8217;s edition of The Exchange.</p>
<p>&#8220;The same dataset says that startups in the city have raised $3.1 billion through Q3 of 2021 — more capital in less time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Colorado&#8217;s central location and quality of life have made Denver and nearby Boulder attractive hubs for Big Tech firms. Now that remote work has become the norm, remote investment in the area has dialed up as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Denver was ready for the Zoom boom, and is reaping the — venture capital — rewards.&#8221;</p>

<p>Giving consumers the convenience of deferring payment for a product is not a new idea, but now that upstarts like Klarna, Afterpay and Affirm have taken the concept to the next level, legacy credit card companies and payment firms are taking notice.</p>
<p>Mary Ann Azevedo and Ryan Lawler have identified a &#8220;slow emergence&#8221; in the BNPL space &#8220;of a symbiotic relationship between traditional financial institutions, payments upstarts and leading companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Visa announced this week that many companies are using its technology to power point-of-sale BNPL solutions; last month, its rival rolled out Mastercard Installments, its bespoke offering.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s not really a surprise that these credit card companies are stepping it up when it comes to BNPL,&#8221; reported Ryan and Mary Ann. &#8220;If anything, it’s a wonder that it took them this long.&#8221;</p>

<p>At a previous job, I worked near a Sweetgreen location, stopping in once each week to pick up our startup&#8217;s lunch order.</p>
<p>The salads were delicious, but the prices definitely made me appreciate our free lunch policy. While reading Alex Wilhelm&#8217;s review of Sweetgreen&#8217;s S-1, I recalled something else: whenever I visited, I was usually the only customer waiting for a pickup.</p>
<p>Heavily reliant on digital orders and office workers, Sweetgreen &#8220;is rather unprofitable and doesn’t appear to be on the cusp of a rapid march toward profitability,&#8221; writes Alex.</p>
<p>At the same time, &#8220;the company’s overall business plan appears sound on paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a modern, mostly remote workplace, unapproved SaaS applications used by individual employees may lead to duplicate subscriptions, wasted IT spend and greater risk of a data breach.</p>
<p>How do you chase away the shadows? Just shine a light on your SaaS portfolio, according to CEO and co-founder of Zylo, Eric Christopher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once IT has a line of sight into all applications in use and how they are used, they are positioned to optimize investments,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Implementing self-service SaaS at your organization is easier than you may think.&#8221;</p>

<p>Any stock that trades on the prospect of a company&#8217;s growth rather than its current business value is treading on thin ice.</p>
<p>So when trading platform Robinhood reported worse-than-expected Q3 revenue and profit, and predicted Q4 revenue also below analysts&#8217; expectations, the market responded.</p>
<p>In an in-depth examination of the company&#8217;s Q3 results, Alex Wilhelm found that Robinhood&#8217;s user base, crypto trading revenues and revenue per user all fell, which led to its profitability &#8220;taking a beating.&#8221;</p>
<p>If competitor Coinbase &#8220;has seen even a fraction of the downturn that Robinhood has experienced in terms of crypto transaction incomes, it could have a tough quarter,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>Taking a thoughtful, balanced approach to combining organic growth with the booster shot of a merger or acquisition can unlock sustainable growth, writes Progress Partners&#8217; senior managing director, Chris Legg.</p>
<p>He highlights two examples of successful M&amp;A strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outside Inc.&#8217;s aggressive vertical acquisition spree to expand its offerings while entering completely new markets.</li>
<li>Trusted Media Brands&#8217; deal with Jukin Media to diversify its content and increase its advertising base.</li>

<h2>Crafting a pitch deck that can’t be ignored</h2>

<p>To find out what a pitch deck needs to stand out, Managing Editor Danny Crichton hosted a panel at TechCrunch Disrupt featuring Mar Hershenson, the founding MD of Pear VC; Mercedes Bent, a partner at Lightspeed, and Saba Karim, who heads the global startup pipeline at TechStars.</p>
<p>Their chat contains valuable insights into how pitches have evolved over the past year, the VCs&#8217; thought process when reading decks and what founders should focus on if they don&#8217;t want to be ignored.</p>
<p>&#8220;The decks are getting better and better in terms of design,&#8221; said Bent. &#8220;I think more and more people have realized that the visual representation of your deck is just as important as the material and the content that’s in there.</p>
<p>Originality definitely helps an entrepreneur break apart from the crowd, said Karim.</p>
<blockquote><p>The best pitch deck that I got in a different format would be from a company that recently got into TechStars — it was actually a podcast version of their pitch deck that had my face on it. I went into Apple Podcasts and it said, “Hey, Saba, here’s my pitch.” That was amazing! But the second or third time that happens, it might not be as impressive because I’ve seen it before.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve always had an interest in the origin of words: We use &#8220;bellwether&#8221; as a term to describe trendsetters, but it originally referred to a sheep with a bell tied around its neck, which encouraged the rest of the flock to follow.</p>
<p>Similarly, IPO filings offer a glimpse into a company&#8217;s inner workings, but they can also offer insight into prevailing market trends.</p>
<p>Tech-enabled footwear maker Allbirds&#8217; IPO filing serves both purposes quite well, reports Alex Wilhelm: The company expects to debut between $12-$14 per share, which would value it about $2 billion at the upper end of the range — not far from where Rent the Runway debuted at in its IPO this week.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for October 29, 2021. If you feel a little snowed-under after all the news from the week, we understand. This week saw Facebook change its name, new hardware from Google and Samsung, Apple laptops reviews, Sequoia revamping its entire structure, Big Tech earnings, issues at Ro, and eighty-eleven startup funding rounds and product launches.</p>
<p>But we made it through, so let’s go back over today’s biggest news and then get right into this weekend! —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226522" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/cloud-infrastructure-market-hits-180b-run-rate-in-q3-as-even-chip-shortages-cant-slow-it-down/"><strong>Public cloud revenues reach $45B:</strong></a><strong> </strong>In the third quarter, the value of public cloud revenues from Google, Microsoft and Amazon hit $45 billion, a figure good for a $180 billion run rate. That figure underscores how far the cloud has come in recent years and represents spend from a host of companies big and small, tech and otherwise. TechCrunch dug into what impact the chip shortage is, and isn’t, having on growth amongst the public cloud lords, in case you were curious about that particular dynamic.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/mastodon-issues-30-day-ultimatum-to-trumps-social-network-over-misuse-of-its-code/"><strong>Trump’s social network already in trouble:</strong></a> Sure, it was mocked when it was announced. And, yes, pranksters got busy in a hurry. But the biggest threat to former U.S. President Trump’s Truth Social product is an open source project that you’ve not heard from in some time, namely Mastodon. Per TechCrunch, the social project “alleges that Truth Social is passing open source software off as its own and has given them 30 days to fix this.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/since-big-tech-came-to-denver-investors-cant-buy-enough-local-startups/"><strong>The American heartland is startup-central:</strong></a> After our look into the larger Midwest startup market in the United States, TechCrunch took the time today to parse results from the city of Denver. Along with regional siblings, startups in the Mile High City are raising huge amounts of capital. But what we learned is that Denver’s startup boom came after a long period of investments in its local technology scene from the industry’s biggest players.</li>
<li>And, for something lighter, <strong>Google’s partnership with Jio to create and sell a budget smartphone in India</strong> is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/google-and-jios-smartphone-with-custom-android-os-for-india-launches-november-4-for-87/">bearing hardware fruit</a>.</li>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/kurly-the-korean-online-grocery-startup-says-it-plans-ipo-in-june-at-estimated-5-9b-valuation/"><strong>Kurly targets $5.9B IPO:</strong></a> Grocery delivery comes in a few forms. There’s the “instant” players, the two-hour delivery crew and then what Kurly is up to in Korea, namely delivering foodstuffs the next day. The slower model hasn’t harmed the unicorn, which intends to list next year at a valuation that could reach nearly six billion dollars.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/will-smith-kevin-durant-and-sean-diddy-combs-invest-in-electric-boat-startup-arc/"><strong>Celebrities back electric boat venture:</strong></a> A bit like how venture capitalists will keep backing email startups in hopes of eventually solving their personal communications crisis, a number of celebrities are backing Arc, which makes a very snazzy, if expensive electric boat. With a price tag around $300,000, it’s not a surprise that well-known celebrities-cum-investors Will Smith, Kevin Durant and Diddy are backing the company given that its product is inside their price range. You and I will have to get by with a Matchbox version.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/patreon-confirms-its-exploring-crypto-as-a-way-for-creators-to-make-money/"><strong>Patreon wants to say yes to crypto:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Creator payments and content platform Patreon may get in on the crypto boom. TechCrunch repots that the company is looking into how crypto might intersect with its creator-heavy user base.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/social-chat-launches-with-6m-to-bring-brands-closer-to-their-customers/"><strong>Social Chat bets consumers want higher-touch digital shopping experiences:</strong></a> Personally one of the best things about online shopping is not having to talk to other humans. However, many consumers disagree, Social Chat appears to be arguing. The company just raised $6 million to help make online shopping more like buying stuff IRL.</li>
<li>And in case you want to know which three funding rounds <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">the Equity crew</a> thought were the hottest of the week, well, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/the-new-alchemy-is-turning-gold-to-crypto/">we have your back</a>.</li>

<h2>Predicting the next wave of Southeast Asia tech giants</h2>
<p>Is Southeast Asia about to hit an inflection point for tech startups?</p>
<p>Four hundred million people in the region already use the internet, but by year&#8217;s end, one estimate suggests that 80% of the population over the age of 15 in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam will be digital consumers.</p>
<p>&#8220;As per Jungle Ventures’ calculations, the total value of the region’s digital companies is around $340 billion today and is estimated to grow to $1 trillion by 2025,&#8221; says founding partner Amit Anand.</p>
<p>E-commerce, fintechs and the rapid digitization of the region&#8217;s SME workforce are a few of the factors reshaping the landscape for Southeast Asia&#8217;s startups, but supply chain technology is also a major opportunity, Anand says.</p>
<p>&#8220;With new deals and intentions to list in the U.S. being announced more frequently, the region shows no sign of slowing down and the birth of many more unicorns is on the horizon.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The global help desk automation industry is expected to grow to <a href="https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/helpdesk-automation-market-4709">$11 billion by 2023</a> as support automation empowers companies to serve their customers more effectively. By automating repetitive tasks and FAQs, companies give employees more time to spend on more human tasks that involve building relationships and generating revenue.</p>
<p>Customers are also increasingly valuing self-service options. Chatbots allow customers to quickly address concerns at any time of the day without needing to pick up the phone. However, adding a human touch to that process will always be helpful.</p>
<p>Consider these three ways to humanize your support automation.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Your chatbot will feel more human if its responses are thoughtful rather than robotic.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Give your bot a name and personality in line with your brand</h2>
<p>Your bot is an extension of your company and is likely to be the first interaction a customer will have on your website or app. Use this opportunity to showcase the qualities your customers want to encounter. Design the chatbot to introduce itself with a memorable name that fits into your brand. Consider the voice your company uses across channels and incorporate the tone into your chatbot’s scripting. Feel free to include jokes or emojis — but only if they are consistent with the voice of your brand.</p>
<p>Your chatbot will feel more human if its responses are thoughtful rather than robotic. An AI-powered chatbot can ask more open-ended questions, which frees the user from the restraints of a few generic options. Your bot should use the customer’s name in conversation and explain if it’s searching for an answer or needs additional details to make the conversation feel more natural. Creating that comfortable dialogue will humanize your chatbot and separate it from the crowd.</p>
<p>Your bot’s personality should include the ability to react to written expressions of emotion. It should ask clarifying questions and confirm the details of a customer’s problem or question. Such guided conversations help a customer feel heard and understood. A natural-sounding diction and a personality that matches your brand will keep customers and potential customers from closing the tab.</p>
<h2>Connect to a knowledgeable human for help</h2>
<p>For a chatbot to be effective, it&#8217;s important that it asks follow-up questions and respond in thoughtful ways, but it should also be able to escalate a problem to a human expert. A chatbot that’s a dead end is not a true solution. When a customer thinks you’ve replaced traditional, human customer service with an inadequate substitute, they’ll feel undervalued.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A day after Facebook’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">rebranding as Meta</a> (and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-errr-meta-unceremoniously-kills-off-oculus-brand/">simultaneous and unceremonious dropping</a> of the Oculus brand), the company announced that it is acquiring Within. The Los Angeles firm is the developer of Supernatural, a Beat Saber-style workout app, Supernatural has been one of the real success stories in virtual reality fitness, with movement-based high-impact cardio exercises.</p>
<p>It’s a sensible acquisition as the company looks to broaden its VR and other ambitions into a kind of metaverse. Supernatural was also, no doubt, a particularly hot commodity over the past year and a half as more people have looked at home solutions amid widespread gym closures and other workout constraints.</p>
<p>“We are excited because our partnership with Meta means we will have more resources to expand and bring you even more music, more creative ways to workout, more features and more social experiences for VR. And of course, we will still be launching new workouts every single day,” Within CEO Chris Milk and Head of Fitness Leanne Pedante wrote in a <a href="https://cdn.getsupernatural.com/images/Leanne_Letter_v7_Mobile.png">blog</a> post.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226577" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company adds that its existing staff of coaches, choreographers and managers will remain on board after the acquisition. Supernatural will operate as part of Meta’s Reality Labs division.</p>
<p>“Together we will also explore ways we can enhance future hardware to support VR fitness apps, encouraging other developers to bring new fitness experiences to VR,” Meta’s VP of Play Jason Rubin wrote in a separate <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/within-to-join-meta/">post</a>. “We believe fitness will be a massive success in VR where multiple third party fitness apps can succeed.</p>
<p>Founded in 2015, Within has raised in excess of $50 million, including, <a href="https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/chris-milk-within-40-million-series-b-1202507040/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recently a $40 million Series B</a> back in 2017. That round was led by Temasek and Emerson Collective. Other investors include Andreessen Horowitz, 21st Century Fox, Raine Ventures, WPP and Macro Ventures.</p>
<p>Financial details of the acquisition have not been disclosed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[The Udemy IPO might seem like good news. After all, the company sold more than $420 million worth of its stock while going public at a price that surpassed its final private-market price. And yet.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Edtech unicorn Udemy <a href="https://investors.udemy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/udemy-announces-pricing-initial-public-offering">priced its IPO</a> at $29 per share, the upper end of its IPO range. Using a simple share count, the company was worth around $4 billion at its IPO price and a few hundred million more if a full -diluted share count is employed in our valuation calculations.</p>
<p>For edtech, the Udemy IPO might seem like good news. After all, the company sold more than $420 million worth of its stock while going public at a price that surpassed its final private-market price. And yet.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Ultimately, a disappointing debut is never a perfect indicator of a company’s long-term success.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In trading today, shares of Udemy declined $1.80 per share as of the time of writing, just over 6%. As far as IPO results go, that’s not the sort of opening day CEOs dream of.</p>
<p>Investors, either.</p>
<p>After tracking the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/udemy-files-to-go-public-on-back-of-growing-b2b-incomes/">company’s financial evolution</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/udemy-targets-valuation-of-4b-in-major-edtech-ipo/">its pricing in some detail</a>, this afternoon we wanted to offer a few observations regarding the final accounting of the Udemy IPO as it has been written thus far.</p>
<h2>Shifting to business sales isn’t a panacea</h2>
<p>Inclusive of its trading declines, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/update-2-online-learning-firm-udemy-valued-at-2437-bln-in-tepid-market-debut/ar-AAQ6ufo">Reuters pegs</a> the Udemy&#8217;s value at $3.7 billion. Recall that based on its own estimates, Udemy had revenues between $125.7 million and $130.9 million in the third quarter. That figure puts Udemy on a run rate of $523.6 million. Or, in multiples terms, Udemy is worth 7x its present revenues.</p>
<p>For software companies that sell to other businesses, that’s far lower than we’d usually see. The company’s somewhat flat revenues in 2021 compared to 2020 are likely to blame for why that number is so low compared to SaaS norms. But muted growth expectations for coming years are also a factor — and edtech in a post-pandemic context, at least from an investor mindset perspective, may be at play.</p>
<p>So, sure, it’s good that Udemy is shifting to selling to stickier, and likely more lucrative corporations, but until that proves to unlock net revenue growth, the company’s valuation appears ready to hold fast in second gear.</p>
<h2>Private-market edtech valuations may have plateaued</h2>
<p><a href="http://crunchbase.com">Crunchbase</a> pegs the final Udemy private-market price at $3.25 billion. <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook</a> has it down to $3.3 billion. Regardless, the company did manage to surpass its final private price. But only by so much.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon disclosed Friday that it owns a 20% stake in Rivian, the electric automaker that filed for an IPO earlier this month.</p>
<p>As of September 30, the e-commerce giant held equity investments, including preferred stock of Rivian that represented about 20% ownership interest, according to the filing. That holding had a &#8220;carrying value&#8221; of $3.8 billion, up from $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2020.</p>
<p>The disclosure, which popped up in a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001018724/000101872421000028/amzn-20210930.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regulatory filing</a>, provides fresh insight into how closely Rivian&#8217;s future is tied to Amazon. Amazon has invested $1.345 billion into Rivian, according to the EV maker&#8217;s initial public offering. Amazon also recently purchased $490 million worth of convertible notes in Rivian that will convert to Class A shares after the IPO, pursuant to certain pricing provisions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226557" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Amazon is not only an investor in Rivian; it&#8217;s also a customer. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In September 2019, Rivian entered into an agreement with Amazon to produce 100,000 electric delivery vans. Rivian disclosed earlier this month that it e</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">xpects to deliver at least 10 vehicles in the month of December 2021. All of the vans (that would be the remaining 99,990) will be delivered by 2025.</span></p>
<p>When Rivian&#8217;s initial public offering filing first dropped it was clear that Amazon was a big part of Rivian&#8217;s universe. For instance, there are 81 mentions of Amazon in the Rivian S-1 filing, a high number due to Amazon&#8217;s dual status as investor and customer.</p>
<p>At the time, it seemed that Amazon owned at least 5% of Rivian, though that final number was not yet available. The disclosure from Amazon shows that its stake is far larger.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/7-takeaways-from-rivians-ipo-filing/">TechCrunch has noted before</a>, the company&#8217;s strong connection to Amazon is both a boon and a risk. Per Rivian&#8217;s S-1&#8217;s risk-factor section:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>We expect that a significant portion of our initial revenue will be from one customer that is an affiliate of one of our principal stockholders. If we are unable to maintain this relationship, or if this customer purchases significantly fewer vehicles than we currently anticipate or none at all, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.</p></blockquote>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Buy now, pay later (BNPL) is an old form of payment that is new again in a big way. And that could mean trouble for BNPL fintechs that are just getting to know the world of lending and the pitfalls associated with traditional banking infrastructure.</p>
<p>Recent data from FIS — one of several payment processors — pegs BNPL at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/21/how-buy-now-pay-later-became-a-100-billion-industry.html">a $100 billion industry</a>, or 2.1% of global e-commerce transactions. Marqeta, another processor, says BNPL transactions on its platform have increased 350% this year.</p>
<p>The success of the BNPL format has been attributed to the lift it provides to merchants at checkout and the convenience it offers consumers seeking to avoid interest payments and debit card fees. Last year, <a href="https://dfpi.ca.gov/2021/10/07/dfpi-report-shows-changes-in-consumer-lending-decrease-in-pace-program/">at least 91% of consumer loans</a> in California were BNPL.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			For BNPL providers, switching to modern architecture for loan management and servicing can minimize third-party merchant risk.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>According to Klarna, one of the largest BNPL providers, the average order value at checkout increases by <a href="https://www.klarna.com/us/blog/why-use-buy-now-pay-later-klarna/">as much as 45%</a> when shoppers are given the opportunity to pay for their purchases in four interest-free payments. BNPL is so convenient, compared to old-fashioned installment loans, that consumer advocates worry it encourages people to take on more debt than they can manage.</p>
<p>If that happens, the BNPL providers could get hurt badly during an economic downturn. <a href="https://www.paymentsdive.com/news/the-convenience-of-buy-now-pay-later-creates-risks-fitch/604437/">In a report published</a> in the summer, Fitch Ratings, one of the Big Three U.S. credit rating agencies, described the performance of BNPL debt as “opaque.” The report cited a survey in which nearly one in three respondents (31%) had either been late with a BNPL payment or incurred a late fee.</p>
<p>But the other side of BNPL is not just consumer credit risk, which BNPL providers say they can manage with non-traditional, data-driven underwriting. BNPL providers also face a double whammy of risk on the merchant side.</p>
<p>Three-sided loans, in which a lender relies on a merchant to act as a reseller, became a focus of regulatory scrutiny with the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010.</p>
<p>Dodd-Frank did many things. Among the most influential provisions was the creation of a <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/102012_cfpb_unfair-deceptive-abusive-acts-practices-udaaps_procedures.pdf">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> endowed with the authority to act against any provider of consumer financial products or services who engage in “any unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s nothing like the growing pains of new adulthood, but for college-aged Gen Zers who have spent these formative years in lockdown, it can be even more difficult to form meaningful friendships. While attending Columbia University remotely during the pandemic, first-generation college student Jamie Lee realized how this isolation was affecting her peers, especially those who would travel to school for their sophomore or junior years without having met any classmates in person yet.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Since I had first downloaded Instagram in middle school, I&#8217;ve always just been presenting myself online as an individual, but I felt like I was having a lot of anxiety about not presenting myself authentically online,&#8221; Lee told TechCrunch. &#8220;I wanted to lean into that idea of, okay, how can we find a way to connect people authentically? And I thought the best way to do that would be with our friends, who we&#8217;re most authentic around.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p>In summer 2020, Lee launched a no-code beta test for <a href="https://www.downtoflox.com/">Flox</a>, an idea for an app that would help people meet. It&#8217;s like Tinder, Hinge or Bumble, where you create a profile and match with others, only you&#8217;re signing up as a group and connecting with other groups of friends.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225684" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;People gave me feedback that it was the most fun they&#8217;d had online in forever, so that was my turning point where I was like, this could be something super serious, and I knew that it was now or never,&#8221; Lee said.</p>
<p>So, she dropped out of Columbia with just a year left of school to charge full-speed ahead on the app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2226503" style="width: 322px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226503" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2226503" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-22-at-7.09.31-PM.png?w=312" alt="Screenshot of Flox app" width="312" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-22-at-7.09.31-PM.png 818w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-22-at-7.09.31-PM.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-22-at-7.09.31-PM.png?resize=138,300 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-22-at-7.09.31-PM.png?resize=768,1671 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-22-at-7.09.31-PM.png?resize=312,680 312w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-22-at-7.09.31-PM.png?resize=706,1536 706w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-22-at-7.09.31-PM.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2226503" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Flox</p></div></p>
<p>In February 2021, Lee and two full-time engineers &#8212; the extent of her team &#8212; conducted an alpha test with around 250 users, which then developed into a private beta test exclusively in New York City for undergrads and recent graduates. By now, their waitlist has over 20,000 users, but Lee says in the next month or so, Flox will begin opening up to college-aged New Yorkers on the waitlist before expanding to other cities later on. Plus, Flox just closed a $1.2 million funding round led by Honeycomb Asset Management, with BBG Ventures and Banana Capital participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not gonna lie, raising my first round was incredibly difficult. I&#8217;m Puerto Rican and Chinese, I was 21 at the time, I never had any background in this, and I had just like, dropped out of Columbia,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;Going into these conversations, I think people definitely had opinions formed about me before the conversation began. I was told in a pitch meeting to be more like Zuck.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a founder developing a platform for people in her own age group, Lee is smart about how she markets the app &#8212; she wants to make it feel authentic. So, she&#8217;s met her audience where they are on TikTok, posting promotional videos about the app that have gone viral, garnering about 1.8 million views over three posts.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t even go to the bathroom alone,&#8221; Lee says in <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jamietylerlee/video/6902236596750404870?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">one TikTok</a>. &#8220;So why are you on these dating apps alone?&#8221;</p>

<p> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script></div>
<p>Flox isn&#8217;t the first app to try group-based social networking &#8212; Tinder had this idea with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/27/oops-tinders-new-friend-finding-feature-tinder-social-is-outing-which-of-your-friends-use-the-app/">Tinder Social</a>, a feature that let you join groups with your friends and match with other groups. But the feature was <a href="https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005734383-Tinder-Social-#:~:text=Tinder%20Social%20was%20discontinued%20in,for%20our%20community%20of%20members.">discontinued</a> a little over a year after a rocky launch in 2016, when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/27/oops-tinders-new-friend-finding-feature-tinder-social-is-outing-which-of-your-friends-use-the-app/">accidentally</a> revealed who in your contacts had a Tinder profile. Lee said that she thinks Tinder Social didn&#8217;t work because Tinder had already branded itself as a dating (or hookup) app &#8212; and since you only had one profile, you&#8217;d be showing the same version of yourself to potential friends and potential dates.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to move away from the focus on the individual, because I think that points to dating,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;We want to really lean into the group identity, so you might see a flock called &#8216;apartment 11,&#8217; and then you would see who makes up the group, rather than, here are these individuals who form the group. It&#8217;s reversing what&#8217;s emphasized.&#8221; While the focus is on meeting new people, Lee hopes that friends who make a Flox group (a Flock) together will be brought closer too.</p>
<p>Even though Bumble started as a dating app too, it also now has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/18/bumble-now-lets-you-filter-potential-matches-on-bumble-date-bizz-and-bff/">modes</a> for making friends and finding business partners. Lee cites Bumble BFF as an inspiration for Flox, but she said that when she used the app, it seemed like most people said they were looking for roommates, rather than looking to make new friends.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2226504" style="width: 323px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226504" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2226504 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-21-at-9.29.13-AM-1.png?w=313" alt="Flox app screenshot" width="313" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-21-at-9.29.13-AM-1.png 812w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-21-at-9.29.13-AM-1.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-21-at-9.29.13-AM-1.png?resize=138,300 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-21-at-9.29.13-AM-1.png?resize=768,1667 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-21-at-9.29.13-AM-1.png?resize=313,680 313w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-21-at-9.29.13-AM-1.png?resize=708,1536 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-21-at-9.29.13-AM-1.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2226504" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Flox</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Gen Z is the most lonely, anxious, depressed generation, and there&#8217;s so many people who need friends,&#8221; said Lee. &#8220;But there&#8217;s a social stigma that [using one-on-one friendship apps] carries with it. Unfortunately, oftentimes, when you&#8217;re looking for friends one-on-one, what that implies to the other person, or to anyone who might know that you&#8217;re on Bumble BFF, is that you don&#8217;t have any friends, and that doesn&#8217;t really put you in a desirable position. So our goal with Flox is also to make it way more comfortable, safe and fun, removing that social stigma behind friend finding.&#8221;</p>
<p>The app hinges on Lee&#8217;s hypothesis that people are most comfortable meeting new people when their existing friends have their back. But the group dynamic adds a built-in layer of safety. Even though Flox isn&#8217;t a dating app, Lee knows that some people are going to use it for that purpose &#8212; but meeting new people in groups can help mitigate the risks inherent in meeting strangers one-on-one.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a really bad experience on a dating app when I was in the city a couple of years ago, and I remember reporting the incident, and nothing was followed up on, and I just didn&#8217;t feel protected on that platform,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;One of the first conversations I had with users last year was people said, &#8216;I&#8217;m not comfortable meeting up with other people on dating apps, because I feel unsafe one-on-one.&#8217; So we really want to give people this more comfortable, safe environment to meet people.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Flox&#8217;s recent seed round, Lee hopes to continue building out the app and letting more and more users in &#8212; but she wants to take it slow to make sure that the experience remains positive and authentic for existing users.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The toughest questions most entrepreneurs face will involve international expansion. Whether to, when to, where to and how to expand all involve a wealth of complex considerations. The stakes are high: Success could mean the creation of a global multimillion-dollar business, whereas failure can often be fatal to a startup&#8217;s long-term viability.</p>
<p>Luckily, international expansion doesn’t have to be a blind gamble. With the right research and strategy combined with knowledge of the most common pitfalls, founders can mitigate a lot of risk and give their startup the best chance to succeed.</p>
<p>Naturally, many of the factors that we need to explore vary considerably between tech verticals. For ease, we will concentrate on midsized startups that sell directly to consumers. However, don’t be disheartened if you operate a B2B startup, as the approach I will outline may broadly apply to your business, too.</p>
<h2>Go big by staying home</h2>
<p>A mistake we often encounter is that businesses see expansion as a goal in itself rather than a move necessary to fulfill a clearly defined commercial strategy. There can be a tendency to rush the process without doing all the objective reflection needed. It’s important to ask yourself, with the risk involved, if international expansion is the only way to realize your dreams for your business. If so, are you really ready?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			It may be that through luck or ingenuity, your business has thrived in your home country with minimal marketing spend, but there is absolutely no guarantee this will happen abroad.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In relation to being &#8220;ready,&#8221; the most successful consumer businesses use their home market to refine their product offering, build their team and infrastructure, and critically, learn to adapt their business per shifting consumer expectations and demand. It is generally much cheaper to gain experience and make your mistakes at home rather than abroad. If, after mulling these questions over, you’re ready to roll, great! Where should you go?</p>
<h2>Start with the simple questions</h2>
<p>There is absolutely no substitute for research, and you can never do enough. You&#8217;ll first need to gather data points from your existing customer base. In an ideal world, a percentage of sales would already come from international clients, and this information may, on the face of it, point to potential demand in a particular region.</p>
<p>However, this is by no means definitive. Sales may be concentrated in a particular country simply because of the language your website is in or, if you&#8217;re selling via a third-party platform, due to where that customer base is. Pay attention to the customer journey and how interest has fluctuated over time. Flat demand or outlying surges could indicate a ceiling in that market or an extraneous factor that has skewed the data.</p>
<p>The next step is to shortlist locations. Countries with a similar time zone, commercial culture, language, and legal and regulatory framework should be at the top of the list.</p>
