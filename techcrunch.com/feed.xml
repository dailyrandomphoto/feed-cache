<h2>the big thing</h2>
<p>In the past month, Apple did something it generally has done an exceptional job avoiding &#8212; the company made what seemed to be an entirely unforced error.</p>
<p>In early August &#8212; seemingly out of nowhere** &#8212; the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/">announced</a> that by the end of the year they would be rolling out a technology called NeuralHash that actively scanned the libraries of all iCloud Photos users, seeking out image hashes that matched known images of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). For obvious reasons, the on-device scanning could not be opted out of.</p>
<p>This announcement was not coordinated with other major consumer tech giants, Apple pushed forward on the announcement alone.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="MJTxDcbf0v"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/">Apple confirms it will begin scanning iCloud Photos for child abuse images</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple confirms it will begin scanning iCloud Photos for child abuse images&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/embed/#?secret=MJTxDcbf0v" data-secret="MJTxDcbf0v" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Researchers and advocacy groups had almost unilaterally negative feedback for the effort, raising concerns that this could create new abuse channels for actors like governments to detect on-device information that they regarded as objectionable. As my colleague Zach noted in a recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/apple-csam-detection-delayed/">story</a>, &#8220;The Electronic Frontier Foundation said this week it had amassed more than 25,000 signatures from consumers. On top of that, close to 100 policy and rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, also <a href="https://cdt.org/insights/international-coalition-calls-on-apple-to-abandon-plan-to-build-surveillance-capabilities-into-iphones-ipads-and-other-products/">called</a> on Apple to abandon plans to roll out the technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>(The announcement also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-apples-child-protection-features-spark-concern-within-its-own-ranks-2021-08-12/">reportedly</a> generated some controversy inside of Apple.)</p>
<p>The issue &#8212; of course &#8212; wasn&#8217;t that Apple was looking at find ways that prevented the proliferation of CSAM while making as few device security concessions as possible. The issue was that Apple was unilaterally making a massive choice that would affect billions of customers (while likely pushing competitors towards similar solutions), and was doing so without external public input about possible ramifications or necessary safeguards.</p>
<p>A long story short, over the past month researchers discovered Apple&#8217;s NeuralHash wasn&#8217;t as air tight as hoped and the company announced Friday that it was delaying the rollout &#8220;to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features.”</p>
<p>Having spent several years in the tech media, I will say that the only reason to release news on a Friday morning ahead of a long weekend is to ensure that the announcement is read and seen by as few people as possible, and it&#8217;s clear why they&#8217;d want that. It&#8217;s a major embarrassment for Apple, and as with any delayed rollout like this, it&#8217;s a sign that their internal teams weren&#8217;t adequately prepared and lacked the ideological diversity to gauge the scope of the issue that they were tackling. This isn&#8217;t really a dig at Apple&#8217;s team building this so much as it&#8217;s a dig on Apple trying to solve a problem like this inside the Apple Park vacuum while adhering to its annual iOS release schedule.</p>

<p>Apple is increasingly looking to make privacy a key selling point for the iOS ecosystem, and as a result of this productization, has pushed development of privacy-centric features towards the same secrecy its surface-level design changes command. In June, Apple announced iCloud+ and raised some eyebrows when they shared that certain new privacy-centric features would only be available to iPhone users who paid for additional subscription services.</p>
<p>You obviously can&#8217;t tap public opinion for every product update, but perhaps wide-ranging and trail-blazing security and privacy features should be treated a bit differently than the average product update. Apple&#8217;s lack of engagement with research and advocacy groups on NeuralHash was pretty egregious and certainly raises some questions about whether the company fully respects how the choices they make for iOS affect the broader internet.</p>
<p>Delaying the feature&#8217;s rollout is a good thing, but let&#8217;s all hope they take that time to reflect more broadly as well.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pa1DYvXeDB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/apple-csam-detection-delayed/">Apple delays plans to roll out CSAM detection in iOS 15 after privacy backlash</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple delays plans to roll out CSAM detection in iOS 15 after privacy backlash&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/apple-csam-detection-delayed/embed/#?secret=pa1DYvXeDB" data-secret="pa1DYvXeDB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>** <em>Though the announcement was a surprise to many, Apple&#8217;s development of this feature wasn&#8217;t coming completely out of nowhere. Those at the top of Apple likely felt that the winds of global tech regulation might be shifting towards outright bans of some methods of encryption in some of its biggest markets.</em></p>
<p><em>Back in October of 2020, then United States AG Bill Barr joined representatives from the UK, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, India and Japan in <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-statement-end-end-encryption-and-public-safety">signing a letter</a> raising major concerns about how implementations of encryption tech posed &#8220;significant challenges to public safety, including to highly vulnerable members of our societies like sexually exploited children.&#8221; The letter effectively called on tech industry companies to get creative in how they tackled this problem.</em></p>

<h2>other things</h2>
<p><em>Here are the TechCrunch news stories that especially caught my eye this week:</em></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/linkedin-is-scrapping-its-stories-feature-to-work-on-short-form-video/"><b>LinkedIn kills Stories</b></a><br />
You may be shocked to hear that LinkedIn even had a Stories-like product on their platform, but if you did already know that they were testing Stories, you likely won&#8217;t be so surprised to hear that the test didn&#8217;t pan out too well. The company announced this week that they&#8217;ll be suspending the feature at the end of the month. RIP.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/faa-grounds-virgin-galactic-amidst-investigation-into-july-mission/"><b>FAA grounds Virgin Galactic over questions about Branson flight</b></a><br />
While all appeared to go swimmingly for Richard Branson&#8217;s trip to space last month, the FAA has some questions regarding why the flight seemed to unexpectedly veer so far off the cleared route. The FAA is preventing the company from further launches until they find out what the deal is.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/apple-buys-classical-music-service-primephonic/">Apple buys a classical music streaming service</a><br />
</b>While Spotify makes news every month or two for spending a massive amount acquiring a popular podcast, Apple seems to have eyes on a different market for Apple Music, announcing this week that they&#8217;re bringing the classical music streaming service Primephonic onto the Apple Music team.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/tiktok-owner-bytedance-buys-a-top-virtual-reality-hardware-company/"><b>TikTok parent company buys a VR startup</b></a><br />
It isn&#8217;t a huge secret that ByteDance and Facebook have been trying to copy each other&#8217;s success at times, but many probably weren&#8217;t expecting TikTok&#8217;s parent company to wander into the virtual reality game. The Chinese company bought the startup Pico which makes consumer VR headsets for China and enterprise VR products for North American customers.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-safety-mode-harassment/"><b>Twitter tests an anti-abuse &#8216;Safety Mode&#8217;</b></a><br />
The same features that make Twitter an incredibly cool product for some users can also make the experience awful for others, a realization that Twitter has seemingly been very slow to make. Their latest solution is more individual user controls, which Twitter is testing out with a new &#8220;safety mode&#8221; which pairs algorithmic intelligence with new user inputs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Along with a cadre of other TechCrunch folks, I spent this week extremely focused on one event: Y Combinator.

</ul>
<p>There’s something quite earnest and magical about spending literally hours hearing founder after founder pitch their ideas, with one minute, a single slide and a whole lot of optimism. It’s why I like covering demo days: I get tunnel vision into where innovation is going next, what behemoths are ripe for disruption and what founders think is a witty competitive edge versus a simple baseline.</p>
<p>That said, I will share one caveat. While YC is an ambitious snapshot, it’s not entirely illustrative of the next wave of decision-makers and leaders within startups — from a diversity perspective. <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1432740992805834757">The accelerator posted small gains</a> in the number of women and LatinX founders in its batch, but dropped in the number of Black founders participating. The need for more diverse accelerators has never been more obvious, and as some in the tech community argue, is Y Combinator’s biggest blind spot.</p>
<p>This in mind, I want to leave you with a few takeaways I had after listening to hundreds of pitches. Here’s what 377 Y Combinator pitches taught me about startups:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Instacart walked so YC startups could stroll. </strong>Instacart, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/instacart-raises-265m-at-a-39b-valuation/">last valued at $39 billion</a></strong>, is one of Y Combinator’s most successful graduates — which makes it even more spicier that a number of startups within this summer’s batch want to take on the behemoth. Instead of going after the obvious — speed — startups are looking to enhance the grocery delivery experience through premium produce, local recipes and even ugly vegetables. It suggests that there may be a new chapter in grocery delivery, one in which ease isn’t the only competitive advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto’s pre-seed world is quieter than fintech. </strong>YC feels more like a fintech accelerator than ever before, but when it comes to crypto, there weren’t as many moonshots as I’d expect. <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/y-combinator-s-21-equity/">We discussed this a bit in the Equity podcast, </a></strong>but if anyone has theories as to why, I’m game to hear ‘em.</li>
<li><strong>Edtech wants to disrupt artsy subjects. </strong>It’s common to see edtech founders flock to subjects like science and mathematics when it comes to disruption. Why? Well, from a pure pedagogical perspective, it’s easier to scale a service that answers questions that only have one right answer. While math may fit into a box that works for a tech-powered AI tutoring bot, arts, on the other hand, may require a little bit more human touch. This is why I was excited to see a number of edtech startups, from Spark Studio to Litnerd, focusing on humanities in their pitches. As shocking as it sounds, to rethink how a bookclub is read is definitely a refreshing milestone for edtech.</li>
<li><strong>Sometimes, the best pitch is no pitch at all. </strong>One pitch stood out simply because it addressed the elephant in the room: We’re all stressed. Jupe sells glamping-in-a-box and the profitable business likely benefited from COVID-19. I remember that because the founder used a portion of his pitch to tell investors to breathe, because it’s been a long two days. Being human, and more importantly, speaking like one, is what it takes to stand out these days.</li>
</ol>
<p>On that note, exhale. Let’s move on to the rest of this newsletter, which includes nostalgic nods to Wall Street, public filings and my favorite new podcast.

<h2>A return to old school Wall Street</h2>

<p>With so many new funds, solo-GPs and alternative capital sources on the market these days, founders are confused. Funding may have moved away from three dudes on Sand Hill Road, but it’s also become more fragmented, which means entrepreneurs need to be even more sophisticated in how they fill up their cap tables. This week, I interviewed one recently venture-backed startup that proposed a solution: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/hum-capital-thinks-the-future-of-funding-is-a-return-to-old-school-wall-street/">a return to old school Wall Street. </a></p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>Hum Capital wants to help investors allocate their resources to ambitious businesses, perfectly. The startup seeks to emulate the world of old school Wall Street, which helped ambitious business owners find the best financing option for their goal, instead of today’s dance of startups trying to prove worthiness for one type of capital. In my story, I explained more about the business.</p>
<p>At this stage,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/hum-capital-thinks-the-future-of-funding-is-a-return-to-old-school-wall-street/"> Hum Capital’s product is easy to explain</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It uses artificial intelligence and data to connect businesses to the available funders on the platform. The startup connects with a capital-hungry startup, ingests financial data from over 100 SaaS systems, including QuickBooks, NetSuite and Google Analytics, and then translates them to the some 250 institutional investors on its platform.</p></blockquote>

<p>When the pandemic began to impact startups, Toast was top of the list. The restaurant tech startup had a series of deep layoffs as many of its clients in the hospitality industry had to shut down. Months later, Toast reentered headlines with a dramatically different message: It’s going public, and here’s all of our financial data.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what you need to know:</strong> This week, Toast published its S-1, offering a portrait into how the startup was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and answering questions on why it&#8217;s going public now. After ripping apart the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/d2c-specs-purveyor-warby-parker-files-to-go-public/">Warby Parker S-1</a>, Alex had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/5-takeaways-from-toasts-s-1-filing/">five takeaways from the Toast S-1</a>. My favorite excerpt? Toast was smart to diversify beyond its hardware, hand-held payment processors:</p>
<blockquote><p>Toast’s two largest revenue sources — software and fintech incomes — have posted constant growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Hardware revenues have proved slightly less consistent, although they are also moving in a positive direction this year and set what appears to be an all-time record result in Q2 2021.</p>
<p>Toast would have had a much worse second quarter last year if it didn’t have software revenues. And since then, its growth would not have been as impressive without payments revenues (its fintech line item, speaking loosely). The broad revenue mix that Toast built has proved to limit downside while opening lots of room for growth.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions&#8230; and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too!</p>

<h3>Apple settles another App Store antitrust case&#8230;but it&#8217;s still winning the war with developers</h3>

<p>Another day, another App Store settlement <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/japan-fair-trade-commission-closes-app-store-investigation/">announced</a> late at night in the hopes that reporters will miss it. (Apparently, publishing press releases after 8 PM ET is a good time to try to hide the news, huh?)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>PR theatrics aside, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apple-announced-new-settlement-with-japan-allowing-developers-to-link-to-external-website/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">this week&#8217;s settlement</a> is only a minor concession on Apple&#8217;s part that its aggressive anti-steering guidelines could be considered anticompetitive. The company said it reached a settlement with Japanese regulator, the Japan Fair Trade Commission (<a href="https://www.jftc.go.jp/en/pressreleases/yearly-2021/September/210902.html">JFTC</a>), to change its policies for &#8220;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#reader-apps">reader apps</a>&#8221; that would allow them to point users to their own website. <strong>Yes, Apple literally had to be drug through an antitrust investigation to agree to allow a <em>subgroup</em> of developers the ability to <em>add a link to a website</em> inside their app</strong>.</p>

<p>Anyone celebrating this as a major win for developers needs to think again. Apple is still winning this war.</p>
<p>The rule change, which kicks in globally in early 2022, will only apply to &#8220;reader&#8221; apps, Apple says. Reader apps provide access to purchased content, like books or audiobooks, or content subscriptions, like streaming music and video. The rule could also apply to apps that provide access to digital magazines or newspapers. Think: Spotify, Netflix, Kindle and others. Of course, &#8220;reader apps&#8221; is a sort of made-up category <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/what-apples-latest-rules-change-means-for-kindle-nook-and-kobo-e-reader-apps/">Apple invented years ago</a> in hopes of forcing a revenue share, but instead <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/iflow-reader-developer-rages-at-apple-q-a/">forced some smaller apps</a> out of business. But now, having this category allows Apple to make up rules that only apply to a subgroup of apps. That is some forward thinking.</p>
<p>Historically, reader apps that have not wanted to share subscription revenue with Apple (or that got big enough to no longer need the in-app purchase option) have offered only a sign-in form for existing subscribers on the home screen that appears at first launch. Some also don&#8217;t offer any way to buy their content through the app itself, forcing users to figure out how to purchase the content they want through the company&#8217;s website. Now they can finally say, &#8220;here is our website.&#8221; Big whoop, we knew where Netflix.com was.</p>
<p>Overall, the iOS reader app experience from a consumer perspective has been a crappy one. It doesn&#8217;t &#8220;just work,&#8221; it&#8217;s a hassle. It&#8217;s an annoyance.</p>
<p>Now, Apple says these apps will be able to offer users a link to a website that launches inside their app so users can &#8220;set up and manage their account.&#8221; Presumably, that could include entering in payment information &#8212; after all, once the website is open, it would seem users could navigate it freely, right? But Apple hints that it will have specific rules about these links to come, saying the company <em>&#8220;will also help developers of reader apps protect users when they link them to an external website to make purchases.&#8221;</em> (Hopefully, Apple just means something like <em>https</em> is required, not that it&#8217;s planning to tell developers how to design their own websites and payment processing.)</p>
<p>Apple critics largely <a href="https://twitter.com/appfairness/status/1433400429497536514">panned</a> the settlement, saying they want better rules for everyone.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a step in the right direction, but it doesn&#8217;t solve the problem,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/eldsjal/status/1433465642737446917">said</a> Spotify CEO Daniel Ek. &#8220;App developers want clear, fair rules that apply to all apps. Our goal is to restore competition once and for all, not one arbitrary, self-serving step at a time. We will continue to push for a real solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>For whatever reason, Apple appears to want to battle App Store antitrust complaints on a case-by-case basis, instead of just rewriting its rules to even the playing field. That decision seems pretty obstinate, not to mention expensive. But, so far, it&#8217;s working. The changes emerging from these settlements so far (including last week&#8217;s) are the very smallest of updates to App Store guidelines. Apple is ceding very little ground here.</p>
<p>But the fight is far from over. As soon as the JFTC ruling hit, news broke <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-apple-hit-with-antitrust-case-india-over-in-app-payments-issues-2021-09-02/">that Apple is facing another antitrust challenge in India</a> over in-app payments. There are similar cases underway in the EU, too, and U.S. lawmakers have been <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/iflow-reader-developer-rages-at-apple-q-a/">pursuing their own legislation</a>, as well. Time will tell.</p>
<h3>Apple asks users to opt-in to its personalized ads</h3>
<p>Does this seem fair?</p>
<p>Today, developers have to show their users a pop-up box that asks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">if they can track their users</a>, with options like &#8220;Ask App not to Track&#8221; or &#8220;Allow.&#8221; Most users <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/96-of-us-users-opt-out-of-app-tracking-in-ios-14-5-analytics-find/">decline</a> tracking. After Apple introduced this new policy, aka App Tracking Transparency (ATT), there was some pushback around the fact that Apple didn&#8217;t have to follow its own rules &#8212; even though it had an ads business of its own where personalized ads were switched on by default.</p>
<p>While Apple, to be clear, is only sharing its data in-house &#8212; and not, say, with a third-party data broker &#8212; it also was doing so without any sort of opt-out screen presented to users who would prefer that data wasn&#8217;t gathered by <em>anyone</em>, you know, <em>at all. </em></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197801" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197801" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2197801" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-4.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-4.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-4.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-4.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-4.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-4.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-4.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-4.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-4.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197801" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> iOS 15 screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>Now, things are changing. In iOS 15, Apple has begun popping up a message that allows users to turn off personalized ads in the App Store and other Apple apps. But wow, does it have a lot of screen space to make its case. Not only does Apple explain the many ways its personalized ads are beneficial to users, it also says its ad platform &#8220;does not track you&#8221; because it doesn&#8217;t link the data it collects with other data, nor does it share any personally identifiable information with third parties.</p>
<p>But there is an argument to be made here that Apple&#8217;s distinction between data-gathering across a set of first-party apps (Apple News, App Store and Stocks) and what it calls &#8220;tracking&#8221; &#8212; where app data is shared externally, or combined with others &#8212; is a line in the sand that is not only about Apple&#8217;s user privacy mission, but also about harming other ad-dependent businesses (like Facebook&#8217;s, naturally) in order to boost its own.</p>

<h3>Apple updates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple delays plans to roll out CSAM detection in iOS 15.</strong> Apple says <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/apple-csam-detection-delayed/">it will delay its CSAM detection tech</a> in light of the feedback from customers and policy groups. While everyone agrees that a system to discover and report CSAM is overall a good thing, critics are concerned about how the system itself was built. They&#8217;re worried that it could be abused by authoritarian governments in the future, who would use it to implicate innocent victims or to detect non-CSAM materials they find objectionable. (China comes to mind here.) Apple says it will now take the time to make improvements before releasing these &#8220;critically important child safety features.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Apple&#8217;s Wallet app will soon be able to hold your ID.</strong> The company said it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apple-digital-licenses-privacy/">now secured two states</a>, Arizona and Georgia, to bring digital driver’s license and state IDs to the app. Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma and Utah are expected to follow. The TSA will allow you to present your digital wallet by tapping it on an identity reader, similar to how Apple Pay works.</li>

A <a href="https://accounts.wsj.com/auth/sso/login?code=OIlWDPkp_4Hs0z7Y&amp;state=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Ffacebooks-whatsapp-fined-around-270-million-for-eu-privacy-violations-11630576800%3Fmod%3Drss_Technology&amp;savelogin=on">WhatsApp spokesperson said</a> the decision would be appealed.</li>
<li><strong>The grace period for compliance with the Age Appropriate Design Code (aka the &#8220;Children&#8217;s Code&#8221;) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/uk-now-expects-compliance-with-its-child-privacy-design-code/">has ended</a>.</strong> App makers offering digital services that are likely to be accessed by children now need to ensure that a high level of privacy is applied by default to users&#8217; accounts, and geolocation and profiling should be off by default. The code also says app makers should provide parental controls while kids receive age-appropriate information about those tools. &#8220;Dark patterns&#8221; are also now forbidden.</li>

SpyFone secretly gathered data on people&#8217;s physical movements, phone use and online activities. The company will also be required to notify victims where the app had been installed on their devices.</li>

<p>Clay is a new cross-platform app (web, mobile and desktop) that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/clay-debuts-a-new-tool-to-help-people-better-manage-their-business-and-personal-relationships/">allows you to better manage your relationships</a>, both business and personal. The service is something of a consumer-grade CRM. That is, it&#8217;s not about a sales pipeline, it&#8217;s about better recalling who you met, how and when, and other important details. This information can be useful to you ahead of meetings and other networking events, business appointments or many other situations. The system is designed to be flexible enough that it can work for a variety of use cases &#8212; so far, it&#8217;s been used by teachers, veterinarians, political candidates and others. The company, backed by $8 million in seed funding, is encrypting data, but ultimately plans to allow the data to be housed locally on users&#8217; machines, more like the Apple model. The app, however, is pricey &#8212; it&#8217;s $20/month for the time being, but the company hopes to bring that down to a freemium model over time.</p>

<p>A startup called <a href="https://www.playbyte.io/">Playbyte</a> wants to become the TikTok for games. The company’s newly launched <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/playbyte/id1551822717">iOS app</a> offers tools that allow users to make and share simple games on their phone, as well as a vertically scrollable, full-screen feed where you can play the games created by others. Also like TikTok, the feed becomes more personalized over time to serve up more of the kinds of games you like to play. At its core, Playbyte’s game creation is powered by its lightweight 2D game engine built on web frameworks, which lets users create games that can be quickly loaded and played even on slow connections and older devices. After you play a game, you can like and comment using buttons on the right side of the screen, which also greatly resembles the TikTok look-and-feel.</p>
<p>At launch, users have already made a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@team_playbyte?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">variety of games</a> using Playbyte’s tools — including simulators, tower defense games, combat challenges, obbys, murder mystery games and more. The app is a free download on iOS.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by what the weekday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">Exchange column</a> digs into, but free, and made for your weekend reading. Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>Hey team! Alex here. I am off next week. Anna, my regular co-pilot on the weekday column, will be handling next week’s newsletter. It will be beyond good. Enjoy!</em></p>
<p>A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/21/tracking-startup-growth-rates/">few weeks back</a> we took a look at some startup results, with a focus on growth. Today we’re narrowing our focus to a single company from the collection of startups that wrote in: <a href="https://www.watercoolertrivia.com/">Water Cooler Trivia</a>.</p>
<p>Many startups begin life as a solution to a problem. A developer finds a flaw in their workflow, codes up a solution for it and later builds that hack into a product that scales. That sort of thing.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/cowllin">Collin Waldoch</a> did something different, turning a hobby of his into a business.</p>
<p>Coming from a family of six kids in what he called a competitive family, Waldoch hosted bar trivia during college, and later sent around weekly trivia questions at his workplace after he completed his schooling. He kept the habit up during his early career, which included a stint at Lyft.</p>
<p>It was during his corporate life that Waldoch realized that companies were willing to spend heavily on team activities. Like a soccer team that he joined during one job that his employer spent a few grand on, but which struggled to find enough regular players. If companies would drop that much money on a group sport that few of its denizens wanted, he thought, perhaps there was some budget he could attack with a trivia product.</p>
<p>So Waldoch started Water Cooler Trivia, building it as a corporate product that he and some friends scaled to around $20,000 in ARR as a side project. The founder described its level of success at the time as pretty good beer money. Helping the project bring in revenue was a super-low churn rate, something that helped Waldoch decide to quit his day job at Lyft and take his side project full time.</p>
<p>Today Water Cooler Trivia has reached $300,000 worth of ARR and sports a collection of workers around the globe that help it run. Companies can select difficulty levels for their weekly trivia questions and track employee scores with longitudinal leaderboards.</p>
<p>Part of the idea’s success in Waldoch’s view is that it is built for the end user &#8212; employees &#8212; instead of HR. Which means that it’s actually fun. Today the company has experienced some churn, but still sports net retention rates of just under 100%. That’s great for a product that doesn’t feature enterprise-SaaS level upsells.</p>
<p>And the service is cheap. Probably too cheap frankly. At $100 per month for 100 seats, Water Cooler could likely boost what it charges and push its revenues higher in short order. Waldoch said that his company might start raising its rates in Q4 of this year. But even without that, Water Cooler thinks that it has a huge amount of growth open to it from its core product.</p>
<p>I dig it. Long live software making life a bit more fun.</p>
<h2>Drift, Xometry, Carrot</h2>
<p>It was a busy week with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">infinite IPO filings</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/alex-wilhelm/">eight billion YC startups pitching</a>, but other things <em>did </em>happen that we need to talk about:</p>
<p><strong>I’m curious about Drift’s sale to private equity:</strong> Boston’s Drift <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/vista-equity-takes-majority-stake-in-saas-startup-drift-taking-it-to-unicorn-status/">sold the majority of its shares to Vista Equity Partners</a>, it announced this week. I’ve been to the Drift offices, as the company once lent us a room to record a podcast in. The folks there were nice. But with the company reporting 70% ARR growth in 2020, I am dead curious why Drift didn’t just raise more capital and keep growing. The company was able to raise lots of private money in the past, including, say, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/17/drift-raises-60-million-to-be-an-amazon-for-businesses/">a $60 million round back in 2018</a>. Exiting the bulk of the company early feels a little weird, similar to how the Gainsight sale to PE was a bit of a head scratcher. For Boston, the exit is good news as it may help mint new angel investors. But it still feels like an exit for which we’re missing a key detail.</p>

<p><strong>Xometry:</strong> This one has been in the notes folder for too long, and since I’m off next week we’re including it here. I spoke with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/randyaltschuler">Xometry CEO Randy Altschuler</a> after his company reported earnings a few weeks back. Recall that Xometry <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/xometry-is-taking-its-excess-manufacturing-capacity-business-public/">went public earlier this year</a>. Altschuler reported generally bullish views on the process of going public during the COVID-19 era, calling his company’s Zoom roadshow efficient in a manner that allowed his company to chat to more folks while also saving on travel-related exhaustion.</p>
<p><strong>Xometry, continued: </strong>But past the standard post-IPO chit chat, Altschuler had a few notes that stood out in my memory. The first being that inflation can impact technology businesses. Rising costs are impacting companies like Root, who have to deal with used car prices impacting claims costs. Inflation also crops up in Xometry’s business connecting manufacturing demand with manufacturing supply. It’s a good reminder that macro market conditions really do matter in the technology world, just not in ways that we can always easily see.</p>
<p><strong>Xometry, even more: </strong>Altschuler also said that he thinks that a carbon tax at some point is inevitable. This came up in our discussion of onshoring manufacturing in the United States over time. Shipping stuff is expensive today and would prove even more costly if we added in the price of carbon emissions via a tax. That could make local manufacturing more competitive, notably. Perhaps that will prove a boon to folks in favor of more industrial production in post-industrial societies. For tech companies that deal with physical-world goods, it’s something to keep in mind.</p>
<p><strong>And, finally, Carrot: </strong>Another entry from the notes archive, let’s talk about <a href="https://www.get-carrot.com/">Carrot</a>. The startup raised a $75 million round a few weeks back, so I asked the company about its growth history and a few other things. Carrot sells a product to employers so that they can offer their workers fertility benefits. Given <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/26/falling-sperm-counts-human-survival">falling human fertility rates</a>, coverage of this sort is, in my view, likely to become more popular over time.</p>
<p>Other factors are at work, of course, but the last 18 months have proved accelerative for Carrot’s business. Per the company, it has seen “nearly 5x overall growth” in the last six quarters. The startup expects to reach 450 customers by the end of 2021, which will add up to around one million covered folks.</p>
<p>Carrot declined to share a valuation differential from its Series B to its Series C. Happily <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook</a> has data on the matter, so we can report that per its dataset, Carrot’s valuation rose from around $66 million (post-money) following its $21 million Series B to around $260 million after its Series C. That’s a good markup for the company’s employees and founders.</p>
<p>My general bullishness around rising needs for fertility support matches the company’s ethos, which it described in an email by saying that it thinks fertility and “family-forming care could and should be the fourth pillar of employee benefits and health care more broadly, much like medical or dental or vision.” A hard yes to that one.</p>
<p>OK, that’s all from me for a few weeks. Stay safe, get vaccinated, and let’s be kind to one another. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Seksom Suriyapa was seemingly destined to land at a venture firm. A Stanford Law graduate, he worked at two blue-chip investment banks before joining the cybersecurity company McAfee as a senior corp dev employee, later logging six years at the human resources software company SuccessFactors and, in 2018, landing at Twitter, where he headed up its 12-person corporate development team until June.</p>
<p>The bigger surprise is that Suriyapa &#8212; who just joined the L.A.-based venture firm <a href="https://upfront.com/">Upfront Ventures</a> &#8212; didn&#8217;t make the leap sooner. &#8220;The catalyst was finding a firm that felt like the exact right fit for me,&#8221; says Suriyapa.</p>
<p>We talked earlier today with Suriyapa &#8212; who lives and will remain in the Bay Area &#8212; about his new role at Upfront, where he will be leading its expanding growth-stage practice with firm founder Yves Sisteron.</p>
<p>He also shed light on how Twitter &#8212; which has been on a bit of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/twitter-picks-up-acquisition-pace-driven-by-new-product-push?sref=gni836kR">buying spree</a> &#8212; thinks about acquisitions these days. Our chat has been edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How did you wind up joining Upfront?</strong></p>
<p>SS: [Longtime partner] Mark Suster and I were introduced through a mutual business acquaintance in the venture world, and I got to know him over a period of time and really came to find him to be a remarkable individual. He&#8217;s thoughtful about the business itself, he&#8217;s an incredible brand builder. I think you could argue that [Upfront] put L.A. on the venture map.</p>
<p><strong>TC: It was also, for a long time, an early-stage firm, but now it has a &#8216;barbell&#8217; strategy. Is your new job to make sure it can maintain its stake in its portfolio companies as they grow? Can you shop outside of that portfolio?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SS: The mission for me will be supporting the best of Upfront&#8217;s hundred-plus existing portfolio companies that are poised to scale, and also to invest in companies not currency on the platform, and I anticipate [the latter] will happen more and more over time.</p>

<p><strong>TC: Twitter was a lot more active on the corp dev front during the years when you were there. Why?</strong></p>
<p>SS: When i joined in 2018, Jack Dorsey had been CEO for about three years, and really his focus was on the core mission of driving the public conversation, and in doing that, Twitter shrunk itself out of a lot of businesses and [shrunk] people wise as well.</p>
<p><strong>TC: I remember it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/27/twitter-lays-off-9-of-its-workforce-as-it-posts-a-much-needed-positive-q3/">laid people off</a> in 2016.</strong></p>
<p>SS: And one of the offshoots of that was way less in the way of newer products, so there were no new acquisitions in the three years prior to me joining, and that muscle atrophies if you don&#8217;t exercise it. So [ahead of me] Jack had transformed the management team, which had been, relatively speaking, a revolving door of executives until that point, and I was brought in with a specific mandate of reviving a corporate development practice that had been quiet for a few years. I&#8217;d known [CFO] Ned Segal when he was a banker at Goldman Sachs and [while] I was at SuccessFactors, so when I heard about the role through the grapevine, I reached out.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So Twitter starts shopping, buying up the news reader service Scroll, the newsletter platform Revue. Were these decisions coming down from the top or vice versa?</strong></p>
<p>SS: The best way to describe it would be that it was product-need driven. The company had a few different objectives. One was to diversify Twitter from its dependency on being an ad-driven business. Something like 80% of revenue comes from ads.</p>
<p>Second, there&#8217;s an incredible need to ramp up its machine learning and artificial intelligence as a company. If you’re looking for toxicity in conversation, it&#8217;s not scalable to hire tens of thousands of people to do that. You need machine learning to find it. Twitter done well is also able to show you the conversations that are most interesting to you, and to do that, it has to take signals from what you follow and spend time reading and what you interact with, and that, at its core, is ML AI.  [Relatedly] Jack has a vision that anybody who tweets in whatever their native tongue is should be able to talk with someone else in their native tongue as part of a global conversation, and to do that, you need [natural language processing] techniques galore.</p>
<p><strong>TC: There&#8217;s also this focus on consumer applications.</strong></p>
<p>SS: That&#8217;s the third objective. What are the tools that followers and creators can use in conversation with each other? So [Twitter] added audio [via its Clubhouse rival Spaces]. We bought Revue, which is a competitor to Substack. So there&#8217;s a lot of innovation happening around the type of content that someone should expect to see or create on Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Would you describe these acquisitions as proactive or reactive?</strong></p>
<p>SS: From the outside it would seem reactive, but the reality is we’d been thinking a lot about something like Spaces even before Clubhouse took off. I think what’s noticeable to me is [Spaces] is one of the first times you’ve seen a company like Twitter build up a capability and a new product area that&#8217;s going head-to-head going against a company that&#8217;s focused only on that realm, and it&#8217;s competitive from day one. Twitter beat Clubhouse in [offering an] Android version because it poured resources into it, and I&#8217;d argue that a lot of the mechanics of Twitter and the fact that creators are on Twitter puts it in an awesome spot to win this segment.</p>
<p>Twitter also just has a huge amount of expertise in finding toxicity and things you want to be wary of when you&#8217;re a social media play, and a company of Clubhouse&#8217;s size, at least in its initial days, will have a hard time getting there.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Twitter has so many interests, including around cryptocurrencies and decentralization. </strong></p>
<p>SS: In terms of priorities at Twitter,  a lot is under wraps in terms of the technologies that we expect [will rise up over] the next five  to 10 years, but [a lot of thought is being given to] the impact of cryptocurrency and the underlying protocols around it and how Twitter participates in a trustless, permissionless [world] where there&#8217;s a decentralized internet that can protect people&#8217;s privacy and allow people not to worry where their content is stored. People think of Twitter as a consumer app but there&#8217;s amazing and considerable diversity under the hood.</p>

<p><strong>TC: Do you think because of the current regulatory environment that it has a better shot at working with companies and projects that might have gotten snapped up by Facebook and Google?</strong></p>
<p>In terms of the regulatory environment, the reality is that even if you take the Facebooks and Googles out of the equation, there are acquirers that are competitive that would step up and buy things, so it&#8217;s a little short-sighted to think of just those two. But even when they were active, we were winning [deals]. A lot of the companies we acquired self-selected to be at Twitter because they like what it stands for, they like the way that Jack Dorsey leads the organization, and they believe in the stands that he takes and the positions that he and his leadership espouse.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re now representing a very different brand. How will your work at Twitter help you compete for deals on behalf of Upfront?</strong></p>
<p>SS: I have this network of incredible entrepreneurs around the world because of companies across my career that I&#8217;ve helped acquire or tried to acquire or who are running businesses; I also [have relationships with] VCs at different stages who actively spot businesses around the world [and introduce them to corp dev teams]. You might also know that Twitter has a diversity and inclusion program where they intend to have 25% of leadership be diverse over the next several years, so my team was often involved in finding the best ways to find diverse targets to buy. I also led a series of LP investments into newly emerging funds, some LatinX-founded, some women-founded, some Black-founded, some that were diverse from a geographic standpoint that are scouting companies in far flung places . . .</p>
<p><strong>TC: Does Twitter also make direct investments?</strong></p>
<p>SS: We did direct investments but [backing fund managers] is a more leveraged approach. Most of them are seed funds and they&#8217;ll in turn invest in 30 to 60 companies each. But yes, I scouted companies in far flung places, including [India&#8217;s] ShareChat where I served on the board for two years. [Editor&#8217;s note: TechCrunch reported earlier this year that Twitter explored <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/twitter-explored-buying-indian-startup-sharechat-and-positioning-moj-as-a-global-tiktok-rival/">buying ShareChat</a> at an earlier point; the company has since raised numerous rounds of funding and was most recently valued by its investors at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/india-sharechat-valued-at-3-billion-in-145-million-fundraise/">nearly $3 billion</a>.]</p>
<p><strong>TC: You have a lot of relationships, but it would still seem really hard to compete for growth-stage deals when so many other outfits are now investing there, too. How do you plan to compete?</strong></p>
<p>SS: I will clearly be drawing on those networks to find deals. I&#8217;ll be investing in sectors where Upfront has already invested in, but initially I’ll be double-clicking [in areas[ I have strong interest in, including around the creator economy ecosystem, because I did so much of that at Twitter, and &#8220;Web 3.0,&#8221; this permissionless [evolution that Twitter is also focused on]. But I won’t kid myself. You compete by learning what your value proposition is. At Twitter, my strategy was winning on speed, knowing people earlier, and [underscoring] Twitter’s value proposition [to close deals]. I can&#8217;t talk about my [VC] strategy without having implemented yet; I’ll have to figure out what’s most interesting to entrepreneurs that the megafunds don’t offer.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for September 3, 2021. As noted yesterday, most of TechCrunch has the day off so today’s newsletter is a <em>little</em> bit different than usual.</p>
<p>Up top let’s chat early-stage startups. The TechCrunch team spent an age this week cataloging a host of startups from Y Combinator’s marathon demo day, with our notes covering all presentations <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/here-are-all-the-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day-part-1/">from day one</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/here-are-all-the-companies-from-day-two-of-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day/">day two</a>. We also yanked our favorites in two batches, in case you wanted to avoid the full download and want to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/our-favorite-startups-from-ycs-summer-21-demo-day-part-1/">skip straight</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/our-favorite-startups-from-ycs-summer-21-demo-day-part-2/">the highlights</a>.</p>
<p>But that’s not all. We also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/tracking-startup-focus-in-the-latest-y-combinator-cohort/">dug into trends from the group</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/y-combinator-s-21-equity/">hopped on Twitter Spaces to chat about what we saw.</a> Of course, Y Combinator is a single accelerator, but given its mammoth cohort sizes we pay extra attention to the trends that its startups detail.</p>
<p>That behind us, let’s take a moment to highlight some great stuff from newer TechCrunch reporters:</p>
<ul>
<li>TechCrunch boomerang <strong>Ryan Lawler</strong> has been busy digging into the fintech world, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/all-the-reasons-why-you-should-launch-a-credit-or-debit-card/">dive into the pros and cons of credit and debit cards</a> at financial-focused startups. His look into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-and-brex-draw-diverging-market-plans-with-ma-strategy/">Brex and Ramp’s diverging strategies</a> was also a hit.</li>
<li><strong>Kate Park</strong> has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/29/korean-3d-spatial-data-tool-startup-urbanbase-closes-11-1m-series-b-round/">dug into Asian startups,</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">regulatory changes in South Korea that impact major smartphone players</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apple-announced-new-settlement-with-japan-allowing-developers-to-link-to-external-website/">news from Japan</a> that could shake up Apple’s grip on its App Store.</li>
<li><strong>Christine Hall</strong> has been <em>hall-ing</em> ass, covering a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/youtravel-me-packs-up-1m-to-match-travelers-with-curated-small-group-adventures/">barrage of startup funding rounds</a> and product news. She even found time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/box-zoom-chief-product-officers-discuss-how-the-changing-workplace-drove-their-latest-collaboration/">to dig into the Zoom-Box news while juggling the rest</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Aria Alamalhodaei</strong> has been killing the transportation beat, bringing all sorts of news to the site, including coverage of the startup space race. Which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/faa-grounds-virgin-galactic-amidst-investigation-into-july-mission/">isn’t always, well, very good news for the companies involved</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Carly Page</strong> kicked off her TechCrunch tenure digging into hackers attacking <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/hackers-phishing-post-covid-office/">employees returning to the office</a> and has written a deluge of stories for TechCrunch including news this week that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/fbi-china-hacking-uyghurs/">China is hacking Uyghurs on American soil</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, Disrupt is coming up. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=dailycrunch&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=dailycrunchad&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=dailycrunchad&amp;display=TRUE">So make sure that you have a ticket.</a> As it’s a virtual event they are cheaper than they have been in years past, despite the event having perhaps its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">strongest content lineup ever</a>. We’re excited!</p>
<p>With that, let’s head into the weekend &#8212; a long one here in the United States &#8212; and get some rest. What a week in the world at large and in our startup-focused niche. I&#8217;ll be taking all next week off, but I will leave the Daily Crunch in the very capable hands of one <a href="https://twitter.com/grg">Greg Kumparak</a>. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>Use cohort analysis to drive smarter startup growth</h2>
<p>Cohort analysis is a basic tool for startups that need to better understand customer behavior, but many early-stage companies let it slide.</p>
<p>Grouping users into &#8220;buckets&#8221; is common practice at most startups, but robust cohort analysis uncovers trends and missed opportunities that young companies can pounce on.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t wait to hire a senior marketing person or a consultant to start this critical work: In a guest column, Jonathan Metrick, chief growth officer at Sagard &amp; Portage Ventures, offers a detailed example explaining the value of this type of analysis.</p>
<p>If you have questions after reading this comprehensive step-by-step, please join us for a <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1OwxWVXZbLnJQ">Twitter Spaces</a> chat with Metrick on Tuesday, September 7, at 3 p.m. PDT/6 p.m. EDT.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian announced Friday that the first edition version of its all-electric R1T pickup truck has an official EPA range of 314 miles, while its R1T SUV comes in a skosh higher at 316 miles.</p>
<p>The official range and fuel economy values have been <a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=44462&amp;id=44461">posted on the U.S. EPA website</a>. The official numbers align with Rivian&#8217;s own previous estimates, which it has advertised as 300 miles.</p>
<p>While EPA estimates can&#8217;t account for different driving styles, the test cycle is robust enough to provide an accurate benchmark for customers shopping for an electric vehicle.</p>
<p>In this case, Rivian has the benefit of being the first electric truck on the market. Ford&#8217;s F-150 Lightning, which isn&#8217;t expected to come on the market until spring 2022, has a targeted range of 230 miles in the standard and up to 300 miles in the extended version. The EPA has not issued official ranges for the Ford Lightning.</p>
<p>Rivian&#8217;s &#8220;Launch edition&#8221; R1T truck and R1S SUV come equipped with a 135-kWh battery pack that is branded as the &#8220;large pack.&#8221; Deliveries of the Launch Edition vehicles are slated to begin this month.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The official EPA range values for our Launch Edition vehicles are in:<br />R1T Large Pack: 314 miles<br />R1S Large Pack: 316 miles<br />We&#39;ll share more EPA information about other editions as we have it. <a href="https://t.co/MPY1wVzkz9">https://t.co/MPY1wVzkz9</a> <a href="https://t.co/rzrCkQpggd">pic.twitter.com/rzrCkQpggd</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Rivian (@Rivian) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rivian/status/1433885852849999873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The R1T and R1S vehicles will be offered in two trims, both of which are offered with the same 135-kWh-pack size. The Adventure variant of the R1T, which has a premium interior, starts at $73,000. The R1T Explore trim starts at $67,500.</p>
<p>The Adventure trim in the R1S SUV starts at $75,500, while the Explore package has a base price of $70,000.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Rivian intends to begin deliveries of the Adventure and Explore packages in January 2022.</p>
<p>Rivian also plans to offer an even larger pack, dubbed the &#8220;Max pack,&#8221; for the R1T. That larger pack costs an additional $10,000 and is expected to push the range of the R1T past 400 miles. The EPA has not posted an official range for the max pack or other editions, including a planned smaller battery pack option.</p>

		Joe Devon is the co-founder of <a href="https://diamond.la/">Diamond</a>, a digital agency that builds accessible experiences. He is also a co-founder of Global Accessibility Awareness Day and chair of the GAAD Foundation. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The world of accessibility has experienced a tipping point thanks to the pandemic, which drove people of all abilities to do more tasks and shopping online.</p>
<p>For the last year, the digital world was the only place brands could connect with their customers. A <a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/digital-accessibility-enters-the-spotlight-as-a-business-priority/">Forrester</a> survey found that 8 in 10 companies have taken their first steps toward working on digital accessibility.</p>
<p>What’s driving this change besides the increased digital interactions? Fortune 500 companies are finally starting to realize that people with disabilities make up 1 billion of the world’s market. That population and their families control more than $13 trillion in disposable income, according to Return on Disability’s “<a href="http://rod-group.com/sites/default/files/Summary%20Report%20-%20The%20Global%20Economics%20of%20Disability%202020.pdf">The Global Economics of Disability</a>.”</p>
<p>However, only 36% of companies in Forrester’s survey are completely committed to creating accessible digital experiences.</p>
<p>Although digital accessibility has been around for decades, companies have not caught on to its benefits until recently. In its latest survey, the <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/">WebAIM Million</a> analysis of 1 million home pages found accessibility errors on 97.4% of the websites evaluated.</p>
<p>What does this mean for you? Why should you care about this? Because this is an opportunity for your company to get ahead of the competition and reap the rewards of being an early adopter.</p>
<h2>The benefits of digital accessibility</h2>
<p>Companies are now realizing the advantages of creating accessible products and properties that go beyond doing the right thing. For one, people are living longer. The <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ageing-and-health#:~:text=People%20worldwide%20are%20living%20longer.%20Today%2C%20for%20the,million%20people%20are%20aged%2080%20years%20or%20older.">World Health Organization</a> says people aged 60 and older outnumber children under 5. Moreover, the world’s population of those who are 60 and older is expected to reach 2 billion by 2050, up from 900 million in 2015.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>W3C Web Accessibility Initiative provides an overview on <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/older-users/literature/#summary">Web Accessibility for Older Users</a>. Here’s what it reveals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hearing loss affects 47% of people aged 61 to 80.</li>
<li>Vision decline affects 16% of people aged 65 to 74.</li>
<li>Mild cognitive impairment affects 20% of people over 70.</li>
<li>Arthritis affects more than 50% of people over 65.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, developing accessible digital products helps you reach a much larger audience, which will include you, your co-workers and your family. Everyone is going to become situationally, temporarily or episodically impaired at some point in their lives. Everyone enters a noisy or dark environment that can make it harder to see or hear. An injury or an illness can cause someone to use the internet differently on a temporary basis. People with arthritis, migraines and vertigo experience episodes of pain and discomfort that affect their ability to interact with digital devices, apps and tools.</p>
<p>Additionally, no one has ever advocated <em>against </em>making products and websites accessible to more people. Despite this, the relative universal appeal of accessibility as a principle does not mean that it will be as easy as explaining the need and getting people on board to make major organizational changes. A lot of work remains in raising awareness and educating people about <em>why </em>we need to make these changes and <em>how</em> to go about it.</p>
<p>You have the why. Now here are five things to help you with how to make changes in your company to integrate accessibility as a core part of your business.</p>
<h2>1. Tap the right people to create accessible experiences</h2>
<p>According to the second annual <a href="https://hubs.ly/H0Vm4kG0">State of Accessibility Report</a>, only 40% of the Alexa Top 100 websites are fully accessible, proving the needs of people with disabilities are, more often than not, being overlooked when creating web experiences.</p>
<p>To design for people with disabilities, it’s important to have an understanding of how they use your products or web properties. You’ll also want to know what tools will help them achieve their desired results. This starts with having the right people on board.</p>
<p>Hiring accessibility experts to advise your development team will proactively identify potential issues and ensure you design accessibly from the start, as well as create better products. Better yet, hiring people with disabilities brings a deeper level of understanding to your work.</p>
<h2>2. Hire designers passionate about accessibility</h2>
<p>Having accessibility experts on your team to provide advice and guidance is a great start. However, if the rest of your team is not passionate about accessibility, that can turn into a potential roadblock. When interviewing new designers, ask about accessibility. It’ll gauge a candidate’s knowledge and passion in the area. At the same time, you set an expectation that accessibility is a priority at your organization.</p>
<p>Being proactive about your hires and making sure they will contribute to a culture of accessibility and inclusion will save you major headaches. Accessibility starts in the design and user experience (UX) phase. If your team doesn’t deliver there, then you will have to fix their mistakes later, essentially delaying the project and costing your organization. It costs more to fix things than to build them accessibly in the first place.</p>
<h2>3. Remember that accessibility is for everyone</h2>
<p>People deciding whether to invest in accessibility often ask themselves how many people are going to use the feature. The reasoning behind the question is understandable from a business perspective; accessibility can be an expense, and it’s reasonable to want to spend money responsibly.</p>
<p>However, the question is rooted in one of the biggest misconceptions in the field. The myth is that accessibility only benefits people who are blind or deaf. This belief is frustrating because it greatly underestimates the number of people with disabilities and minimizes their place in society. Furthermore, it fails to acknowledge that people who may not have a disability still benefit greatly from accessibility features.</p>
<p>Disability is a spectrum that all of us will find ourselves on sooner or later. Maybe an injury temporarily limits our mobility that requires us to perform basic tasks like banking and shopping exclusively online. Or maybe our vision and hearing change as we age, which affects our ability to interact online.</p>
<p>When we understand that accessibility is about designing in a way that includes as many people as possible, we can reframe the conversation around whether it&#8217;s worth investing in. This approach sends a clear message: No business can afford to ignore a fast-growing population.</p>
<p>Think about it this way: If you have a choice of taking an elevator or the stairs, which would you take? Most pick the elevator. Those ramps on street corners called curb cuts? They were initially designed for allowing wheelchairs to cross the street.</p>
<p>Yet, many use these ramps, including parents pushing strollers, travelers pulling luggage, skateboarders rolling and workers moving heavy loads on dollies. A feature initially designed for accessibility benefits far more people than the original target audience. That’s the magic of the curb-cut effect.</p>
<h2>4. Hire agencies that build accessibly by default</h2>
<p>Whether you have a small team or are expanding an in-house accessibility practice, working with an agency can be an effective way to embrace and adopt accessible practices. The secret to a successful partnership is choosing an agency that will help your team grow into its accessibility practice.</p>
<p>The key to finding the right agency is selecting one that builds accessibly by default. When you know you are working with an agency that shares your organization’s values, you have a trusted partner in your mission of improving accessibility. It also removes any guesswork or revisions down the line. This is a huge win, as many designers overlook details that can make or break an experience for a user with a disability.</p>
<p>Working with an agency focused on providing accessible experiences narrows the likelihood of errors going unnoticed and unremedied, giving you confidence that you are providing an excellent experience to your entire audience.</p>
<h2>5. Integrate accessibility into your supply chain</h2>
<p>On any given day, enterprises and large organizations often work with dozens of stakeholders. From vendors and agencies to freelancers and internal employees, the nature of business today is far-reaching and collaborative. While this is valuable for exchanging ideas, accessibility can get lost in the mix with so many different people involved.</p>
<p>To prevent this from happening, it’s important to align these moving pieces of a business into a supply chain that is focused on accessibility at every stage of the business. When everyone is completely bought in, it cuts the risk of a component being inaccessible and causing issues for you in the future.</p>
<h2>The startup advantage</h2>
<p>A major challenge that comes up repeatedly is the struggle to change the status quo. Once an organization implements and ingrains inaccessible processes and products into its culture, it is hard to make meaningful change. Even if everyone is willing to commit to the change, the fact is, rewriting the way you do business is never easy.</p>
<p>Startups have an advantage here: They do not bear years of inaccessible baggage. It’s not written into the code of their products. It’s not woven into the business culture. In many ways, a startup is a clean slate, and they need to learn from the trials of their more established peers.</p>
<p>Startup founders have the opportunity to build an accessible organization from the ground up. They can create an accessible-first culture that will not need rewriting 10, 20 or 30 years from now by hiring a diverse workforce with a passion for accessibility, writing accessible code for products and web properties, choosing to work with only third parties who embrace accessibility and advocating for the rights of people with disabilities.</p>
<p>Many of these considerations here have a common denominator: culture. While most people in the technology industry will agree that accessibility is an important and worthy cause to champion, it has a huge awareness problem.</p>
<p>Accessibility needs to be everywhere in software development, from requirements and beyond to include marketing, sales and other non-tech teams. It cannot be a niche concern left to a siloed team to handle. If we, as an industry and as a society, recognize that accessibility is <em>everyone’s </em>job, we will create a culture that prioritizes it without question.</p>
<p>By creating this culture, we will no longer be asking, “Do we have to make this accessible?” Instead, we’ll ask, “How do we make this accessible?” It’s a major mindset shift that will make a tangible difference in the lives of 1 billion people living with a disability and those who eventually will have a disability or temporary, situational or episodic impairments affecting their ability to use online and digital products.</p>
<p>Advocating for accessibility may feel like an uphill battle at times, but it isn’t rocket science. The biggest need is education and awareness.</p>
<p>When you understand the people you build accessible products for and the reasons they need those products, it becomes easier to secure buy-in from people in all parts of your organization. Creating this culture is the first step in a long quest toward accessibility. And the best part is, it gets easier from here.</p>

		Ken Sutton is CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://yobeinc.com/">Yobe</a>, a software company that uses edge-based AI to unlock the potential of voice technologies for modern brands.	</div>

<p>Hospitality, travel, IoT and the auto industry are all on the cusp of leveling-up voice assistant adoption and the monetization of voice. The global voice and speech recognition market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.2% from 2019 to reach $26.8 billion by 2025, according to <a href="https://www.meticulousresearch.com/product/speech-and-voice-recognition-market-5038">Meticulous Research</a>. Companies like Amazon and Apple will accelerate this growth as they leverage ambient computing capabilities, which will continue to push voice interfaces forward as a primary interface.</p>
<p>As voice technologies become ubiquitous, companies are turning their focus to the value of the data latent in these new channels. Microsoft’s recent acquisition of Nuance is not just about achieving better NLP or voice assistant technology, it’s also about the trove of healthcare data that the conversational AI has collected.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Our voice technologies have not been engineered to confront the messiness of the real world or the cacophony of our actual lives.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Google has monetized every click of your mouse, and the same thing is now happening with voice. Advertisers have found that speak-through conversion rates are higher than click-through conversation rates. Brands need to begin developing voice strategies to reach customers — or risk being left behind.</p>
<p>Voice tech adoption was already on the rise, but with most of the world under lockdown protocol during the COVID-19 pandemic, adoption is set to skyrocket. Nearly <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/voice-assistant-and-smart-speaker-users-2020">40%</a> of internet users in the U.S. use smart speakers at least monthly in 2020, according to Insider Intelligence.</p>
<p>Yet, there are several fundamental technology barriers keeping us from reaching the full potential of the technology.</p>
<h2>The steep climb to commercializing voice</h2>
<p>By the end of 2020, <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS47534521">worldwide shipments</a> of wearable devices rose 27.2% to 153.5 million from a year earlier, but despite all the progress made in voice technologies and their integration in a plethora of end-user devices, they are still largely limited to simple tasks. That is finally starting to change as consumers demand more from these interactions, and voice becomes a more essential interface.</p>
<p>In 2018, in-car shoppers spent $230 billion to order food, coffee, groceries or items to pick up at a store. The auto industry is one of the earliest adopters of voice AI, but in order to really capture voice technology’s true potential, it needs to become a more seamless, truly hands-free experience. Ambient car noise still muddies the signal enough that it keeps users tethered to using their phones.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://kalepa.com/">Kalepa</a>, an insurance underwriting platform based out of New York, has raised a $14 million Series A funding round led by Inspired Capital, with participation from previous investor IA Ventures. Also participating was Gokul Rajaram of Doordash, Coinbase, and formerly of Google, Jackie Reses, formerly of Square, and Henry Ward of Carta.</p>
<p>Founded by Paul Monasterio and Daniel Hillman, the startup was launched in 2018 aimed at commercial insurance underwriters.</p>
<p>Co-Founder and CEO, Paul Monasterio said: “InsureTech has seen a massive evolution over the past decade, but commercial insurance—which supports hard-working business owners and protects their most important assets—has been left behind. We leverage billions of data points and unlock crucial insights in order to bring businesses and insurers a single version of the truth.”</p>
<p>Kalepa says its Copilot software automatically learns what the best underwriters are doing, allowing an underwriter to take a more accurate underwriting decision as quickly as possible vs. simply aggregating a lot of data for them. It competes with the legacy MGAs (e.g., RT Specialty, AmWins) as well as new entrants such as Pathpoint in the E&amp;S market.</p>
<p>Penny Pritzker, co-founder at Inspired Capital and former U.S. Secretary of Commerce said: “Commercial insurance represents a $1T industry globally and helps 30 million U.S. businesses. Kalepa has brought some of the sharpest minds in understanding risk to this segment of the insurance market.”</p>
<p>Veteran insurance player Mario Vitale is also joining Kalepa’s Board.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">There’s an old startup adage that goes: Cash is king. I’m not sure that is true anymore.</p>
<p>In today’s cash rich environment, options are more valuable than cash. Founders have many guides on how to raise money, but not enough has been written about how to protect your startup’s option pool. As a founder, recruiting talent is the most important factor for success. In turn, managing your option pool may be the most effective action you can take to ensure you can recruit and retain talent.</p>
<p>That said, managing your option pool is no easy task. However, with some foresight and planning, it’s possible to take advantage of certain tools at your disposal and avoid common pitfalls.</p>
<p>In this piece, I’ll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mechanics of the option pool over multiple funding rounds.</li>
<li>Common pitfalls that trip up founders along the way.</li>
<li>What you can do to protect your option pool or to correct course if you made mistakes early on.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A minicase study on option pool mechanics</h2>
<p>Let’s run through a quick case study that sets the stage before we dive deeper. In this example, there are three equal co-founders who decide to quit their jobs to become startup founders.</p>
<p>Since they know they need to hire talent, the trio gets going with a 10% option pool at inception. They then cobble together enough money across angel, pre-seed and seed rounds (with 25% cumulative dilution across those rounds) to achieve product-market fit (PMF). With PMF in the bag, they raise a Series A, which results in a further 25% dilution.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The easiest way to ensure you don’t run out of options too quickly is simply to start with a bigger pool.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>After hiring a few C-suite executives, they are now running low on options. So at the Series B, the company does a 5% option pool top-up pre-money — in addition to giving up 20% in equity related to the new cash injection. When the Series C and D rounds come by with dilutions of 15% and 10%, the company has hit its stride and has an imminent IPO in the works. Success!</p>
<p>For simplicity, I will assume a few things that don’t normally happen but will make illustrating the math here a bit easier:</p>
<ol>
<li>No investor participates in their pro-rata after their initial investment.</li>
<li>Half the available pool is issued to new hires and/or used for refreshes every round.</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, every situation is unique and your mileage may vary. But this is a close enough proxy to what happens to a lot of startups in practice. Here is what the available option pool will look like over time across rounds:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197721" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197721" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2197721" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Figure-1.png" alt="Option pool example" width="1024" height="404" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Figure-1.png 2031w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Figure-1.png?resize=150,59 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Figure-1.png?resize=300,118 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Figure-1.png?resize=768,303 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Figure-1.png?resize=680,268 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Figure-1.png?resize=1536,606 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Figure-1.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197721" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Allen Miller</p></div></p>
<p>Note how quickly the pool thins out — especially early on. In the beginning, 10% sounds like a lot, but it’s hard to make the first few hires when you have nothing to show the world and no cash to pay salaries. In addition, early rounds don’t just dilute your equity as a founder, they dilute everyone&#8217;s — including your option pool (both allocated and unallocated). By the time the company raises its Series B, the available pool is already less than 1.5%.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in July, <a href="https://www.yasa.com/">YASA</a> (formerly Yokeless And Segmented Armature), a British electric motor startup with a revolutionary &#8216;axial-flux&#8217; motor, was acquired by Mercedes-Benz. The acquisition didn’t exactly garner enormous press attention, as scant other details were announced. But YASA is likely to be an entity worth watching.</p>
<p>Founded in 2009 after being spun out of Oxford University, YASA will now develop ultra-high-performance electric motors for Mercedes-Benz’s AMG.EA electric-only platform. It will stay in the UK as a fully owned subsidiary, serving both Mercedes-Benz and existing customers like Ferrari. The company will retain its own brand, team, facilities, and location in Oxford.</p>
<p>YASA&#8217;s axial-flux electric motors generated EV industry interest because of their efficiency, high power density, small size, and low weight.</p>
<p>By contrast, the &#8216;radial&#8217; electric motor design is more common in today’s EV market. Even Tesla relies on radial electric motors, a legacy technology more than 40 years old with very little left to give in terms of innovation.</p>
<p>But YASA’s axial-flux design, which has very thin segments, means they can be combined into powerful single drive units. This makes them one-third the weight of other electric motors, more efficient, and with 3x higher power densities than Tesla.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/timwoolmer">Tim Woolmer</a>, YASA’s Founder and CTO, invented this very new approach to electric motor design. I caught up with him to find out what’s next.</p>
<p><strong>TC</strong>: What’s the journey so far:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TW</strong>: We started just over 12 years ago with really one remit: let&#8217;s accelerate electric cars, let&#8217;s do anything we can to make electric cars happen faster. We&#8217;re now 10 years into a 20-year revolution, every new car that gets sold in 10 years will be electric, no question. There&#8217;s nothing more exciting for an engineer than a period of revolution because the speed of innovation is what&#8217;s important. What is so exciting for us is we get to innovate fast, and that&#8217;s where the partnership with Mercedes is really interesting.</p>
<p><strong>TC</strong>: What was different about the engine you came up with?</p>
<p><strong>TW</strong>: We started with a blank sheet of paper at the beginning of my PhD. And the idea was to say, what could be created for the electric car industry in 10 or 15 years from now that they would need, that we could meet. Something that was lighter, more efficient, mass-producible in volume. In the 2000s, axial flux motors were not very common, but by combining axial flux technology and making a couple of little tweaks using some new materials, I basically stumbled into this new design which we call YASA: Yokeless And Segmented Armature. It takes what is a light topology in axial flux and makes it even lighter, about half as much again. There&#8217;s a benefit because the rotors are rotating at a bigger diameter. So, essentially torque is force times diameter, so for the same force, you get more torque. So if you double your diameter, you get double the torque for the same amount of materials. So that&#8217;s the benefit of axial flux.</p>
<p><strong>TC</strong>: You’ve done this with deal with Mercedes &#8211; what’s next?</p>
<p><strong>TW</strong>: We are basically a fully owned subsidiary. We&#8217;re going to utilize Mercedes’ industrialization powerhouse. But the key thing is, if you watch how technologies filter down in automotive, they start in the luxury sector, like the Ferraris of this world, and then filter down into mainstream sector and then go into higher volumes after that. That&#8217;s a space where Mercedes are world-class in terms of their industrialization, so that&#8217;s the kind of the idea behind the partnership.</p>
<p><strong>TC</strong>: What else can you do from here?</p>
<p><strong>TW</strong>: We will have a very high, high power, low density and lightweight engine so we can explore sport performance coupled with high levels of industrialization. That puts us in a really unique position for all sorts of things.</p>
<p>Although coy about his future plans, Woolmer is certainly one to watch in the EV and electric motor space. Post the acquisition YASA released this video:<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram made headlines (including this one) when product head Adam Mosseri <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CQwNfFBJr5A/">said in June</a> that the app is &#8220;no longer just a square photo-sharing app,&#8221; since it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/after-testing-instagram-launches-ads-in-the-instagram-shop-tab-globally/">pivoting its focus</a> to shopping and video. But where does that leave photographers who want a social photo-sharing experience?</p>
<p>According to Tom Watson, a former product designer at Facebook and Pinterest, photographers have lacked a social network for a while. That&#8217;s why, with co-founder Stefan Borsje, Watson built Glass, a subscription-based iOS app designed to be a home for photographers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always loved photography, and when Flickr got <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/23/flickrs-acquisition-9-years-later/">bought by Yahoo</a>, it was a sad moment for me. I love that kind of nerdy photography community,&#8221; Watson told TechCrunch. &#8220;Then you started to see it pick up with Instagram to take the torch into the mobile space. But I was at Facebook when Facebook purchased Instagram, and you could kind of see that it would inevitably be where it is today.&#8221;</p>
<p>For those of us accustomed to free, ad-supported social media, it might feel unfamiliar to pay a monthly fee for an app. Glass costs $4.99 a month (or $29.99 a year) to use, but you can try it without charge for 14 days. Still, the app takes your App Store payment info right away, so it could be a barrier to entry for people who worry they won&#8217;t remember to delete Glass before the trial period ends, should they not want to continue with it. But this model is intentional. Watson and Borsje are specifically trying to build their app &#8212; which only has five team members &#8212; without any venture funding or ad revenue. They only want to have to answer to their community of photographers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to do something different and start with a social subscription model and to bootstrap without venture capital,&#8221; said Watson. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen in the past what happens when you take on venture capital and go for the moon. You keep pivoting away from your photographer community in order to become more broad.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197793" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197793" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2197793" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="390" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg?resize=768,440 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg?resize=680,390 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg?resize=1536,881 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg?resize=2048,1174 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197793" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Glass</p></div></p>
<p>From the moment you open the Glass app, it&#8217;s clear that the emphasis is on the photography itself. When you follow photographers, their posts will appear in a feed of images designed to minimize distractions. The photos take up the entire screen, and you can only see who posted them if you drag them to the right. When you click on an image, you can see its caption and other information about how the photograph was shot. You can engage socially through comments, but there aren&#8217;t likes on photos &#8212; this is an intentional design choice, though Watson says some users are asking for a like button, even if it just helps them bookmark images for later browsing. In the coming weeks, Glass will launch<a href="https://glass.photo/updates/glimpse-into-glass"> discovery features</a>, like categories for photographs. Glass also has a feedback board, which allows users to request features and upvote or downvote other users&#8217; ideas. If Glass chooses to develop a suggestion, it is noted as &#8220;in progress&#8221; on the board.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though it&#8217;s only in its beginning stages, Glass already sets itself apart from Instagram or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/05/inside-vsco-a-gen-z-approved-photo-sharing-app-with-ceo-joel-flory/">VSCO</a> by offering EXIF data, which is like candy for the &#8220;photography nerds&#8221; that Glass hopes to attract. EXIF data shows what camera a photographer used, as well as the photo&#8217;s ISO, aperture, shutter speed, and focal length. This data and sense of community was what drew people to Flickr in its early days, but when Yahoo gave free users up to one terrabyte of data, it became more of a personal archive than a community. Then, when SmugMug bought Flickr from Yahoo in 2018, it tried to backpedal by only allowing free users to have 1000 photos, warning that they could <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/01/flickr-revamps-under-smugmug-with-new-limits-on-free-accounts-unlimited-storage-for-pros/">delete free users&#8217; photos</a> if they didn&#8217;t upgrade to a paid plan.</p>
<p>Glass also appeals to photographers by allowing for a wider variety of image sizes on the app &#8212; the maximum aspect ratio is 16 x 9, which accommodates the size of standard camera photos. But on Instagram, even after the platform moved away from its square image motif, it&#8217;s not possible to post vertical photographs from most cameras without cropping them. Like VSCO, Glass doesn&#8217;t show how many followers each user has, though you can see comments. While you can&#8217;t see how many followers someone else has, you can see who is following your own account.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought that was important for safety. If someone follows you, you need to know who that is, and to be able to block them,&#8221; Watson said. &#8220;We really wanted to build blocking and reporting features from day one.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Watson declined to share how many users have downloaded the app so far, but Watson said he&#8217;s &#8220;extremely happy with the response&#8221; to Glass. It launched with a waitlist in August, and Wednesday the app opened up to all iOS users. The goal of the waitlist wasn&#8217;t to generate hype, but rather, to make sure that the user experience remained smooth, and that the app wouldn&#8217;t get overloaded. At the time of the app&#8217;s waitlist launch in August, Watson told TechCrunch that Glass was sending hundreds of invites out every day. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been on the internet a long time, and I used to feel like there was a cozier, safer space,&#8221; Watson said. &#8220;I hope that by having this subscription model, these spaces can feel that way a little bit more again.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/1b3ba3cf-fb54-46b3-b9a6-7c8307897784?dark=false" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> gathered to dig through the week&#8217;s biggest happenings, including some news of our own. As a note, Equity&#8217;s Monday episode will be landing next <em>Tuesday, </em>thanks to a national holiday here in the United States. And we have something special planned for Wednesday, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>Ok! Here&#8217;s the rundown from the show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apollo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apollo-completes-its-5b-acquisition-of-verizon-media-now-known-as-yahoo/">completed its takeover of <del>Verizon Media Group</del> Yahoo</a>: Yep, we have new bosses, and we have feelings about it. But mostly the TechCrunch news was a useful segue to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/vista-equity-takes-majority-stake-in-saas-startup-drift-taking-it-to-unicorn-status/">Drift&#8217;s majority exit to Vista Equity Partners</a> at a price that made the Boston-based startup a unicorn. Terms were not disclosed, sadly, but Drift&#8217;s revenues looked strong going into the transaction. That left us with questions.</li>
<li>Then we chatted about Databricks, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/databricks-raises-1-6b-at-38b-valuation-as-it-blasts-past-600m-arr/">raised a small country&#8217;s GDP in a single funding round this week</a>, valuing the data-and-ML company at a staggering $38 billion valuation. Why isn&#8217;t Databricks going public? Because it doesn&#8217;t have to, mostly.</li>
<li>Hum Capital believes the future of startup fundraising <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/hum-capital-thinks-the-future-of-funding-is-a-return-to-old-school-wall-street/">requires a return to old school Wall Street. </a>The startup helps founders and investors navigate the overly fragmented market these days, and just raised millions to scale this service.</li>
<li>Form there we dug into two IPOs, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/5-takeaways-from-toasts-s-1-filing/">including the very interesting story of Toast</a>, another Boston-based company, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/31/business/allbirds-ipo.html">and AllBirds</a>. The AllBirds offering was less exciting from a numerical perspective, though Natasha and Alex both like their shoes from the company.</li>
<li>And to close out, we discussed how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/compounds-foods-brews-up-4-5m-to-make-coffee-without-beans/">Compound Foods wants to save the planet</a> by making coffee sans beans. Which we are willing to try as soon as we can.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s a wrap from us for the week! Keep your head atop your shoulders and have a great weekend!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup called <a href="https://www.playbyte.io/">Playbyte</a> wants to become the TikTok for games. The company&#8217;s newly launched <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/playbyte/id1551822717">iOS app</a> offers tools that allow users to make and share simple games on their phone, as well as a vertically scrollable, fullscreen feed where you can play the games created by others. Also like TikTok, the feed becomes more personalized over time to serve up more of the kinds of games you like to play.</p>
<p>While typically, game creation involves some aspect of coding, Playbyte&#8217;s games are created using simple building blocks, emoji and even images from your Camera Roll on your iPhone. The idea is to make building games just another form of self-expression, rather than some introductory, educational experience that&#8217;s trying to teach users the basics of coding.</p>
<p>At its core, Playbyte&#8217;s game creation is powered by its lightweight 2D game engine built on web frameworks, which lets users create games that can be quickly loaded and played even on slow connections and older devices. After you play a game, you can like and comment using buttons on the right-side of the screen, which also greatly resembles the TikTok look-and-feel. Over time, Playbyte&#8217;s feed shows you more of the games you enjoyed as the app leverages its understanding of in-game imagery, tags and descriptions, and other engagement analytics to serve up more games it believes you&#8217;ll find compelling.</p>
<p>At launch, users have already made a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@team_playbyte?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">variety of games</a> using Playbyte&#8217;s tools &#8212; including simulators, tower defense games, combat challenges, obbys, murder mystery games, and more.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We made an app called Playbyte that lets you make games on your phone, discover games made by other users, and challenge your friends <a href="https://t.co/FFnMbKG1ls">https://t.co/FFnMbKG1ls</a> <a href="https://t.co/eqhabN3kM1">pic.twitter.com/eqhabN3kM1</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Playbyte (@PlaybyteInc) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlaybyteInc/status/1397259875076481029?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>According to Playbyte founder and CEO Kyle Russell &#8212; previously of Skydio, Andreessen Horowitz, and (disclosure!) TechCrunch &#8212; Playbyte is meant to be a social media app, not just a games app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have this model in our minds for what is required to build a new social media platform,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>What Twitter did for text, Instagram did for photos and TikTok did for video was to combine a constraint with a personalized feed, Russell explains. &#8220;Typically. [they started] with a focus on making these experiences really brief&#8230;So a short, constrained format and dedicated tools that set you up for success to work within that constrained format,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Similarly, Playbyte games have their own set of limitations. In addition to their simplistic nature, the games are limited to five scenes. Thanks to this constraint, a format has emerged where people are making games that have an intro screen where you hit &#8220;play,&#8221; a story intro, a challenging gameplay section, and then a story outro.</p>
<p>In addition to its easy-to-use game building tools, Playbyte also allows game assets to be reused by other game creators. That means if someone who has more expertise makes a game asset using custom logic or which pieced together multiple components, the rest of the user base can benefit from that work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically, we want to make it really easy for people who aren&#8217;t as ambitious to still feel like productive, creative game makers,&#8221; says Russell. &#8220;The key to that is going to be if you have an idea &#8212; like an image of a game in your mind &#8212; you should be able to very quickly search for new assets or piece together other ones you&#8217;ve previously saved. And then just drop them in and mix-and-match &#8212; almost like Legos &#8212; and construct something that&#8217;s 90% of what you imagined, without any further configuration on your part,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>In time, Playbyte plans to monetize its feed with brand advertising, perhaps by allowing creators to drop sponsored assets into their games, for instance. It also wants to establish some sort of patronage model at a later point. This could involve either subscriptions or even NFTs of the games, but this would be further down the road.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The startup had originally began as a web app in 2019, but at the end of last year, the team scrapped that plan and rewrote everything as a native iOS app with its own game engine. That app launched on the App Store this week, after previously maxing out TestFlight&#8217;s cap of 10,000 users.</p>
<p>Currently, it&#8217;s finding traction with younger teenagers who are active on TikTok and other collaborative games, like Roblox, Minecraft, or Fortnite.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are young people who feel inspired to build their own games but have been intimidated by the need to learn to code or use other advanced tools, or who simply don&#8217;t have a computer at home that would let them access those tools,&#8221; notes Russell.</p>
<p>Playbyte is backed by $4 million in pre-seed and seed funding from investors including FirstMark (Rick Heitzmann), Ludlow Ventures (Jonathon Triest and Blake Robbins), Dream Machine (former Editor-in-Chief at TechCrunch, Alexia Bonatsos), and angels such as Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase; Nate Mitchell, co-founder of Oculus; Ashita Achuthan, previously of Twitter; and others.</p>
<p>The app is a free download <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/playbyte/id1551822717">on the App Store</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://technologyonecorp.co.uk/">TechnologyOne</a>, an Australian SaaS enterprise, has agreed to acquire UK-based higher education software provider <a href="https://www.scientia.com/">Scientia</a> for £12 million /$16.6 million in cash.<br />
 <br />
TechnologyOne claims to have 75% of Higher Education institutions in Australia using its software, while Scientia claims 50% market share in the UK.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The ongoing fintech revolution continues to level the playing field where legacy companies have historically dominated startups.</p>
<p>To compete with retail banks, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/all-the-reasons-why-you-should-launch-a-credit-or-debit-card/">many newcomers are offering customers credit and debit cards</a>; developer-friendly APIs make issuance relatively easy, and tools for managing processes like KYC are available off the shelf.</p>
<p>To learn more about the low barriers to entry — and the inherent challenges of creating a unique card offering — reporter Ryan Lawler interviewed:</p>

<p>The barrier to entry for launching hardware startups has fallen; if you can pull off a successful crowdfunding campaign, you&#8217;re likely savvy enough to find a factory overseas that can build your widgets to spec.</p>
<p>But global supply chains are fragile: No one expected an off-course container ship to block the Suez Canal for six days. Due to the pandemic, importers are paying almost $18,000 for shipping containers from China today that cost $3,300 a year ago.</p>
<p>After spending a career spinning up supply chains on three continents, Liteboxer CEO Jeff Morin authored a guide for Extra Crunch for hardware founders.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you’re clear-eyed about the challenges and apply some rigor and forethought to the process, the end result can be hard to match,&#8221; Morin says.</p>

<p>Few people thought about virtual events before the pandemic struck, but this format has fulfilled a unique and important need for organizations large and small since early 2020. But what will virtual events’ value be as more of the world attempts a return to “normal”?</p>
<p>To find out, we caught up with top executives and investors in the sector to learn about the big trends they’re seeing — as the sequel to a survey we did in March 2020.</p>
<p>We surveyed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xiaoyin Qu, founder and CEO, Run The World</li>
<li>Rosie Roca, chief customer officer, Hopin</li>
<li>Hemant Mohapatra, partner, Lightspeed Venture Partners India</li>
<li>Paul Murphy, former investor in Hopin with Northzone (currently co-founder of Katch)</li>

<p>Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim wrapped up TechCrunch’s coverage of the summer cohort from Y Combinator’s Demo Day with an evaluation of how the group fared in comparison to their expectations.</p>
<p>They were surprised by the number of startups focusing on no-and low-code software, and pleased by the unanticipated quantity of new companies focusing on space.</p>
<p>“It seems only fair to note that some categories of startup activity simply met our expectations in terms of popularity,” noting delivery-focused startups including dark stores and kitchens.</p>
<p>Popping up less than expected? Crypto and insurtech.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has delayed plans to roll out its child sexual abuse (CSAM) detection technology that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/">chaotically announced last month</a>, citing feedback from customers and policy groups.</p>
<p>That feedback, if you recall, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apples-csam-detection-tech-is-under-fire-again/">been largely negative</a>. The Electronic Frontier Foundation said this week it had amassed more than 25,000 signatures from consumers. On top of that, close to 100 policy and rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, also <a href="https://cdt.org/insights/international-coalition-calls-on-apple-to-abandon-plan-to-build-surveillance-capabilities-into-iphones-ipads-and-other-products/">called</a> on Apple to abandon plans to roll out the technology.</p>
<p>In a statement on Friday morning, Apple told TechCrunch:</p>
<p>&#8220;Last month we announced plans for features intended to help protect children from predators who use communication tools to recruit and exploit them, and limit the spread of Child Sexual Abuse Material. Based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features.”</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s so-called NeuralHash technology is designed to identify known CSAM on a user’s device without having to possess the image or knowing the contents of the image. Because a user’s photos stored in iCloud are encrypted so that even Apple can’t access the data, NeuralHash instead scans for known CSAM on a user’s device, which Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/interview-apples-head-of-privacy-details-child-abuse-detection-and-messages-safety-features/?tpcc=ECTW2020">claims is more privacy-friendly</a> than the current blanket scanning that cloud providers use.</p>
<p>But security experts and privacy advocates have expressed concern that the system <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life">could be abused</a> by highly resourced actors, like governments, to implicate innocent victims or to manipulate the system to detect other materials that authoritarian nation states find objectionable.</p>
<p>Within a few weeks of announcing the technology, researchers said they were able to create &#8220;hash collisions&#8221; using NeuralHash, effectively <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apples-csam-detection-tech-is-under-fire-again/">tricking the system</a> into thinking two entirely different images were the same.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>iOS 15 is expected out later in the next few weeks.</p>
<p><em>This report has been updated with more detail about NeuralHash and to clarify iCloud Photos are encrypted but not end-to-end encrypted. </em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The mobile app that provides information and reviews on barbers for potential customers while also managing appointments, mobile payments and pricing on the back end for barbers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.thecut.co/">TheCut</a>, a technology platform designed to handle back-end operations for barbers, raised $4.5 million in new funding.</p>
<p>Nextgen Venture Partners led the round and was joined by Elevate Ventures, Singh Capital and Leadout Capital. The latest funding gives theCut $5.35 million in total funding since the company was founded in 2016, founder Obi Omile Jr. told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Omile and Kush Patel created the mobile app that provides information and reviews on barbers for potential customers while also managing appointments, mobile payments and pricing on the back end for barbers.</p>
<p>“Kush and I both had terrible experiences with haircuts, and decided to build an app to help find good barbers,” Omile said. “We found there were great barbers, but no way to discover them. You can do a Google search, but it doesn’t list the individual barber. With theCut, you can discover an individual barber and discover if they are a great fit for you and won’t screw up your hair.”</p>
<p>The app also enables barbers, perhaps for the first time, to have a list of clients and keep notes and photos of hair styles, as well as track visits and spending. By providing payments, barbers can also leverage digital trends to provide additional services and extras to bring in more revenue. On the customer side, there is a search function with barber profile, photos of their work, ratings and reviews, a list of service offerings and pricing.</p>
<p>Omile said there are 400,000 to 600,000 barbers in the U.S., and it is one of the fastest-growth markets. As a result, the new funding will be used to hire additional talent, marketing and to grow the business across the country.</p>
<p>“We’ve gotten to a place where we are hitting our stride and seeing business catapulting, so we are in hiring mode,” he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indeed, the company generated more than $500 million in revenue for barbers since its launch and is adding over 100,000 users each month. In addition, the app averages 1.5 million appointment bookings each month.</p>
<p>Next up, Omile wants to build out some new features like a digital store and the ability to process more physical payments by rolling out a card reader for in-person payments. TheCut will also focus on enabling barbers to have more personal relationships with their customers.</p>
<p>“We are building software to empower people to be the best version of themselves, in this case barbers,” he added. “The relationship with customers is an opportunity for the barber to make specific recommendations on products and create a grooming experience.”</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Leadout founder and managing partner Ali Rosenthal joined the company&#8217;s board of directors. She said Omile and Patel are the kind of founders that venture capitalists look for — experts in their markets and data-driven technologists.</p>
<p>“They had done so much with so little by the time we met them,” Rosenthal added. “They are creating a passionate community and set of modern, tech-driven features that are tailored to the needs of their customers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Editor&#8217;s note:</strong> <em><a href="https://twitter.com/kylebrussell">Kyle Russell</a> is the founder of <a href="https://playbyte.io/">Playbyte</a>, a startup building an app that lets people make games on their phones.</em></p>
<p>Last Friday, Dom Hofmann tweeted the launch of <a href="https://www.lootproject.com/" rel="">Loot</a>, one of his new projects looking at games and game creation through the lens of NFTs:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>If “NFTs,” “gas” and “minting” sound unintelligible, the short version is that this project lets you spend some money to create <strong>a unique list of items</strong> that you could keep in the same wallet (an app like <a href="http://rainbow.me/" rel="">Rainbow</a>) where you’d keep cryptocurrencies or other digital collectibles, typically art (or, as skeptics gleefully note, JPEGs).</p>
<p>I repeat: <strong>a unique list of items. </strong>No artwork, stats to compare quality or even game rules that could inform such stats.</p>
<p>People spent money to get those unique lists. Thousands. And as happens in NFTs, a market quickly formed around these unique lists of items. The “floor,” or minimum price to buy into a Loot “bag,” <a href="https://twitter.com/mikedemarais/status/1432852925697646596?s=21" rel="">shot to thousands of dollars worth of Ethereum</a>. Certain kinds of items in these lists sounded cool and were found to be rare upon analysis of the entire set, and so bags containing them rose in value to extreme heights:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>And people began to fill in those missing elements like art — not fundamentally changing the underlying lists, but creating new works that explicitly reference the items in particular lists:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>And like the lists themselves, people began taking an algorithmic approach to generating that art:</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>By August 31st, there was a legible community of people…</p>
<ul>
<li>investing in bags containing certain kinds of items;</li>
<li>creating tools for visualizing Loot items and monitoring price fluctuations in this niche market;</li>
<li>working on new derivative projects, like creating Realms for a theoretical adventurer with the gear in a Loot bag to explore:</li>

<p>Except, there’s still no game rules for these items — including what it would even mean to have a character equipping them!</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In less than a week, a community has gone from lists of text to infinitely many illustrations of those items to worlds for those items to reside in and characters to wield them. All from taking simple primitives and generating context around them that gives them value.</p>
<p>It’s pretty magical stuff. But even if there’s some speculative angle to the creation happening, how many people get to participate if these bags cost tens of thousands of dollars at a minimum? On the one hand: If you just think the game of making up a game is fun, because all of these bags and items live on the Ethereum network, then you can still make things that incorporate them at no cost (short of the painful fees currently associated with using Ethereum).</p>
<p>And if it really matters to you to have those unique objects in a wallet of your own so you can really participate, people are thinking of interesting paths there, as well:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Synthetic Loot</p>
<p>&#8211; returns a &quot;virtual nft&quot; of loot based on a given wallet<br />&#8211; b/c the wallet is the seed, only one bag per wallet<br />&#8211; because it&#39;s not a &quot;real&quot; nft, no minting, transferring, selling, etc</p>

<p>If that’s all too jargon-y, I’ll again summarize: There are feasible paths to making it free to “have” these items for the purpose of playing with the growing set of inter-compatible apps or games that might incorporate Loot — you just won’t have a Legit Bag with rare items that could sell for lots of money.</p>
<p>Oh, and what if you like some of the items in a Loot bag, but wish your adventurer could mix-and-match with other items from the broader set that just dropped?</p>

<p>Less than a week and already getting disrupted by unbundling!</p>
<h2>I’m sorry, why is this interesting?</h2>
<p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe started with Marvel Comics taking out a billion-dollar loan to finance the first four movies based on its iconic superhero characters. The seeds of awareness of these characters had been planted in the minds of the masses through decades of appearances in comics and TV leading up to their first appearances in blockbuster films. Decades of perhaps hundreds of writers and artists were getting paid to create fantastical stories for those characters that people would want to read and that would get them hooked to come back for the next issue. People came to closely associate themselves with characters with kind of funny origins (bit by a radioactive spider!).</p>
<p>This all happened in a top-down, corporate, mass-production context. A few creatives at Marvel did high-leverage work on a freelance or in-house basis, printers made a ton of copies and a supply chain got those issues to comics shops and dime stores across the country. Like dominoes, Stan Lee thinks of some new superhero (pitch: this guy’s not a hippy, he’s a weapons manufacturer industrialist!) to five decades later, Avengers: Endgame and Black Panther warp the definition of blockbuster forever.</p>
<p>But what if someone wanted to create an MCU competitor as a community, instead of going head-to-head with Disney?</p>
<p>Extrapolating from the last week of Loot…</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2197922 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/https___bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_fa758d5e-644d-4c12-9d5a-9bcc41ed61ad_460x184.gif" alt="" width="460" height="184" /></p>
<p>You’d release a contract to generate sets of superhero names and associated powers. People would mint those heroes and they would begin to trade on the open market. People would build tools that determine which powers are more rare, especially around ones that sound cool (“flight” is a gimme).</p>
<p>They’d imagine their hero, illustrate them themselves and commission artists who could make them look cool. Eventually more technical folks in the community would do the heavy lifting to piece together tools that could generate art for characters in a common style, or be customizable by some key parameters.</p>
<p>Eventually, people would commission crossover art, and then you’re only a step away from shared storylines (increase the value of multiple characters with a single commissioned piece!).</p>
<p>DAOs, or decentralized groups who come together to create new projects in the crypto space or even &#8220;just” invest together, might buy up more popular characters and commission more elaborate visual stories with the aim of boosting the value of that underlying item containing a hero name + powers and any popular artworks that they inspired.</p>
<p>And assuming the project’s originators went with the direction of the Loot zeitgeist, all of this would be IP that could be re-used and remixed by anyone. That might sound crazy — isn’t the point to own it, and the point of owning it is to control how it’s used?</p>
<p>That’s the Disney status quo. In a world of projects like Loot, you want to reinforce the value of the NFT you own — and that value reflects that NFT’s renown and reputation. Echoing the phrase “all press is good press”: Any remix is a good remix. To be referenced is to still be culturally relevant. So if you own an NFT describing Arachnid Person, you want to contribute to an environment where as many people want to include Arachnid Person in their works as possible so that Arachnid Man No. 1 becomes something worth owning.</p>
<p>I’m really just expanding on Dylan Field:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Feels like two paths are emerging in NFT space.</p>
<p>(1) Build a universe but hold onto IP. Ex: <a href="https://twitter.com/larvalabs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@larvalabs</a> deal with UTA (<a href="https://t.co/OxOq106hiK">https://t.co/OxOq106hiK</a>)</p>
<p>(2) Form a community to build a universe. Give all the IP away. See what happens. Ex: <a href="https://twitter.com/lootproject?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@lootproject</a> </p>
<p>Personally like approach #2 better!</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>And John Palmer rightly emphasizes something special: The lack of anybody who can say “no,” as people try to figure out how to make Loot cool:</p>
