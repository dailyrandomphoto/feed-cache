										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israel’s startup ecosystem <a href="https://www.ivc-online.com/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=jtuNmDGPhqY%3d&amp;portalid=0&amp;timestamp=1608630794894">raised record amounts of funding</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/israel-tech-exits-int/led-by-ipos-israeli-tech-exits-jump-to-record-15-billion-in-2020-pwc-idUSKBN28W1IH">produced 19 IPOs</a> in 2020, despite the pandemic. Now tech companies across industries are poised for an even better year, according to more than a dozen investors we talked to in the country.</p>
<p>Mainstay sectors like cybersecurity continue to matter, they said, but are maturing (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/2020-was-a-record-year-for-israels-security-startup-ecosystem/">more about that here</a>). Some people are more excited by emerging areas like artificial intelligence, which has been a focus of the country’s military for years, and like cybersecurity is now producing many fresh teams of founders. Other investors felt that a broader range of industries, like fintech and biotech, would eventually produce the biggest companies in the country.</p>
<p>Overall, local investors cited the country’s focus on global markets from day one, general support from the Israeli government and deep relationships with Silicon Valley and other global tech centers as additional factors that are powering it forward today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h2>Boaz Dinte, Qumra Capital</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
At Qumra, we get excited about companies that disrupt traditional industries while doing good and improving quality of life. Our portfolio includes some great examples such as Fiverr that has disrupted the labor market by unlocking the global talent pool, or Talkspace, which is providing access to therapy to all.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Our latest investment is At-bay, the insurance company for the digital age. At-bay offers an end-to-end solution with comprehensive risk assessment, a tailored cyber insurance policy, and active, risk-management service.</p>
<p>Traditional insurers don’t have the know-how to properly and continually assess risk and approach digital risk the same way they approach physical products, through a statistical model that tries to predict the future based on past events. This a great example of company that is disrupting a traditional market.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
As a growth fund, we are sector agnostic and diversify our investments across multiple industries. Would be happy to add proptech and agritech startups to our portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
We stay clear of nonregulated industries and do not invest in cryptocurrency-related companies, gambling, etc.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We are focused on Israeli and Israeli-related companies. As growth companies they may have moved to NY or CA with their headquarters and maintained their R&amp;D in Israel.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
A great amount of talent is cultivated in the military, which has spawned innovative cyber, AI and machine-learning companies. Also, significant experience and know-how have been accumulated here in big data analytics. SaaS models and cloud technologies have eliminated some of the barriers for Israeli companies and enable companies to quickly set up and set up a proof of concept.</p>
<p>A few highlights in our portfolio include AppsFlyer, JoyTunes, Riskified, Talkspace and Guardicore.</p>
<p>Data-driven AppsFlyer, spearheaded by Oren Kaniel, is an exciting mobile-attribution company that is rapidly growing ($200 million+ ARR in 2020) yet maintains a unique DNA. JoyTunes, led by Yuval Kaminka has developed a music-learning platform that has skyrocketed in 2020. The platform has been widely adopted doing so much good for so many people in a short amount of time. Guardicore is disrupting the traditional firewall market by providing fine-grained segmentation for greater attack resistance. Led by CEO Pavel Gurevich the company is seeing excellent traction. Riskified makes e-ommerce easier and safer and enables a thriving e-commerce environment. Founder duo Eido Gal and Assaf Feldman are a powerhouse of vision and execution capabilities. Talkspace has not only created the leading online therapy business, but is actually improving the quality of life of hundreds of thousands of Americans, which are gaining access to therapy for the first time. Founding husband and wife Oren and Roni Frank are the ultimate power couple — creating an incredible business while creating some real impact.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Tech investors must make sure that Israel is part of their portfolio. Same as VC funds are deeply acquainted with Silicon Valley, tech investors cannot ignore this hub of innovation that has produced global market leading companies and serial entrepreneurs</p>
<p><strong>What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Products and services that require anything requiring on-site visits and integration as well as a long sales cycle involving face-to-face meetings and customer education are negatively impacted during this time. The upside is that companies that will develop a remote and simplified approach can reap gains from this time. Such an example is Augury from our portfolio that has developed an end-to-end solution to provide manufacturers with early, actionable and comprehensive insights into machine health and performance. This has proved to be of crucial value in the supply chain during the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy?</strong><br />
Earlier in the month we have closed our third fund, Qumra III, at $260 million. This was done in a short time in a period when traveling and face-to-face meetings were impossible. Commitments to this fund, which is larger than its predecessor, included increased investments form existing LPs as well as new LPs from new geographies. This is a vote of confidence in the Israeli growth market in general and in Qumra in particular and has been a great achievement and source of hope going forward.</p>
<h2>Rafi Carmeli, Viola Growth</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Platforms that are transforming how people and businesses operate, go about their business or leverage their core assets, using superior products, data and AI.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Zoomin Software.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Transformation of the CFO and treasury suite of tools.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
A+ team, superior product demonstrated with business/market traction and a sizable market opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong></p>
<p>Any area that needs to compete both with incumbents and also a set of already successful &#8220;new age&#8221; companies that made the first step of meaningful disruption.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
More than 50%.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong></p>
<p>Plenty of interesting opportunities but like many places, competitive around the best of the best.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Definitely see changes in evolution of young startups given the behavioral changes caused by COVID.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? </strong><strong>What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Any area that is exposed to mass physical engagement (pockets in travel, food, sports, etc.) are at risk. Remote engagement and productivity have potential to disrupt more industries, such as corporate events/virtual events.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Founders are generally resilient and based on their view on the company&#8217;s position post-COVID (winner/at risk) and the capital resources available, should decide on appropriate level of caution/aggressiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes in many areas. In general software has proven to be a winner and specifically SaaS as a business model has proven its resilience.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
The speed and decisiveness at which humanity acted to adjust to the effects and aftermath of the pandemic, and importantly to proactively get us all out of the health and economic crisis as quickly as possible (e.g., the speed of creating vaccines).</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong><br />
If something won&#8217;t matter in five years, don&#8217;t waste more than five minutes worrying about it now — easier said than done!</p>
<h2>Yonatan Mandelbaum, TLV Partners</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Fintech (specifically embedded finance or financial SaaS), synthetic bio. This is in addition to traditional focus areas that we remain bullish on — cloud infrastructure, ML infra and cyber.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Unit.co, meshpayments.com.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
There simply isn&#8217;t enough innovation in fintech from the Israeli ecosystem. Our locale has managed to produce three of the most prolific insurtech companies (Next, Lemonade and Hippo), has a strong history of successful fintech companies (Payoneer, Forter, Riskified) and even has a few very promising earlier-stage ventures (Unit, Melio). That said, only about 10% of our overall deal flow are fintech companies. Areas such as vertical banking, embedded finance, compliance as a service and consumer finance consistently get overlooked by young Israeli founders.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
The cliche VC answer: strong team, big market. This remains constant during all times.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
(1) Cybersecurity — with one caveat. Israel will always be at the forefront of cyber innovation, and thus there will always be an opportunity for fledgling cyber companies in Israel. That said, it is 100% oversaturated, and there are too many examples of strong technical founders creating &#8220;yet another&#8221; SaaS security startup. (2) Remote work collaboration — clearly an issue that needs solving, but we have unsurprisingly seen an absurd amount of companies in the space. They are largely reactionary companies, and the companies that will prove to be the winners in this market have already been in the market for quite some time (Zoom, Alack, Miro, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
More than 50%.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Fintech and bio are very well-positioned to thrive in Israel. In 10 years I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if Israel is more well-known for those two sectors than it is for its cyber companies. Some companies to keep an eye on: Next Insurance, Unit, Mesh Payments, Aidoc, Deepcure, Immunai.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
I&#8217;m not saying anything new, but Israel is known as the startup nation for a reason. There is an incredible, thriving entrepreneurship culture that breeds fascinating companies weekly. Interestingly, valuation trends seem to trail the U.S. by about 12-18 months. So for later-stage VCs around the globe, Israel can represent an interesting opportunity to do deals of the same quality that they are doing in their locale, but for a more reasonable price.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Not particularly. Israel a small country, and even if there may be a residential exodus from Tel Aviv, there won&#8217;t be a commercial one.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Travel and proptech are more exposed due to COVID-19.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
COVID hasn&#8217;t impacted our investment strategy much. We have remained steady in our search for interesting early-stage software opportunities and our commitment to invest substantial amounts even at the seed round. The biggest worries of the portfolio founders surround slower enterprise sales cycles due to WFH and smaller budgets from potential customers. Our early advice to founders was to ensure runway for 18 months in order to weather the storm. Recently however, after witnessing the incredibly founder-friendly fundraising landscape, our advice has been to put the pedal to the metal, reach certain benchmarks and raise capital.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
No, there still hasn&#8217;t been enough time. That said, I will say that the initial enthusiasm of WFH has faded. The vast majority of our companies are clamoring to be back in the office.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
My grandparents both recently passed away from COVID-19. Despite the tragic loss that it was for my family, there was one moment that truly gave me hope. I had the opportunity to visit my grandmother in the COVID ward at a local hospital before she passed (in full protective gear of course). Before entering the ward, while the nurses were going over the protocols with me and four other individuals who were there to visit their sick family members, I was surprised to realize that the five of us in the room were an eclectic bunch. Jewish, Muslim, religious and not, young and old. In that moment, we all gave each other strength, wished each other well and it gave me hope that we can truly become a unified country in the near future. The next exponential growth that occurs in the Israeli ecosystem will be when there is an influx of minorities (Arabs, ultra-Orthodox) into the workforce.</p>
<h2>Natalie Refuah, Viola Growth</h2>

RapidAPI.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Exciting team, hypergrowth, disruptiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Cyber, automotive.</p>

DevOps, cyber, enterprise software.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Very positively.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
There will be changes, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19?</strong></p>
<p>E-commerce tech-related companies will thrive.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
We lowered our check size per company. My advice — if you are &#8220;with COVID trend&#8221; push hard, if you are &#8220;against COVID trend&#8221; — preserve cash.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
More time with my kids, but in general I miss hugging people when i meet them, and I prefer meeting people face to face.</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong><br />
Let the vaccine go!</p>
<h2>Daniel Cohen, Viola Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Games, vertical AI and AI agencies, digital health.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Hyperguest, creating direct connectivity between hotels and OTAs. It&#8217;s the perfect next-gen travel infrastructure for the world post-pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
The biggest trend in the post-COVID world will be the new work environment. We would love to see more startups that will create corporate solutions that are focused on the future of work. That can be at the workplace or at the home.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Unique, innovative go-to-market. Leveraging technology to reach consumers in a more innovative way. It&#8217;s basically innovation in growth hacking, not only in great products.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Cybersecurity — the market is real and important, but there are too many startups with small niche solutions.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
More than 50%.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
The most exciting trends locally are everything AI with focus on B2B apps. Same goes with digital health and consumer-focused health applications.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Israel is the #1 region globally in unicorn production, probably the hottest startup region right now.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
No.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong></p>
<p>The biggest change has been on company culture, which is hard to maintain in a distributed work-from-home environment. Companies need to be innovative and creative in maintaining/building culture, which was so much easier pre-COVID.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic? What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong></p>
<p>The announcements around the vaccines make it clear that the end of the pandemic is near. I think 2021 will be amazing.</p>
<h2>Ben Wiener, Jumpspeed Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Jumpspeed invests exclusively in pre-seed and seed-stage startups from the Jerusalem startup ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
MDGo.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Not really, we are sector agnostic/bottom-up rather than thesis driven.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
10x better, paradigm-shift solution to a large, near-term, acute business problem, produced and led by a complementary founding team (hacker+hustler+designer).</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Cybersecurity, crypto, telehealth.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
EXCLUSIVELY, see above.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Jerusalem is well-positioned in certain clusters such as computer vision, general enterprise SaaS, AI/ML and healthtech.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Our city&#8217;s startup ecosystem is underexploited and generates a few fantastic under-the-radar opportunities per year.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Yes.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Little direct impact on strategy because by definition I am investing in things that will go to market and ripen over years.</p>
<p>Founders&#8217; biggest worries are employee well-being, after that access to overseas customers and markets.</p>
<p>Advice to founders: Stay calm and healthy, play the long game, take care of yourself, your family and your employees, don&#8217;t panic or cut staff reactively.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes but not that I can attribute directly to the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
No specific moment, just the general resilience and ability to adapt to the radically changing new realities that our portfolio founders have exhibited.</p>

“Entrepreneurship in advanced technology, is not merely a matter of decision-making; it is a matter of imposing cognitive order on situations that are repeatedly ill-defined.” — W. Brian Arthur, &#8220;The Nature of Technology&#8221;</p>
<p>No situation has been this ill-defined in the past century. Keep calm and carry on :-)</p>
<h2>Inbal Perlman, TAU Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
At TAU, we are interested in a variety of sectors and evaluate each potential investment independently. In regards to trends, we look at trends with a grain of salt understanding that trends might come and go. When we see a particular trend, we try to understand if there is a need behind the trend and see beyond the initial hype. We want to assure that a startup is meeting a real need in the market. We are particularly interested in technologies that do not require too much time and capital to get to market.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
We invested in a company called Xtend, which is creating human-machine telepresence allowing us to “step into” a machine, anywhere in the world, breaking the limits of physical reality. In particular, it develops solutions that allow people to interact with drones and other unmanned machine technologies. The company’s technology enables humans to extend themselves into the action by allowing them to virtually sit inside the drone for various tactical missions. What is exciting about Xtend is how the technology can be implemented in a variety of ways from defense and homeland security to reimagining entertainment, gaming and cinematography.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
We like to see startups that are disrupting traditional industries by solving basic challenges and needs with innovative means. There are some industries that haven’t changed in many years. And if you create a technology that can be simply integrated into existing markets, it has the potential to gain significant traction and drastically change an industry. So we would love to see more startups going &#8220;back to the basics&#8221; asking questions about commonly felt pain points and innovating to solve those pains.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
We want to get the feeling from the entrepreneur that they are professional, ready for the entrepreneurial journey, have the right mindset and skill set and will conquer the world. We understand that with early-stage startups, the product or service will likely change and therefore pay significant attention to the entrepreneurs themselves as an early indicator of future success.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Technology trends that often come and go can create an oversaturated market for startups. For example, previously there was hype around drones. Now, only the strongest companies in the drone industry have stuck around. Today, there are many startups responding to needs exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic such as remote learning and remote work. It is important to filter out whether these are solutions that will be around for a while and survive a post-COVID world or are temporary.</p>
<p>We are more cautious about particular industries. In edtech, those who have successfully done exits, have done so at low amounts ($200 million-$300 million). For us, we are seeking larger exits. Blockchain is a difficult sector because it lacks a clear regulatory environment, subsequently raising many questions. Similarly, the cannabis industry also does not have a fixed regulatory environment across countries. Any small regulation change can highly impact the company. These are the sectors and areas that we are more cautious around.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We invest in startups that are exclusively Israeli startups but are targeted for a global market. At TAU Ventures, we have 1,000 sq. meter coworking office space where majority of our portfolio companies and accelerator program companies sit on a daily basis. On a daily basis we are engaging with our startups through kitchen chats and hallway encounters. Through our coworking space, we are directly investing in our local ecosystem both supporting entrepreneurs and identifying rising entrepreneurs.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
In Israel, many Israeli entrepreneurs bring a high level of technical capabilities that they learn in the army such as in cyber and AI. After acquiring this knowledge and ability, they are well-prepared and able to transfer it to the commercial area. This is why we see many successful startups coming out of Israel particularly in these fields.<br />
For example, founders of our portfolio company, SWIMM all come from leading elite tech training units in the army (Aram, Talpiot) and before founding SWIMM, established ITC (Israel Tech Challenge, a nonprofit high-tech academy that offers in-demand tech training programs in English in Tel Aviv, inspired by the IDF’s 8200 unit).<br />
Furthermore, Tel Aviv University (TAU), our affiliated university, is a leading research institute and academic leader in AI, engineering and other sciences and is producing entrepreneurs with high levels of knowledge. 50% of entrepreneurs in Israel have studied at TAU. And TAU ranked eighth worldwide as a top university producing VC-backed entrepreneurs, and the first outside of the US. So we are very excited by the added advantage we have in being affiliated closely with the university and the talent which it is producing.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
The significant advantage of Israel is its small size. Because there is little to no local market, startups automatically think globally in their marketing and growth strategies. To best understand Israel and Israelis, it’s important to understand the influence of the military and the reality of thriving in a complex political environment in the Middle East. Military service is compulsory for all Israelis at the age of 18. The army plays an important role in the socialization, education, skills development, social network and fabric of Israeli society. Many personal and professional networks are the result of army service. As Israelis, we live in an environment where we need to constantly be innovative and one step ahead to survive. This innovative mindset has been instilled in our state of mind and cultural DNA.<br />
We are proud that In Israel we have academics at the highest level in the world across a variety of fields. Multinationals from all over the world have local R&amp;D centers or innovation hubs in Israel to source from the local talent pool. This presence of multinationals creates mutual exposure for both startups and corporates alike.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
At TAU Ventures, the majority of our portfolio and accelerator companies sit next to us at our 1,000 sq. meter coworking space. At our offices, we love seeing our founders and their employees on a regular basis. This is how we have successfully created a strong familial culture at our VC. Throughout COVID, companies have continued to come in person to the office. This has reinforced to us that there is no exchange for face-to-face engagement. As early-stage investors, we understand that at this stage it is all about the people. At the end of the day, people want to be around people and you can not replace the experience of sharing a cup of coffee and shaking someone&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19?</strong><br />
COVID affected companies in different ways. For some, it boosted business and for others it led them to shift their strategy and approach. Our companies who had clients in the travel industry or airports were obviously affected. In this situation, the company looked at their technology and reconsidered where and how their technology could be relevant to other consumers and industries. This particular company saw an opportunity to shift to logistics and supply chain clients. COVID is presenting opportunities for companies to reevaluate their target market and discover new applications of their technology for different purposes.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
As a result of COVID, we have come to understand that things simply are taking more time, such as processes of raising funds or achieving the next milestone. We are patient and empathetic to the experiences of our startups.</p>
<p>The startups’ most significant worry is that they will not succeed to raise enough funds before reaching their next milestone. And more so, if they are unable to prove their achievement milestones in time, then they might be forced to close business. As a result, our startups are raising more funds during this time to assure a longer runway. Our startups are also keenly aware of how periods of crisis might call on them to pivot and adapt to the current circumstances. Startups are making decisions around adjusting budgets, determining whether customers are still relevant, anticipating whether the circumstances are temporary or will renormalize and ultimately whether there is a completely new path to pivot to.<br />
In light of the circumstances, we are advising our portfolio startups to raise more funds in next rounds to have runway for at least 1.5 years and not to be afraid of making drastic changes (i.e., pivots, changing budget, raising more funds).</p>
<p>As a fund, we are assuring our entrepreneurs that if they choose to change paths, it is okay. Working from a coworking space alongside many of our founders enables us to stay updated on the startups, foster a strong internal ecosystem and network, and provide ongoing psychological safety for our entrepreneurs, which is ever so needed during these unprecedented times for startups.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Two of our portfolio companies have experienced impressive growth and are thriving in 2020.<br />
1. Gaviti is a SaaS company that specializes in receivable collections acceleration. Its system maps out the collection process to spot inefficiencies and optimize clients&#8217; procedures. Specifically during COVID, many companies had increased economic pain points related to generating cash flow on a timely, efficient basis. Gaviti’s solution helps companies manage their collection payments. As a result of of the economic crisis this year, Gaviti saw fast growth in clients and have thrived during 2020.<br />
2. Medorion understands that health companies and hospitals want us to get regular health checkouts. Using AI and behavioral science, Medorion is driving people to take action for their own health by increasing engagement and communication between insurance companies and patients. During COVID, they are combating the coronavirus pandemic by applying their technology to create highly personalized engagement and communication plans targeted at those individuals who are at highest risk of COVID-19.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
In recent months, it is inspiring to see our entrepreneurs continue fighting despite the uncertain economic and global circumstances. Many of our companies are continuing to recruit and hire. Our founders are resilient and are finding creative means to succeed. It is also a blessing to have a large coworking space hosting the offices of 10 startups and to see employees continue to come in to the office day in and day out working with their teams.</p>

<h2>David (Dede) Goldschmidt, Samsung Catalyst Fund</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Digital transformation and AI.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Solarisbank (Germany).</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
AI-acceleration technologies seems to be overcrowded.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
Less than 50%.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
AI, cyber security. Excited about our portfolio company Innoviz (LiDAR). Excited about Avigdor Willenz, serial entrepreneur, including our portfolio company Habana Labs that was acquired for $2 billion.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Highly dynamic and competitive, very global approach of entrepreneurs, risk takers, &#8220;can-do&#8221; approach.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t expect that to happen because a strong ecosystem of entrepreneurs, investors and service providers would be needed, and it takes years for that to grow.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19?</strong><br />
Industries serving brick-and-mortars are likely to get weakened by accelerated transition to online.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Our advice has been to be careful with cash. There is a disconnect between the strong momentum in the tech financing vis-a-vis overall economic crisis (unemployment, governments deficits, etc.). We have yet to see the full impact of COVID-19 on tech startups and better be prepared for that.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, for pure digital plays.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Frankly, I remain concerned because of the disconnect alluded to above. Vaccine momentum brings some hope, but too early to tell.</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong><br />
I am very concerned from potential crunch in early stage. While overall financing numbers are growing almost across all geographies, investments are heavily weighted toward later stage and unicorns, and much fewer new companies are being formed. This will have dramatic impact on the tech ecosystem a few years out, if it does not change in 2021.</p>
<h2>Dror Nahumi, Norwest Venture Partners</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
We are a large fund that invests in early-to-late-stage companies across a wide range of sectors with a focus on consumer, enterprise and healthcare. My focus is primarily in Israeli companies and I’m seeing many exciting startups in security, SaaS, enterprise and cloud infrastructure, robotics and semiconductors.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
We are naturally excited about all our latest investments. I recently invested in three seed-stage companies that are in stealth mode: an open-source cloud infrastructure company, a people analytics (HR) SaaS company and a next-generation business-intelligence platform.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
I believe there is a massive opportunity for startups to develop new solutions to fuel the digitization of next-generation enterprises. We’re seeing innovation and activity in this sector, but there’s so much more to be done, especially in light of challenges and vulnerabilities that COVID-19 has exposed. The hottest areas will be in human resources, production, security, infrastructure, sales and remote work.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
We look for a great team, strong intellectual property and compelling execution. The new product idea can be a replacement (i.e., replace existing products that are aging, low performance) or a new category. Gong.io is a great example of a new category we invested in early on. We created the new “revenue intelligence” category that offers businesses automated, unfiltered and real-time insights on customer interactions and deals. This helps businesses understand what’s actually being said to transform the way they go to market.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Security is currently oversaturated. There are too many companies doing similar things, which can make it difficult for newcomers to break through. Additionally, most emerging security startups are all claiming to use machine learning and AI to combat the next level of breaches. These are important areas to focus on, but it’s getting harder for these companies to differentiate themselves. That aside, we have made several great investments in security over the years and will continue to invest in great teams.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
Our team in Israel is 100% focused on our local market.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Numerous industries in the Israeli market are poised to thrive and are doing so currently. Examples include startups in the security, SaaS, enterprise and the cloud infrastructure space, and even consumer services. We are especially excited to continue to witness the growth and success of Gong, VAST Data, WekaIO, Cynet, Wiliot, ActiveFence, Ermetic and SundaySky while building new companies who are still in the stealth stage.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
At Norwest and especially among our Israel portfolio companies, we’ve been able to let our companies mature. We’ve given them the time and support they need to reach maturity. This is a very different approach than what we are seeing in other environments.</p>
<p>Today, growth comes before M&amp;A and companies get valuations much quicker. In past years, it was hard to raise money but it’s not so difficult now. In Israel, inside sales and marketing analytics allow companies to sell more effectively now than in the last decade. This gives entrepreneurs flexibility, room to expand into other markets and the ability to hire top talent globally versus just within their own region.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Israel is so small that you are never really too far outside a major city. We expect our startup hub to stay intact even if individuals and businesses choose to move slightly outside of the main CBD.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
The travel industry has been massively impacted in every market globally since the COVID-19 outbreak. That said, that means there is a huge opportunity to fill gaps based on business and consumer needs as we approach a post-pandemic normal.</p>
<p>I would say that solutions with huge potential are those centered on hybrid workforces as enterprises rethink the future of work. These have the potential to significantly benefit from the pandemic in the short and long term.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
COVID-19 has not impacted our investment strategy. However, in recent conversations with our portfolio companies, it’s clear that brands can emerge stronger than ever with an adaptable strategy, adjusted expectations, strong marketing and B2C communications, and compassionate leadership.</p>
<p>Over the past several months, we’ve advised companies in our portfolio to focus on building their business while prioritizing the safety of their workforce, which could mean further extending work-from-home policies or making remote work a standard option in their hiring practices. Companies’ ability to innovate and adapt while building their business around the new normal will be better positioned to succeed in a post-COVID landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
While it’s not one particular moment, there were many times this past year where our portfolio companies faced major challenges due to the pandemic and were still able to continue to expand their businesses. Every sales quarter that shows growth and success gives me hope.</p>
<h2>Sharin Fisher, Fort Ross Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
I&#8217;m mostly excited about AI/ML technologies, cybersecurity companies and the global opportunity in B2B SaaS companies in general; companies that help to optimize business processes and boost efficiency (e.g., one of our portfolio companies, Kryon, is operating in the robotic process automation space, evaluating business processes, and recommending which ones to automate in order to free up underutilized human talent). We are seeing many successful Israeli SaaS companies across the board, from marketing and collaboration tools, business intelligence products, to payment systems.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
My latest investment was in a B2B SaaS company that disrupts a huge market. I&#8217;m mostly excited about the team, which contains senior executives and second-time entrepreneurs with domain expertise.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong></p>
<p>We are looking for companies that have a big market, a compelling story and a clear path to building a large business. When we invest, companies already have traction, a diverse customer base, established and repeatable sales process and metrics. So, when we dive deeper into the company&#8217;s metrics we would like to see they support the company’s assumptions and ability to scale up properly.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
WFH enablement tools (from security to communication tools).</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We are a global VC with a distributed team, focused on investing in midstage companies based in the U.S. and Israel, that can become global leaders. I&#8217;m leading our investments in the Israeli companies, globally.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Israel is well-positioned to build and grow large companies that can become segment leaders. We are seeing many leading companies across multiple sectors such as mobility (Moovit, Mobileye), cybersecurity (Armis, Cybereason, SentinelOne), fintech (Lemonade, Payoneer, eToro), information technology (Jfrog, Snyk), etc.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
The Israeli ecosystem has matured significantly over the last decade, mainly due to repeat entrepreneurs who bring knowledge and relevant experience to the table. They aspire to build meaningful companies. On top of that, there&#8217;s more available late-stage capital, allowing companies to stay private longer and become mega-acquisitions/IPO.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
The COVID-19 crisis has impacted Israeli founders in terms of how and from where they work. As many Israeli startups aim to tap into the U.S. market, they usually relocate pretty early on, mainly to build relationships with potential customers. Since the pandemic has created a situation where you have to sell your product/service remotely, physical location has become less relevant. In the short term, I believe we&#8217;ll see more Israeli founders working out of Israel, especially when taking into account the advantages (e.g., lower cost of living compared to other places like NYC/San Francisco). In the long run, there&#8217;s a high probability that founders who can keep the same sales efficiency remotely will continue to work out of their home country.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
All of the segments we look at are thriving or haven&#8217;t changed significantly. I&#8217;m mostly interested in startups that are able to sell remotely and have an established inside sales team with a simple integration/deployment, because I believe they are in a better position to scale faster even in this climate.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Our investment strategy remains the same; we are still looking to back companies that can become global leaders and aspire to disrupt huge markets. In terms of the work with our portfolio companies, our founders have already made the needed adjustments and are now more focused on capital efficiency and expanding the runway.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Most of our portfolio adapted to the crisis quite fast and have enough runway to reach their next milestone. For some of our portfolio companies, especially those that support the digital transformation, the pandemic has created business opportunities and accelerated the adoption of their technology. As a result, we deployed additional capital to help them leverage this momentum.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Although the pandemic has created uncertainty for all of us, we have still been seeing more (+14) Israeli companies reaching unicorn status/going public during the past months.</p>

<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />

<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy?</strong><br />
COVID hasn&#8217;t strongly affected our overall strategy other than a slowdown in March/April. The biggest worry is inadequate funding/runway.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Realizing that we landed in this pandemic on a moment in history that we had the tools needed to enable a large amount of the world&#8217;s population to continue working without having to be in a specific physical location.</p>

I don&#8217;t see the pandemic having that effect. Hubs will remain as are.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19?</strong><br />
Anything relying on on-prem slowed down; this can be semiconductors and retail. but it&#8217;s recovering.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Not really, we invest the same amount into the same amount of companies at same stages as before.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, deals are closing, financing is taking place as well as M&amp;As.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Simply lively investment atmosphere, new up rounds and several M&amp;A processes emerging.</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong><br />
Careful optimism, raise aggressively and cash up when possible, refresh the pipeline and get to it, corporates are back into closing deals.</p>

We see a lot of could monitoring services/SaaS cloud startups all competing with very similar technologies.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
Israel 85%; USA 15% — always looking to expand in the U.S. market as well.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
StageOne portfolio companies: Coralogix, Silverfort, Epsagon, Avanan, Neuroblade. Other companies: OwnBackup/RunAI/Verbit/Indegy — all based in Israel.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Less relevant for Israel and more for the U.S., but yes we will probably see new founders from different geographies, which is a good thing, giving new opportunities to people that before may have not considered starting a company.</p>
<p><strong>What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
We do see that COVID-19 has less of an effect on the cybersecurity industry as many organizations are looking for new solutions, as the risk of cyberattacks increases due to remote working and refocusing a lot of their activity to the digital world.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Our companies continue to adapt and make the necessary changes and plans for the near future. Most of the companies have continued the work-from-home policy.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Seeing our companies continue to grow and expand both in people and product. They all adapted to the situation for both the short term and long run. They have continued to raise funds and some companies have even developed additional products to assist with COVID-19-related issues.</p>
<h2>Ayal Itzkoviz, partner, Pitango First</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Disruption in traditional markets yearning innovation, such as retail, insurtech, logistics, etc.</p>
<p>B2B2B: Companies no longer wish to build things they can buy. Buying key components of the product/software enables companies to focus on the innovation side. One example is Frontegg &#8212; the company provides a set of pre-built, essential SaaS product capabilities that can easily and seamlessly integrate within any new or existing SaaS application. This enables dev teams to focus on perfecting the truly differentiating and valuable features at the heart of their SaaS offering. Another viable example is Stripe and its offering in the payments market.</p>
<p>Cyber: 2020 taught us many lessons, one of them is that tech is just getting more exciting as digital transformation is enhanced, and the other is that the digital revolution presents cyber challenges that didn’t exist before. This results in continued opportunities for disruption in this domain.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Frontegg &#8212; a startup that transforms the way SaaS is being built, so that developers don’t need to develop nondifferentiating code and features. Frontegg provides a state of the art SaaS-as-a-service platform, perfectly integrated within the company’s stack and allowing it to do what it’s best at: building their own product. Frontegg is the first pre-built suite of universal SaaS capabilities, enabling teams to focus on core features, shorten time-to-market and drive user adoption. Frontegg’s mission is to accelerate the delivery of enterprise-grade SaaS applications while providing the safest, most secure and optimal user experience.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
First: more open-source projects. They do exist, but usually operate under the radar and come out of stealth mode when they’re already mature and beyond the phase of seed and stage on which Pitango First is focused.</p>
<p>Quantum computing, in our view, has reached a point of no return. We’ll be happy to see entrepreneurs, scientists and business people in Israel jumping on the opportunity wagon already now, and build companies now, before the quantum market begins what will surely be an exponential growth.</p>
<p>Lastly are startups with a double bottom line, i.e., startups that while solving a pain point in the market they’re in and have a potential to become category leader, also address an impact category. Pitango is the first VC to integrate ESG practices into its mainstream activities. As part of this strategy, and as a first step, we are focusing on our vast portfolio of companies and work closely with them to embed</p>
<p>ESG into their core practices through a “migration” process.</p>
<p>Pitango aims to move the needle in the venture capital space through the &#8220;AND&#8221; philosophy: profit AND purpose, capital AND impact. Pitango is introducing a new paradigm of how venture capital does impact and integrates the &#8220;AND&#8221; philosophy by turning to a new opportunity set: the impact migrants. i.e., those startups that, although might not have been created under the SDG narrative, have the potential and a desire to embrace and track their impact. They will define their impact mission, integrate SDG targets within their business performance and track impact in alignment with financial targets, all without losing sight of their primary mission to deliver superior financial returns.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Pitango applies this AND philosophy beyond its existing portfolio and onto future deal flow review. We call it the &#8220;mainstreaming&#8221; of impact investing.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
The Israeli market has evolved tremendously in recent years. While the IPO market used to be out of reach for Israeli-born companies, this is no longer the case. We are looking for the visionaries, the dent blowers, the unconventional types who are eager to solve the biggest of challenges and are aiming at building an IPO-able business rather than an M&amp;A one.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
Pitango First is focused on Israeli/Israeli-related startups. From time to time we identify an investment opportunity in areas we have defined as strategic, in which the Israeli market isn’t mature enough and for which we believe we can add significant value and then invest in non-Israeli companies.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Israel is a super strong innovation hub. One of the major evolution trends of recent years is that the traditional glass ceiling that Israeli startups used to tackle has been shattered. Global players realize that now they can get the same upside like SV-based companies, in much more reasonable terms, and sometimes, less competition.<br />
Somewhat counterintuitively, we see the investment climate in these times of COVID-19 being extremely vibrant and competitive. Strong teams are raising significant rounds at record high valuations, which add up to the current belief that COVID-19 didn’t slow, but accelerated the digital transformation.</p>
<p><strong>What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
For many seed early-stage startups that have secured funding, COVID-19 didn’t set setbacks in their plans, as they are further from the market from more mature companies. However, such companies, when backed by strong investors, while they may experience decrease in their revenues, are using this period to gain strength by acquiring companies within their ecosystem and position themselves better toward the out-of-pandemic curve that will eventually be here in a few short quarters.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
The pattern of investing for the long run during the pandemic. Looking far into the horizon, as veterans of previous crises we were able to share our experience and insights and help them better deal with the crisis. Also, this question can’t be answered without mentioning the COVID-19 vaccines, which set a magnificent example to the extent humanity can benefit when tech, medical companies and governments join hands and engage in a group effort.</p>
<h2>Ittai Harel, Pitango HealthTech</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
The consumerization of healthcare.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
HomeThrive — a tech-enabled healthcare services company tackling the aging-in-home challenge and helping families help their loved ones age happily.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
An all-star team building a category-defining or category-leading company with demonstrable clinical AND financial outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Narrow wearables that do not integrate into a clinical or life workflow.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
Pitango HealthTech is focused on Israeli/Israeli-related startups. From time to time we identify an investment opportunity in areas we have defined as strategic, in which the Israeli market isn’t mature enough and for which we believe we can add significant value, and then invest in non-Israeli companies.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Israel has many thriving healthcare sectors — from RPM and computer vision in digital health to cardiovascular in med devices to drug research in biotech and pharma. We are excited about our portfolio company Variantyx (a provider of whole genome sequencing and analytics unique platform solution) and Alike (a patient-facing platform to allow individuals to access and analyze their medical data and to connect to others similar to them). We are also excited to be part of this ecosystem and to lead thought leadership in it.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
The healthcare innovation ecosystem in Israel is thriving. There are incredible entrepreneurs and opportunities with global potential and reach that global investors should be aware of.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
To some extent we are witness more disbursement in Israel, but there is nonetheless a strong draw to co-locating in hubs and we expect to see Tel-Aviv and the central area in Israel to continue dominating in terms of attractiveness to strong teams.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19?</strong></p>
<p>Hospitals have seen a drastic decline in elective procedures and an overall disruption to their operations and budgets. Startups that are able to introduce new technologies to make this shift efficient and painless stand to win from the current trend.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
For the healthcare industry, COVID-19 has brought challenges — but also opportunities. We believe overall that our companies (and the industry overall) stand to gain from the shift as stakeholders are quicker to adopt changes that before took much longer. We advise our — and all — portfolio companies to prepare for the days after COVID and think through what changes in their specific segment will be long-lasting and are &#8220;here to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
When the first individual in the U.K. — a 90-year-old woman — received the vaccine. A turning point hopefully for the entire world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</em></a><em>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. Click <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a> if you want it in your inbox every Saturday morning.</em></p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>It was yet another week of startups that became unicorns going public, only to see their valuation soar. Already marked up by their IPO pricing, seeing so many unicorns achieve such rich public-market valuations <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/who-is-underpricing-roblox/">made us wonder who was mispricing whom</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s a matter of taste, a semantic argument, a tempest in a teacup. What matters more is that precisely <em>no one</em> knows what <em>anything</em> is worth, and that’s making a lot of people rich and/or mad.</p>
<p>This is not a new theme. I’ve <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/no-one-knows-what-anything-is-worth/">touched on</a><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/no-one-knows-what-anything-is-worth-part-ii/"> it for years</a>, but what matters for us today is that there appear to be three distinct valuation bands for companies, and the gaps between them do not appear ready to shrink. You could even argue that they have widened.</p>
<p>Band 1 is the private capital cohort. These are the folks who <a href="https://www.affirm.com/press/releases/affirm-series-g-and-biweekly-payment-option">valued Affirm at $19.93 per share</a> in its September 2020 round and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/roblox-raises-150m-series-g-led-by-andreessen-horowitz-now-valued-at-4b/">Roblox at $4 billion in February of 2020</a>. Now Affirm is worth $116.58 per share, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/robloxs-raises-at-29-5-billion-valuation-as-it-readies-for-direct-listing/">and Roblox is worth $29.5 billion</a>. Whoops?</p>
<p>Band 2 is the long-term public investing cohort. These are folks critical in the IPO pricing context. They are willing to pay more for startups than the private capital crew. Affirm was not worth under $20 per share to this group, instead it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/wall-street-hugs-affirm-as-it-starts-life-as-a-public-company/">worth $49 per share</a> just a few months later. Whoops?</p>
<p>Band 3 is the retail cohort, the /r/WallStreetBets, meme-stock, fintech Twitter rabble that are both incredibly fun to watch and also the sort of person you wouldn’t loan $500 to while in Las Vegas. They are willing to pay nearly infinite money for certain stocks &#8212; like Tesla &#8212; and often far more than the more conservative public money. Demand from the retail squad can greatly amplify the value of a newly listed company by making the supply/demand curve utterly wonky. This is how you get Poshmark more than doubling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/alex-wilhelm/">a strong IPO valuation</a> on its first day.</p>
<p>Most investors do well in today’s world. Though Band 1 likes to blame Band 2 for not being willing to pay Band 3 prices, it always sounds like the private capital folks are merely complaining about sharing some of the winnings with another party.</p>
<p>Regardless, who really knows what anything is worth? I was recently chatting with an early-stage founder who has a history of investing &#8212; narrowing it down to 17,823 people, I know &#8212; about the price of software companies both private and public and why they may or may not make sense. He said that old valuation models at banks presumed that software companies’ growth would go to zero over time, and that profits would be rare among SaaS concerns. Both concepts were wrong, so prices went up.</p>
<p>But I have yet to have anyone explain to me why companies that would have been valued at 10x next year’s revenues can now get, <em><a href="https://cloudedjudgement.substack.com/p/clouded-judgement-11521">at median</a></em>, 18.1x. I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/a-theory-about-the-current-ipo-market/">have a working theory of what’s going on</a>, but none of it points to sanity, or pricing that is grokkable through a lens that isn’t hype.</p>
<p>(You can hit reply to this email and tell me why I am dumb if you’d like. I will buy the person with the best valuation explanation coffee when the world works again.)</p>
<h2>Milestones and megarounds</h2>
<p>On the milestone front, it was a huge week for leaving the private markets and joining the Big Kid Club. Namely for Affirm and Poshmark, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/affirm-doubles-after-starting-to-trade-despite-strong-ipo-pricing/">which priced well and started to trade</a>. And for Bumble, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/bumble-files-to-go-public/">which filed to go public</a>. They are targeting a good IPO window.</p>
<p>But there was lots more going on, including a milestone that caught my eye. <a href="https://www.m1finance.com/">M1 Finance</a>, a fintech startup that brings together lots of pieces of the fintech playbook into a single service, <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/14/2158815/0/en/M1-Rockets-to-3-Billion-in-Client-Assets-Four-Months-After-Hitting-2-Billion.html">reached $3 billion in assets under management</a> (AUM) this week. The company had reached $2 billion in AUM last September, after reaching $1 billion in February of 2020.</p>
<p>Why do we care? The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/m1-finance-closes-45m-series-c-mere-months-after-it-raised-its-33m-series-b/">previously told TechCrunch</a> that it works to generate revenues worth around 1% of AUM. If that percentage has held past its October, 2020 Series C, the company just added around $10 million in ARR in under half a year. That’s a pace of revenue creation that made me sit up and take notice. (Shoutout <a href="https://twitter.com/propllrhead">Josh</a> for never shutting up about the Midwest.)</p>
<p>But I really bring up the M1 Finance milestone for a different reason. Namely that I am consistently surprised at how deep certain markets are. Neobanks that are still growing; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/rapid-growth-in-2020-reveals-okr-software-markets-untapped-potential/">the OKR software market’s surprising depth</a>; the ability of M1 to accrete deposits in a market with so many incumbents and well-funded startups.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why prices make no sense; if you can’t see the edge limits of TAM, can anything be overpriced?</p>
<p>Moving on, some quick notes on things from the week that mattered:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitLab is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/gitlab-ceo-eyes-public-market-after-secondary-valued-it-at-6-billion-.html">now worth $6 billion</a> and hit $150 million in annual recurring revenue last year. It grew 75%, we presume year-over-year in its most recent quarter.</li>
<li>Fintech upstart LendingPoint <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210114005235/en/LendingPoint-Announces-125-Million-Growth-Investment-from-Warburg-Pincus">raised</a> $125 million at an undisclosed valuation.</li>
<li>NYC-based Paige <a href="https://www.finsmes.com/2021/01/paige-raises-100m-series-c-funding.html">raised $100 million</a>. It uses computers to help make diagnoses.</li>
</ul>
<h2>One more VC Visa-Plaid take</h2>
<p>Aziz Gilani, a managing director at Mercury Fund and an advocate of Texas (<a href="https://twitter.com/TexasVC">observe his Twitter handle</a>), wrote in <em>late</em> regarding our query for investor notes on the Visa-Plaid breakup. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/venture-capitalists-react-to-visa-plaid-deal-meltdown/">You can read the rest here</a>.</p>
<p>But who are we to deprive you of useful notes. And Gilani is a nice person. So, here are his $0.02:</p>
<blockquote><p>My big take-away on the Plaid/Visa deal falling apart is about how fast everything in 2021 is moving. Arguably the biggest advantage of SPACs over direct listings and IPOs is how fast those liquidity events can get done. In a world in which valuation[s] change week to week, the delays created by the DOJ can kill a deal – even if the DOJ would eventually lose in court.</p>
<p>I’m philosophically super negative about the government imposing their will, but I’m also personally excited about the current wave of insurgent startups not getting gobbled up by the FAANGs of the world. For the last several years too many startups fell victim to the “quick exit” mentality personified by Mint selling so fast to Intuit. With fast/cheap capital freely available, today’s crop of startups are going big.</p></blockquote>
<p>Worth chewing on.</p>
<h2>Odds/Ends</h2>
<p>What a week. I have only a few things left for you, including some early-stage rounds that I could not get thanks to <em></em><em>waves arms around generally</em> but wanted to flag all the same.</p>
<ul>
<li>Goldman Sachs <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210114005225/en/Marqeta-Announces-Partnership-With-Goldman-Sachs-on-Marcus-Checking-Offering">chose</a> Marqeta for Marcus. If you know what those words mean, they matter. If you don’t, congrats on having a life.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nayya.com/">Nayya</a> raised $11 million for <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/13/nayya-raises-10-million-to-guide-employee-health-benefits-decisions-with-ai/">what VentureBeat calls</a> “an insurance benefits management platform,” including money from Felicis.</li>
<li><a href="https://minnatechnologies.com/">Minna</a> raised €15.5 million for what Tech.eu <a href="https://tech.eu/brief/minna-series-b/">called</a> a “subscription management app.”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.muniqlife.com/">Muniq</a> closed a  $8.2M Series A to sell a shake-sort-of-thing that could help with blood sugar control.</li>
<li>And from TechCrunch two more highlights, this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/crossbeam-first-fund/">neat Crossbeam round</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/corporate-credit-card-platform-moss-raises-25-5-million/">more money for Moss</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hugs,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week kicked off with a report of a GitHub worker who was fired after cautioning his coworkers in the DC area to stay safe from Nazis during the assault on the U.S. Capitol. Meanwhile, Facebook created a new executive role pertaining to civil rights and California’s Proposition 22 faced its first legal challenge this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All that and more in this week’s edition of Human Capital.</span></p>
<h3><b>Facebook hires VP of civil rights</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/facebook-hires-a-vp-of-civil-rights/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook hired</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Roy Austin to become its first-ever VP of Civil Rights and Deputy General Counsel to create a new civil rights organization within the company. Austin is set to start on January 19 and will be based in Washington, DC.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin most recently served as a civil rights lawyer at Harris, Wiltshire &amp; Grannis LLP. Prior to that, Austin co-authored a report on big data and civil rights and worked with President Barack Obama’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing.</span></p>
<h3><b>Prop 22 faces lawsuit challenging its constitutionality</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of rideshare drivers in California and the Service Employees International Union </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/gig-workers-seiu-file-lawsuit-alleging-prop-22-is-unconstitutional/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> alleging Proposition 22 violates California’s constitution. The goal of the suit is to overturn Prop 22, which classifies gig workers as independent contractors in California.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suit, filed in California’s Supreme Court, argues Prop 22 makes it harder for the state’s legislature to create and enforce a workers’ compensation system for gig workers. It also argues Prop 22 violates the rule that limits ballot measures to a single issue, as well as unconstitutionally defines what would count as an amendment to the measure. As it stands today, Prop 22 requires a seven-eights legislative supermajority in order to amend the measure.</span></p>
<h3><b>Best tech companies to work for, according to Glassdoor</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/glassdoor-best-tech-companies-to-work-for-in-2021/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glassdoor released</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its annual ranking of the</span><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Award/Best-Places-to-Work-LST_KQ0,19.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> best companies to work for in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We broke out the top 10 tech companies from the list of large businesses (1,000+ employees) as well as from the small to medium-sized business list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite recent allegations of </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/googles-co-lead-of-ethical-ai-team-says-she-was-fired-for-sending-an-email/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrongful firings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/facebook-content-moderators-demand-safer-working-conditions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demands of better workplace conditions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Google ranked number three on the list of best tech companies, while Facebook ranked fifth. </span></p>
<h3><b>Netflix releases first diversity report</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was not the first time Netflix had shared this type of data, but the company had not put a bow on it until</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/netflix-releases-latest-diversity-numbers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worldwide, women make up 47.1% of Netflix’s workforce. Since 2017, representation of white and Asian employees has been on a slow decline, while representation of Hispanic or Latinx, Black, mixed race and folks from native populations has been on the rise. In the U.S., Netflix is 8.1% Hispanic or Latinx, 8% Black and 5.1% of its employees are mixed race, while 1.3% of employees are either Native American, Native Alaskan, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander and/or from the Middle East or North Africa.</span></p>
<h3><b>Github faces backlash after firing of Jewish employee who made comment about Nazis</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the day a violent mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, a worried GitHub employee warned his co-workers in the D.C. area to be safe. In an interview with TechCrunch, the now-former employee said he was genuinely concerned about his co-workers in the area, in addition to his Jewish family members. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch agreed to keep the identity of the terminated employee confidential due to fears of his and his family’s safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After making a comment in Slack saying, “stay safe homies, Nazis are about,” a fellow employee took offense, saying that type of rhetoric wasn’t good for work, the former employee told me. Two days later, he was fired, with a human relations representative citing a “pattern of behavior that is not conducive to company policy” as the rationale for his termination, he told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the terminated employee says he is currently seeking counsel to ensure his family is protected, as well as figure out if he can receive damages or some other form of reconciliation. The fired employee said GitHub has reached out to him for help in the internal investigation, but is waiting to engage with the company until he has legal representation in place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can read the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/fired-github-employee-who-warned-coworkers-about-nazis-is-seeking-legal-counsel/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">full story here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>Dropbox lays off 315 people</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dropbox laid off 11% of its global workforce, which comes to 315 people affected. </span><a href="https://investors.dropbox.com/node/8916/html#januaryexhibit991.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an email to employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, CEO Drew Houston said the company simply doesn’t need as much in-office support due to the shift to remote work, “so we’re scaling back that investment and redeploying those resources to drive our ambitious product roadmap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the note, Houston said the changes will make Dropbox more efficient and nimble this year.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<h3><b>Apple launches racial justice and equity programs</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/apple-announces-new-projects-related-to-its-100-million-pledge-for-racial-equity-and-justice/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple unveiled </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">a few key projects as part of its $100 million commitment to racial equity and justice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first is a $25 million investment in the </span><a href="https://propelcenter.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Propel Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an innovation and learning hub for HBCUS. As part of the investment into the Propel Center, Apple employees will help to develop the curriculum and offer mentorship to students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Detroit, Apple will launch a developer academy for young Black entrepreneurs in collaboration with Michigan State University. In all, Apple hopes to reach 1,000 students per year in Detroit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, Apple invested $10 million in VC firm Harlem Capital, $25 million in Siebert Williams Shank’s Clear Vision Impact Fund and donated an undisclosed amount to the King Center.</span></p>
<h3><b>Amazon warehouse workers scheduled to vote on union starting next month</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://apps.nlrb.gov/link/document.aspx/09031d458334974b"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Labor Relations Board has scheduled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a mail-in voting process for Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama to begin on February 8 and end March 29. Workers at the facility will decide whether or not to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. The bargaining unit includes about 6,000 workers, including hourly full-time and regular part-time fulfillment workers, as well as the hundreds of Amazon’s seasonal workers, and others.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Copy and paste the converted output. --></p>
<p>A failed acquisition usually triggers the same series of questions: What does this mean for early-stage startups in the sector? Will a chilling effect occur and hurt valuations? Will VCs stop funding this category? How will the exit environment look going forward?</p>
<p>This week gave that narrative a bullish twist. Visa and Plaid announced that they have reached a mutual agreement to no longer pursue a merger. The $5.3 billion deal had been under antitrust scrutiny from the DOJ, and eventually ended amid these regulatory challenges.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fintech VCs and startups alike reacted to the fallen deal with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/venture-capitalists-react-to-visa-plaid-deal-meltdown">aggressive optimism</a> about Plaid’s future as an independently-owned fintech startup.</p>
<p>The most common arguments?</p>
<ul>
<li>Plaid’s price in this current moment is far beyond $5.3 billion, so now that it is a free bird it will pursue a much larger exit</li>
<li>Plaid will go public through SPAC because it is in charge of its own destiny.</li>
<li>And my favorite: One day, Plaid will buy Visa.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/plaid-ceo-touts-new-clarity-after-failed-visa-acquisition/ ">In an interview with TechCrunch,</a> Plaid CEO Zach Perret wouldn’t give too many details on the future (and whether a SPAC is involved), but he did say he has new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/plaid-ceo-touts-new-clarity-after-failed-visa-acquisition/ ">‘clarity’</a> going forward.</p>
<p>The fact that fintech is bullish on the future of fintech isn’t quite surprising. I will say that while one deal can never make or break a sector, a flopped merger certainly can surface the current temperature in the market. Startups Weekly readers will remember <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-next-zoom-wants-to-be-nothing-like-zoom/">last week’s edition</a> about how P&amp;G’s decision not to acquire Billie could hurt DTC exit opportunities. Fintech seems unbothered and, in fact, celebratory. The only counterargument I got, via Twitter DM, is that it could set a bad precedent on big fintech mergers.</p>
<p>“Or maybe&#8230;corporations learn from this and look to make riskier acquisitions earlier in a company’s lifecycle because they know that if they let the company get too big they’ll lose the chance,” <a href="https://twitter.com/ramiessaid">Rami Essaid</a>, founder of Finmark, told me.</p>
<p>Only in 2021 could a $5.3 billion break-up and a DOJ investigation be considered a blessing. Rock on, ‘Plaid for X’ startups.</p>

<h2><strong>Columbus is the new Miami which is new the San Francisco</strong></h2>
<p>I hope that sub-hed gave you a headache, because that’s exactly what debates about where the best place to start a company do to me. The rise of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/work-from-home-is-dead-long-live-work-from-anywhere/">Work From Anywhere </a>has emboldened VCs to leave San Francisco for markets such as Miami or Austin in search of the next unsung hero of their portfolios.</p>
<p>For investors, though, the financial benefit of moving to an emerging market might not be apparent within months, but instead years. Venture is a long game <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/two-year-old-nuvia-sells-to-qualcomm-for-1-4-billion/">(at least most of the time</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know</strong>, per Silicon Valley editor Connie Loizos: <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/columbus-drivecapital/ ">Drive Capital</a>, a venture capital firm based in Columbus, Ohio, and started by two ex-Sequoia investors now has over $1.2 billion in assets. But before it had breakout companies like Root and Olive AI, Drive had to play the unusual role of investing in a region without key investing infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Etc</strong>: Founding partner Chris Olsen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/columbus-drivecapital/ ">explained how they set up their roots</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;We’ve had to spend a lot of time going into the universities and putting new seed managers in business and helping them fundraise and sort of building all of this infrastructure from scratch so that the next entrepreneur is out here [versus moves away], and it works. In our first year, we had inbound interest from 1,800 [startups], then it went to about 3,000 and now it’s up to about 7,000, which is more than I’ve heard any other venture firms say that they see in California. And I don’t think it’s because we’re great. I think that’s more [a reflection of the] scale of the opportunity that’s here now. One of the things that we would love to see more of is more venture capitalists coming here, because there’s certainly more opportunity than we can invest in.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>

<h2>The CFO Tech Stack</h2>
<p>If you want to start a company, go to a startup and look where employees are still using an Excel sheet. The best products are the ones fueled by frustrations, right?</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know</strong> per managing editor Danny Crichton: For a trio of Palantir alums, 15 collective years at the now-public government tech company showed a huge gap in technology for CFOs. So, they started Mosaic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/mosaic-raises-18-5m-series-a-from-gc-to-rebuild-the-cfo-software-stack/">a techstack to help financial officers</a> better communicate and perform their jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Etc:</strong> Co-founder Bijan Moallemi describes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/mosaic-raises-18-5m-series-a-from-gc-to-rebuild-the-cfo-software-stack/">the mistake</a> other platforms are making:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Everyone wants to be strategic, but it’s so tough to do because 80% of your time is pulling data from these disparate systems, cleaning it, mapping it, updating your Excel files, and maybe 20% of [your time] is actually taking a step back and understanding what the data is telling you.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h2><strong>The future of consumer hardware startups beyond Peloton</strong></h2>
<p>Are wearables still exciting? Is consumer hardware ever going to get easier to pull off? What was the strategy that made Peloton so successful?</p>
<p>These questions and more are answered in the latest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/5-consumer-hardware-vcs-share-their-2021-investment-strategies/">consumer hardware-focused Extra Crunch Survey</a>, which brings together VCs from SOSV, Lux Capital, Shasta Ventures, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> Everyone is studying the Peloton success recipe. But the big question for consumer hardware startups is if the at-home fitness market’s boom is translating to other use cases.</p>
<p><strong>Etc:</strong> Cyril Ebersweiler of SOSV noted that supply chain distribution disruption during COVID-19 has been difficult for category startups, but the need for innovative solutions has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/5-consumer-hardware-vcs-share-their-2021-investment-strategies/">never been more clear</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Everybody is waiting for new and mind-blowing experiences, and I guess we’ve all experienced the shortcomings or the magic of some IoT products over the shelter-in-place [orders]. Spatial and ambient technologies that work well will be in demand (audio or visual), while “holographic Skype” will invade households thanks to Looking Glass.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h2><strong>Pop goes the public market</strong></h2>
<p>We had yet another noisy week of privately-held startups going public to a Very Warm Wall Street reception.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last CES was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/as-autonomy-stalls-lidar-companies-learn-to-adapt/">a time of reckoning for lidar companies</a>, many of which were cratering due to a lack of demand from a (still) non-existent autonomous vehicle industry. The few that excelled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/barajas-unique-and-ingenious-take-on-lidar-shines-in-a-crowded-industry/">did so by specializing</a>, and this year the trend has pushed beyond lidar, with new sensing and imaging methods pushing to both compete with and complement the laser-based tech.</p>
<p>Lidar pushed ahead of traditional cameras because it could do things they couldn&#8217;t — and now some companies are pushing to do the same with tech that&#8217;s a little less exotic.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>A good example of addressing the problem or perception by different means is <a href="https://eyenet-mobile.com/">Eye Net&#8217;s vehicle-to-x tracking platform</a>. This is one of those techs that&#8217;s been talked about in the context of 5G (admittedly still somewhat exotic), which for all the hype really does enable short-distance, low-latency applications that could be life-savers.</p>
<p>Eye Net provides collision warnings between vehicles equipped with its tech, whether they have cameras or other sensing tech equipped or not. The example they provide is a car driving through a parking lot, unaware that a person on one of those horribly unsafe electric scooters is moving perpendicular to it ahead, about to zoom into its path but totally obscured by parked cars. Eye Net&#8217;s sensors detect the position of the devices on both vehicles and send warnings in time for either or both to brake.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2096690" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/warning-eye-net.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2096690" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2096690" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/warning-eye-net.jpg" alt="CG illustration of a bicyclist and car being warned of an imminent collision." width="1024" height="700" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/warning-eye-net.jpg 1306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/warning-eye-net.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/warning-eye-net.jpg?resize=300,205 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/warning-eye-net.jpg?resize=768,525 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/warning-eye-net.jpg?resize=680,465 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/warning-eye-net.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2096690" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Eye Net</p></div></p>
<p>They&#8217;re not the only ones attempting something like this, but they hope that by providing a sort of white-label solution, a good size network can be built relatively easily, instead of having none, and then all VWs equipped, and then some Fords and some e-bikes, and so on.</p>
<p>But vision is still going to be a major part of how vehicles navigate, and advances are being made on multiple fronts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.brightwayvision.com/technology">Brightway Vision</a>, for instance, addresses the issue of normal RGB cameras having limited visibility in many real-world conditions by going multispectral. In addition to ordinary visible-light imagery, the company&#8217;s camera is mated to a near-infrared beamer that scans the road ahead at set distance intervals many times a second.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2097138" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/brightway.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2097138" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2097138" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/brightway.png" alt="CG illustration of a camera using infrared to see further ahead at night." width="1024" height="605" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/brightway.png 1328w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/brightway.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/brightway.png?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/brightway.png?resize=768,454 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/brightway.png?resize=680,402 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/brightway.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2097138" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brightway Vision</p></div></p>
<p>The idea is that if the main camera can&#8217;t see 100 feet out because of fog, the NIR imagery will still catch any obstacles or road features when it scans that &#8220;slice&#8221; in its regular sweep of the incoming area. It combines the benefits of traditional cameras with those of IR ones, but manages to avoid the shortcomings of both. The pitch is that there&#8217;s no reason to use a normal camera when you can use one of these, which does the same job better and may even allow another sensor to be cut out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foresightauto.com/">Foresight Automotive</a> also uses multispectral imagery in its cameras (chances are hardly any vehicle camera will be limited to visible spectrum in a few years), dipping into thermal via a partnership with FLIR, but what it&#8217;s really selling is something else.</p>
<p>To provide 360-degree (or close) coverage, generally multiple cameras are required. But where those cameras go differs on a compact sedan versus an SUV from the same manufacturer — let alone on an autonomous freight vehicle. Because those cameras have to work together, they need to be perfectly calibrated, aware of the exact position of the others, so they know, for example, that they&#8217;re both looking at the same tree or bicyclist and not two identical ones.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2097244" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/foresight-place.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2097244" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2097244 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/foresight-place.gif" alt="Image showing Foresight cameras being attached magnetically to a car's body." width="800" height="448" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2097244" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Foresight Automotive</p></div></p>
<p>Foresight&#8217;s advance is to simplify the calibration stage, so a manufacturer or designer or test platform doesn&#8217;t need to be laboriously re-tested and certified every time the cameras need to be moved half an inch in one direction or the other. The Foresight demo shows them sticking the cameras on the roof of the car seconds before driving it.</p>
<p>It has parallels to <a href="https://www.nodarsensor.com/product">another startup called Nodar</a> that also relies on stereoscopic cameras, but takes a different approach. The technique of deriving depth from binocular triangulation, as the company points out, goes back decades, or millions of years if you count our own vision system, which works in a similar ways. The limitation that has held this approach back isn&#8217;t that optical cameras fundamentally can&#8217;t provide the depth information needed by an autonomous vehicle, but that they can&#8217;t be trusted to remain calibrated.</p>
<p>Nodar shows that its paired stereo cameras don&#8217;t even need to be mounted to the main mass of the car, which would reduce jitter and fractional mismatches between the cameras&#8217; views. Attached to the rear view mirrors, their &#8220;Hammerhead&#8221; camera setup has a wide stance (like the shark&#8217;s), which provides improved accuracy because of the larger disparity between the cameras. Since distance is determined by the differences between the two images, there&#8217;s no need for object recognition or complex machine learning to say &#8220;this is a shape, probably a car, probably about this big, which means it&#8217;s probably about this far away&#8221; as you might with a single camera solution.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2097231" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hammerhead_03.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2097231" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2097231" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hammerhead_03.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="563" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hammerhead_03.jpg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hammerhead_03.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hammerhead_03.jpg?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hammerhead_03.jpg?resize=768,422 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hammerhead_03.jpg?resize=680,374 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hammerhead_03.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2097231" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nodar</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;<span id="m_-6560671669699923875gmail-docs-internal-guid-9e3d4e7e-7fff-e68e-2639-f789c329de70"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The industry has already shown that camera arrays do well in harsh weather conditions, just as human eyes do,&#8221; said Nodar COO and co-founder Brad Rosen. &#8220;For example, engineers at Daimler have published results showing that current stereoscopic approaches provide significantly more stable depth estimates than monocular methods and LiDAR completion in adverse weather. The beauty of our approach is that the hardware we use is available today, in automotive-grade, and with many choices for manufacturers and distributors.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p>Indeed, a major strike against lidar has been the cost of the unit — even &#8220;inexpensive&#8221; ones tend to be orders of magnitude more expensive than ordinary cameras, something that adds up very quickly. But team lidar hasn&#8217;t been standing still either.</p>
<p>Sense Photonics came onto the scene with a new approach that seemed to combine the best of both worlds: a relatively cheap and simple flash lidar (as opposed to spinning or scanning, which tend to add complexity) mated to a traditional camera so that the two see versions of the same image, allowing them to work together in identifying objects and establishing distances.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/sense-photonics-flashes-onto-the-lidar-scene-with-a-new-approach-and-26m/">Since its debut in 2019</a> Sense has refined its tech for production and beyond. The latest advance is custom hardware that has enabled it to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sense-photonics-demonstrates-the-worlds-first-940nm-global-shutter-flash-lidar-with-200-meter-range-for-mass-market-automotive-applications-301202111.html">image objects out to 200 meters</a> — generally considered on the far end both for lidar and traditional cameras.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the past, we have sourced an off-the-shelf detector to pair with our laser source (Sense Illuminator). However, our 2 years of in-house detector development has now completed and is a huge success, which allows us to build short-range and long-range automotive products,&#8221; said CEO Shauna McIntyre.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sense has created &#8216;building blocks&#8217; for a camera-like LiDAR design that can be paired with different sets of optics to achieve different FOV, range, resolution, etc,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;And we&#8217;ve done so in a very simple design that can actually be manufactured in large volumes. You can think of our architecture like a DSLR camera where you have the &#8216;base camera&#8217; and can pair it with a macro lens, zoom lens, fisheye lens, etc. to achieve different functions.&#8221;</p>
<p>One thing all the companies seemed to agree on is that no single sensing modality will dominate the industry from top to bottom. Leaving aside that the needs of a fully autonomous (i.e. level 4-5) vehicle has very different needs from a driver assist system, the field moves too quickly for any one approach to remain on top for long.</p>
<p>&#8220;AV companies cannot succeed if the public is not convinced that their platform is safe and the safety margins only increase with redundant sensor modalities operating at different wavelengths,&#8221; said McIntyre.</p>
<p>Whether that means visible light, near-infrared, thermal imaging, radar, lidar, or as we&#8217;ve seen here, some combination of two or three of these, it&#8217;s clear the market will continue to favor differentiation — though as with the boom-bust cycle seen in the lidar industry a few years back, it&#8217;s also a warning that consolidation won&#8217;t be far behind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020.</p>
<p>Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>

<h3>The right-wing gets deplatformed</h3>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/this-week-in-apps-social-apps-react-to-riots-us-bans-chinese-payment-apps-ftc-threatens-app-store-regulation/">Last weekend</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/">Google</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/apple-suspend-parler-from-app-store/">Apple</a> removed Parler from their respective app stores, the latter after first giving the app 24 hours to come up with a new moderation strategy to address the threats of violence and illegal activity taking place on the app in the wake of the Capitol riot. When Parler failed to take adequate measures, the app was pulled down.</p>
<p>What happened afterwards was unprecedented. All of Parler&#8217;s technology backend services providers pulled support for Parler, too, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-is-officially-offline-after-aws-suspension/">Amazon AWS</a> (which has led to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-sues-amazon-leveling-far-fetched-antitrust-allegations/">lawsuit</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/stripe-reportedly-joins-the-tech-platforms-booting-president-trump-from-their-services/">Stripe</a> and even <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/okta-ceo-todd-mckinnon-parler-not-even-trying-to-suppress-threats.html">Okta</a>, which Parler was only using as a free trial. <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/01/parler-ceo-says-service-dropped-by-every-vendor-and-could-end-the-company-1234670607/">Other vendors also refused</a> to do business with the app, <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22227131/parler-return-amazon-apple-google">potentially ending its ability</a> to operate for good.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Parler is officially offline after AWS suspension&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-is-officially-offline-after-aws-suspension/embed/#?secret=BpBp3YJgwR" data-secret="BpBp3YJgwR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But although Parler is down, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/every-deleted-parler-post-many-with-users-location-dat-1846032466?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">its data lives on</a>. Several efforts have been made to archive Parler data for posterity &#8212; and for tipping off the FBI. Gizmodo <a href="https://gizmodo.com/parler-users-breached-deep-inside-u-s-capitol-building-1846042905?rev=1610480731991">made a map</a> using the GPS data of 70,000 Parler posts. Another effort, <a href="https://thepatr10t.github.io/yall-Qaeda/">Y&#8217;all Qaeda</a>, is also using location data to map videos from Parler to locations around the Capitol building.</p>
<p>These visualizations are possible because the data itself was quickly archived by internet archivist <a href="https://twitter.com/donk_enby">@donk_enby</a> before Parler was taken down, and because Parler stored rich metadata with each user&#8217;s post. That means each user&#8217;s precise location was recorded when they uploaded their photos and videos to the app.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/scraped-parler-data-is-a-metadata-goldmine/">It&#8217;s a gold mine for investigators</a> and a further indication of the privilege these rioters believed they had to avoid prosecution or the extent to which they were willing to throw their life away for their cause &#8212; the false reality painted for them by Trump, his allies and other outlets that repeated the &#8220;big lie&#8221; until they truly believed only a revolution could save our democracy.</p>

<p>The move to kick Parler offline followed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">the broader deplatforming of Trump</a>, who&#8217;s accused of inciting the violence, in part by his refusal to concede and his continued lies about a &#8220;rigged election.&#8221; As a result, Trump has been deplatformed across social platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitch, YouTube, Reddit, Discord and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/snapchat-permanently-bans-president-trumps-account/">Snapchat</a>, while e-commerce platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/shopify-pulls-donald-trump-stores-off-its-website/">Shopify</a> kicked out Trump merch shops and PayPal <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/paypal-and-shopify-remove-trump-related-accounts-citing-policies-against-supporting-violence/">refused</a> to process transactions for some groups of Trump supporters.</p>
<h3>Alternative social apps post gains following Capitol riot</h3>
<p>Parler was the most high-profile app used by the Capitol rioters, but others found themselves compromised by the same crowd. Walkie-talkie app Zello, for instance, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/13/zello-app-us-capitol-attack-far-right">was used by some insurrectionists</a> during the January 6 riot to communicate. Telegram, meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/telegram-channels-banned-violent-threats-capitol/">recently had to block dozens of hardcore hate channels</a> that were threatening violence, including those led by Nazis (which were reported for years with no action by the company, some claim).</p>
<p>Now, many in the radical right are moving to new platforms outside of the mainstream. Immediately following the Capitol riot, MeWe, CloutHub and other privacy-focused rivals to big tech <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/following-riots-alternative-social-apps-and-private-messengers-top-the-app-stores/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">began topping the app stores</a>, alongside the privacy-focused messengers Signal and Telegram. YouTube alternative Rumble also gained ground due to recent events. Right-wingers even mistakenly downloaded the wrong &#8220;Parlor&#8221; app and a local newspaper app they thought was the uncensored social network Gab. (They&#8217;re not always the brightest bulbs.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pqKiVVthIl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/following-riots-alternative-social-apps-and-private-messengers-top-the-app-stores/">Following riots, alternative social apps and private messengers top the app stores</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Following riots, alternative social apps and private messengers top the app stores&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/following-riots-alternative-social-apps-and-private-messengers-top-the-app-stores/embed/#?secret=pqKiVVthIl" data-secret="pqKiVVthIl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This could soon prove to be another difficult situation for the platforms to address, as we already came across highly concerning posts distributed on MeWe, which had used extreme hate speech or threatened violence. MeWe claims it moderates its content, but its recent growth to now 15 million users may be making that difficult &#8212; <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/mewe-sold-itself-on-privacy-then-the-radical-right-arrived-e527b38e4718">especially since it&#8217;s inheriting the former Parler users, including the radical far-right.</a> The company has not been able to properly moderate the content, which may make it the next to be gone.</p>
<h3>2020 annual review</h3>
<p>App Annie this week released its annual review of the mobile app industry finding (as noted above) that mobile app downloads grew by 7% year-over-year to a record 218 billion in 2020. Consumer spending also grew by 20% to also hit a new milestone of $143 billion, led by markets that included China, the United States, Japan, South Korea and the United Kingdom. Consumers spent 3.5 trillion minutes on Android devices in 2020. Meanwhile, U.S. users now spend more time in apps (four hours) than watching live TV (3.7 hours).</p>
<p>The full report examines other key trends across social, gaming, finance, e-commerce, video and streaming, mobile food ordering, business apps, edtech and much more. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">We pulled out some highlights here</a>, such as TikTok&#8217;s chart-topping year by downloads, the rise in livestreamed and social shopping, consumers spending 40% more time streaming on mobile YoY and other key trends.</p>

<p>Though not &#8220;apps&#8221; news per se, it&#8217;s worth making note of what&#8217;s next in the Android ecosystem of high-end devices. This week was Samsung&#8217;s Unpacked press event, where the company revealed its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/samsungs-galaxy-s21-line-arrives-with-camera-bumps-price-drops-and-s-pen-compatibility/">latest flagship devices</a> and other products. The big news was Samsung&#8217;s three new phones and their now lower prices: the glass-backed Galaxy S21 ($799) and S21 Plus ($999), and the S21 Ultra ($1,199), which is S Pen compatible.</p>
<p>The now more streamlined camera systems are the key feature of the new phones, and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>S21 and S21 Plus: A 12-megapixel ultrawide, 12-megapixel wide and 64-megapixel telephoto with 30x space zoom.</li>
<li>S21 Ultra: A 12-megapixel ultra-wide, 108-megapixel wide and, for the first time, a dual-telephoto lens system with 3x and 10x optical zoom. The Ultra also improves low-light shooting with its Bright Night sensor.</li>
</ul>
<p>The devices support UWB and there&#8217;s a wild <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230902/samsung-s21-one-ui-3-object-eraser-photos-remove-people-background">AI-powered photo feature</a> that lets you tap to remove people from the background of your photos. (How well it works is TBD). Other software imaging updates allow you to pull stills from 8K shooting, better image stabilization and a new &#8220;Vlogger view&#8221; for shooting from front and back cameras as the same time.</p>
<p>Also launched were Samsung&#8217;s AirPods rival, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/samsungs-galaxy-buds-pro-are-a-solid-airpods-alternative/">Galaxy Buds Pro,</a> and its Tile rival, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/samsung-unveils-its-newest-tile-competitor-the-galaxy-smarttag/">Galaxy SmartTag</a>.</p>

Critics say Google took too long to respond to the outcry, which has already prompted suicides. Police have also frozen bank accounts holding $58 million for alleged scams conducted through 30 apps, none of which had approval from India&#8217;s central bank.</li>

<p>This new blockchain camera app, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/numbers-protocols-blockchain-camera-capture-app-safeguards-the-integrity-of-photos/">reviewed here</a> on TechCrunch, uses tech commercialized by the Taiwan-based startup, Numbers Protocol. The app secures the metadata associated with photos you take on the blockchain, also allowing users to adjust privacy settings if they don&#8217;t want to share a precise location. Any subsequent changes to the photo are then traced and recorded. Use cases for the technology include journalism (plus combating fake news), as well as a way for photographers to assure their photos are attributed correctly. The app is available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/capture/id1536388009">App Store </a>and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.numbersprotocol.capturelite">Google Play</a>.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture-capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. We’re back on this lovely Saturday with a bonus episode!</p>
<p>Again!</p>
<p>There is enough going on that to avoid failing to bring you stuff that we think matters, we are back yet again for more. This time around we are not talking Roblox, we&#8217;re talking about ecommerce, and a number of rounds &#8212; big <em>and</em> small &#8212; that have been raised in the space. Honest question: do y&#8217;all plan to release news on the same week? Are trends a social construct?</p>
<p>From Natasha, Grace, Danny, and your humble servant, here&#8217;s your run-down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webflow <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/webflow-raises-140m-pushing-its-valuation-to-2-1-billion/">raised $140 million</a> in a round that it says it did not need. This is not a new thing. Some startups are doing well, and don&#8217;t burn much. So investors offer them more at a nice price. In this case $2.1 billion. (Webflow does no-code</li>
<li>Checkout.com <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/checkout-com-raises-450-million-and-reaches-15-billion-valuation/">raised $450 million</a>. The rich really do get richer. In this case the founders of Checkout.com, whose company is now worth around $15 billion Checkout.com does, you guessed, online checkout work. Which as Danny explains is complicated and critical.</li>
<li>We also talked about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/bolt-adds-75m-to-its-series-c-as-the-battle-to-rule-online-checkout-continues/">this Bolt round</a>, for context.</li>
<li>And sticking to the ecommerce theme, Rapyd <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/rapyd-raises-300m-on-a-2-5b-valuation-to-boost-its-fintech-as-a-service-api/">raised $300 million</a> at around a $2.5 billion valuation. There is infinte money available for late-stage fintech.</li>
<li>Early stage as well, it turns out, with<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tradeswell-series-a/"> Tradeswell raising $15.5 million</a> to help businesses improve their net margins.</li>
<li>Finally, ending with a chat on infrastructure, Nacelle closed an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/e-commerce-infrastructure-startup-nacelle-closes-18m-series-a/">$18 million Series A. </a></li>
</ul>
<p>And now we&#8217;re going back to bed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some time ago, I gave up on the idea of finding a thread that connects each story in the weekly Extra Crunch roundup; there are no unified theories of technology news.</p>
<p>The stories that left the deepest impression were related to two news pegs that dominated the week — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">Visa and Plaid calling off their $5.3 billion acquisition agreement</a>, and sizzling-hot IPOs for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/affirm-boosts-its-ipo-price-target-more-than-doubling-its-latest-private-valuation/">Affirm</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/poshmark-prices-ipo-above-range-as-public-markets-continue-to-yolo-startups/">Poshmark</a>.</p>
<p>Watching Plaid and Visa sing &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOILZ_D3aRg">Let&#8217;s Call The Whole Thing Off&#8221;</a> in harmony after the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit to block their deal wasn&#8217;t shocking. But I was surprised to find myself editing an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/plaid-ceo-touts-new-clarity-after-failed-visa-acquisition/">interview Alex Wilhelm conducted with Plaid CEO Zach Perret</a> the next day in which the executive said growing the company on its own is &#8220;once again&#8221; the correct strategy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<hr />
<p>In an analysis for Extra Crunch, Managing Editor Danny Crichton suggested that federal regulators&#8217; new interest in antitrust enforcement will affect valuations going forward. For example, Procter &amp; Gamble and women&#8217;s beauty D2C brand Billie also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/pg-terminates-plan-to-acquire-razor-startup-billie-following-ftc-lawsuit/">called off <i>their</i> planned merger last week</a> after the Federal Trade Commission raised objections in December.</p>
<p>Given the FTC&#8217;s moves last year to prevent Billie and Harry&#8217;s from being acquired, &#8220;it seems clear that U.S. antitrust authorities want broad competition for consumers in household goods,&#8221; Danny concluded, and I suspect that applies to Plaid as well.</p>
<p>In December, C3.ai, Doordash and Airbnb burst into the public markets to much acclaim. This week, used clothing marketplace Poshmark saw a 140% pop in its first day of trading and consumer-financing company Affirm &#8220;priced its IPO above its raised range <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210112006165/en/Affirm-Announces-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering">at $49 per share</a>,&#8221; reported Alex.</p>
<p>In a post titled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/a-theory-about-the-current-ipo-market/">&#8220;A theory about the current IPO market&#8221;</a>, he identified eight key ingredients for brewing a debut with a big first-day pop, which includes &#8220;exist in a climate of near-zero interest rates&#8221; and &#8220;keep companies private longer.&#8221; Truly, words to live by!</p>
<p>Come back next week for more coverage of the public markets in The Exchange, an interview with Bustle CEO Bryan Goldberg where he shares his plans for taking the company public, a comprehensive post that will unpack the regulatory hurdles facing D2C consumer brands, and much more.</p>
<p>If you live in the U.S., enjoy your MLK Day holiday weekend, and wherever you are: Thanks very much for reading Extra Crunch.</p>

<p>After spending much of the week covering 2021&#8217;s frothy IPO market, Alex Wilhelm devoted this morning&#8217;s column to studying the OKR-focused software sector.</p>
<p>Measuring objectives and key results are core to every enterprise, perhaps more so these days since knowledge workers began working remotely in greater numbers last year.</p>
<p>A sign of the times: This week, enterprise orchestration SaaS platform Gtmhub announced that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/okr-focused-gtmhub-raises-30m-series-b-after-growing-3x-in-2020/">raised a $30 million Series B</a>.</p>
<p>To get a sense of how large the TAM is for OKR, Alex reached out to several companies and asked them to share new and historical growth metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gthmhub</li>
<li>Perdoo</li>
<li>WorkBoard</li>
<li>Ally.io</li>
<li>Koan</li>
<li>WeekDone</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Some OKR-focused startups didn’t get back to us, and some leaders wanted to share the best stuff off the record, which we grant at times for candor amongst startup executives,&#8221; he wrote.</p>

<p>For our latest investor survey, Matt Burns interviewed five VCs who actively fund consumer electronics startups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hans Tung, managing partner, GGV Capital</li>
<li>Dayna Grayson, co-founder and general partner, Construct Capital</li>
<li>Cyril Ebersweiler, general partner, SOSV</li>
<li>Bilal Zuberi, partner, Lux Capital</li>
<li>Rob Coneybeer, managing director, Shasta Ventures</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Consumer hardware has always been a tough market to crack, but the COVID-19 crisis made it even harder,&#8221; says Matt, noting that the pandemic fueled wide interest in fitness startups like Mirror, Peloton and Tonal.</p>
<p>Bonus: Many VCs listed the founders, investors and companies that are taking the lead in consumer hardware innovation.</p>

<p>Clothing resale marketplace Poshmark closed up more than 140% on its first trading day yesterday.</p>
<p>In Thursday&#8217;s edition of The Exchange, Alex noted that Poshmark boosted its valuation by selling 6.6 million shares at its IPO price, scooping up $277.2 million in the process.</p>
<p>Poshmark&#8217;s surge in trading is good news for its employees and stockholders, but it reflects poorly on &#8220;the venture-focused money people who we suppose know what they are talking about when it comes to equity in private companies,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>This week, Visa announced it would drop its planned acquisition of Plaid after the U.S. Department of Justice filed suit to block it last fall.</p>
<p>Last week, Procter &amp; Gamble called off its purchase of Billie, a women&#8217;s beauty products startup — in December, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued to block that deal, too.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, the U.S. government took an arm&#8217;s-length approach to enforcing antitrust laws, but the tide has turned, says Managing Editor Danny Crichton.</p>
<p>Going forward, &#8220;antitrust won’t kill acquisitions in general, but it could prevent the buyers with the highest reserve prices from entering the fray.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perret, who noted that the last few years have been a &#8220;roller coaster,&#8221; said the Visa deal was the right decision at the time, but going it alone is &#8220;once again&#8221; Plaid&#8217;s best way forward.</p>

<p>To create a detailed analysis of the investor presentations for both offerings, he tried to answer two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are special purpose acquisition companies a path to public markets for &#8220;potentially promising companies that lacked obvious, near-term growth stories?&#8221;</li>
<li>Given the number of unicorns and the limited number of companies that can IPO at any given time, &#8220;maybe SPACS would help close the liquidity gap?&#8221;</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As a precaution against coordinated violence as the U.S. approaches President-elect Joe Biden&#8217;s inauguration, Facebook announced a few new measures it&#8217;s putting in place.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/preparing-for-inauguration-day/">blog post</a> and tweets from Facebook Policy Communications Director Andy Stone, the company explained that it would block any events slated to happen near the White House, the U.S. Capitol or any state capitol building through Wednesday.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Update: Through Inauguration Day, we&#39;re blocking the creation of new Facebook events happening in close proximity to DC and state capitols. And we&#39;re doing a secondary review of inauguration-related events and removing policy-violating ones. <a href="https://t.co/AV6z0gSTiu">https://t.co/AV6z0gSTiu</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Andy Stone (@andymstone) <a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1350210024065392644?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The company says it will also do &#8220;secondary&#8221; sweeps through any inauguration-related events to look for violations of its policies. At this point, that includes any content connected to the &#8220;Stop the Steal&#8221; movement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/facebook-blocks-sharpiegate-hashtag-election-conspiracies/">perpetuating the rampant lie that Biden&#8217;s victory is illegitimate</a>. Those groups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/facebook-says-it-will-remove-references-to-stop-the-steal-across-its-platform/">continued to thrive on Facebook</a> until measures the company took at the beginning of this week.</p>
<p>Facebook will apparently also be putting new restrictions in place for U.S. users who repeatedly break the company&#8217;s rules, including barring those accounts from livestreaming videos, events and group pages.</p>
<p>Those precautions fall short of what some of Facebook&#8217;s critics have called for, but they&#8217;re still notable measures for a company that only began taking dangerous conspiracies and armed groups seriously in the last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> has confirmed with TechCrunch that it oversaw a $195 million secondary sale that values the company at $6 billion. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/gitlab-ceo-eyes-public-market-after-secondary-valued-it-at-6-billion-.html">CNBC broke the story</a> earlier today.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s impressive valuation comes after its most recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/gitlab-hauls-in-268m-series-e-on-2-768b-valuation/">2019 Series E in which it raised $268 million</a> on a 2.75 billion valuation, an increase of $3.25 billion in under 18 months. Company co-founder and CEO Sid Sijbrandij believes the increase is due to his company&#8217;s progress adding functionality to the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe the increase in valuation over the past year reflects the progress of our complete DevOps platform towards realizing a greater share of the growing, multi-billion dollar software development market,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the startup has raised over $434 million, this round involved buying employee stock options, a move that allows the company&#8217;s workers to cash in some of their equity prior to going public. CNBC reported that the firms buying the stock included Alta Park, HMI Capital, OMERS Growth Equity, TCV and Verition.</p>

<p>The next logical step would appear to be IPO, something the company has never shied away from. In fact, it actually at one point included the proposed date of November 18, 2020 as a target IPO date on <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/strategy/">the company wiki</a>. While they didn&#8217;t quite make that goal, Sijbrandij still sees the company going public at some point. He&#8217;s just not being so specific as in the past, suggesting that the company has plenty of runway left from the last funding round and can go public when the timing is right.</p>
<p>&#8220;We continue to believe that being a public company is an integral part of realizing our mission. As a public company, GitLab would benefit from enhanced brand awareness, access to capital, shareholder liquidity, autonomy and transparency,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;That said, we want to maximize the outcome by selecting an opportune time. Our most recent capital raise was in 2019 and contributed to an already healthy balance sheet. A strong balance sheet and business model enables us to select a period that works best for realizing our long-term goals.&#8221;</p>
<p>GitLab has not only published IPO goals on its Wiki, but its entire company philosophy, goals and OKRs for everyone to see. Sijbrandij told TechCrunch&#8217;s Alex Wilhelm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/getting-to-100m-arr/">at a TechCrunch Disrupt panel</a> in September that he believes that transparency helps attract and keep employees. It doesn&#8217;t hurt that the company was and remains a fully remote organization, even pre-COVID.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started [this level of] transparency to connect with the wider community around GitLab, but it turned out to be super beneficial for attracting great talent as well,&#8221; Sijbrandij told Wilhelm in September.</p>
<p>The company, which launched in 2014, offers a DevOps platform to help move applications through the programming lifecycle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Of course COVID-19 was bound to be an unavoidable topic during the first-ever all-virtual CES. After all, the topic is at front of mind regardless of the topic these days. Close to a year into the pandemic, presenters still understandably feel obligated to address the always-present elephant in the room. Sometimes it was as simple as acknowledging the strangeness of moving from the Las Vegas Convention Center to a Microsoft-powered virtual venue. Other times it felt far more forced.</p>
<p>When it comes to the technology itself, there’s no doubt that the pandemic is going to have a profound effect on the industry for years to come, from health measures to remote work setups. Sometimes it’s a genuinely organic evolution aimed at adapting technology to an ever-changing world. In other cases, it can feel far more exploitative &#8212; like the consumer electronics equivalent to a beer commercial discussing “these uncertain times.”</p>

<p>I’ve written a lot about how the pandemic will impact robotics and AI going forward. The short version is that companies will no doubt be more enthusiastic about embracing these technologies, after bumping up against the limitations of a human workforce with a deadly and highly contagious virus spreading across the world.</p>
<p>We saw some glimpses of robotics’ response. Though there tends to be a far longer lead time than in the consumer category. The clearest and most immediate example had to be the prevalence of UV outfitted robotics. LG, Ubtech and Ava Robotics all bombarded my inbox with their take on the category. The desire for disinfecting technology should be clear during a pandemic, and robotics offer both a way to automate a dull and repetitious process like this, while removing a potential human viral vector from the equation.</p>

<p>UV disinfecting made appearances in a number of other form factors. Phones have been a target for the tech for a few years now. After all, it didn’t take COVID-19 to teach us that smartphones are mobile petri dishes we watch TikToks on. Products like CleanPhone from Canadian startup Glissner are looking to enter a space that’s been thus far dominated by PhoneSoap, which was genuinely ahead of the curve on the phenomenon.</p>
<p>Targus’s keyboard may well have been the most widely reported-on UV solution of the show, because, well, it’s a bit wacky, with an ultraviolet lamp that sits above it.</p>
<p>Masks are another piece of the puzzle that have slowly been infiltrating the show, but really hit a fever pitch this year. Obviously wearing a face mask in public is only a new phenomenon in some countries &#8212; in other parts of the world like East Asia it’s long been a normal part of life. Last year, Portland-based Ao Air grabbed some headlines with its own take on the category.</p>

<p>Razer’s Project Hazel was undoubtedly the most prominent mask to debut at the show. It’s big and flashy and a bit of a diversion for a company that primarily trades in gaming peripherals. The N95 mask sports LEDs to indicate charging status and make the wearer’s face visible in dark surroundings. There’s also technology built in to make the wearer’s voice clearer. For the moment, however, it’s hard to see them as much beyond a headline grabber.</p>
<p>One piece I genuinely expected to see more of was remote work. We caught glimpses, like the Dell monitor with Microsoft Teams conferencing built in. Microsoft pitched its new Surface as a remote work machine, but frankly, it didn’t feel any more targeted at that vertical than any other portable Surface.</p>

<p>No doubt many of the innovations companies are working on will have to wait until CES 2022. Fingers crossed, we’ll see them next year in Vegas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp delays enforcement of a controversial privacy change, Apple may get rid of the Touch Bar in future MacBooks and Bumble files to go public. This is your Daily Crunch for January 15, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: WhatsApp responds to privacy backlash</strong></p>
<p>Earlier this month, WhatsApp sent users a notification asking them to consent to sharing some of their personal data — such as phone number and location — with Facebook (which owns WhatsApp). The alert also said users would have to agree to the terms by February 8 if they wanted to continue using the app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This change prompted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/whatsapp-faces-legal-challenge-over-privacy-in-its-biggest-market/">legal threats</a> and an investigation from <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2021/01/11/turkey-investigates-whatsapp-and-facebook-over-data-privacy-update">the Turkish government</a>. Now the company is pushing the enforcement date back three months.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one will have their account suspended or deleted on February 8. We’re also going to do a lot more to clear up the misinformation around how privacy and security works on WhatsApp,&#8221; the company said in a post. &#8220;We’ll then go to people gradually to review the policy at their own pace before new business options are available on May 15.”</p>
<p><strong>The tech giants</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;">This week, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey finally <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510769268850690">responded publicly</a> to the company’s decision to ban President Trump from its platform, writing that Twitter had &#8220;faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance&#8221; and that he did not &#8220;feel pride&#8221; about the decision. In the same thread, he took time to call out a nascent Twitter-sponsored initiative called &#8220;bluesky,&#8221; which is aiming to build up an &#8220;open decentralized standard for social media&#8221; that Twitter is just one part of.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Researchers involved with bluesky reveal to TechCrunch an initiative still in its earliest stages that could fundamentally shift the power dynamics of the social web.</p>
<p>Bluesky is aiming to build a “durable” web standard that will ultimately ensure that platforms like Twitter have less centralized responsibility in deciding which users and communities have a voice on the internet. While this could protect speech from marginalized groups, it may also upend modern moderation techniques and efforts to prevent online radicalization.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_1768336" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1768336" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1768336" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1027291750.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1027291750.jpg 3800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1027291750.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1027291750.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1027291750.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1027291750.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1027291750.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1027291750.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1027291750.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1768336" class="wp-caption-text">Jack Dorsey, co-founder and chief executive officer of Twitter Inc., arrives after a break during a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Wednesday, Sept. 5, 2018.

<h2>What is bluesky?</h2>
<p>Just as Bitcoin lacks a central bank to control it, a decentralized social network protocol operates without central governance, meaning Twitter would only control its own app built on bluesky, not other applications on the protocol. The open and independent system would allow applications to see, search and interact with content across the entire standard. Twitter hopes that the project can go far beyond what the existing Twitter API offers, enabling developers to create applications with different interfaces or methods of algorithmic curation, potentially paying entities across the protocol like Twitter for plug-and-play access to different moderation tools or identity networks.</p>
<p>A widely adopted, decentralized protocol is an opportunity for social networks to &#8220;pass the buck&#8221; on moderation responsibilities to a broader network, one person involved with the early stages of bluesky suggests, allowing individual applications on the protocol to decide which accounts and networks its users are blocked from accessing.</p>
<p>Social platforms like Parler or Gab could theoretically rebuild their networks on bluesky, benefitting from its stability and the network effects of an open protocol. Researchers involved are also clear that such a system would also provide a meaningful measure against government censorship and protect the speech of marginalized groups across the globe.</p>
<p>Bluesky&#8217;s current scope is firmly in the research phase, people involved tell TechCrunch, with about 40-50 active members from different factions of the decentralized tech community surveying the software landscape and putting together proposals for what the protocol should ultimately look like. Twitter has told early members that it hopes to hire a project manager in the coming weeks to build out an independent team that will start crafting the protocol itself.</p>
<p>A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment on the initiative.</p>
<p>Bluesky&#8217;s initial members were invited by Twitter CTO Parag Agrawal early last year. It was later determined that the group should open the conversation up to folks representing some of the more recognizable decentralized network projects, including <a href="http://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>, which joined the working group hosted on the secure chat platform <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a>.</p>
<p>Jay Graber, founder of decentralized social platform <a href="https://happening.net/">Happening</a>, was paid by Twitter to write up a technical review of the decentralized social ecosystem, an effort to &#8220;help Twitter evaluate the existing options in the space,&#8221; she tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;If [Twitter] wanted to design this thing, they could have just assigned a group of guys to do it, but there&#8217;s only one thing that this little tiny group of people could do better than Twitter, and that&#8217;s not be Twitter,&#8221; said Golda Velez, another member of the group who works as a senior software engineer at Postmates and co-founded <a href="https://civ.works/">civ.works</a>, <span class="lt-line-clamp__line">a privacy-centric social</span> <span class="lt-line-clamp__line lt-line-clamp__line--last">network for civic engagement.</span></p>
<p>The group has had some back and forth with Twitter executives on the scope of the project, eventually forming a Twitter-approved list of goals for the initiative. They define the challenges that the bluesky protocol should seek to address while also laying out what responsibilities are best left to the application creators building on the standard.</p>

<h2>Who is involved</h2>
<p>The pain points enumerated in the document, viewed by TechCrunch, encapsulate some of Twitter&#8217;s biggest shortcomings. They include &#8220;how to keep controversy and outrage from hijacking virality mechanisms,&#8221; as well as a desire to develop &#8220;customizable mechanisms&#8221; for moderation, though the document notes that the applications, not the overall protocol, are &#8220;ultimately liable for compliance, censorship, takedowns etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the solution to the problem of algorithms isn&#8217;t getting rid of algorithms &#8212; because sorting posts chronologically is an algorithm &#8212; the solution is to make it an open pluggable system by which you can go in and try different algorithms and see which one suits you or use the one that your friends like,&#8221; says Evan Henshaw-Plath, another member of the working group. He was one of Twitter&#8217;s earliest employees and has been building out his own decentralized social platform called <a href="https://planetary.social/">Planetary</a>.</p>
<p>His platform is based on the secure scuttlebutt protocol, which allows users to browse networks offline in an encrypted fashion. Early on, Planetary had been in talks with Twitter for a corporate investment as well as a personal investment from CEO Jack Dorsey, Henshaw-Plath says, but the competitive nature of the platform prompted some concern among Twitter&#8217;s lawyers and Planetary ended up receiving an investment from <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Twitter co-founder Biz Stone&#8217;s venture fund Future Positive. Stone did not respond to interview requests.</span></p>
<p>After agreeing on goals, Twitter had initially hoped for the broader team to arrive at some shared consensus, but starkly different viewpoints within the group prompted Twitter to accept individual proposals from members. Some pushed Twitter to outright adopt or evolve an existing standard while others pushed for bluesky to pursue interoperability of standards early on and see what users naturally flock to.</p>
<p>One of the developers in the group hoping to bring bluesky onto their standard was Mastodon creator Eugen Rochko, who tells TechCrunch he sees the need for a major shift in how social media platforms operate globally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Banning Trump was the right decision though it came a little bit too late. But at the same time, the nuance of the situation is that maybe it shouldn&#8217;t be a single American company that decides these things,&#8221; Rochko tells us.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RtzyeO0iXf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">The deplatforming of President Trump</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The deplatforming of President Trump&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/embed/#?secret=RtzyeO0iXf" data-secret="RtzyeO0iXf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Like several of the other members in the group, Rochko has been skeptical at times about Twitter&#8217;s motivation with the bluesky protocol. Shortly after Dorsey&#8217;s initial announcement in 2019, Mastodon&#8217;s official Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/joinmastodon/status/1204791506143457281?s=20">tweeted out a biting critique</a>, writing, &#8220;This is not an announcement of reinventing the wheel. This is announcing the building of a protocol that Twitter gets to control, like Google controls Android.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, Mastodon is arguably one of the most mature decentralized social platforms. Rochko claims that the network of decentralized nodes has more than 2.3 million users spread across thousands of servers. In early 2017, the platform had its viral moment on Twitter, prompting an influx of &#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of new users alongside some inquisitive potential investors whom Rochko has rebuffed in favor of a donation-based model.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1809256" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1809256" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1809256" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/toxic-twitter-alt.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/toxic-twitter-alt.png 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/toxic-twitter-alt.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/toxic-twitter-alt.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/toxic-twitter-alt.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/toxic-twitter-alt.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/toxic-twitter-alt.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1809256" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<h2>Inherent risks</h2>
<p>Not all of the attention Rochko has garnered has been welcome. In 2019, Gab, a social network favored by right-wing extremists, brought its entire platform onto the Mastodon network after integrating the platform&#8217;s open-source code, bringing Mastodon its single biggest web of users and its most undesirable liability all at once.</p>
<p>Rochko quickly disavowed the network and aimed to sever its ties to other nodes on the Mastodon platform and convince application creators to do the same. But a central fear of decentralization advocates was quickly realized, as the platform type&#8217;s first &#8220;success story&#8221; was a home for right-wing extremists.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Dxlo8v8WHs"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-is-officially-offline-after-aws-suspension/">Parler is officially offline after AWS suspension</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Parler is officially offline after AWS suspension&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-is-officially-offline-after-aws-suspension/embed/#?secret=Dxlo8v8WHs" data-secret="Dxlo8v8WHs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This fear has been echoed in decentralized communities this week as app store owners and networks have taken another right-wing social network, Parler, off the web after violent content surfaced on the site in the lead-up to and aftermath of riots at the U.S. Capitol, leaving some developers fearful that the social network may set up home on their decentralized standard.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Fascists are 100% going to use peer-to-peer technologies, they already are and they&#8217;re going to start using it more&#8230; If they get pushed off of mainstream infrastructure or people are surveilling them really closely, they&#8217;re going to have added motivation,&#8221; said Emmi Bevensee, a researcher <a href="https://emmibevensee.com/">studying</a> extremist presences on decentralized networks. &#8220;Maybe the far-right gets stronger footholds on peer-to-peer before the people who think the far-right is bad do because they were effectively pushed off.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>A central concern is that commoditizing decentralized platforms through efforts like bluesky will provide a more accessible route for extremists kicked off current platforms to maintain an audience and provide casual internet users a less janky path towards radicalization.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peer-to-peer technology is generally not that seamless right now. Some of it is; you can buy Bitcoin in Cash App now, which, if anything, is proof that this technology is going to become much more mainstream and adoption is going to become much more seamless,&#8221;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Bevensee told TechCrunch. </span>&#8220;In the current era of this mass exodus from Parler, they&#8217;re obviously going to lose a huge amount of audience that isn&#8217;t dedicated enough to get on IPFS. Scuttlebutt is a really cool technology but it&#8217;s not as seamless as Twitter.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="M549TT2LjY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/telegram-channels-banned-violent-threats-capitol/">Telegram blocks ‘dozens’ of hardcore hate channels threatening violence</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Telegram blocks ‘dozens’ of hardcore hate channels threatening violence&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/telegram-channels-banned-violent-threats-capitol/embed/#?secret=M549TT2LjY" data-secret="M549TT2LjY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Extremists adopting technologies that promote privacy and strong encryption is far from a new phenomenon, encrypted chat apps like Signal and Telegram have been at the center of such controversies in recent years. Bevensee notes the tendency of right-wing extremist networks to adopt decentralized network tech has been &#8220;extremely demoralizing&#8221; to those early developer communities &#8212; though she notes that the same technologies can and do benefit &#8220;marginalized people all around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though people connected to bluesky&#8217;s early moves see a long road ahead for the protocol&#8217;s development and adoption, they also see an evolving landscape with Parler and President Trump&#8217;s recent deplatforming that they hope will drive other stakeholders to eventually commit to integrating with the standard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right at this moment I think that there&#8217;s going to be a lot of incentive to adopt, and I don&#8217;t just mean by end users, I mean by platforms, because Twitter is not the only one having these really thorny moderation problems,&#8221; Velez says. &#8220;I think people understand that this is a critical moment.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Marc Lore, the executive vice president, president and CEO of U.S. e-commerce for Walmart,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/104169/000010416921000005/wmt-20210114.htm"> is stepping down</a> a little over four years after selling his e-commerce company Jet.com to the country&#8217;s largest retailer for $3 billion.</p>
<p>Lore&#8217;s tenure at the company was a mixed bag. Walmart instituted several new technology initiatives under Lore&#8217;s tenure, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/walmart-says-it-will-discontinue-jet-com-which-it-acquired-for-3b-in-2016/">the Jet.com service was shuttered last May</a> and other initiatives from Lore, like an option to have customers order items via text, was also a money-loser for the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company.</p>

<p>&#8220;After Mr. Lore retires on January 31, 2021, the U.S. business, including all the aspects of US retail eCommerce, will continue to report to John Furner, Executive Vice President, President and Chief Executive Officer, Walmart U.S., beginning on February 1, 2021,&#8221; Walmart said in a filing.</p>
<p>Walmart has continued to push ahead with a number of tech-related initiatives, including the launch of a new business that will focus on developing financial services.</p>
<p>That initiative is being undertaken through a strategic partnership with the fintech investment firm, Ribbit Capital and adds to a startup tech portfolio that also includes the incubator Store N⁰8, <a href="https://www.storeno8.com/the-l8est/how-to-better-serve-the-consumer-of-the-future-starting-today">which launched in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reflecting on the past few years with so much pride – Walmart changed my life and the work we did together will keep changing the lives of customers for years to come. It has been an honor to be a part of the Walmart family and I look forward to providing advice and ideas in the future,&#8221; Lore said in a statement posted to Linkedin. &#8220;Looking forward, I’ll be taking some time off and plan to continue working with several startups. Excited to keep you all up to date on what’s next.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coinbase has a problem. As interest in Bitcoin has soared along with its price, the popular cryptocurrency exchange has found itself the target of a growing spate of angry customers who haven&#8217;t been able to access customer service.</p>
<p>A quick look at Twitter tells the story. As one upset user of the service ranted earlier today: &#8220;Multiple issues over the last month which cost me $$$ several open cases and 0% response?? When are you going to help me or is it easier to just forget. This wont be so easy when your publicly traded. Will be following up with [SEC] soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are many (many) similar complaints to be found.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the interest of full disclosure, this editor asked the company this week for more insight into its customer service operations after emailing its support staff more than a half dozen times and tweeting once over 10 days, and receiving no response. (I bought one unit of Ether in 2018 on the platform and wanted to access my account, which I&#8217;d been locked out of nearly two years ago.)</p>
<p>To its credit, Coinbase today<a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/committing-to-better-customer-service-during-this-time-of-heightened-interest-in-the-cryptoeconomy-5dc2637c4fa7"> issued a statement</a>, promising to do better. Its VP of customer success, Casper Sorenson, wrote on the company&#8217;s blog that Coinbase is &#8220;committing to a better customer experience during this time of heightened interest in the cryptoeconomy.&#8221;  The company says it is adding more people to its team; adding more self-service options (there are startling few); expanding its &#8220;help center&#8221;; and launching a new educational site, Coinbase Learn, &#8220;as a one-stop-shop for first timers, experienced investors, and everyone in between.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most meaningful perhaps, Coinbase says that in the coming months, it will begin offering live messaging with Coinbase representatives, which is not currently an option. Indeed, Coinbase does not offer live support of any kind. A help support phone line is only available to users wanting to freeze their accounts, and it is automated. (The flip side of its slow customer response times may tie to the apparent seriousness with which Coinbase, which works closely with regulated banks, <a href="https://blockonomi.com/is-coinbase-safe/">takes security issues</a>.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wV1Pw9vsBy"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/coinbase-files-to-go-public-confidentially-and-were-hyped/">Coinbase files to go public confidentially and we&#8217;re hyped</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Coinbase files to go public confidentially and we&#8217;re hyped&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/coinbase-files-to-go-public-confidentially-and-were-hyped/embed/#?secret=wV1Pw9vsBy" data-secret="wV1Pw9vsBy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Either way, the company will have to do far more for its increasingly mainstream users as a publicly traded outfit, both because regulators will undoubtedly take a greater interest in its unhappy customers and because it will otherwise lose existing and potential clients to rivals, of which there are a growing array, from the international payment giant PayPal, which is now seeing <a href="https://beincrypto.com/paypals-cryptocurrency-trading-volume-soars-past-242m-in-24-hours/">record daily cryptocurrency trading</a>, to investment brokers like Robinhood. (Another increasingly popular option: digital asset <a href="https://craft.co/grayscale/competitors">managers</a> like Grayscale, whose trusts are publicly traded over the counter.)</p>
<p>More attention to the issue appears overdue. While Coinbase has presumably been dealing with a surge in complaints that corresponds with the volatility of Bitcoin&#8217;s ups and downs, customer service has been an ongoing issue for the nearly nine-year-old, San Francisco outfit, which filed its <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-files-confidentially-for-ipo-aiming-for-major-crypto-industry-milestone-195758729.html">confidential form</a> with the SEC in December to go public and says it has 35 million users in more than 100 countries.</p>
<p>In 2018, Mashable obtained <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sec-coinbase-complaints-fraud/">134 pages of complaints</a> filed to the SEC and the California Department of Business Oversight following a five-month FOIA process, and the picture that emerged was &#8220;not of a responsible actor in the cryptocurrency space opening the market to new investors, but rather a company overwhelmed by and underprepared for its own success,&#8221; the outlet reported at the time.</p>
<p>Asked today, among other things, how Coinbase&#8217;s processes have since changed, how many of its more than 1,200 employees are focused on customer support, and whether the outfit could share its latest customer numbers, Coinbase, currently in its SEC-mandated quiet period, declined to comment.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Coinbase has raised $547.3 million in venture backing over the years, according to Crunchbase. Tiger Global Management, which is currently raising up to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/tiger-global-is-raising-a-new-3-75-billion-venture-fund-one-year-after-closing-its-last/">$3.75 billion for its newest fund</a>, led Coinbase&#8217;s company&#8217;s most recent private round, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/coinbase-is-now-valued-at-8b-after-closing-new-300m-round/">$300 million Series E financing</a> that closed in 2018 and assigned Coinbase a post-money valuation of $8 billion.</p>
<p>Last September, the company parted ways with more than 5% of its employees, after cofounder and CEO Brian Armstrong publicly discouraged employee activism and political discussions at work, then offered severance to staffers who were uncomfortable with the policy.</p>
<p>Roughly <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/a-follow-up-to-coinbase-as-a-mission-focused-company-6e7545e9aea2">60 people</a> took the company up on the offer, Coinbase itself later revealed.</p>
<p>Coinbase&#8217;s IPO has been eagerly anticipated by many, though changes in Washington could potentially have a dampening effect on the company and other exchanges.</p>
<p>Coinbase&#8217;s own former chief legal officer, Brian Brooks, was last summer appointed as the acting head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and among his other crypto-friendly efforts, he published interpretive letters and announcements declaring that banks can partner with crypto custodians and conduct payments using stablecoins.</p>
<p>It was never entirely clear how much weight those letters and announcements carried. Asked last week about Brooks&#8217;s most recent interpretive letter, in which he stated that financial institutions can participate as nodes on a blockchain and store or validate payments, the FDIC said in an emailed response that it had no comment.</p>
<p>Asked last week if Brooks&#8217;s letter signaled changing U.S. monetary policy, the U.S. Treasury Department did not respond to our press request.</p>
<p>Brooks&#8217;s reign has ended, in any case. With a new incoming administration, he resigned from his position this week, replaced by a career OCC employee, Blake Paulson, who may himself be replaced in coming weeks. The change leaves question about how and whether the agency&#8217;s tone toward cryptocurrency will change.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gary Gensler, a former financial regulator and Goldman Sachs banker who has most recently been teaching at M.I.T. is expected to be nominated to lead the SEC. He is also expected to welcome greater oversight of the <a href="https://qz.com/1954555/all-the-worlds-crypto-is-now-worth-more-than-1-trillion">$1 trillion</a> cryptocurrency market than Jay Clayton, the Wall Street attorney who stepped down from the role last month after three years.</p>

	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Launching is easy; fundraising is harder.</p>
<p>I’ve been fortunate to be a partner at two different VC firms over the past nine years, and we’ve grown AUM 10x both times.</p>
<p>Based on my experience, taking the 15 steps below will help build the core of a high-performing fundraising and investor relations function.</p>
<h2>1. Build the firm as much as possible before soliciting LPs</h2>
<p>The more baked you are, the more investable you are. The best possible move is to invest in and warehouse some special purpose vehicles that fit your strategy. However, that may distract you from the larger goal of raising a fund, not just a special purpose vehicle.</p>
<p>The next best move is to build your core team, e.g., recruit an advisory board, venture partners and EIRs. Lastly, gather feedback. Yohei Nakajima, founder of <a href="http://Untapped.vc">Untapped.vc</a>, said, “Before pitching LPs and building my firm, I talked with over 50 people I knew to get feedback.”</p>
<h2>2. Set up a basic marketing toolkit: Deck, website and social media</h2>
<p>It’s virtually mandatory to develop a detailed, data-backed deck and ideally a video pitch. Your materials should ideally meet the <a href="http://teten.com/lpdd">expectations</a> of the Institutional Limited Partners Association, even if you’re not targeting institutions. Keep these documents constantly up to date, so all team members are aligned on key numbers, e.g., total dollars raised so far. You’ll look unprofessional if you’re not coordinated.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, almost no one invests based on a deck; they want to talk with the people. However, a high-credibility deck opens the door to a meeting where you then have the chance to sell yourself.</p>
<p>Note that limited partners view formatting as a proxy for professionalism. It’s worth investing a little money in a graphic designer who can design a consistent website, business card, logo and presentation templates.</p>
<p>Richard Dukas, CEO, <a href="https://www.dlpr.com/">Dukas Linden Public Relations</a>, said, “If you don&#8217;t have a website and have no material online presence, you likely won&#8217;t get past the first hurdle with potential investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>When you’re fundraising, you’re selling a luxury good. The less widely marketed your fund, the more valuable it is perceived to be. For example, one LP told me she prefers to receive customized emails from fund principals, as opposed to a bulk-mailed quarterly update. An extreme example of this are venture capitalists who don’t even bother with a website, e.g., <a href="http://www.benchmark.com/">Benchmark</a> and <a href="https://www.thrivecap.com/">Thrive Capital</a>. They are the equivalent of a nightclub with an unmarked door, but other investors will need to <a href="https://teten.com/PE-social">shape up their social media tech stack</a>.</p>
<h2>3. Make your online profile data-driven and internally consistent</h2>
<p>All team members should have internally consistent and professional profiles on Linkedin at a minimum and typically also on Twitter, Facebook and/or other platforms you use. In particular, highlight the metrics by which you measured <a href="http://teten.com/resume">your past activities</a>: size of exit, number of people you managed, budget you were responsible for, etc.</p>
<h2>4. Set up a data room with a completed due diligence questionnaire</h2>
<p>Among the most important information to include: details on return history, legal documents, fund organization chart, <a href="https://medium.com/@eniacvc/seed-fund-portfolio-construction-for-dummies-9ec5b4d152dc">portfolio construction model</a>, portfolio company one-pagers, key personnel resumes and case studies of past investments. We are using <a href="http://digify.com">Digify</a> to manage this.</p>
<h2>5. Prepare FAQs for prospective LPs</h2>
<p>You will inevitably receive a wide range of one-off questions from potential LPs. Make sure to compile all your answers in a single document so that you can recycle and refine these answers.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://tophat.com/">Top Hat</a>, a startup that digitizes textbooks and turns them into an interactive experience for college students, announced on Wednesday that it has acquired yet another business: Fountainhead Press. The acquisition marks Top Hat’s third scoop of a publishing company in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Consolidation is going to be huge in the next few years for edtech, as bigger players raise enough financing (and gain profits) to be able to afford other businesses.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Top Hat’s whole business proposition is a subtweet to Zoom University: It wants to make learning an active, online experience and completely digital. That focus has let them reach 3.5 million students and thousands of universities. With a new acquisition, Top Hat is bringing more content into its fold, and with it, more customers who need a better solution to a dusty textbook.</p>
<p>I caught up with Top Hat CEO and founder <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSilagadze?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Mike Silagadze</a> to understand what has triggered this string of content acquisitions. While the M&amp;A isn’t tech-focused, we can learn about how a well-funded edtech startup is navigating the early innings of 2021.</p>
<p>We’ll talk about the shift from offline to online, edtech’s consolidation environment and why the “sell to Pearson or bust” mindset might officially be out the door for the sector.</p>
<h2><strong>Offline to online</strong></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Group Nine Media <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/group-nine-spac/">revealed last month</a> that it was forming a SPAC (short for special purpose acquisition corporation) in order to raise money for acquisitions.</p>
<p>The company has now moved forward with those plans, announcing last night that it had priced the SPAC&#8217;s IPO at $10 per unit, to raise a total of $200 million. It&#8217;s now trading on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol GNACU; as of 2:53 p.m. Eastern shares were up 6.55%. (Eventually, the Class A common stock will be listed as GNAC and warrants will be listed separately as GNACW.) The offering is expected to close on January 20.</p>
<p>The acquisition corporation, like Group Nine itself, is led by CEO Ben Lerer (pictured above). Imagination Capital Partner Richard D. Parsons and Reddit Chief Operating Officer Jen Wong are also on the board of directors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Group Nine was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/13/group-nine-media/">formed in 2016</a> with backing from Discovery, merging Thrillist, NowThis, The Dodo and Seeker. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/group-nine-acquires-popsugar/">subsequently acquired PopSugar</a>, with co-founder Brian Sugar becoming president of both Group Nine and now Group Nine Acquisition Corp.</p>
<p>SPACs, also known as blank-check corporations, have become an increasingly popular way for companies to raise money from the public markets. In its initial filing, Group Nine said it would use the funding &#8220;for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve got an Apple TV+ trial that&#8217;s set to expire sometime between now and June, good news: you&#8217;re getting some free bonus time.</p>
<p>Apple TV+ first launched in November of 2019, alongside a one-year free trial for anyone buying a new iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple TV or Mac. As those initial trials approached their end, Apple voluntarily <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/apple-is-extending-some-appletv-subs-through-february-2021-for-free/">extended them out to February of 2021</a>. Now they&#8217;re extending them once again.</p>
<p>As first reported <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/15/apple-again-extends-apple-tv-free-trials-subscribers-now-get-free-access-until-july-2021/">by 9to5Mac</a>, any trial that previously would&#8217;ve expired from February to June of 2021 will now expire in July instead. We have confirmed these plans with Apple.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Users should expect to get an email about the extension in the coming weeks. If you&#8217;re already paying for AppleTV+ or have it as part of an Apple One bundle, meanwhile, you&#8217;ll be getting a $4.99 per month credit until the end of June.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t already, take this as an opportunity to blast through Ted Lasso, which is probably the most charming thing anyone has made for TV in a decade. Central Park is also great, though it has yet to hook me in quite the same way as Loren Bouchard&#8217;s other series (Bob&#8217;s Burgers, Home Movies).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Desktop Metal this morning announced its intention to purchase fellow 3D printing company EnvisionTEC. Founded in Germany in 2002, EnvisionTEC specializes in photopolymer additive manufacturing, putting its technology in more direct competition with the likes of 3D printing darling Carbon than Desktop Metal’s own existing portfolio.</p>
<p>The deal follows Desktop Metal’s push to go public last August as part of a growing trend of SPAC mergers. Prior to this, the company had raised no shortage of its own funds, with a rapid ascent into unicorn status on the wake of $430 million in investments. It’s spending $300 million to acquire EnvisionTEC through a combination of cash and stock.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of potential for Desktop Metal to grow here. EnvisionTEC has the underlying technology with the ability to print in more than 190 materials, and Desktop Metal has the resources to help scale that tech beyond what the German company has been able to build thus far.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s clear that dental is a pretty huge piece of this puzzle. It’s among the clearest and most immediate use cases for this sort of mass volume 3D printing &#8212; and, indeed, the company already sports around 1,000 customers in dental, including companies like Smile Direct Club. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the company effectively tripled its Envision One dental shipments over the previous year.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s used for everything from restorations to same-day, full arch implants,” Desktop Metal CEO Ric Fulop tells TechCrunch. “Usually when you get a denture, you’ve got to wait three weeks for denture implants. This is the first time you&#8217;ve got a solution that can do it in the same day. And it’s affordable.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210115005221/en/Desktop-Metal-to-Acquire-EnvisionTEC-Entering-Market-for-Volume-Production-Polymer-Additive-Manufacturinghttps:/www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210115005221/en/Desktop-Metal-to-Acquire-EnvisionTEC-Entering-Market-for-Volume-Production-Polymer-Additive-Manufacturing">Per a press release</a> issued in the wake of the news, other existing customers include Ford and Hasbro. Fulop says the company will continue to operate as its own division after the acquisition, which is expected to close this quarter.</p>
<p>“We’ll be able to leverage their channel,” the executive says. “We look forward to expanding on that capability and using our channel to give them more tools to have a full solution that spans from metal to composites to biomaterials and now photopolymer printing.”</p>
