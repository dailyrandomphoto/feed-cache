										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With two giants calling the shots and collecting whatever tolls they see fit, mobile software makers have long complained that app stores take an unfair cut of the cash that should be flowing directly to developers. Hearing those concerns, a group of senators introduced a new bill this week that, if passed, would greatly diminish Apple and Google&#8217;s ability to control app purchases in their operating systems and completely shake up the way that mobile software gets distributed.</p>
<p>The new bill, called <a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/8.11.21%20-%20Open%20App%20Markets%20Act%20-%20Bill%20Text.pdf">the Open App Markets Act</a>, would enshrine quite a few rights that could benefit app developers tired of handing 30 percent of their earnings to Apple and Google. The bill, embedded in full below, would require companies that control operating systems to allow third party apps and app stores.</p>
<p>It would also prevent those companies from blocking developers from telling users about lower prices for their software that they might find outside of official app stores. Apple and Google would also be barred from leveraging &#8220;non-public&#8221; information collecting through their platforms to create competing apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;This legislation will tear down coercive anticompetitive walls in the app economy, giving consumers more choices and smaller startup tech companies a fighting chance,&#8221; said Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), who introduced the bipartisan bill with Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). Klobuchar chairs the Senate&#8217;s antitrust subcommittee and Blackburn and Blumenthal are both subcommittee members.</p>
<p>Senator Blackburn called Apple and Google&#8217;s app store practices a &#8220;direct affront to a free and fair marketplace&#8221; and Sen. Klobuchar noted that their behavior raises &#8220;serious competition concerns.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" src="https://www.scribd.com/embeds/519922659/content?start_page=1&view_mode&access_key=key-8egZfKyFWBMht6E2ep5m"  data-auto-height="true" scrolling="no" id="scribd_519922659" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>The bill draws on information collected earlier this year from that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/senate-antitrust-hearing-apple-tile-spotify-match-epic/">subcommittee&#8217;s hearing on app stores and competition</a>. In the hearing, lawmakers heard from Apple and Google as well as Spotify, Tile and Match Group, three companies that argued their businesses have been negatively impacted by anti-competitive app store policies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; We urge Congress to swiftly pass the Open App Markets Act,&#8221; Spotify Chief Legal Officer Horacio Gutierrez said of the new bill. &#8220;Absent action, we can expect Apple and others to continue changing the rules in favor of their own services, and causing further harm to consumers, developers, and the digital economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/coalition-for-app-fairness-a-group-fighting-for-app-store-reforms-adds-20-new-partners/">Coalition for App Fairness</a>, a developer advocacy group, praised the bill for its potential to spur innovation in digital markets. &#8220;The bipartisan Open App Markets Act is a step towards holding big tech companies accountable for practices that stifle competition for developers in the U.S. and around the world,&#8221; CAF executive director Meghan DiMuzio said.</p>
<p>Hoping to head off future regulatory headaches, Apple dropped its own fees for companies that generate less than $1 million in App Store revenue from 30 to 15 percent last year. Google followed suit with its own gesture, dropping fees to 15 percent for the first $1 million in revenue a developer earns through the Play Store in a year. Some developers critical of the companies&#8217; practices saw those changes as little more than a publicity stunt.</p>

<p>Developers have long complained about the high tolls they pay to distribute their software through the world&#8217;s two major mobile operating systems. That fight escalated in the last year when Epic Games circumvented Apple&#8217;s payments rules by allowing Fortnite players to pay Epic directly, setting off a legal fight that has huge implications for the software world.</p>
<p>Unlike Apple, Google does allow apps to be &#8220;sideloaded,&#8221; installed onto devices outside of the Google Play Store. But documents <a href="https://gizmodo.com/even-google-thinks-a-apps-on-android-is-a-hor-1847440852">unsealed in Epic&#8217;s parallel case against Google</a> revealed that the Play Store&#8217;s creator knows the sideloading process is a terrible experience for users — something the company brings up when pressuring developers to stick with its official app marketplace.</p>
<p>The counterargument here is that official app stores make apps safer and smoother for consumers. While Apple and Google extract heavy fees for selling mobile software through the App Store and the Google Play Store, the companies both argue that streamlining apps through those official channels protects people from malware and allows for prompt software updates to patch security concerns that could jeopardize user privacy.</p>
<p>Adam Kovacevich, a <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tech/2021/04/30/leaked-google-email-reveals-ties-to-new-pro-tech-group-794997">former Google policy executive</a> who leads the new tech-backed industry group Chamber of Progress, called the new bill &#8220;a finger in the eye&#8221; for Android and iPhone owners.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t see any consumers marching in Washington demanding that Congress make their smartphones dumber,&#8221; Kovacevich said. &#8220;And Congress has better things to do than intervene in a multi-million dollar dispute between businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>At least in Google&#8217;s case, the counterargument has its own counterargument. Android has long been notorious for malware, but apparently most of that malicious software <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/play-store-identified-as-main-distribution-vector-for-most-android-malware/">isn&#8217;t making its way onto devices through sideloading</a> — it&#8217;s walking through the Google Play Store&#8217;s front door.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://box.com">Box</a> has been in an ongoing dispute with activist investors <a href="https://www.starboardvalue.com/">Starboard Value</a> over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/activist-investor-starboard-value-makes-official-bid-for-box-board-seats-in-letter/">control of the board</a>, an argument that is expected to come to a head on September 9th at the annual shareholder meeting. In an effort to show shareholders that the numbers are continuing to improve under the current leadership, Box took the unusual move of <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210812005313/en/Box-Announces-Preliminary-Fiscal-Second-Quarter-2022-Financial-Results">releasing its earning report</a> this morning, two weeks ahead of the expected August 25th report date.</p>
<p>Companies don&#8217;t normally report ahead of schedule, but perhaps Box sees the opportunity to do some lobbying, or conversely, to counter any negative lobbying that Starboard may be doing with its fellow investors ahead of the vote.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that in spite of the meeting being on September 9th, like a lot of voting these days, people will be sending in votes throughout this month ahead of that day. Box wants to get its latest financial information out there sooner rather than later, to catch those early voters before they cast their ballots.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Box and CEO Aaron Levie, the numbers look decent.</p>
<h2>Earnings</h2>
<p>It’s not hard to see why Box released its earnings early, as the numbers provide an argument for keeping the company’s current leadership in place.</p>
<p>In the three month period ending July 31, 2021 &#8212; the second quarter of Box’s fiscal 2022 &#8212; the company generated $214 million in revenue, up 11% on a year-over-year basis. And, as Box is quick to point out, its second consecutive quarter of “accelerating revenue growth.” The company bested its own guidance of $211 to $212 million in revenue for the period.</p>
<p>It matters that Box is showing an ability to accelerate its revenue growth for several reasons. First, because doing so puts wind in the sales of its stock; quickly growing companies are worth more per dollar of revenue than more slowly growing concerns, and accelerating revenue growth over time is investor catnip.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HEdV7gPjLX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/activist-investor-starboard-value-makes-official-bid-for-box-board-seats-in-letter/">Activist investor Starboard Value makes official bid for Box board seats in letter</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Activist investor Starboard Value makes official bid for Box board seats in letter&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/activist-investor-starboard-value-makes-official-bid-for-box-board-seats-in-letter/embed/#?secret=HEdV7gPjLX" data-secret="HEdV7gPjLX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The accelerating pace of growth over the last half year also provides footing for Box’s leadership to argue that their product choices have been sound, directly supporting their positions that they should remain in charge of the company. If they made good product decisions quarters ago, and those choices are leading to accelerating revenue growth, why swap out the CEO?</p>
<p>Box had more quarterly good news apart from its revenue numbers to disclose. It also reported improved GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins &#8212; a key measure of profitability &#8212; better billings results than it had previously anticipated for the period. Box’s net retention rate also expanded to 106% from 103% in the sequentially-preceding period.</p>
<p>And the company boosted its guidance for its fiscal year from “$845 million to $853 million” to “$856 million to $860 million.”</p>
<p>The counter arguments are somewhat easy to generate, however. Yes, Box’s revenue growth is accelerating, but from an admittedly reduced base; it’s not as hard to accelerate revenue expansion from low numbers as it is from higher base levels. And the company’s net retention is lower than what any business-focused SaaS company would want to report.</p>
<p>Will the good news be enough? Shares of Box are up around 1.5% in today’s regular trading, despite a somewhat mixed overall market. Investors now have to vote with more than just their dollars.</p>
<h2>Boardroom context</h2>
<p>Starboard <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/starboard-value-takes-7-5-stake-in-box/">bought approximately 7.5% of the company</a> in 2019, and actually stayed fairly quiet for the first year, but at the end of 2020 it started making itself heard with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/as-activist-investors-loom-whats-next-for-box/">rumors of pressure</a> to sell the company. In what appeared to be a defensive move, Box <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/kkr-hands-box-a-500m-lifeline/">took a $500 million investment</a> from private equity firm KKR and gave the investor a board seat in April.</p>
<p>The activist investor did not take kindly to that move, <a href="https://www.starboardvalue.com/wp-content/uploads/Starboard_Value_LP_Letter_to_Box_Stockholders_05.03.2021.pdf">writing in a letter to investors in early May</a>, &#8220;The only viable explanation for this financing is a shameless and utterly transparent attempt to “buy the vote” and shows complete disregard for proper corporate governance and fiscal discipline.&#8221; In that same letter, Starboard made it official that it wanted to take over several board seats outlining a litany of complaints it had about the way the company was being run. It also made clear that it wanted co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie gone or the company sold.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Industry experts bullish on $500M KKR investment in Box, but stock market remains skeptical&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/industry-experts-bullish-on-500m-kkr-investment-in-box-but-stock-market-remains-skeptical/embed/#?secret=l0uUc2aHdx" data-secret="l0uUc2aHdx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Box pushed back that the letter and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/activist-investor-starboard-value-makes-official-bid-for-box-board-seats-in-letter/">another on May 10th</a> did not accurately reflect the progress that the company had made. In July, Box took the battle public <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/box-takes-fight-with-activist-investor-public-in-sec-filing/">in an SEC filing detailing the back and forth</a> dance that had been going between Box and Starboard since it bought its stake in the company</p>
<p>So far, the cloud content management company has staved off all attempts to force its hand and sell the company or fire Levie, but this is all going to culminate with the shareholder&#8217;s vote. It&#8217;s truly a battle for the soul of the company.</p>
<p>If Starboard convinces shareholders to give it several seats on the Box board, it would probably be able to push out Levie, take control of the company and likely sell it to the highest bidder. The early financial report released today, while not exactly stellar, shows a pattern of increasingly good quarters, and that&#8217;s what Box is hoping voters will focus on when they fill out their ballots.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">I’m frequently asked by journalists whether I think venture capital valuations are too high in the current environment.</p>
<p>Because the average venture capital fund returns only 1.3x committed capital over the course of a decade, according to the last reported data from Cambridge Associates, and 1.5x, according to PitchBook, I believe the answer is a resounding “yes.”</p>
<p>So when entrepreneurs use unicorn aspirations to pump private company valuations, how can investors plan for a decent return?</p>
<p>At the growth stage, we can easily apply traditional financial metrics to venture capital valuations. By definition, everything is fairly predictable, so price-to-revenue and industry multiples make for easy math.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			For starters, venture capitalists need to stop engaging in self-delusion about why a valuation that is too high might be OK.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But at the seed and early stages, <a href="https://medium.com/touchdownvc/its-a-trap-3b6bb185eb61?source=friends_link&amp;sk=43952d63b99b72a30d51db57867a0964">when forecasting is nearly impossible</a>, what tools can investors apply to make pricing objective, disciplined and fair for both sides?</p>
<p>For starters, venture capitalists need to stop engaging in self-delusion about why a valuation that is too high might be OK. Here are three common lies we tell ourselves as investors to rationalize a potentially undisciplined valuation decision.</p>
<h2>Lie 1 : The devil made me do it</h2>
<p>If a big-name VC thinks the price is OK, it must be a good deal, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>While the lead investor who set the price may be experienced, there are many reasons why the price she set may not be justified. The lead may be an “inside” investor already, committing small amounts or  —  believe it or not  —  simply not care.</p>
<p>Insiders are investors who have previously placed capital in the startup. They face a conflict of interest because they are rooting for the success of the startup and generally want the company’s stock price to keep growing to show momentum.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why many venture capitalists prefer not to lead subsequent rounds: Pricing decisions can no longer be objective because investors are effectively on both sides of the table at the same time.</p>
<p>Inside-led rounds happen all the time for good reasons  —  including making a funding process fast so that management can focus on building the business  —  but because these decisions are not at arm&#8217;s length, they cannot be trusted as an objective indicator of market value. Only a test of the open market or an independent third-party valuation can accomplish this goal.</p>
<p>It’s also the case that a relatively small investment can relax pricing discipline in some firms. If a funding amount represents 1% of the fund size or less, it’s possible that the VC team may view the investment as “putting a marker down” and not worry about whether the price offers an attractive multiple. For this reason, it’s a good idea to check the lead investor’s check size against the overall size of the firm’s latest fund.</p>
<p>There are other reasons why investors may not care about the valuation. Some VCs are “logo hunters” who just want to be able to say they were investors in a particular company. If you outsource valuation discipline to a lead investor who doesn’t value financial results, your own returns may suffer.</p>
<h2>Lie 2:  We are getting a deal because the price is flat from the last round</h2>
<p>If the last round valuation was $50 million and the current round valuation is about the same, we tell ourselves it’s gotta be a good deal.</p>
<p>Again, this is faulty thinking, because the last round’s price might have been too high.</p>

	</div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">A short decade after<a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/"> software started eating the world</a>, along came headlines about <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/01/21/every-company-will-be-a-fintech-company/">every company becoming a fintech</a> thanks to innovation and growth in embedded finance business models.</p>
<p>This narrative oversimplifies the evolution that’s happening in the financial services sector. Storing and moving money and extending credit in a regulated environment is difficult. And differentiating your offering from incumbent financial institutions requires much more than superficial tweaks.</p>
<p>What really makes a fintech company extends far beyond user interface enhancements and delivering financial services to end customers. It’s what’s “under the hood” &#8212; the full-stack approach that allows fintech companies to truly innovate for their customers.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			What really makes a fintech company extends far beyond user interface enhancements and delivering financial services to end customers.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Embedded finance helps companies and brands outside of the core financial sector distribute financial services. This requires varying levels of effort from the company and looks like anything from Starbucks offering an integrated wallet and payments within its app to Lyft offering a debit card to their drivers. But that doesn’t make Starbucks or Lyft fintech companies.</p>
<h2>The fallacy behind the hype</h2>
<p>The “every company will be a fintech” stance investors are bullish on conflates multiple approaches to inlaying financial offerings, coupling the resurgence of white-labeled financial services (which have been around for decades) with the rising banking, payments and lending-as-a-service players. The latter approach allows companies to customize their financial product experience while outsourcing many core financial services tasks. The former is simply distribution through embedded delivery.</p>
<p>There are four core tenets to fully operate as a financial services provider: a customer-facing product, transactional infrastructure, risk management and compliance, and customer servicing. In the case of lending, there is a fifth tenet: Companies also need to be able to manage capital. Embedded financial services help companies sidestep the majority of what it really means to be a fintech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>White-labeling versus “becoming a fintech”</h2>
<p>While embedded finance is hot today, white-labeled financial services have been around for decades. Branded credit cards, for example, are a common paradigm for white-labeling. They quickly became a lasting way to incentivize consumer loyalty but don’t signal real effort or know-how in financial services. United and Alaska don’t run credit checks, configure billing or handle disputes for cardholding customers, nor do they assume any risk by embossing their logo on a card. The partnerships are<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/advisor/2020/07/15/how-airlines-make-billions-from-monetizing-frequent-flyer-programs/?sh=62a452b914e9"> major money makers</a> for airlines while the risk stays on the financial institutions’ side (Chase, Bank of America and Visa). This risk can even account for significant loss on the financial side: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/27/your-money/airline-frequent-flier-credit-card.html">According</a> to American Express, 21% of its outstanding credit card loans belonged to people with a Delta credit card a few years ago.</p>
<p>This white-labeling approach is becoming common for other services, coming to life in forms like<a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/t-mobile-money"> banking offerings from cell carriers</a>, and it’s by design: Financial services are complex and highly regulated, so brands prefer to defer most of the work to the experts. So while United, Delta or T-Mobile offer financial services under their brand, they are definitely not becoming fintech companies.</p>
<p>In contrast, some corporations are seeing the opportunity to build financial services from the ground up. Walmart’s move to<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-28/goldman-s-consumer-chief-ismail-makes-surprise-exit-for-fintech"> snag</a> Goldman Sachs talent to lead its foray into finance (with Ribbit at the helm) shows promise for a true fintech spinout.</p>
<p>The investment in expertise in compliance and risk management furthers the company’s potential to build detailed and relevant infrastructure from the get-go — a significant step beyond the retailer’s many existing white-labeled financial partnerships.</p>
<h2>The limitations of platforms as a service</h2>
<p>Tools and turnkey solutions that help non-finance companies build financial applications more recently came into the mix: VCs are enthusiastic about new players building embedded payments, lending and, more recently, banking platform services (also known as BaaS) through APIs and backend tools.</p>
<p>As opposed to financial infrastructure services provided directly by sponsor banks or processors providing payments or ledger services, these platforms abstract the underlying infrastructure, wrap them with friendly-to-use APIs, and bundle core financial elements like risk management, compliance and servicing. While these platforms do offer some self-efficacy for companies to provide financial services, their major limitation is that they’re general purpose by design.</p>
<p>Fintechs found an opportunity to serve customers overlooked and underserved by traditional finance through specialization. Traditional financial institutions long applied the generalist model, carrying hundreds of SKUs and serving all segments. This strategy inevitably led banks to invest more in services for their most profitable customers, optimizing for their needs. Less profitable segments were left with stale and one-size-fits-all offerings.</p>
<p>Fintechs’ success with these underserved segments is derived from a relentless pursuit and laser focus on addressing core customers&#8217; unique needs, building products and services designed for them. In order to deliver on this promise, fintechs must innovate across all layers of the stack &#8212; from the product experience and feature set to the infrastructure and risk management, all the way down to servicing.</p>
<p>UI is not nearly enough to differentiate, and addressing customers’ needs while minding overall unit economics is critical. One fintech’s choices on these matters may be completely different from another if they address different segments &#8212; it all boils down to tradeoffs. For example, deciding on which data sources to use and balancing between onboarding and transactional risk look different if optimizing for freelancers rather than larger small businesses.</p>
<p>In contrast, third-party platform providers must be generic enough to power a broad range of companies and to enable multiple use cases. While the companies partnering with these services can build and customize at the product feature level, they are heavily reliant on their platform partner for infrastructure and core financial services, thus limited to that partner’s configurations and capabilities.</p>
<p>As such, embedded platform services work well to power straightforward commoditized tasks like credit card processing, but limit companies’ ability to differentiate on more complex offerings, like banking, which require end-to-end optimization.</p>
<p>More generally and from a customer’s perspective, embedded fintech partnerships are most effective when providing confined financial services within specific user flows to enhance the overall user experience.</p>
<p>For example, a company can offer credit at the point of sale through a third-party provider to enable a purchase. However, when considering general purpose and standalone financial services, the benefits of embedded fintech are much weaker.</p>
<h2>Building a product of choice</h2>
<p>The biggest proponents of embedded finance argue that large companies and brands can be successful with finance add-ons on their platforms because of their brand recognition and install base.</p>
<p>But that overlooks the reality of choice in the market: Just because a customer does one facet of their business with a company doesn’t necessarily mean they want that company as their provider for everything, especially if the service is inferior to what they can get elsewhere.</p>
<p>While the fintech market booms and legacy brands continue to buy into the opportunity, verticalized, full-stack fintechs will trump their generic offerings time and time again. Some aspects of embedded finance and white-labeling will continue to crop up or prevail, like payment processing and buy now, pay later services. But customers will continue to choose the banks/neobanks, lenders and tools built for them and their own unique needs, bucking the &#8220;every company is a fintech&#8221; fallacy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever sold a house, you know what a pain it is to go through the process of listing, showing and negotiating the sale of your home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s so much of a pain that many people put it off as long as possible because they don’t want to deal with it. The result is fewer homes on the market, which exacerbates existing housing shortages in already tight markets such as the San Francisco Bay Area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an attempt to help address the problem, one startup called Aalto has built out a new kind of homeowner marketplace. It’s a private one that doesn’t rely on the MLS, and gives sellers more control of how and when their homes are listed, shown and sold. Today </span><a href="https://aalto.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aalto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is emerging from stealth and announcing that it has raised $13 million in a Series A funding round led by Sequoia Capital. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.background.vc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Background Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://defy.vc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defy Partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.maplevc.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maple VC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Greg Waldorf &#8212; the first investor at Trulia &#8212; also participated in the financing, which brings Aalto’s total raised to $17.3 million since its 2018 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aalto’s online marketplace, which launched in April of this year, directly connects homeowners to buyers. The company claims that a potential seller can list their home on its platform in five minutes, rather than a typical process that is closer to five weeks. Since launching in the Bay Area, Aalto has built up a network of more than 30,000 buyers and more than two dozen homes have been sold via the marketplace. Currently, about 85 homes are listed for sale on its platform, with an average of one new home being added per day. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Sundae closes on $80M for residential real estate marketplace&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/sundae-closes-on-80m-for-residential-real-estate-marketplace/embed/#?secret=8LZoiNadQs" data-secret="8LZoiNadQs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, Aalto founder and CEO Nick Narodny is the son and brother of real estate agents. He concedes that the startup’s platform could be seen as a threat to the industry, but notes the trade-off is that more homes end up on the market, which helps minimize the region’s affordability crisis, and sellers see higher returns.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, 5-10% of total available inventory listed in competitive markets like Dublin, Fremont, Mill Valley and Milpitas are listed on the Aalto platform. And, Narodny said, the company is on its way to bring more homes to market, sooner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Buying or selling a home is one of the biggest events people will ever experience, but it’s also a tedious, outdated process,” he said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aalto aims to double the number of homes on the market in the Bay Area by streamlining the way homeowners can list, without the third-parties or contracts required elsewhere. This dramatically lowers the bar to sell, according to Narodny, bringing homes to market an average of four and a half months earlier than traditional real estate processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform offers a preview listing feature that allows sellers to list with no commitment. They can also build a waitlist of qualified buyers for their home while they consider a sale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We pull the tax record and info to make it super easy and ask the seller to fill out a Q&amp;A,” Narodny said. After filling out that info, sellers can then see interested buyers and those that are prequalified or that can make all cash offers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process is also less intrusive, Narodny said, by giving the seller more of a say in who sees their home and when. For example, sellers can also line up virtual or in-person showings on their own schedule. And they can sell the homes on their timelines &#8212; whether it be in a few weeks, or few months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a San Francisco-based hand surgeon recently listed his home on the Aalto platform with the desire of moving at the end of October. More than two dozen people were interested and he allowed a few people to tour the home. He was able to sell the house based on a timeline that was more beneficial for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People can sell totally on their terms and are much more connected in the process,” Narodny said. Busy professionals such as the surgeon with director and above titles and growing families so far are among the most common sellers on the platform.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189025" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189025" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2189025 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aalto-TC-A.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="365" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aalto-TC-A.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aalto-TC-A.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aalto-TC-A.jpg?resize=300,161 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aalto-TC-A.jpg?resize=768,413 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aalto-TC-A.jpg?resize=680,365 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aalto-TC-A.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189025" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Aalto</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, there is an economic benefit. By removing a middleman, or agent, from the process, sellers can make an average of $44,000 more on their home sale, according to Narodny. The startup charges a 1% fee, compared to the 2-2.5% commission that an agent charges. But if a seller requires help “with the hard stuff,” Aalto has “expert, licensed” people available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sellers can craft descriptions of their homes in a way that comes across as more personal than if an agent does it, according to Narodny.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have them tell their own story of their home,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The approach also gives them more privacy. For example, an MLS will show when a home was listed and any price reductions. A home listed on Aalto won’t include any of that information. Also similar to Airbnb, the seller’s exact address is not shared, just a radius. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefit for buyers &#8212; besides having more options &#8212; is the ability</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to set up instant alerts, join waitlists and schedule showings in one easy-to-use platform. They can also “anonymously prequalify and share that with a seller,” Narodny said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryan Schreier, partner at Sequoia Capital, believes that real estate is “one of the last giant industries with a 1900s experience.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a painful process where the seller has limited visibility and the buyer is holding their breath after every bid,” he said. “Aalto is the first company to reinvent how homes are bought and sold by putting the consumer first. It goes far beyond a listing site and reinvents every aspect of the experience to be customer oriented rather than realtor oriented.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the company plans to expand beyond the Bay Area to other major metropolitan real estate markets in California and across the country. It also plans to use its new capital to continue improving its technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Narodny insists that while the platform may be seen as a threat by some agents, it’s not a malicious thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My family and I are very close. It’s something that I talk about with them quite a bit,” he told TechCrunch. “I believe Aalto truly is additive. We still work with them every day and will continue to&#8230;It’s not like agents are totally being replaced.”</span></p>

The company told investors during an earnings call that it plans to build EV factories in the US and Thailand in 2022 and start mass producing vehicles the following year. Chairman Liu Young-way said the company is also in talks regarding possible locations for plants in Europe.</p>
<p>At its US facility, Foxconn will build vehicles for EV clients including Fisker. The companies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fisker-foxconn-035645198.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><ins>signed a deal in May</ins></a>, and Foxconn plans to start making Fisker EVs by the end of 2023. The two are jointly investing in the Project Pear vehicle and will share revenue from it.</p>
<p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>Foxconn is in discussions with three states, including Wisconsin, for the EV plant, according to <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Taiwan-s-Foxconn-to-build-EV-plants-in-US-and-Thailand-in-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Nikkei" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1"><em>Nikkei</em></a>.

Liu has also suggested Foxconn may build EVs at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/foxconn-wisconsin-plant-ventilators-coronavirus-132525498.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1"><ins>controversial plant</ins></a>.</p>
<p>The planned Thai factory will form part of Foxconn&#8217;s joint venture with oil and gas conglomerate PTT. The two are working on a platform for EV and component production. Liu said Foxconn plans to build up to 200,000 EVs at that plant each year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is thrilled to announce Seth Rogen is coming to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt this September</a>. The movie-star-turned-pot-businessman is speaking on his latest venture: Houseplant, his privately funded entrée into the cannabis business.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/seth-rogen-and-evan-goldberg-want-to-be-your-weed-dealer/">Houseplant made a big splash when it launched in 2021</a>, and it continues to get a lot of attention in the noisy world of cannabis. But, of course, having Seth Rogen involved helps keep the company relevant.</p>
<p>You know Seth. Seth Rogen is one of the biggest stars in the entertainment world and isn&#8217;t shy about his use of cannabis — the plant is nearly a co-star in each of his movies. And now he&#8217;s selling different strains and lifestyle house goods, too.</p>
<p>Houseplant quickly gained a large following. As a result, we have a lot of questions. First, we want to know about Houseplant&#8217;s trajectory and its involvement with the cannabis giant, Canopy Growth. And then there&#8217;s Houseplant&#8217;s use of social media, which is instrumental in the company&#8217;s success. How can other cannabis companies learn from Houseplant&#8217;s strategies? And then there&#8217;s the celebrity angle, too. How can a brand net a high-profile spokesperson or investor, and at what cost?</p>
<p>Houseplant isn&#8217;t just a variety project for co-founders Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. This company can become a significant player in the cannabis world, and we&#8217;re thrilled to have Seth on our stage, answering questions and giving advice.</p>
<p>Passes are now available for the virtual show and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?display=true">there&#8217;s a handful of pass options with discounts for founders, students and non-profits</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?display=true">Get your ticket soon</a> though, prices more than double on September 20. We hope to see you online.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[All told there were 22 venture rounds for New York City enterprise startups worth $100 million or more in H1 2021. How did they raise so much?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We lied when we said that The Exchange was done covering 2021 venture capital performance. Yesterday, we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/vcs-unfazed-by-chinese-regulatory-shakeups-so-far/">dug into preliminary Q3 data</a> for the Chinese startup market. This morning, we’re looking back at just what startups in New York City managed in the first half of the year.</p>
<p>Some startups, at least. We paged through <a href="https://www.work-bench.com/the-state-of-enterprise-tech-in-nyc-1h-2021-funding-report">a report</a> from New York City-based Work-Bench, a venture capital group focused on enterprise technology. The firm ran the numbers on Q1 and Q2 venture performance in their target market. What emerged from the data is a startup market busy accelerating its ability to raise capital, mint unicorns and, increasingly, generate outsized exits.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Gone are the days when the New York startup ecosystem, perennially in Silicon Valley’s shadow, was more hype than substance. (In recent news, Work-Bench recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/work-bench-will-continue-supporting-early-stage-enterprise-startups-with-new-100m-fund/">raised a new $100 million fund</a>.)</p>
<p>There’s a lot to chat through, so we got Work-Bench partner <a href="https://twitter.com/fendien">Jonathan Lehr</a> &#8212; one half of a founding pair that includes <a href="https://twitter.com/jerseejess">Jessica Lin</a> &#8212; to answer our questions. Let’s explore just how large the New York City venture capital market has grown, where the funds are flowing in enterprise-startup terms, and discuss the pace at which the city is minting new unicorns &#8212; can it find enough exits for so many $1 billion startups?</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995212 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>That final question is one that we have about essentially every startup hub in the world. Perhaps New York City will provide a blueprint for how to think about an ever-larger unicorn stable that seems to have a wider entrance than exit.</p>
<h2>A venture bonanza</h2>
<p>At a state level, New York had a huge start to 2021. As with many startup ecosystems, there was far more venture capital activity in the state during the first half of 2021 than in the same period of 2020.</p>
<p><a href="https://cbinsights.com">CB Insights</a> data paints a clear picture: In the first half of 2020, New York-based startups raised $7.6 billion across 667 rounds. In the first half of 2021, however, those numbers swelled to $22.4 billion from 847 deals.</p>
<p>Enterprise venture funding saw similar gains. Per the Work-Bench report, enterprise startups in New York City raised $6.7 billion in the first and second quarters of this year, up 146% from the first half of 2020, when $2.7 billion was raised. Even more notable, Work-Bench reports that venture funding of enterprise startups in its city was up 12x in H1 2021 compared to a full-year 2014 tally.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the figures detail the rise of New York’s key startup market in the last decade.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When someone mentioned to me that Xiaomi was launching its own “robot dog,” my mind immediately went to Sony’s Aibo. And honestly, it would have been difficult to be more wrong. Now that the news has been out for a few days, the company’s heard all of your bad Black Mirror jokes, don’t worry.</p>
<p>And, honestly, the Chinese hardware maker didn’t do itself any favors with the design here. Boston Dynamics has done a lot to imbue its quadrupedal robots with personality, through design language and viral videos of Spot and company busting a move to the Dirty Dancing soundtrack.</p>
<p>With Cyberdog, however, Xiaomi’s design team clearly just leaned in and went full-on Robocop (and the Bladerunner pastiche doesn&#8217;t help) . I receive a deluge of Metalhead gifs every time I post something about Boston Dynamics &#8212; seriously, I’m using Cyberdog as the lead image on this post, just so you can see what I mean. Go check the replies on Twitter. I’ll wait.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188896" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188896" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2188896" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CyberDog_06.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CyberDog_06.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CyberDog_06.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CyberDog_06.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CyberDog_06.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CyberDog_06.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CyberDog_06.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CyberDog_06.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188896" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Xiaomi</p></div></p>
<p>Xiaomi is, of course, far from the first company to release a Spot-like quadrupedal robot. There are a number of companies competing in that space, including ANYmal and Ghost Robotics. For its part, Xiaomi is looking to put a developer spin on the category. Per <a href="https://blog.mi.com/en/2021/08/10/xiaomi-launches-cyberdog-an-open-source-quadruped-robot-companion/">the Mi blog:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>CyberDog is Xiaomi’s first foray into quadruped robotics for the open source community and developers worldwide. Robotics enthusiasts interested in CyberDog can compete or co-create with other like-minded Xiaomi Fans, together propelling the development and potential of quadruped robots.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2189227" style="width: 778px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189227" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2189227" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/yt1s.com-Xiaomi-Cyberdog-Robotic-Dog-Live-Demo.2021-08-12-10_41_57.gif" alt="" width="768" height="480" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189227" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Xiaomi</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The robot is powered by Nvidia’s Jetson Xavier NX platform, coupled with 11-built in sensors, including cameras, touch, GPS and more. The company will be release 1,000 of the robots, price at roughly $1,540 &#8212; a fraction of the cost of the advanced Spot system. The robot is also a fraction of the size of Boston Dynamics&#8217; quadruped. And while there are superficial similarities the project really couldn&#8217;t be more different.</p>
<p>Xiaomi&#8217;s entry into robotics is more about building hardware for Nvidia&#8217;s platform. It&#8217;s a (relatively) inexpensive way for people to get a hang of programming and, perhaps, protoyping robotics. The likely limited functionality &#8212; and availability &#8212; are pretty clear indications that that the company&#8217;s not trying to put a Cyberdog in every home just yet.</p>

<p>A sizable acquisition this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/john-deere-buys-autonomous-tractor-startup-bear-flag-robotics/">John Deere announced plans to buy Bear Flag Robotics</a> for $250 million. We’ve been following Bear Flag since it was a member of the YC cohort. The deal seems like a good outcome for both parties. Bear Flag gets a lot of resources from an agricultural giant like John Deere and Deere gets to step another foot into the world of cutting-edge tech with an autonomous tractor startup.</p>
<p>Says co-founder and CEO Igino Cafiero:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the biggest challenges farmers face today is the availability of skilled labor to execute time-sensitive operations that impact farming outcomes. Autonomy offers a safe and productive alternative to address that challenge head on. Bear Flag’s mission to increase global food production and reduce the cost of growing food through machine automation is aligned with Deere’s and we’re excited to join the Deere team to bring autonomy to more farms.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another startup we’ve been following since its early days, Kiwibot <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/kiwibot-partners-with-hospitality-giant-sodexo-to-bring-food-delivery-robots-to-college-campuses/">is seeing expansion to a significant number of campuses</a>. In spite of campus shutdowns last year, the Berkeley-based company is actually seeing something of a boom due to the pandemic. COO Diego Varela Prada tells TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have a procedure to disinfect the bots between orders. If you’re a student and you don’t want to mix into large crowds, I think it’s much safer to order food through Kiwibot and have it delivered to the library or your dorm.</p></blockquote>

<p>We’ve written about Lidar company Aeva a few times over the years, including last November, when it announced plans to go public via SPAC. This week, the company announced a <a href="https://www.aeva.ai/press/aeva-and-nikon-to-bring-4d-lidar-to-industrial-automation-and-metrology-markets/">deal with Nikon</a> that takes it beyond its existing automotive applications. The company says there are a slew of potential applications, though the chip is still about four years away from production. Fields include, “consumer electronics, consumer health, industrial robotics, and security.”</p>
<p>A whole bunch of robots are making their way to Florida late next year, courtesy of Amazon. The company <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210811005557/en/Amazon-Announces-New-Robotics-Fulfillment-Center-Plus-Five-New-Delivery-Stations-in-Florida-Bringing-Total-State-Investment-to-Over-18-Billion">announced this week</a> that it has chosen Tallahassee (birthplace of T-Pain and objectively the best Mountain Goats album) as the home of its next fulfillment center. The company plans to add to its massive arm of warehouse robots for the 630,000-square-foot space, along with 1,000 human jobs.</p>

<p>FedEx, meanwhile, has implemented Berkshire Grey robotics at <a href="https://newsroom.fedex.com/newsroom/fedex-ground-and-berkshire-grey-team-up-to-streamline-small-package-processing/">a shipping facility in Queens</a> (the best borough). The systems will identity, pick, sort, collected and containerize primarily small packages like polybags, tubes and padded mailers. The systems are set to roll out to additional locations, including Las Vegas and Columbus, Ohio. Says B.G.,</p>
<blockquote><p>This technology has been developed and installed as a direct response to the exponential growth of e-commerce, which has accelerated the demand for reliable automated solutions throughout all stages of the supply chain. FedEx Ground believes that continued innovation and automation will improve safety, efficiency, and productivity for its team members as they continue to keep the e-commerce supply chain moving.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here’s a new company in the food space worth keeping an eye on. Formerly known as Ono Food Co. (then a food truck company), <a href="https://usehyphen.com/">SF-based Hyphen</a> has <a href="https://medium.com/@StephenKlein/robot-kitchen-confidential-33b765ae4cbb">come out of stealth</a> with the announcement of its Makeline automated meal platform. The company says the system is able to create up to 350 meals an hour, with the aid of a single staff member.</p>
<p>“[W]e really see ourselves like Shopify,” CEO Stephen Klein said in a release, “but instead of enabling merchants to compete with the likes of Amazon, we’re enabling restaurants to compete with the likes of DoorDash as well as other services and ghost kitchens that have decided to compete with their own customers by offering their own food brands.”</p>
<p>The platform is set to start rolling out this winter with plans for 300 locations in New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle and Phoenix.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Executives from London-based commercial EV company Arrival told investors Thursday the company was on track to meet planned product launch dates, but much will depend on whether or not the company can fulfill orders and turn letters of intent into sales &#8212; especially a crucial van order with UPS, which could bring in upwards of $1 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>The company’s non-binding orders and letters of intent total 59,000 vehicles &#8212; a number that includes an agreement with UPS to purchase up to 10,000 vehicles across the U.S. and Europe, and an option in the agreement for an additional 10,000 vehicles. If the logistics giant opts to purchase all 20,000 vehicles, the deal could be worth over $1 billion, the company told investors last year.</p>
<p>The 59,000 figure also includes two sales that have come in since the close of last quarter: an agreement with car leasing company LeasePlan for 3,000 vehicles, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter, and a five-bus order from Anaheim, California’s public transportation network.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="iFeYUkHTEI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/commercial-ev-company-arrival-to-build-electric-buses-for-anaheim/">Commercial EV company Arrival to build electric buses for Anaheim</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Commercial EV company Arrival to build electric buses for Anaheim&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/commercial-ev-company-arrival-to-build-electric-buses-for-anaheim/embed/#?secret=iFeYUkHTEI" data-secret="iFeYUkHTEI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s earnings report contains an important asterisk toward the end: “All references to orders and LOIs are non-binding and subject to cancellation or modification at any time.” And there are a number of steps the company must complete before we start to see its vans and buses on the road, including public road trials, completed prototype builds and production certification.</p>
<p>Despite the to-do list, Arrival executives said the Arrival Bus will commence trial productions in the U.K. at the end of this year, with a planned start of production at the company’s South Carolina microfactory by the second quarter of 2022. The first Arrival Vans will be built in the U.K. by the third quarter of next year.</p>
<p>Arrival President Avinash Rugoobur also said the company has decided to open a product development R&amp;D center in India, where it has seen an increase in “potential” orders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I think the Indian market is extremely important,” Arrival CEO Denis Sverdlov added. “It&#8217;s very market unique in terms of size. Pricing for the product and the certification for the product is very much different than what we’re used to seeing in Europe or the United States. For us it&#8217;s an extremely important step because this enables us to create vehicles which can be successful in countries like in Asia and India and so on, so for us it’s a big, big step.”</p>
<h2>A different manufacturing approach</h2>
<p>Arrival, whose investors include Hyundai Motor Company and Kia Motors Corporation, wants to take what it pitches as a new approach to auto manufacturing. Instead of building a large, centralized factory, it aims to build commercial EVs in scalable, more capex-light regional microfactories – and it wants to open 31 by 2024. Arrival’s factories use autonomous mobile robots, or AMRs, which the company develops in-house. The robots were designed to operate autonomously and run on a single AMR software.</p>
<p>The company already has plans for two microfactories in the U.S.: one in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/arrival-to-open-a-second-us-microfactory-to-build-electric-vans-for-ups/">West Charlotte, North Carolina</a>, and a factory in Rock Hill, South Carolina. The company also has a microfactory in Bicester, U.K., which the company said has already produced over 500 composite panels.</p>
<p>Construction on the North Carolina site is due to be complete in October this year, with production commencing in the fourth quarter of next year. The EVs built at that location will eventually end up in UPS’s North American fleet.</p>
<p>Like other new EV makers, the company still has no revenue yet to speak of and its earnings report reflects the expenses associated with bringing a new vehicle to market. Arrival reported an EBITDA loss of €29 million ($34 million). Its adjusted EBITDA loss was €35 million ($41 million) which widened from the first quarter&#8217;s loss of €27 million ($31 million).</p>
<p>Capex came to €65 million ($76 million), primarily due to the costs of staff working on product development and other costs related to factory equipment. The company anticipates spending between €175 million to €225 million ($205 million to $264 million) on capex in the remainder of the year, versus €106 million ($124 million) for the first half of the year. The increase is due to expenses from the Bicester, U.K. microfactory being brought forward into this year, as well as planned openings of other factories in South Carolina and one-off tooling costs.</p>
<p>The company is completing the quarter with €445 million ($522 million) in cash.</p>
<p>Since the first quarter, Arrival has announced a number of partnerships, including with Microsoft for an open software platform, Hitatchi and STMicroelectronics. It also counts LG Chem as its battery cell supplier.</p>
<p>The company, founded in 2015, joined a suite of other transportation startups when it merged with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/arrival-becomes-latest-electric-vehicle-startup-to-test-the-public-markets-with-a-spac/">blank-check firm in March</a>. That transaction, with CIIG Merger Corp., had an implied enterprise value of $5.4 billion and injected the company with around $660 million in cash. The company’s also growing fast: It now has over 2,200 full-time employees, versus 1,300 in December 2020.</p>
<p>Its shares soared to $37.18 apiece in December. Today, the share price opened at $12.80. The company trades on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “ARVL.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Several users from Zambia have taken to Twitter informing the general public that WhatsApp has been restricted in the country amidst ongoing general elections today.</p>
<p>The president and parliamentary elections culminate in a face-off between current President Edgar Lungu and opposition Hakainde Hichilema.</p>
<p>Internet monitoring organization <a href="https://netblocks.org/">Netblocks</a> further corroborated these reports, adding that multiple internet providers in Zambia had restricted access to the American social messaging platform.

<p>Just this week, reports circulated that the Zambian government had threatened to shut down the internet if Zambians &#8220;failed to use the cyberspace during this year&#8217;s election correctly.&#8221; The reports say the government intended to go through with its plans from Thursday, the polling day, till Sunday, when vote counts are expected to have ended.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, the Zambian government, via its Information and Broadcasting Services Permanent Secretary, Amos Malupenga, came out to deny the reports, calling them &#8220;malicious.&#8221; Nevertheless, he mentioned that the government would not tolerate abuse of the internet and if any mischief occurred, there would be no hesitation to take appropriate measures.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government, therefore, expects citizens to use the internet responsibly. But if some people choose to abuse the internet to mislead and misinform, the government will not hesitate to invoke relevant legal provisions to forestall any breakdown of law and order as the country passes through the election period,&#8221; Malupenga said.</p>
<p>Zambia isn&#8217;t the first African country to witness this during an election as social media restrictions and internet shutdowns are now a recurring theme for most African states.</p>
<p>Countries like Cameroon, Congo, Uganda, Tanzania, Guinea, Togo, Benin, Mali and Mauritania have faced social media restrictions and internet shutdowns during elections. A handful of others like Chad, Nigeria and Ethiopia, on the other hand, have experienced similar restrictions for unrelated events.</p>

<p>Most governments argue that they carry out social media restrictions and internet shutdowns to maintain security during elections; however, it&#8217;s glaring to see the process as a means to curb the spread of vital information among voters and the media within and outside the country.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s event shows that despite denying reports about an imminent internet shutdown, the Zambian government is heading in that direction by first cutting off WhatsApp. While writing on the WhatsApp restriction, Netblocks also reported that the Zambian government has proceeded to restrict other social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Twitter.</p>
<p>Still, internet users in Zambia are now using VPN services to bypass the restrictions on WhatsApp and these other social media platforms. Yet, it remains to be seen if the government will enforce a full internet shutdown.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pyka appeared out of nowhere in 2019 with an unusual take on electric aircraft: a pilotless crop duster. The success of this first plane led the company to begin developing its next one, the P3: a nine-passenger craft with a totally unique propeller setup aimed at making regional flights cheaper and simpler. It could be flying as soon as next year.</p>
<p>The company also has a new president in Dan Grossman, formerly of Zipcar, Ford and Maven. The transportation sector DNA he brings could help Pyka create the networks and partnerships it needs to get off the ground in local air travel.</p>
<p>The P3 is intended to fly up to 200 nautical miles (about 230 of our lubber miles) at 155 knots, in other words doing the kind of hour-ish hops people opt for instead of a long drive. Currently these routes are served by larger, more expensive aircraft that often fly half-full, making the economics a bit squirrelly. But by Pyka&#8217;s estimate its smaller, much less expensive to operate aircraft will allow for more full flights per day between regional hubs.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mostly places where driving 150 miles is unfeasible,&#8221; said founder and CEO Michael Norcia. &#8220;The amount of money people spend driving these regional routes, it&#8217;s a staggering amount — billions of dollars, and they&#8217;re not happy about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Existing small craft flights are prohibitively expensive, but Norcia thinks the P3 will be able to match bulk airfare rates while offering many more flights per day and more destinations.</p>
<p>The aircraft itself looks quite conventional, until you look closely&#8230; are those propellers on the fronts <em>and</em> backs of the wings?</p>

<p>&#8220;It hasn&#8217;t been done before,&#8221; said Norcia. And it bears a brief explanation why.</p>
<p>Small planes like this need to change the pitch of their propellers from one configuration during takeoff and climbing to another during cruising, since a different angle is needed for each task. That means the propeller blades have to tilt, which isn&#8217;t simple.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In a normal aircraft, it makes sense to have this quite complex and heavy mechanism on your propeller in order to operate optimally over the whole range,&#8221; said Norcia. &#8220;Electric propulsion provides some opportunities to just massively simplify the aircraft. So all four of the propellers are fixed-pitch: the ones in front are pitched for takeoff and climb out, and the rear ones are for cruising.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a heavy, complex, expensive traditional engine, it would be silly to double the number just so you don&#8217;t have to use variable pitch propellers for takeoff. But with light, simple, inexpensive electric engines, it makes perfect sense to do so, even if it looks unusual.</p>
<p>The front and rear propellers are only both active during take-off and climbing, with the front ones folding away afterwards as then the rear ones take over completely for cruise. It mechanically simplifies things — no heavy duty hinges and hydraulics — and in fact putting the prop back there seems to improve efficiency by about 10%, said Norcia. &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty cool,&#8221; he added. (And they&#8217;ve applied for a patent.)</p>
<p>(<strong>Update</strong>: I misunderstood the way the propellers share work and have updated the preceding paragraphs to reflect that.)</p>
<p>The general size and shape of the P3 are familiar, however, and that&#8217;s not an accident.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re starting clean sheet,&#8221; Norcia said, as the unconventional prop setup attests, &#8220;but the approach to this aircraft was talking to customers and regulators and finding out what they want. The answer was resoundingly a nine-passenger plane.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is partly because of regulatory requirements: planes with certain burdens and passenger counts fall under a simpler, more permissive regulatory regime, as do airlines that fly with nine or fewer seats. Therefore, the simplest path forward seems to be a nine-passenger plane that makes big progress on efficiency and affordability while not reinventing the wheel.</p>
<p>Further expediting its transition from twinkle in the eye to actual flying machine is starting the P3 out as an unmanned cargo vehicle, essentially a drone for medium-size payloads. There&#8217;s a limited market for this (unmanned small aircraft can&#8217;t fly ordinary overland cargo routes), but it&#8217;s a way to put the P3 in the air legally and get the ball rolling with regulators before aiming for the more important passenger plane certification.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188989" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pyka-flight-p3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188989" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2188989" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pyka-flight-p3.jpg" alt="The Pyka P3 flying in the air." width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pyka-flight-p3.jpg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pyka-flight-p3.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pyka-flight-p3.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pyka-flight-p3.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pyka-flight-p3.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pyka-flight-p3.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2188989" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pyka</p></div></p>
<p>The goal is to have P3 in the air by the end of 2022, which is an extremely aggressive timeline for a brand new aircraft. But Pyka has already shipped two aircraft, the prototype Egret crop dusting craft and the production Pelican version.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started the company because we think electric aviation will fundamentally change the way we move for the better,&#8221; said Norcia. &#8220;It&#8217;s unprecedented times for electric aircraft, but most are taking pre-orders for aircraft that <em>may</em> get certified some time in the next decade. We just shipped two Pelicans in the last three months.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grossman said that was a major factor in his choice to join the company and help it scale: &#8220;They&#8217;re shipping right now, and planning on shipping one plane a month next year. They&#8217;ve been incredibly efficient with the money they&#8217;ve made.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, launching a new aircraft is an expensive endeavor, and Norcia said that they are in the middle of raising a big round to fund production scaling and to fly a full-sized P3. If all goes well the passenger version could be in the air as soon as 2025.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just five months after raising </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/taxbit-raises-100-million-to-enable-mainstream-cryptocurrency-adoption-301238809.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $100 million Series A</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://taxbit.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TaxBit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced today it has raised $130 million in a Series B round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest financing officially makes the Salt Lake City, Utah-based provider of crypto tax and accounting software a unicor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n, with a valuation of $1.33 billion. It also brings the startup&#8217;s total raised to $230 million since brothers Austin and Justin Woodward founded the company with their cousin Brandon Woodward in 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IVP and Insight Partners co-led the Series B, which also included participation from Tiger Global, Paradigm, 9Yards Capital, Sapphire Ventures, Madrona Venture Group and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/APompliano"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthony Pompliano</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TaxBit connects digital asset transactions across exchanges so individuals and enterprises can more accurately file their taxes, manage their portfolios and make tax-optimized trades through its platform, explains CEO and co-founder Austin Woodward. Put simply, its software automates all aspects of cryptocurrency tax compliance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its early March raise, the company has tripled its headcount to about 100 people,</span><a href="https://www.dailyrecordnews.com/news/state/taxbit-announces-seattle-presence-with-hq2/article_deccc0b4-9477-5159-b24d-8e275bb5634d.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">launched an office in Seattle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-irs-selects-taxbit-as-software-partner-301288491.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">deployed services with the IRS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and inked partnerships with a number of digital asset platforms. For example, it&#8217;s connected to exchanges such as Coinbase, BlockFi and Gemini.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The digital economy&#8217;s need for tax and accounting software is growing with the industry as regulators require more formal reporting practices. As a result, TaxBit has seen impressive growth. In 2020, it issued over two million tax forms. This year, it is on track to issue over 50 million forms, according to Austin Woodward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The digital asset space experienced a watershed moment during the pandemic, resulting in an accelerated push toward digital payments and alternative stores of value,” Austin Woodward told TechCrunch. “The momentum of adoption across the digital economy is quickly becoming the new normal among the traditional financial institutions and disruptors.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, the crypto world can be a very complex one and TaxBit’s products, designed by CPAs and tax attorneys, provide tax filing and accounting services to not just financial institutions but also to individuals and governments so they can “more easily” navigate those digital complexities.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those products include </span><a href="https://taxbit.com/enterprise"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tax Center Suites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was built for end users and automates back-office accounting functions for finance teams, and </span><a href="https://taxbit.com/consumer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TaxBit Consumer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which aims to make filing taxes on digital asset investments “simple and painless, while equipping users with real-time directional insights to optimize their tax liability throughout the year.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup also works with governmental agencies,</span><a href="https://taxbit.com/blog/the-irs-selects-taxbit-as-software-partner/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">including the IRS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to provide data analysis and tax calculation support for taxpayers with digital assets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dozens of financial institutions are integrating TaxBit’s Tax Center Suite technology, the latest being FTX US.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to scale its tax and accounting offerings across enterprise, consumer and government sectors. TaxBit also plans to double its headcount by year’s end and continue to open new offices in the U.S. and the United Kingdom. Long term, the company has plans for global expansion, with the U.K. “on the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">horizon and other jurisdictions to quickly follow,” Austin Woodward said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its investors are bullish on the company’s offerings, and potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom Loverro, general partner at IVP, believes TaxBit is in the right place at the right time. He’s taking a seat on the company’s board with the raise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Almost every company touching crypto needs tax reporting software. As we all saw with the recent legislation, crypto tax reporting obligations are only getting more rigorous,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And crypto-native companies are not the only ones that need tax reporting. Every fintech and financial institution that is rolling out a crypto offering does too, Loverro added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And don’t forget about state and federal governments here in the U.S. and abroad,” he said. “Then there is the buy side, which includes both consumers and institutions. It’s a deceptively large and rapidly growing market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loverro went on to say that a common refrain that he hears with regards to anything crypto is “Why can’t [incumbent] just add that as a feature?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a former board observer for Coinbase, the investor can attest that crypto is “incredibly deep and complex.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Crypto requires intense dedication and focus. Calculating taxes on buying and selling a single lot of bitcoin may not be that complicated from a tax perspective but what about airdrops, staking and DeFi,” Loverro asked. “Things get pretty complex quickly!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nikhil Sachdev, managing partner at Insight Partners, points out </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that crypto is already a $1.5 trillion market and that is continually expanding as new asset classes begin transacting on blockchains. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our current tax, accounting and ERP software infrastructure isn’t equipped to manage this shift, yet TaxBit has built a platform to help manage tax compliance financial reporting on crypto transactions across industries,” Sachdev said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TaxBit is the only scaled B2B solution across crypto taxes and already won contracts with blue chip logos.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chip design is a long slog of trial and error, taking years to bring a design to market. <a href="https://motivo.ai/">Motivo</a>, a five-year-old startup from a chip industry veteran, is creating software to speed up chip design from years to months using AI. Today the company announced a $12 million Series A.</p>
<p>Intel Capital led the round along with new investors Storm Ventures and Seraph Group, as well as participation from Inventus Capital. The company reports it has now raised a total of $20 million with its previous seed funding.</p>
<p>Motivo co-founder and CEO Bharath Rangarajan has worked in the chip industry for 30 years, and he saw a few fundamental trends and issues. For starters, the chip design process is highly time-intensive, taking years to come up with a successful candidate, and typically the first to market wins.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, Moore&#8217;s Law, where you fit more and more electronics onto an increasingly powerful chip, increases the complexity of these designs, and once in production, there is a lot of waste producing them. Rangarajan started the company to put artificial intelligence to work on the design process and bring chips to market faster with more accuracy in the production cycle.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can train an AI engine to bring about human judgment, and do a lot of design for manufacturability on the design without causing any other issue. So we avoid all these iteration loops [and we can also] design code and validation and timing and again we&#8217;re going from weeks and months to days,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s ultimate goal is to take the chip design process and distill it down using software and intelligence from three years to three months, and while they are not there yet, they have started to attack the problem, and have a working product that looks at chip layout, the underlying RTL code that runs the chip and the netlist, which describes how the various pieces and electronics on the chip connect together.</p>

<p>One other differentiator is that the company is trying to make its AI transparent to explain why it made the decisions it did. &#8220;A lot of AI is just a black box. I don&#8217;t know why the self-driving car suddenly decided to swerve here. Our AI is understandable. We built the solution so that we can tell you why the AI is saying change the chip this way, or why it&#8217;s saying change it that way,&#8221; Rangarajan explained.</p>
<p>The company has paying customers. Although it can&#8217;t name them, there is probably a limited market for this kind of software, so you could make an educated guess that it&#8217;s the chip companies, especially with Intel Capital a lead investor on this round. At this point, the company has 15 employees, 12 of them being full-time, with plans to double or even triple over the next year, depending on how things go.</p>
<p>Hiring is always challenging for a company with a specific engineering focus like this one, but Rangarajan says that the team is already fairly diverse, and he is definitely looking at keeping that going as he builds the company. &#8220;We have to find the right people to join the company and you&#8217;re looking for any and all sorts of great people or backgrounds. [&#8230;] In fact, the more the merrier as far as we&#8217;re concerned. We&#8217;ve got very experienced people who&#8217;ve grown up in the industry and we&#8217;ve still built up a fairly diverse team here,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>For now, he plans to keep the office hybrid, where people who want to come in can come in, but people who don&#8217;t want to, like those with younger kids who aren&#8217;t vaccinated yet, can continue to work from home, he said. And that flexibility should continue even after offices open more completely.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company is developing robotic smart mobile assistants that enable frontline workers to perform their jobs more safely and efficiently.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile field service startup <a href="https://youreka.io/">Youreka Labs Inc.</a> raised an $8.5 million Series A round of funding co-led by Boulder Ventures and Grotech Ventures, with participation from Salesforce Ventures.</p>
<p>The Maryland-based company also officially announced its CEO — Bill Karpovich joined to lead the company after previously general manager at IBM Cloud &amp; Watson Platform.</p>
<p>Youreka Labs spun out into its own company from parent company Synaptic Advisors, a cloud consulting business focused on the customer relationship management transformations using Salesforce and other artificial intelligence and automation technologies.</p>
<p>The company is developing robotic smart mobile assistants that enable frontline workers to perform their jobs more safely and efficiently. This includes things like guided procedures, smart forms and photo or video capture. Youreka is also embedded in existing Salesforce mobile applications like Field Service Mobile so that end-users only have to operate from one mobile app.</p>
<p>Youreka has identified four use cases so far: healthcare, manufacturing, energy and utilities and the public sector. Working with companies like Shell, P&amp;G, Humana and the Transportation Security Administration, the company’s technology makes it possible for someone to share their knowledge and processes with their colleagues in the field, Karpovich told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“In the case of healthcare, we are taking complex medical assessments from a doctor and pushing them out to nurses out in the field by gathering data into a simple mobile app and making it useful,” he added. “It allows nurses to do a great job without being doctors themselves.”</p>
<p>Karpovich said the company went after Series A dollars because it was “time for it to be on its own.” He was receiving inbound interest from investors, and the capital would enable the company to proceed more rapidly. Today, the company is focused on the Salesforce ecosystem, but that can evolve over time, he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding will be used to expand the company’s reach and products. He expects to double the team in the next six to 12 months across engineering to be able to expand the platform. Youreka boasts 100 customers today, and Karpovich would also like to invest in marketing to grow that base.</p>
<p>In addition to the use cases already identified, he sees additional potential in financial services and insurance, particularly for those assessing damage. The company is also concentrated in the United States, and Karpovich has plans to expand in the U.K. and Europe.</p>
<p>In 2020, the company grew 300%, which Karpovich attributes to the need of this kind of tool in field service. Youreka has a licensing model with charges per end user per month, along with an administrative license, for the people creating the apps, that also charges per user and per month pricing.</p>
<p>“There are 2.5 million jobs open today because companies can’t find people with the right skills,” he added. “We are making these jobs accessible. Some say that AI is doing away with jobs, but we are using AI to enhance jobs. If we can take 90% of the knowledge and give a digital assistant to less experienced people, you could open up so many opportunities.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[E-commerce roll-up companies are big in the United States, and Wonder Brands wants to be that for Latin America.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-commerce roll-up companies are big in the United States, and <a href="https://wonderbrands.co/">Wonder Brands</a> wants to be that for Latin America.</p>
<p>The Mexico-based company closed on $20 million in seed funding, co-led by ALLVP and Mountain Nazca, with participation from CoVenture, Victory Park Capital, GFC, QED (Fontes), Korify Capital and Endeavor Catalyst.</p>
<p>Wonder Brands co-founders Nicolás Gonzalez Luna and Federico Malek came together to start the company in January 2021 to acquire digital brands in the MercadoLibre and Amazon ecosystem. It then leverages its technology to scale their operations and grow sales by taking care of the marketing, analytics, supply chain management and working capital needs of the companies. It focuses on companies in the areas of home and garden, sports and fitness, beauty and personal care.</p>
<p>“MercadoLibre has a larger share, but Amazon is entering the region quickly, so there is not one dominating marketplace. MercadoLibre may have half the market, but then it is more balanced between a number of different platforms,” Gonzalez Luna told TechCrunch. “That diversification means operations here are more complex than the classic Amazon seller. Negotiations take longer and require more discussion about who you are to get the trust in you. That’s why we will be doing fewer, but larger deals than our U.S. counterparts.”</p>
<p>Malek’s background is on the commerce side, having worked at Argentinian insurtech company iunigo.com before founding e-commerce fulfillment company Avenida.com, which was acquired by Groupon in 2010. He then worked as Groupon’s managing director in the region. He knew Gonzalez Luna, whose background includes Goldman Sachs where he focused on M&amp;A.</p>
<p>Michael Breitstein, principal at CoVenture, said his firm has made a variety of investments on the debt and equity sides of e-commerce and believes Malek and Gonzalez Luna provide a “great one-two punch” with their backgrounds, as well as the ability to raise capital and build out a platform.</p>
<p>Though there is a lot of competition to acquire digitally native companies in the $1 million revenue range, Malek said Wonder Brands will focus on larger sellers and operators, with a deal target of at least $5 million in revenue. They are also taking a “buy and build” approach rather than the “buy and consolidate” business model many of the other roll-up companies have, he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With its approach, the company’s goal is to enable its acquired companies to sell on multiple channels. It provides support in four areas: category management and brand development, marketing and performance, technology to automate processes like inventory and logistics and operations to manage all of the channels needed. For example, in Latin America, inventory has to be consolidated into one warehouse, but then separated depending on the sales channel, Malek.</p>
<p>Acquiring and scaling companies is big business. London-based Hahnbeck Business Systems, an e-commerce M&amp;A firm that <a href="https://www.hahnbeck.com/fba-acquirers">tracks funding</a> to FBA (fulfillment by Amazon) acquirers all over the world, reports that e-commerce roll-up companies raised $7.24 billion in disclosed funding to date.</p>
<p>According to the different sources, reports say Latin American e-commerce company MercadoLibre has a market cap of between $70 billion and $94.billion. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2021/04/29/what-percentage-of-products-on-amazon-are-sold-by-marketplace-sellers/">marketplace merchants</a> accounted for 55% of units sold on Amazon.com, according to the retailer. In 2020, that accounted for $300 billion in sales, <a href="https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/amazon-gmv-in-2020">according to Marketplace Pulse</a> estimates based on Amazon disclosures.</p>
<p>The seed financing enables Wonder Brands to invest in building a team to focus on the four support areas and marketing. The company has 20 employees currently and plans to triple that in the next month. The funding is also complementing larger debt facilities that the company has available to acquire brands. Its target is to make six or seven acquisitions this year.</p>
<p>The company is on target to achieve $55 million in revenue by the end of the year and will then move toward $100 million in revenue in the next 12 months, Malek said. It currently operates in Mexico and plans to begin operations in Brazil by the end of 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, media software maker Plex released <a href="https://plexamp.com/">Plexamp</a>, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/media-software-maker-plex-launches-new-subscriber-only-apps-for-music-and-server-management/">subscriber-only music app</a> whose name was a nod to the classic Winamp player it aimed to replace. Today, the company is <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/super-sonic-get-closer-to-your-music-in-plexamp/">upgrading the app with a new feature called Super Sonic,</a> which offers new ways to mix up your playlists &#8212; including by matching songs that are &#8220;sonically&#8221; similar, instead of by metadata alone &#8212; like matching based on musical genre, for example.</p>
<p>The company explains that Super Sonic is designed to use the music&#8217;s sound to understand how different tracks relate to one another in your library. This is a different way of approaching a large music catalog and brings to mind something like Pandora&#8217;s Music Genome where songs are categorized based on attributes, like mood, tone, or beats per minute, among others.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188969" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188969" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2188969 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sonically-similar-albums-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="209" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sonically-similar-albums-1.png 2496w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sonically-similar-albums-1.png?resize=150,46 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sonically-similar-albums-1.png?resize=300,92 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sonically-similar-albums-1.png?resize=768,236 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sonically-similar-albums-1.png?resize=680,209 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sonically-similar-albums-1.png?resize=1536,473 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sonically-similar-albums-1.png?resize=2048,630 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sonically-similar-albums-1.png?resize=50,15 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188969" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Plex</p></div></p>
<p>But unlike the Music Genome, where trained musicologists analyze songs across hundreds of attributes, Super Sonic uses technology.</p>
<p>The new sonic analysis feature in Plexamp leverages a neural network and AI to map all the tracks, albums and artists in your library. Super Sonic extracts around 50 parameters from its analysis, which are then weighted appropriately. &#8220;Sonically similar&#8221; refers to two points in N-dimensional space being close to one another, Plex says.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="e1ViVoCDem"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/generative-algorithms-are-redefining-the-intersection-of-software-and-music/">Generative algorithms are redefining the intersection of software and music</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Generative algorithms are redefining the intersection of software and music&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/generative-algorithms-are-redefining-the-intersection-of-software-and-music/embed/#?secret=e1ViVoCDem" data-secret="e1ViVoCDem" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The setup process for using the new feature is fairly CPU-intensive and can take hours or even days to complete, depending on your library&#8217;s size. However, once finished, you&#8217;ll be able to use a whole new set of features for discovering music. This can be particularly helpful if you listen to a lot of indie or obscure music, where metadata may be limited or perhaps not available at all.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After the analysis is complete, a new &#8220;Related Tracks&#8221; feature will let you see which tracks you have that are sonically similar, which can sometimes lead to surprises that you wouldn&#8217;t have otherwise found if only matching on standard metadata.</p>
<p>Another addition, &#8220;Mixes for You,&#8221; will cluster into mixes the songs you&#8217;ve had on heavy rotation, but then add sonically similar tunes alongside your recent favorites. The server will also look back in time to make a few historical mixes based on past habits, too, so you have more to explore.</p>
<p>The company is also rolling out new radio features to address the removal of the popular Plex Mix feature from a few years ago, after a metadata provider change. It now sees the new Sonic data as a way to replace the feature with Track Radio and Album Radio, which play either tracks or full albums that are sonically similar, respectively.</p>

<p>Other additions arriving alongside the Super Sonic launch include a new way to organize and filter albums by type (e.g. demos, live albums, etc.) and an &#8220;on this day&#8221; feature that reminds you of notable album milestones &#8212; like album releases that took place 20, 30 or 50 years ago.</p>

<p>Plex has been working over the years toward making its subscription service more appealing to power users, who are a smaller part of the company&#8217;s some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/plex-launches-a-subscription-based-retro-game-streaming-service-plex-arcade/">25 million</a> registered users. But the company is no longer fully dependent on subscriber revenue to remain profitable, as it&#8217;s expanded into the free, ad-supported streaming market and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/plex-raises-50m-growth-round-to-fuel-ad-supported-streaming-expansions/">raised funding</a>.</p>
<p>Today, Plex&#8217;s larger focus is on expanding the streaming business into areas like rentals, purchases and subscription content. But as Super Sonic proves, the team at Plex will continue to explore technology that will appeal to its core audience of digital media collectors and enthusiasts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/reddit-raises-250-million-in-series-e-funding/">Reddit raised $250 million</a>, bringing the 16-year-old site up to around $800 million in total funding. Today, it announced <a href="https://redditblog.com/2021/08/12/reddit-secures-funding-to-continue-growth-plans/">plans for an even more massive windfall</a>, with a Series F led by Fidelity. The company confirmed with TechCrunch that it has raised $410 million thus far, with plans to raise up to $700 million, putting Reddit at a $10 billion valuation.</p>
<p>The company says funding will go toward building out community and advertising efforts and increasing headcount.</p>
<p>“These efforts require us to grow our teams and make smart bets on how to make Reddit better, faster, easier to use, and more empowering for communities,” Reddit writes. “We are also evolving as a business, maturing, and building the operational structures that will help propel us into the future with transparency, values and integrity.”</p>
<p>As we noted back in February, an extraordinarily strange couple of years found the content aggregation service playing a key role in rollercoaster stock figures for companies like GameStop and AMC, by way of the r/WallStreetBets subreddit. It also kicked off 2021 with a short Super Bowl spot. All of that helped lead to a doubling of the company’s valuation to $6 billion.</p>
<p>For now, it seems, the hype train is continuing. In Q2, Reddit broke $100 million in advertising revenue for the first time, marking a 192% year-over-year increase for the quarter. The site now attracts 50 million daily visitors and hosts 100,000 active subreddits. In March, it announced Drew Vollero would be joining as the site’s first-ever CFO, after assisting with Snap&#8217;s IPO efforts four years prior.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/technology/reddit-new-funding.html">interview with The New York Times</a>, co-founder Steve Huffman notes that it hadn&#8217;t planned to raise another round so quickly, but ultimately couldn&#8217;t turn down what Fidelity was offering. He adds that the funding will also factor into Reddit&#8217;s eventual IPO plans.</p>
<p>“We are still planning on going public, but we don’t have a firm timeline there yet,” he told the paper. “All good companies should go public when they can.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok today becomes the latest tech company to roll out increased protections for minors on its platform in the wake of increased regulatory scrutiny. The company says it will introduce a series of product changes for teen users aged 13 to 17, aimed at making their TikTok experience more private, safer and less addictive. TikTok&#8217;s news follows similar moves recently announced by other tech companies catering to teens, including<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/google-to-introduce-increased-protections-for-minors-on-its-platform-including-search-youtube-and-more/"> Google and YouTube,</a> as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">Instagram.</a></p>
<p>The changes TikTok plans to roll out over the coming months will address in-app messaging, the public nature of users&#8217; videos, the default download settings for videos and TikTok&#8217;s use of push notifications.</p>
<p>This expands on the changes to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/">privacy settings and defaults</a> for users under the age of 18 that TikTok introduced in January. At the time, TikTok debuted stricter rules for teens aged 13 to 15 and slightly more permissive settings for users 16 to 17 focused on default account types, commenting and the use of TikTok&#8217;s interactive features, like Stitch and Duet.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0GbdnWOESb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/">TikTok update will change privacy settings and defaults for users under 18</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TikTok update will change privacy settings and defaults for users under 18&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/embed/#?secret=0GbdnWOESb" data-secret="0GbdnWOESb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Now, TikTok says new users aged 16 to 17 will have their Direct Message setting be set to &#8220;No One&#8221; by default and existing users would be prompted to review and confirm their settings the next time they use the messaging feature.</p>
<p>The company won&#8217;t prevent teens from using Direct Messages, however, but they will have to make a more explicit choice to do so.</p>
<p>The app will also now display a pop-up message when a teen under the age of 16 publishes their first video that asks them to choose who can watch their content &#8212; either followers, friends only or only themselves. (The &#8220;Everyone&#8221; option is disabled.) Before, TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/">had limited</a> who would come across the accounts belonging to teens under the age of 16, which would reduce the visibility of their content to only followers they approved, when using the default settings. Now, it&#8217;s more directly pushing teens to make a choice about how public they want their content to be &#8212; and they have to decide in order for the video to be published, TikTok notes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2188841" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188841" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2188841" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tiktok-visibility-prompt.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tiktok-visibility-prompt.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tiktok-visibility-prompt.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tiktok-visibility-prompt.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tiktok-visibility-prompt.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tiktok-visibility-prompt.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tiktok-visibility-prompt.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188841" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>TikTok also said it will disable Duet and Stitch for users under 16, but this is not new &#8212; it was a part of the privacy changes that rolled out in January.</p>
<p>Separately, teens 16 to 17 will now be asked to make a decision about whether or not their videos can be downloaded by others. While TikTok won&#8217;t prevent the teens from making their content downloadable, it will pop up a box that asks them to reconfirm their choice, while reminding them that this means the videos could be shared to other platforms. (Downloads remain disabled for users 13 to 15, meanwhile.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188842" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188842" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2188842" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tiktok-downloads-prompt.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tiktok-downloads-prompt.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tiktok-downloads-prompt.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tiktok-downloads-prompt.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tiktok-downloads-prompt.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tiktok-downloads-prompt.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tiktok-downloads-prompt.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188842" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>The final change is perhaps the most interesting because it&#8217;s something neither YouTube nor Instagram introduced: TikTok will limit push notifications.</p>
<p>Younger teens ages 13 to 15 won&#8217;t receive any push notifications after 9 PM, while those aged 16 to 17 won&#8217;t receive any notifications after 10 PM. (The notifications resume the following morning at 8 AM).</p>

<p>This part of the update is reflective of TikTok&#8217;s global mindset and its parent company&#8217;s Chinese roots. Today, China is in the midst of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/the-china-tech-crackdown-continues/">a tech crackdown</a>, encompassing antitrust regulations, data security practices, tech business models and even social mores &#8212; like the addictive nature of video games, which <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/03/tencent-netease-shares-tank-after-chinese-media-calls-gaming-opium.html">state media equated to a drug like &#8220;opium.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>TikTok, too, has been called out as one of the most <a href="https://medium.com/dataseries/how-tiktok-is-addictive-1e53dec10867">addictive</a> social apps on the market, thanks to its advanced personalization technology, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/03/tencent-netease-shares-tank-after-chinese-media-calls-gaming-opium.html">interactive design and simple interface,</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/01/18/digital-crack-cocaine-the-science-behind-tiktoks-success/?sh=5823e97a78be">psychological tricks</a> that activate the pleasure center of users brains. The company <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/tiktoks-new-screen-time-prompts-remind-users-to-take-a-breather-21816527">already inserts</a> &#8220;take a break&#8221; videos inside its main feed, because users have been losing hours to scrolling the app. Its decision to limit notifications is yet another acknowledgment of the app&#8217;s ability to lead users &#8212; and particularly younger users &#8212; to create negative digital media habits. By preventing notifications during certain hours, TikTok can point potential regulators to a feature that demonstrates it&#8217;s doing something to address that problem.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="dK6W0y7bUu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/the-china-tech-crackdown-continues/">The China tech crackdown continues</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The China tech crackdown continues&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/the-china-tech-crackdown-continues/embed/#?secret=dK6W0y7bUu" data-secret="dK6W0y7bUu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The changes come at a time when there&#8217;s a broader shift in the industry in terms of how tech companies cater to their younger users, as concerns about screen time, addictiveness, online abuse, data collection, privacy and more have been brought to light.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Congress has been pressuring companies to do more to protect younger users from the more harmful and negative impacts of technology.</p>
<p>One <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/29/coppa-update-teenagers-online/">key piece of legislation in the works</a> is an update to the decades-old children&#8217;s privacy law, COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act). A new bill, the Protecting the Information of our Vulnerable Children and Youth Act, would expand COPPA to include teens under the age of 18 and prevent tech companies from using targeted advertising, among other things.</p>
<p>As a result, tech companies have been revamping their products to make teens&#8217; experience more private and they&#8217;ve increased protections, including over how teens&#8217; data is collected and used by advertisers.</p>
<p>TikTok was early to take action on protections to teens, as a result of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/musical-ly-tiktok-fined-5-7m-by-ftc-for-violating-childrens-privacy-laws-will-update-app-with-age-gate/">multimillion-dollar fine</a> by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for earlier violations of children&#8217;s privacy laws in a crackdown by the government agency that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/ftc-sells-kids-privacy-cheap/">later extended to YouTube.</a> Beyond the privacy changes from earlier in the year and take a break reminders, TikTok also led the market by<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/tiktok-to-launch-parental-controls-globally-disable-direct-messaging-for-users-under-16/"> bundling parent controls inside its app</a> with the Family Pairing feature. The company also offers other resources for parents, including <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/resources/safety-videos?lang=en&amp;appLaunch=web" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">educational safety videos</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/resources/safety-videos?lang=en&amp;appLaunch=web" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">parental guides.</a> And it brought in outside experts to advise on policy creation, with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/tiktok-brings-in-outside-experts-to-help-it-craft-moderation-and-content-policies/">introduction</a> of the TikTok Content Advisory Council.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our priority is to ensure teens on TikTok have a safe and age-appropriate experience as they create and share on our platform,&#8221; said Tracy Elizabeth, TikTok&#8217;s Global Minor Safety Policy Lead, in a statement about today&#8217;s changes. &#8220;This announcement builds on our industry-leading efforts to make all accounts under 16 private by default, age-restrict features like direct messaging, and empower parents with Family Pairing,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>TikTok told us the features will roll out globally, over time, but couldn&#8217;t share a specific timeframe.</p>
