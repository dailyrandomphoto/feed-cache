</div><p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Who should my first marketing hire be?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is (by far) the most common question I’ve received since starting as Fuel&#8217;s CMO, and for good reason. Your first marketer will have an outsized impact on team dynamics as well as the overall strategic direction of the brand, product and company.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The reality is that anyone who excels across all marketing functions is a unicorn and nearly impossible to find.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The nature of the marketing function has expanded significantly over the past two decades. So much so that when founders ask this question, it immediately prompts multiple new ones: Should I hire a brand or growth marketer? An offline or an online marketer? A scientific or a creative marketer?</p>
<p>Once upon a time, the number of marketing channels was fairly limited, which meant the function itself fit into a neater, tighter box. The number of ways to reach customers has since grown exponentially, as has the scope of the marketing role. Today’s startups require at least four broad functions under the umbrella of &#8220;marketing,&#8221; each with its own array of subfunctions.</p>
<p>Here’s a sample of the marketing functions at a typical early-stage startup:</p>
<p><strong>Brand marketing:</strong> Brand strategy, positioning, naming, messaging, visual identity, experiential, events, community.</p>
<p><strong>Product marketing:</strong> UX copy, website, email marketing, customer research and segmentation, pricing.</p>
<p><strong>Communications:</strong> PR and media relations, content marketing, social media, thought leadership, influencer.</p>
<p><strong>Growth marketing:</strong> Direct response paid acquisition, funnel optimization, retention, lifecycle, engagement, reporting and attribution, word of mouth, referral, SEO, partnerships.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;">Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?<br />
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/">Respond to our survey</a> and help us find the best startup growth marketers!</p>
<hr />
<p>As you can imagine, that’s a lot for one person to manage, let alone be an expert in. What’s more, the skill set and experience required to excel in growth marketing is quite different from the skill set required to succeed in brand marketing. The reality is that anyone who excels across all marketing functions is a unicorn and nearly impossible to find.</p>
<h2>So who do you hire first?</h2>
<p>Unless you’re lucky enough to nab that unicorn, your first hire should be a generalist who can tend to the full stack of the marketing function, learn what they don’t know, and roll up their sleeves to get things done. Someone smart, savvy and super scrappy who understands how to experiment across marketing channels until they find the right mix.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mate Rimac, the founder and CEO of Croatian electric hypercar and components developer Rimac Automobili, started a separate company nearly three years ago to work on electric robotaxis.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Little is known about the company, which still operates in stealth. Rimac told TechCrunch this week at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> he hopes to keep this separate company under wraps until the team is ready to showcase what it has been working on.</p>
<p>Rimac did provide some details on what he described as an electric robotaxi company. He said the company has offices in Croatia and the U.K. and could expand to other locations. Rimac also said the company intends to be a global operator and he expects to reveal what the team has been working on early next year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Why stealth mode?,&#8221; Rimac asked during the interview. &#8220;Because there&#8217;s so much hot air in this industry, and so many PowerPoint companies, you know, announcing big things and not delivering and so on. We didn&#8217;t want to be that company, we wanted to do a lot of stuff — and like under-promise, over-deliver.&#8221;</p>
<p>Few even knew of the company&#8217;s existence until last month when local media discovered a <a href="https://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/hrvatski-prijedlog-fondu-eu-za-oporavak-rimcu-1-5-milijardi-kuna-za-razvoj-auta-bez-vozaca-15060549">Croatia Ministry of Transport filing</a> that described a proposed project involving an urban mobility ecosystem that used electric autonomous vehicles. While Rimac noted that was an unfortunate discovery, he wants to reveal their work properly.</p>
<p>&#8220;People see us as the hypercar company,&#8221; Rimac said, noting the company is viewed as one focused on ultra-high net worth individuals. (Indeed, Rimac Automobili unveiled a production version of its Concept 2 vehicle. The renamed Nevera has a $2.44 million price tag.) &#8220;We have many other things cooking and have a longer-term outlook. I think that the new mobility will be really a shift in society. Just like phones didn&#8217;t just change the phone industry. Apple didn&#8217;t just disrupt Nokia, but changed our lives. I think the next big change that we&#8217;ll have is mobility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rimac didn&#8217;t get into details about the autonomous driving system, sensors or design of the vehicle.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think that a lot of people are missing the bigger picture and focusing on some of the building blocks, like the autonomous driving system itself,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We believe maybe that&#8217;s not the differentiator itself, that there are some other differentiating factors within the ecosystem of autonomous mobility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rimac later added that the user experience of the robotaxi is one area that he is focused on and believes it can be different than what others are developing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA said Friday it was <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/leo-economy/NASA-seeks-proposals-next2-private-astronaut-missions-ISS">seeking proposals</a> from commercial companies for two new private crewed missions to the International Space Station. The first mission would likely take place between fall of 2022 and mid-2023. The second one would follow sometime between mid-2023 and the end of 2023.</p>
<p>Private astronaut missions are a relatively recent initiative from NASA, part of its Commercial low Earth Orbit (LEO) Development program. For most of humanity’s history in space, trips to the ISS were reserved for astronauts from countries’ respective space agencies.</p>
<p>Houston-based startup Axiom Space was awarded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/axiom-space-and-nasa-detail-first-fully-private-human-launch-to-the-space-station-set-for-january-2022/">the first private astronaut mission</a>, to take place in January 2022. That mission will carry four private astronauts for an eight-day mission from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. NASA will pay Axiom $1.69 million for services associated with the mission.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Each of the new missions can be up to 14 days and proposals are due by July 9. The agency specified that the missions must be brokered by a U.S. company and use approved U.S. transportation spacecraft. (Axiom&#8217;s private mission will use a SpaceX Crew Dragon.)</p>
<p>NASA said that enabling private manned missions such as this one may help “develop a robust low-Earth orbit economy where NASA is one of many customers, and the private sector leads the way.” Thanks to the significantly decreased launch costs &#8212; due in large part to innovations in rocket reusability, led by SpaceX &#8212; as well as a whole new ecosystem of &#8220;new space&#8221; companies that have sprung up over the last five years, space has become busier than ever.</p>
<p>The agency also said LEO could eventually be used as a “training and proving ground” for the planned Artemis program &#8212; humanity’s long-awaited return to the moon &#8212; and missions even deeper into the solar system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In Friday acquisition news, Shopify shared today that they&#8217;ve acquired the team from augmented reality startup <a href="https://www.primer.com/">Primer</a>, which makes an app that lets users visualize what tile, wallpaper or paint will look like on surfaces inside their home.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.primer.com/posts/primer-team-is-joining-shopify">blog post</a>, co-founders Adam Debreczeni and Russ Maschmeyer write that Primer&#8217;s app and services will be shutting down next month as part of the deal. Primer&#8217;s team of eight employees will all be joining Shopify following the acquisition.</p>
<p>Primer had partnered with dozens of tile and textile design brands to allow users to directly visualize what their designs would look like using their iPhone and iPad and Apple&#8217;s augmented reality platform ARKit. The app has been highlighted by Apple several times, including this <a href="https://apps.apple.com/story/id1556283927">nice write-up</a> by the App Store&#8217;s internal editorial team.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of big talk about how augmented reality will impact online shopping, but aside from some of the integrations made in home design, there hasn&#8217;t been an awful lot that&#8217;s found its way into real consumer use. Shopify has worked on some of <a href="https://help.shopify.com/en//manual/products/product-media">their own integrations</a> &#8212; allowing sellers to embed 3D models into their storefronts that users can drop into physical space &#8212; but it&#8217;s clear that there&#8217;s much more room left to experiment.</p>

This morning, we&#8217;re extending <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/softbank-uber-tencent-set-to-reap-rewards-from-didi-ipo/">our earlier reporting</a> on the company to dive into its numerical performance, economic health and possible valuation.</p>
<p>Didi is approaching the American public markets at a fortuitous moment. While the late-2020 IPO fervor, which sent offerings from DoorDash and others skyrocketing after their debuts, has cooled, valuations for public companies remain high compared to historical norms. And Uber and Lyft, two American ride-hailing companies, have been posting numbers that point to at least a modest recovery in the ride-hailing industry as COVID-19 abates in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>As further grounding, recall that Didi has raised<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/didi-dache/company_financials"> <em>tens</em> of billions</a> worth of private capital from venture capitalists, private equity firms, corporations and other sources. The size of the bet riding on Didi is simply massive. As we explore the company&#8217;s finances, then, we&#8217;re more than vetting a single company&#8217;s performance; we&#8217;re examining what sort of returns an ocean of capital may be able to derive from its exit.</p>
<p>In that vein, we&#8217;ll consider GMV results, revenue growth, historical profitability, present-day profitability, and what Didi may be worth on the American markets, given current comps. Sound good? Into the breach!</p>
<h2>Inside Didi&#8217;s IPO filing</h2>
<p>Starting at the highest level, how quickly has gross transaction volume (GTV) scaled at the company?</p>
<h3>GTV</h3>
<p>Didi is historically a business that operates in China but has operations today in more than a dozen countries. The impact and recovery of China&#8217;s bout with COVID-19 is therefore not the whole picture of the company&#8217;s GTV results.</p>
<p>COVID-19 began to affect the company starting in the first quarter of 2020. From the Didi F-1 filing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Core Platform GTV fell by 32.8% in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the first quarter of 2019, and then by 16.0% in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the second quarter of 2019.</p></blockquote>
<p>The dips were short-lived, however, with Didi quickly returning to growth in the second half of the year:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our businesses resumed growth in the second half of 2020, which moderated the impact on a year-on-year basis. Our Core Platform GTV for the full year 2020 decreased by 4.8% as compared to the full year 2019. Both our China Mobility and International segments were impacted, but whereas the GTV for our China Mobility segment decreased by 6.6% from 2019 to 2020, the GTV for our International segment increased by 11.4% from 2019 to 2020.</p></blockquote>
<p>Holding to just the Chinese market, we can see how rapidly Didi managed to pick itself up over the last year. Chinese GTV at Didi grew from 25.7 billion RMB to 54.6 billion RMB from the first quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2021; naturally, we&#8217;re comparing a more pandemic-impacted quarter at the company to a less-affected period, but the comparison is still useful for showing how the company recovered from early-2020 lows.</p>
<p>The number of transactions that Didi recorded in China during the first quarter of this year was also up more than 2x year over year.</p>
<p>On a whole-company basis, Didi&#8217;s &#8220;core platform GTV,&#8221; or the &#8220;sum of GTV for our China Mobility and International segments,&#8221; posted numbers that are less impressive in growth terms:</p>

<p>You can see how quickly and painfully COVID-19 blunted Didi&#8217;s global operations. But seeing the company settle back to late-2019 GTV numbers in 2021 is not super bullish.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway: </strong><strong>While Didi managed an impressive GTV recovery in China, its aggregate numbers are flatter, and recent quarterly trends are not incredibly attractive.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://lydia-app.com">Lydia</a> is better known as the dominant app for peer-to-peer payments. But the company has been adding more features, such as a debit card, account aggregation, donations, money pots and more. This week, the company is adding <a href="https://lydia-app.com/fr/products/remunerated-account">savings accounts</a> thanks to a partnership with French fintech startup <a href="https://www.cashbee.fr">Cashbee</a>.</p>
<p>If you aren’t familiar with Cashbee, the company lets you open savings accounts through a mobile app. After connecting your bank account with Cashbee, you can transfer money back and forth between your bank account and a savings account.</p>
<p>Right now, Cashbee partners with <a href="https://www.mymoneybank.fr">My Money Bank</a> for the savings accounts. Cashbee doesn’t keep your money, it just acts as a middle person between your bank account and My Money Bank. With those savings accounts, users can expect an interest rate of 0.6% after an introductory rate of 2% for a few months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lydia basically offers the same terms and conditions with a few differences. Instead of earning 2% interest for the first three months, Lydia users only earn more interest during the first two months.</p>
<p>The other big difference is that Lydia asks you to put at least €1,000 on your savings account when you open it. If you go through Cashbee’s app, you only have to put €10 or more. But users can do whatever they want after that when it comes to putting some money aside and withdrawing money from the savings account.</p>
<p>But the fact that Cashbee is seamlessly integrated in Lydia is interesting. It’s going to expose Cashbee to a lot more users as Lydia has more than 5 million users. It’s also an important feature if Lydia wants to become a financial super app.</p>
<p>This savings feature competes with Livret A, the most prevailing savings account in France. Everybody can open a Livret A in a retail bank. You get an interest rate of 0.5% net of taxes. On paper, 0.6% is better than 0.5%. But Cashbee’s savings accounts aren’t net of taxes.</p>
<p>If you’re a student and don’t pay any taxes, that’s a better deal. But many people pay 30% in taxes on accrued interests, which means that you end up earning 0.42% in interests net of taxes with a Cashbee account.</p>
<p>But it’s hard to beat the simplicity of Lydia’s solution here. For instance, you can save up to €1,000,000 on your savings account while the Livret A is limited to €22,950. In other words, if you’re already using Lydia to send, receive and spend money, you might want to check out those savings accounts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Now that we have your attention, know this: Prices go up tonight on passes to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?promo=5reasonspost&amp;display=true">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing &amp; Fundraising</a>. If you’re an early-stage founder (pre-seed through Series A), don’t miss this chance to save $100 on our two-day virtual event dedicated to helping you build a stronger startup. It’s one of the best investments you’ll ever make.</p>
<p><strong>It’s Now O’clock:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#tickets">Buy your pass here</a> before <strong>the sale expires tonight at</strong> <strong>11:59 p.m. (PT)</strong>.</p>
<p>Why should you attend TC Early Stage 2021? Chloe Leaaetoa, the founder of Socicraft and an Early Stage 2020 attendee, explains:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>What you learn at Early Stage is so much better than the random information you find on YouTube. You get to interact with industry experts and ask them specific questions. It’s like a mini bootcamp, and you&#8217;re going to walk away with a lot of knowledge.</p></blockquote>
<p>What can you expect at Early Stage 2021? The first day is packed with presentations designed to help you learn (or deepen your knowledge of) essential startup skills — product fit, growth marketing, fundraising and a whole bunch more. We’ve tapped some of the best startup ecosystem experts who will not only impart their wisdom, but they’ll also take and answer your questions.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#eb734612-27f1-4c57-96ec-246fab3228a8">the event agenda</a> and our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#3e01330b-4bf1-4206-b038-769db50898a0">roster of speakers</a>.</p>
<p>We’re talking an interactive experience — from which you’ll take away tips and advice that you can implement in your business now when you need it most. Case in point, again from Chloe Leaaetoa:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sequoia Capital’s session, <em>Start with Your Customer</em>, looked at the benefits of storytelling and creating customer personas. I took the idea to my team, and we identified seven different user types for our product, and we’ve implemented storytelling to help onboard new customers. That one session alone has transformed my business.</p></blockquote>
<p>Day two is all about the TC Early-Stage Pitch-Off. Tune in and watch as 10 early-stage founders bring the heat. Each team will deliver a five-minute pitch in front of TC editors, global investors, press and hundreds of attendees. After each team pitches, they’ll engage in a five-minute Q&amp;A with our panel of top VC judges.</p>
<p>You’ll learn so much by watching those pitches and hearing the VC’s questions. It’s a great way to improve your own pitch deck. And if notetaking is not your forte, don’t stress. All sessions, including the pitch-off, will be available courtesy of video-on-demand.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?promo=5reasonspost&amp;display=true">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing &amp; Fundraising</a> takes place July 8-9, but you have just hours left before the early bird flies south and the prices head north. It’s now o’clock — beat the deadline and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#tickets">register here</a><strong> before 11:59 p.m. (PT) tonight</strong>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We spoke with a number of VCs from Europe to hear their perspectives on what’s happening on the ground, including folks from Accel, Astorya.vc and Insurtech Gateway.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. insurance technology market is hot and has been for years now. Back in early 2020, to pick an example, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/02/why-vcs-are-dumping-money-into-insurance-marketplaces/">reported on a wave of funding events</a> among domestic insurtech marketplaces. Those companies have since gone on to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/insurtech-startups-are-leveraging-rapid-growth-to-raise-big-money/">raise hundreds of millions of dollars more</a>.</p>
<p>And after a long period of incubation, we’ve seen neoinsurance players from the U.S. like Root and MetroMile go public. Hippo is working to join the cohort.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>So from the perspective of venture capital activity, startup growth and exits, insurtech is proving itself in the States. Even if growth remains the name of the game in insurance tech and profits are often scarce.</p>
<p>What about other markets? The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/31/european-insurtech-startup-wefox-grabs-650-million-at-3-billion-valuation/">recent Wefox round</a> caught The Exchange’s eye. A $650 million insurtech round would have commanded our attention regardless of its location. But to see a European insurance technology startup raise that amount of cash made us wonder if there’s as much money present for the EU market’s insurtech startups as we’ve seen here in the U.S.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>After all, with business-focused neoinsurance provider <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/09/2244313/0/en/Embroker-Raises-100-Million-to-Expand-Business-Insurance-Platform.html">Embroker raising a big round this week</a> in the United States, to pick an example, it seems that attacking the massive and antiquated insurance market is good startup sport. Why wouldn’t that concept apply to Europe?</p>
<p>To find out more, we got in touch with a number of VCs from Europe to hear their perspectives on what’s happening on the ground, including folks from <a href="https://www.accel.com/">Accel</a>, <a href="http://astorya.vc">Astorya.vc</a> and <a href="https://insurtechgateway.com/">Insurtech Gateway</a>. To ground us, we collated the biggest recent rounds from the EU insurance technology market. Let’s go!</p>
<h2>A quick note on insurtech exits</h2>
<p>Venture capitalists and startup founders get paid when they generate an exit. Lately, exits in the space have featured a number of IPOs.</p>
<p>The older a startup gets, the more it has to deal with public-market investors. Crossover funds and the like make their appearance before unicorns go public. And then former startups have to pitch not the venture capital market, but the public markets. It’s a different game.</p>
<p>That’s the impression that The Exchange got chatting with the CEO of Root, <a href="https://twitter.com/timm_alex?lang=en">Alex Timm,</a> this earnings cycle. He noted that public tech-focused investors don’t always grok the insurance elements of his business, while insurance investors don’t always grok the tech side of Root.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been just under two years since I reviewed the WF-1000XM3, and in that time, Sony’s earbuds never stopped being the reference point for high-end earbuds. Seriously, I reviewed a new pair like a month ago and still made the customary reference.</p>
<p>That’s a rarity in these days of the yearly upgrade cycle. And that goes double for the wireless earbud space. It already felt crowded when Sony entered it in earnest in mid-2019, and things have only gotten worse on that front. But the M3s were a breath of fresh air. With so many companies competing for the middle and low end of the spectrum, Sony dropped something truly premium.</p>

<p>Six months before the AirPods Pro arrived, the M3 hit the market with excellent sound and noise canceling. The latter has, of course, become standardized across the category, but when Sony brought it, it was nearly unheard of. In spite of the headphones’ warm reception, however, the company’s waited two years to deliver a proper follow-up. Understandable, I suppose. Improving on very good is difficult.</p>

<p>I’m happy to report that the WF-1000XM4 is worth the wait. Sony’s great at high-end headphones, and these are no exception. The new buds represent an improvement over their predecessors in a number of ways. Unfortunately, they’re priced to match. If you thought the M3’s were steep at $230, I’ve got some bad news for you, friend. The new ones run an additional $50.</p>
<p>The upshot is that new headphones means a price drop on the older units. A quick search shows them for around $178 from a number of places, putting them more in line with standard earbud pricing. At $30 more than the AirPods Pro, Sony’s really leaning into the premium end of the spectrum. If anyone has the resources and scale to keeping pricing down, it’s Sony.</p>

<p>Are the WF-1000XM4s worth the price? It’s a fairly subjective question, of course. What I can definitely say is that they’re among the best-sounding pairs of earbuds you can buy. I’m still not convinced that anyone can truly duplicate the over-ear headphone experience in a pair of buds &#8212; the form factor is just too limited for now. But there are definitely advantages to going with buds &#8212; namely portability and on these unspeakably hot summer days, a chance to let your ears breathe.</p>

<p>Buds are, of course, better suited to fitness, as well. Though if you’re specifically looking for a pair to work out in, these probably shouldn’t be your first choice. I mean, they’re IPX4 water resistant, which is plenty good for sweat, but these are more of a long plane ride or sitting at your desk and really enjoying the hell out of a jazz record kind of earbuds.</p>
<p>In part, because they’re big. Granted, they’re a fair bit smaller than their predecessors, and moving from a paddle design to placing the components above the ear canal is a net benefit, but they’re still a bit too large for a long run. And while this is one of those things that vary dramatically from person to person, I found that the buds tended to cause ear pain after wearing them for extended stretches. I found the pressure relieved a bit when I swapped the medium foam tips for a small (I’m a medium in virtually all variety of earbud tips), though the small were much worse at forming a seal in my ears &#8212; a necessity to really take advantage of the active noise canceling. And even still, the eventual dull pain was not non-existent.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165113" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165113" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2165113" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9526.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9526.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9526.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9526.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9526.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9526.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9526.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9526.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9526.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165113" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>It is also worth noting that I’ve had less than spectacular experiences with foam tips. They tend to be more prone to wear and tear than silicone and have a habit of getting a bit gnarly in the earwax department (look, this job isn’t always pretty). Though I understand why high-end manufacturers go this route, from a comfort perspective.</p>
<p>Also, hey, kudos to Sony for going with sustainable paper packaging. It’s not much to look at, but how often do you really look at the package your electronics came in? Anything that’s even slightly better for the planet is a net positive in my book. And besides, the charging case looks great.</p>
<p>It’s significantly smaller than the W3’s. These are a helluva lot more pocketable. It’s an understated matte black, albeit with a pretty loud white Sony logo on top. The magnets are strong and the buds snap into the case with authority &#8212; they’ll also attach to each other. A thin LED strip directly below the lid glows green or red, depending on charge. The case is wide enough to sit upright, so the USB-C port is located around the back &#8212; or you can charge it up wirelessly with a Qi pad.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165110" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165110" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2165110" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9533.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9533.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9533.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9533.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9533.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9533.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9533.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9533.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9533.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165110" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Interestingly, the stated charging time is the same as the M3s, though the numbers have been shifted around. With the originals, you got six hours on the buds and another 18 from the case. Here it’s eight hours on the buds and 16 on the case. So, a full day, either way, but I certainly prefer the two added hours on the actual earbuds.</p>
<p>The buds themselves are a bit flashier than the case. The design features two intersecting circles, the upper most of which is designed to lie flush with the ear. The outside is accented with a metal microphone, with a second, flush microphone up top.</p>

<p>The sound of the buds is really excellent. It’s got the kind of instrument separation that opens up new details on familiar songs you missed with inferior buds. The default balance is terrific, as well. Sony doesn’t lean to heavily into the bass because it doesn’t have to. The headphones sound terrific across a wide range of music varieties, as well as podcasts.</p>
<p>The noise-canceling is, once again, industry leading. A simple tap on the left earbud cycles between ANC and ambient noise, and the difference is like night and day. I was really impressed by the sounds it was capable of blocking, including my extremely loud vegetable juicer. I was also impressed by the buds’ Bluetooth range.</p>
<p>With earbuds, it’s true that you often get what you pay for. That’s certainly the case here. Sony’s once again managed to set the bar for high-end buds with the WF-1000XM4.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, Apple announced it wanted employees to return to the Cupertino campus for <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/03/apple-employees-to-return-to-office-three-days-a-week-in-september.html#:~:text=News%20%7C%20Getty%20Images-,Apple%20employees%20will%20return%20to%20the%20office%20three%20days%20a,the%20company%20confirmed%20to%20CNBC.&amp;text=Apple%20will%20ask%20most%20employees,to%20five%20days%20a%20week.">three days a week</a> starting in September. Some employees who have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook">grown used to the flexibility of working at home</a> pushed back.</p>
<p>Prior to the pandemic, with few exceptions, most employees went into an office most days. But when COVID hit in March 2020 and workers were forced home, employers quickly learned that their staff could be productive even when they weren&#8217;t sitting in the same building. Now it seems it will be difficult to put the genie back in the bottle.</p>
<p>Finding that right balance between fully remote and however a given company defines hybrid &#8212; like Apple, some days in the office and some days at home &#8212; is never going to be easy, and there will never be a one size fits all answer. In fact, it&#8217;s probably going to be fluid moving forward.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Just to show how different companies are approaching this, we asked five other large technology companies besides Apple to see how they are treating the return to the office, and each was looking at some form of hybrid work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google is taking a similar approach to Apple, with three days in the office and two days at home. &#8220;We’ll move to a hybrid work week where most Googlers spend approximately three days in the office and two days wherever they work best. Since in-office time will be focused on collaboration, your product areas and functions will help decide which days teams will come together in the office. There will also be roles that may need to be on site more than three days a week due to the nature of the work,&#8221; Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet wrote in <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/life-at-google/hybrid-approach-work/">a recent blog post</a>.</li>
<li>Salesforce is giving employees <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/creating-a-best-workplace-from-anywhere/">a broad set of choices</a> depending on their role. Most employees can work at home most of the time, and can come into the office 1-3 days a week to collaborate with colleagues, meet with customers or for presentations. Others who don&#8217;t live near an office can be fully remote and those who choose, or whose job requires them to be office-based, may come in 4-5 days a week.</li>
<li>Facebook is expanding remote work, telling employees, &#8220;As of June 15, Facebook will open up remote work to all levels across the company, and anyone whose role can be done remotely can request remote work,&#8221; the company wrote to employees.</li>
<li>Microsoft is leaving it up to managers, but <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/10/09/embracing-a-flexible-workplace/">most roles are going to be remote</a> at least part of the time. As they told employees in an announcement recently, &#8220;We recognize that some employees are required to be onsite and some roles and businesses are better suited for working away from the worksite than others. However, for most roles, we view working from home part of the time (less than 50%) as now standard – assuming manager and team alignment.&#8221;</li>
<li>Amazon originally was looking at a policy of mostly in-office, but it announced this week that it had decided to offer employees a more flexible work schedule. &#8220;Our new baseline will be three days a week in the office (with the specific days being determined by your leadership team), leaving you flexibility to work remotely up to two days a week,&#8221; the company wrote in <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/amazon-updates-return-to-office-guidance">a message to employees</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The larger tech companies are offering most employees some level of flexibility to decide when to come into the office, but how do startups look at work as we move toward post-pandemic? Most startups I speak to don&#8217;t foresee an office-centric approach, with many taking a remote-first approach. Andreessen Horowitz <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/06/08/are-we-returning-to-the-office-or-is-the-future-remote/">recently surveyed 226 startups</a> in its portfolio and found that two-thirds of portfolio companies are looking at a similar hybrid approach as their larger counterparts. In fact, 87 were thinking about 1-2 days a week, with 64 looking at no office at all, only gathering for company off-sites. By contrast, just 18 said that they wouldn&#8217;t allow any work from home.</p>
<p>Dion Hinchcliffe, an analyst at Constellation Research who has been studying distributed work for many years, says that tech companies will be more likely to embrace flexible work models now that they have seen how it works during the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most tech companies will maintain some degree of flexibility when returning to the office, especially since it is popular with many of their workers. Plus the worries about productivity loss have turned out to be largely unfounded,&#8221; he said. But he emphasized that this would not be true for every company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certain companies, especially ones that believe they have a lot of IP to protect or operate in other sensitive types of work will be more reluctant to allow work to continue from home,&#8221; he said. This in spite of the fact that many of these companies have been doing just that for the last 15 months. Going hybrid as Apple has only muddles that argument further.</p>
<p>&#8220;It definitely includes Apple, which has long been well known for discouraging work from home. Their new policy of three days a week in-office probably makes them feel a bit more secure, but does not really accomplish it,&#8221; Hinchcliffe said.</p>
<p>Of course companies can set policies, but it doesn&#8217;t mean they won&#8217;t run into employee objections. Apple certainly learned that. Workers appear to want to be the ones choosing where to work, not their employers, and it could very well be a competitive advantage to offer work from home options, especially in a tight labor market where the power appears to be shifting to employees.</p>
<p>It should be interesting to see where this all goes, and how much power employees have to push their companies to their more flexible working ideal. For now, most companies will have a far larger degree of flexibility than existed pre-pandemic, but certainly not everyone wants people working from home all the time forever, and companies will need to decide what works best for them and their employees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The war for talent in the tech world can be brutal &#8212; and so, it turns out, can the war between platforms that help companies source it. In the latest developement, <a href="https://www.toptal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toptal</a> &#8212; a marketplace for filling engineering and other tech roles with freelance, remote workers &#8212; has filed a lawsuit against direct competitor <a href="https://andela.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andela</a> and several of its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">employees, alleging the theft of trade secrets in pursuit of &#8220;a perfect clone of its business&#8221;, according to the complaint. All of the Andela employees previously worked at Toptal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toptal&#8217;s lawsuit, filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York and embedded below, alleges that the employees reneged on confidentiality, non-solicitation and non-compete agreements with Toptal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Toptal also alleges interference with contract, unfair competition and misappropriation of trade secrets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While both Toptal and Andela have built businesses around the idea of remote freelancers filling tech jobs &#8212; a concept that has increased in profile and acceptance as people shifted to remote work during the pandemic &#8212; the pair only emerged as very direct competitors in the last year or so. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toptal was co-founded by CEO Taso Du Val in 2010, and since then it has grown to become one of the world&#8217;s most popular on-demand talent networks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company matches skilled tech personnel like engineers, software developers, designers, finance experts and product managers to clients across the globe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to company data, it currently serves over 1,000 clients in more than 10 countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andela, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, only recently turned to using a similar</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> approach. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2014 in Lagos, Andela&#8217;s original business model </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on building physical hubs to source, vet, train and house talent across the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It did this in Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda and Uganda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Andela struggled with scaling and operating that business model, and in 2019 it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/africa-focused-andela-cuts-400-staff-as-it-confirms-50m-in-revenue/">laid off 400 developers</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. E</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">arly last year as the pandemic took hold, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/06/andela-ceo-confirms-staff-cuts-as-layoffs-hit-african-tech/">laid off a further 135 employees</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However this time around it did so with a strategy pivot in mind: after testing satellite models in Egypt and Ghana, the talent company decided to go forego physical hubs completely and go remote, f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">irst <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/andela-which-builds-remote-engineering-teams-tapping-african-talent-goes-fully-remote-and-opens-to-the-wider-continent/">across Africa in 2020</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/andela-begins-global-expansion-in-37-countries-months-after-going-remote-across-africa/">globally this year</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We thought, ‘What if we accelerated [the African remote network] and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enabled applicants from anywhere?’ Because it was always the plan to become a global company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That was clear, but the timing was the question,” Andela CEO Jeremy Johnson told TechCrunch in April.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Toptal </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">believes Andela&#8217;s choice to scrap its hubs and source remote talent from everywhere was specifically to replicate Toptal&#8217;s business model &#8212; and success</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Until recently, Andela operated an outsourcing operation focused on in-person, on-site hubs in Africa,&#8221; Toptal notes in the complaint.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the course of the past year, Andela has moved away from its prior focus on in-person hubs situated in Africa and is engaging in a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">barely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> disguised attempt to become a clone of Toptal.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toptal claims that for Andela to pull off a &#8220;perfect clone of its business,&#8221; it poached key Toptal employees to exploit their knowledge, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that the ex-employees knowingly breached their confidentiality and non-solicitation obligations to Toptal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies often try to uncover each other&#8217;s trade secrets by poaching, and many </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blatantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> copy a competitor and do so without repercussions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On top of this, these two are hardly the only two places to for tech talent to connect with remote freelance job opportunities. Others include Fiverr, Malt, Freelancer.com, LinkedIn, Turing, Upwork and many more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a global economy with an estimated 1 billion so-called knowledge workers, and with freelancers accounting for <a href="https://www.thimble.com/blog/freelance-statistics-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some 35% of the world&#8217;s workforce</a>, it&#8217;s a pretty gigantic market, which you could alternately look at as a major opportunity, but also a ripe field for many players with multiple permutations of the marketplace concept.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why is Toptal crying foul play? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says its ex-employees have not only revealed Toptal’s trade secrets and confidential information to compete </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unfairly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but are also poaching </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Toptal personnel, clients and the talent that Toptal matches and sources to clients</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ex-employees cited by Toptal include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sachin Bhagwata, vice president of enterprise; Martin Chikilian, head of talent operations; Courtney Machi, vice president of product; and Alvaro Oliveira, executive vice president of talent operations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Toptal says</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> three </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional former employees in non-executive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> roles breached express covenants not to compete in their agreements with Toptal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some of the allegations focus on the expertise of the employees, one of the trade secret allegations more directly references Toptal&#8217;s technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toptal claims Machi tapped into her extensive knowledge of Toptal’s &#8220;proprietary software platform&#8221; and used that to help transform Andela &#8220;from a group of outsourcing hubs situated in various African locations into a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> remote, global company like Toptal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked to comment on the suit, Johnson at Andela said he believes Toptal is suing Andela for being competitive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With regards to the situation </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overall</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I can say that frivolous lawsuits are the price of doing anything that matters,&#8221; he told TechCrunch in an email. &#8220;And this is the kind of baseless bullying and fear tactics that make employees want to leave in the first place</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We will defend ourselves and our colleagues </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">vigorously.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toptal has an unconventional story for a company that started only a decade ago. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is one of the few companies in the Valley that doesn&#8217;t issue stock options to its investors or employees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Even</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Du Val&#8217;s co-founder, Breanden Beneschott, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was ousted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the company without any shares, according to an article from <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/at-booming-toptal-no-stock-for-employees-or-investors">The Information.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did it pull this off? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2012, Toptal raised a $1.4 million seed via convertible notes and investors </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were entitled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to 15% of the company, according to The Information article. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there was one condition: Toptal had to raise more money</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company hasn&#8217;t needed to secure </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> capital because of its profitability and growing revenue ($200 million annually as of 2018, per The Information). So investors are stuck in limbo &#8212; as are employees who joined hoping that the company would raise money down the line so their stock options would convert</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>The Information story strikes a distinct note of resentment, noting that some employees felt &#8220;tricked out of stock in a company that Du Val has said publicly is worth more than $1 billion.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that situation, TechCrunch asked Du Val if he thought it played any role in employee departures, and ex-employee relations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The issuance of stock options does not excuse theft of trade secrets,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, there are more than 800 full-time people at Toptal [but] the complaint names seven individual defendants</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The full complaint is embedded below.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><em>We&#8217;re closing our survey soon, so this is your last chance (probably) to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd96e0oKV6OPcilUHgSIJBnNuD7_GNcnFCqnk1RveUNuBJojQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">get your voice heard</a>!</em></p>
<p>Despite it being a short week, as always, it was a busy, busy time. We had <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> on the dials today, and <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> making chit-chat about the tech world. As with every week this year, we had to cut and cut and cut to get the show down to size. Here&#8217;s what made it in in the end:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medium saw more employees depart the company after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/medium-exodus-culture-memo/">CEO Ev Williams published a &#8220;culture memo.&#8221;</a> While the Medium memo doesn’t wholly ban politics, some allege that the undertone of the statement, timed weeks after a failed unionization attempt, created an unsafe environment. A week later, Natasha covered another controversy,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/does-what-happens-at-yc-stay-at-yc/"> this time at Y Combinator. </a>We riff on the takeaway, and what this story looks like three months from now.</li>
<li>The issue of company culture is attracting companies. Or more precisely startups, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/blendoor-data-lets-you-know-if-companies-are-living-up-to-diversity-pledges/">Blendoor dropping a new report this week</a> that TechCrunch covered, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/06/googles-gradient-ventures-leads-8-2m-series-a-for-vault-platforms-misconduct-reporting-saas/">Vault raising $8.2 million</a> to provide a software solution to aid employees in reporting misconduct.</li>
<li>On the funding round beat, we explored <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/charthop-raises-35m-for-its-internal-org-chart-and-people-analytics-platform/">ChartHop&#8217;s new $35 million round</a> that Danny had many thoughts about, fake-chicken nuggets startup Nuggs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/nuggs-creator-simulate-raises-50m/">raising $50 million</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/a-mens-brand-faculty-launches-with-with-nail-polish-and-seed-funding-from-estee-lauder/">Faculty&#8217;s latest deal</a> that will help power its vision for the future of male grooming. We also got into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/lifted-raises-6-2m-series-a-round-led-by-fuel-ventures-for-its-long-term-social-care-platform/">Lifted&#8217;s elder-care focused round</a>, a startup in the larger health tech beat that Natasha is giving some of her attention to.</li>
<li>And we wrapped with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/network-security-startup-extrahop-skips-and-jumps-to-900m-exit/">the ExtraHop exit</a>. We spent a minute trying to figure out why the company was valued at $900 million in its exit. The number, while large, felt light based on what we knew about the company.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for hopping along with us this week and every week. Quick programming note: Natasha will take Alex&#8217;s spot on the Monday show for next week since he&#8217;s out, so be nice, and<a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_"> send her stuff </a>to mention.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volkswagen says more than 3.3 million customers had their information exposed after one of its vendors left a cache of customer data unsecured on the internet.</p>
<p>The car maker said <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20806130-audi-volkswagen-letter">in a letter</a> that the vendor, used by Volkswagen, its subsidiary Audi and authorized dealers in the U.S. and Canada, left the customer data spanning 2014 to 2019 unprotected over a two-year window between August 2019 and May 2021.</p>
<p>The data, which Volkswagen said was gathered for sales and marketing, contained personal information about customers and prospective buyers, including their name, postal and email addresses, and phone number.</p>
<p>But more than 90,000 customers across the U.S. and Canada also had more sensitive data exposed, including information relating to loan eligibility. The letter said most of the sensitive data was driver&#8217;s license numbers, but that a &#8220;small&#8221; number of records also included a customer&#8217;s date of birth and Social Security numbers.</p>

<p>Volkswagen did not name the vendor, and a company spokesperson did not immediately comment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the latest security incident involving driver license numbers in recent months. Insurance giants <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/metromile-website-bug-hacker/">Metromile</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/geico-driver-license-numbers-scraped/">Geico</a> admitted earlier this year that their quote forms had been abused by scammers trying to obtain driver license numbers. Several other car insurance companies have also reported similar incidents involving the theft of driver license numbers. Geico <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/geico-driver-license-numbers-scraped/">said</a> it was likely an effort by scammers to file and cash fraudulent unemployment benefits in another person&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>Volkswagen&#8217;s letter, however, did not say if the company had evidence that the data exposed by the vendor was misused.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Well this is big. The U.K.&#8217;s competition regulator looks set to get an emergency brake that will allow it to stop Google ending support for third-party cookies, a technology that&#8217;s currently used for targeting online ads, if it believes competition would be harmed by the depreciation going ahead.</p>
<p>The development follows an investigation opened by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) into Google&#8217;s self-styled &#8220;Privacy Sandbox&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>The regulator will have the power to order a standstill of at least 60 days on any move by Google to remove support for cookies from Chrome if it accepts a set of legally binding commitments the latter has offered &#8212; and which the regulator has today issued a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/992975/Notice_of_intention_to_accept_binding_commitments_offered_by_Google_publication.pdf">notification of intention to accept</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The CMA could also reopen a fuller investigation if it&#8217;s not happy with how things are looking at the point it orders any standstill to stop Google crushing tracking cookies.</p>
<p>It follows that the watchdog could also block Google&#8217;s wider &#8220;Privacy Sandbox&#8221; technology transition entirely &#8212; if it decides the shift cannot be done in a way that doesn&#8217;t harm competition. However, the CMA said today it takes the &#8220;provisional&#8221; view that the set of commitments Google has offered will address competition concerns related to its proposals.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now opened a consultation to see if the industry agrees &#8212; with the feedback line open until July 8.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Andrea Coscelli, the CMA’s chief executive, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The emergence of tech giants such as Google has presented competition authorities around the world with new challenges that require a new approach.</p>
<p>That’s why the CMA is taking a leading role in setting out how we can work with the most powerful tech firms to shape their behaviour and protect competition to the benefit of consumers.</p>
<p class="last-child">If accepted, the commitments we have obtained from Google become legally binding, promoting competition in digital markets, helping to protect the ability of online publishers to raise money through advertising and safeguarding users’ privacy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/our-commitments-privacy-sandbox/">blog post</a> sketching what it&#8217;s pledged &#8212; under three broad headlines of &#8220;Consultation and collaboration&#8221;; &#8220;No data advertising advantage for Google products&#8221;; and &#8220;No self-preferencing&#8221; &#8212; Google writes that if the CMA accepts its commitments it will &#8220;apply them globally&#8221;, making the U.K.&#8217;s intervention potentially hugely significant.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s perhaps one <em>slightly unexpected</em> twist of Brexit that it&#8217;s put the U.K. in a position to be taking key decisions about the rules for global digital advertising. (The European Union is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">working on new rules for how platform giants can operate</a> but the CMA&#8217;s intervention on Privacy Sandbox does not yet have a direct equivalent in Brussels.)</p>
<p>That Google is choosing to offer to turn a U.K. competition intervention into a global commitment is itself very interesting. It may be there in part as an added sweetener &#8212; nudging the CMA to accept the offer so it can feel like a global standard-setter.</p>
<p>At the same time, businesses do love operational certainty. So if Google can hash out a set of rules that are accepted by one (fairly) major market, because they&#8217;ve been co-designed with national oversight bodies, and then scale those rules <em>everywhere</em>, it may create a shortcut path to avoiding any more regulator-enforced bumps in the future.</p>
<p>So Google may see this as a smoother path toward the sought-for transition for its adtech business to a post-cookie future. Of course it also wants to avoid being ordered to stop entirely (or, well, maybe not! Either outcome would surely work for Google).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is a clear win for Google — they can now credibly say that they are unable to phase out third-party cookies. Because the regulator is not agreeing to this! The reasoning goes: so Google wants to introduce a « replacement ». Do you see what just happened? Tech policy/PR! <a href="https://t.co/8ZvvAfo37R">https://t.co/8ZvvAfo37R</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>More broadly, engaging with the fast-paced U.K. regulator could be a strategy for Google to try to surf over the political deadlocks and risks which can characterize discussions on digital regulation in other markets (especially its home turf of the U.S. &#8212; where there has been a growing drumbeat of calls to break up tech giants; and where Google specifically now faces <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/google-justice-department-antitrust-trial-date/">a number</a> of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/google-antitrust-lawsuit-new-york-colorado-35-states-search/">antitrust investigations</a>).</p>
<p>The outcome it may be hoping for is being able to point to regulator-stamped &#8220;compliance&#8221; &#8212; in order that it can claim it as evidence there&#8217;s no need for its ad empire to be broken up. (Or to have a regulator order that it can&#8217;t make privacy-centric changes.)</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s offering of commitments also signifies that regulators who move fastest to tackle the power of tech giants will be the ones helping to define and set the standards and conditions that apply for web users everywhere. At least &#8212; unless or until &#8212; more radical interventions rain down on big tech.</p>
<h2>What is Privacy Sandbox?</h2>
<p>Privacy Sandbox is a complex stack of interlocking technology proposals for replacing current ad tracking methods (which are widely seen as horrible for user privacy) with alternative infrastructure that Google claims will be better for individual privacy and also still allow the adtech and publishing industries to generate (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/google-claims-almost-no-change-in-ad-revenue-from-targeting-proposals-in-its-privacy-sandbox-but-privacy-upside-less-clear/">it claims much the same</a>) revenue by targeting ads at cohorts of web users &#8212; who will be put into &#8220;interest buckets&#8221; based on what they look at online.</p>
<p>The full details of the proposals (which include components like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/google-isnt-testing-flocs-in-europe-yet/">FLoCs</a>, aka Google&#8217;s proposed new ad ID based on federated learning of cohorts, and Fledge/Turtledove, Google&#8217;s suggested new ad delivery technology) have not yet been set in stone.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Google announced in January 2020 that it intended to end support for third-party cookies within two years &#8212; so that rather nippy time frame has likely concentrated opposition, with pushback coming from the adtech industry and (some) publishers that are concerned it will have a major impact on their ad revenues when individual-level ad targeting goes away.</p>
<p>The CMA began to look into Google&#8217;s planned depreciating of tracking cookies after complaints that the transition to a new infrastructure of Google&#8217;s devising will merely increase Google&#8217;s market power &#8212; by locking down third parties&#8217; ability to track internet users for ad targeting while leaving Google with a high dimension view of what people get up to online as a result of its expansive access to first-party data (gleaned through its dominance for consumer web services).</p>
<p>The executive summary of today&#8217;s CMA notice lists its concerns that, without proper regulatory oversight, Privacy Sandbox might:</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<ul>
<li>distort competition in the market for the supply of ad inventory and in the market for the supply of ad tech services, by restricting the functionality associated with user tracking for third parties while retaining this functionality for Google;</li>
<li>distort competition by the self-preferencing of Google’s own advertising products and services and owned and operated ad inventory; and</li>
<li>allow Google to exploit its apparent dominant position by denying Chrome web users substantial choice in terms of whether and how their personal data is used for the purpose of targeting and delivering advertising to them.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>At the same time, privacy concerns around the ad tracking and targeting of internet users are undoubtedly putting pressure on Google to retool Chrome (which ofc dominates web browser market share) &#8212; given that other web browsers have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/webkits-new-anti-tracking-policy-puts-privacy-on-a-par-with-security/">stepping up efforts</a> to protect their users from online surveillance by doing stuff like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-adds-a-tracker-blocker-to-desktop-safari/">blocking trackers</a> for years.</p>
<p>Web users hate creepy ads &#8212; which is why they&#8217;ve been turning to ad blockers in droves. Numerous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/cambridge-analytica-sought-to-use-facebook-data-to-predict-partisanship-for-voter-targeting-uk-investigation-confirms/">major data scandals</a> have also increased awareness of privacy and security. And &#8212; in Europe and elsewhere &#8212; digital privacy regulations have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/20/wtf-is-gdpr/">toughened up</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/08/ccpa-privacy-law-rocky-start/">introduced</a> in recent years. So the line of &#8220;what&#8217;s acceptable&#8221; for ad businesses to do online has been shifting.</p>
<p>But the key issue here is how privacy and competition regulation interacts &#8212; and potentially conflicts &#8212; with the very salient risk that ill-thought-through and overly blunt competition interventions could essentially lock in privacy abuses of web users (as a result of a legacy of weak enforcement around online privacy, which allowed for rampant, consent-less ad tracking and targeting of Internet users to develop and thrive in the first place).</p>
<p>Poor privacy enforcement coupled with banhammer-wielding competition regulators does not look like a good recipe for protecting web users&#8217; rights.</p>
<p>However. there is cautious reason for optimism here.</p>
<p>Last month the CMA and the U.K.&#8217;s Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office (ICO) issued a <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2619797/cma-ico-public-statement-20210518.pdf">joint statement</a> in which they discussed the importance of having competition <em>and</em> data protection in digital markets &#8212; citing the CMA&#8217;s Google Privacy Sandbox probe as a good example of a case that requires nuanced joint working.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Or, as they put it then: &#8220;The CMA and the ICO are working collaboratively in their engagement with Google and other market participants to build a common understanding of Google’s proposals, and to ensure that both privacy and competition concerns can be addressed as the proposals are developed in more detail.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Although the ICO&#8217;s record on enforcement against rights-trampling adtech is, well, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/uks-ico-faces-legal-action-after-closing-adtech-complaint-with-nothing-to-show-for-it/">non-existent</a>. So its preference for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/adtech-scores-a-pandemic-pause-from-uk-privacy-oversight/">regulatory inaction</a> in the face of adtech industry lobbying should off-set any quantum of optimism derived from the bald fact of the U.K.&#8217;s privacy and competition regulators&#8217; &#8220;joint working&#8221;.</p>
<p>(The CMA, by contrast, has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/uks-competition-watchdog-still-eyeing-facebooks-giphy-buy/">very active in the digital space</a> since gaining, post-Brexit, wider powers to pursue investigations. And in recent years took <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/03/uks-cma-launches-investigation-into-digital-advertising-and-its-potential-harm-to-consumers/">a deep dive look at competition in the digital ad market</a>, so it&#8217;s armed with plenty of knowledge. It is also in the process of configuring <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uks-digital-markets-unit-starts-work-on-pro-competition-reforms/">a new unit</a> that will oversee a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">pro-competition regime</a> which the U.K. explicitly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">wants to clip the wings of big tech</a>.)</p>
<h2>What has Google committed to?</h2>
<p>The CMA writes that Google has made &#8220;substantial and wide-ranging&#8221; commitments vis-à-vis Privacy Sandbox &#8212; which it says include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A commitment to develop and implement the proposals in a way that avoids distortions to competition and the imposition of unfair terms on Chrome users. This includes a commitment to involve the CMA and the ICO in the development of the Proposals to ensure this objective is met.</li>
<li>Increased transparency from Google on how and when the proposals will be taken forward and on what basis they will be assessed. This includes a commitment to publicly disclose the results of tests of the effectiveness of alternative technologies.</li>
<li>Substantial limits on how Google will use and combine individual user data for the purposes of digital advertising after the removal of third-party cookies.</li>
<li>A commitment that Google will not discriminate against its rivals in favour of its own advertising and ad-tech businesses when designing or operating the alternatives to third-party cookies.</li>
<li>A standstill period of at least 60 days before Google proceeds with the removal of third-party cookies giving the CMA the opportunity, if any outstanding concerns cannot be resolved with Google, to reopen its investigation and, if necessary, impose any interim measures necessary to avoid harm to competition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Google also writes that: &#8220;Throughout this process, we will engage the CMA and the industry in an open, constructive and continuous dialogue. This includes proactively informing both the CMA and the wider ecosystem of timelines, changes and tests during the development of the Privacy Sandbox proposals, building on our <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/a-more-privacy-first-web/" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/a-more-privacy-first-web/&quot;}">transparent approach to date</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will work with the CMA to resolve concerns and develop agreed parameters for the testing of new proposals, while the CMA will be getting direct input from the ICO,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s commitments cover a number of areas directly related to competition &#8212; such as self-preferencing, non-discrimination and stipulations that it will not combine user data from specific sources that might give it an advantage versus third parties.</p>
<p>However privacy is also being explicitly baked into the competition consideration, here, per the CMA &#8212; which writes that the commitments will [emphasis ours]:</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 5">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<blockquote><p>Establish the criteria that must be taken into account in designing, implementing and evaluating Google’s Proposals. These include the impact of the Privacy Sandbox Proposals on: <strong>privacy outcomes and compliance with data protection principles</strong>; competition in digital advertising and in particular the risk of distortion to competition between Google and other market participants; the ability of publishers to generate revenue from ad inventory; and user experience and control over the use of their data.</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">An ICO spokeswoman was also keen to point out that one of the first commitments obtained from Google under the CMA&#8217;s intervention &#8220;focuses on privacy and data protection&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>In a statement, the data watchdog added:</p>
<blockquote><p>The commitments obtained mark a significant moment in the assessment of the Privacy Sandbox proposals. They demonstrate that consumer rights in digital markets are best protected when competition and privacy are considered together.</p>
<p>As we outlined in our recent <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2619797/cma-ico-public-statement-20210518.pdf" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2619797/cma-ico-public-statement-20210518.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623490085578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEawKF7Uo2PEY4sREPqa_n_x6fo1A">joint statement</a> with the CMA, we believe consumers benefit when their data is used lawfully and responsibly, and digital innovation and competition are supported. We are continuing to build upon our positive and close relationship with the CMA, to ensure that consumer interests are protected as we assess the proposals.</p></blockquote>
<p>This development in the CMA&#8217;s investigation raises plenty of questions, large and small &#8212; most pressingly over the future of key web infrastructure and what the changes being hashed out here between Google and U.K. regulators might mean for internet users everywhere.</p>
<p>The really big issue is whether &#8220;co-design&#8221; with oversight bodies is the best way to fix the market power imbalance flowing from a single tech giant being able to combine massive dominance in consumer digital services with duopoly dominance in adtech.</p>
<p>Others would say that breaking up Google&#8217;s consumer tech and Google&#8217;s adtech is the only way to fix the abuse &#8212; and everything else is just fiddling while Rome burns.</p>
<p>Google, for instance, is still in charge of proposing the changes itself &#8212; regardless of how much pre-implementation consultation and tweaking goes on. It&#8217;s still steering the ship and there are plenty of people who believe that&#8217;s not an acceptable governance model for the open web.</p>
<p>But, for now at least, the CMA wants to try to fiddle.</p>
<p>It should be noted that, in parallel, the U.K. government and CMA are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">speccing out a wider pro-competition regime</a> that could result in deeper interventions into how Google and other platform giants operate in the future. So more interventions are all but guaranteed.</p>
<p>For now, though, Google is probably feeling pretty happy for the opportunity to work with U.K. regulators. If it can pull oversight bodies deep down in the detail of the changes it wants to (or feels it has to) make that&#8217;s likely a far more comfortable spot for Mountain View versus being served with an order to break its business up &#8212; something the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/uks-competition-regulator-asks-for-views-on-breaking-up-google/">CMA has previously taken feedback on</a>.</p>
<p>Google has been contacted with questions on its Privacy Sandbox commitments. (<strong>Update:</strong> see below for some responses.)</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.iabuk.com/news-article/googles-privacy-sandbox-x-cma-heres-whats-happening">statement</a> responding to the development, the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) UK&#8217;s CEO Jon Mew, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“At the IAB, we have always been really clear that the phasing out of third-party cookies is an opportunity to reset the ad-funded web for the better, which is why we have laid out <a href="https://www.iabuk.com/user-identity">clear principles </a>that we believe any viable User ID solutions must meet. I think that the CMA’s investigation into Privacy Sandbox and Google’s commitments to address its concerns about the potential impact on competition are an important and valuable part of this process.</p>
<p>“The commitments allow the wider industry to have confidence that Google’s proposals are being developed in a way that takes into account both competition and privacy objectives, with the benefit of regulatory oversight brought by the CMA. The phasing out of third-party cookies is the most seismic shift that the digital ad industry has ever experienced and it’s only right that developments in this space are subject to appropriate scrutiny.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Some wider questions</h2>
<p>In response to our questions, Google has now sent some additional background information. Via these additional remarks the company resists the suggestion that there will be any &#8220;co-designing&#8221; of Privacy Sandbox under the proposed commitments, saying rather that this is about oversight from and collaboration with the CMA. But, well, that might just be Google seeking to split hairs.</p>
<p>It confirmed the commitments it&#8217;s offered (around design and testing) cover all the proposed technologies in the Privacy Sandbox. So this definitely isn&#8217;t just about tracking cookies &#8212; and will apply to whatever may (or may not) replace them.</p>
<p>Google also affirmed that &#8212; if formally accepted &#8212; it would apply commitments made to the U.K.&#8217;s CMA globally.</p>
<p>Asked whether it has an alternative/s in mind, if the CMA orders that it can&#8217;t depreciate tracking cookies &#8212; or whether such an order would essentially mean Privacy Sandbox is dead &#8212; Google declined to speculate.</p>
<p>But it also said it believes the web is at risk if it doesn&#8217;t keep up with users&#8217; expectations around privacy, claiming it&#8217;s strongly committed to the Privacy Sandbox project and adding that it&#8217;s hopeful the engagement with the CMA will help alleviate industry concerns about the planned transition.</p>
<p>It also told us it will be continuing to work on the project &#8212; rather than halting work to wait for the outcome of the CMA&#8217;s consultation.</p>
<p>But it declined to provide a response when asked if it sees any implications (e.g. a delay) for the original timeline for implementing Privacy Sandbox as a result of the regulator&#8217;s intervention.</p>
<p>Asked about the governance model for Privacy Sandbox &#8212; and whether it&#8217;s fair that Google is the entity redesigning such a core piece of web infrastructure &#8212; it argued it&#8217;s doing this collaboratively with the industry via fora such as the W3C.</p>
<p>However W3C groups don&#8217;t have leverage over Google&#8217;s decisions. So the concern for some is that Google is engaging in what amounts to a &#8220;theatre of collaboration&#8221; &#8212; providing cover as it unilaterally conducts a major retooling with implications for entire online industries. And while it is being made to widen its outreach now &#8212; by looping U.K. regulators into proposal discussions &#8212; the proposals and decisions are still Google&#8217;s own.</p>
<p>Commenting on the governance point, <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik">Dr Lukasz Olejnik</a>, an independent privacy and cybersecurity researcher and consultant who has <a href="https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/governance-of-privacy-preserving-digital-advertising-systems/">written about the governance of privacy-preserving systems</a>, told TechCrunch: &#8220;It seems that Google is certainly trying its best at collaborations and trying to hear the feedback from various parties. This happens, for example, within the W3C Group venue. It is not clear to me if at the present moment there is any governance model of the Privacy Sandbox. I would say there is none. And the devil here is in the details.</p>
<p>&#8220;The issue is, there has to be a way of agreeing to some changes or modifications being deployed. What are the guarantees that, assuming a good proposal is put forward, it is actually taken for implementation? Furthermore it is not clear how the future maintenance or development of the proposal stacks would look like. What is the legitimisation now?</p>
<p>&#8220;Google certainly cannot claim that they alone have a legitimate right to unilaterally take decisions. I don&#8217;t think they also want to argue that this is the case. I would suggest a semi-formal governance structure, that would accept feedback from, or represent, the actors involved &#8212; the users, the publishers, the user agents, the advertisers, and privacy experts or researchers. It&#8217;s the first time we see an attempt to deploy privacy-preserving ad systems, so it would be great to have it future-proofed.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch also asked Google about the ad serving component of the Privacy Sandbox proposals &#8212; and how Google believes its proposed architecture respects user privacy.</p>
<p>Google didn&#8217;t offer a lot of detail on this but it suggested the Turtledove proposal &#8212; i.e. that advertisers serve ads based on one or more interest groups without combining that interest group with other information about the user (e.g. who they are or what page they are visiting) &#8212; is more privacy-preserving than the current way of doing things with tracking cookies (i.e. individual level targeting).</p>
<p>It also suggested that the Fledge component of its proposal aims to build on Turtledove by proposing a trusted third-party server &#8212; to address concerns about information being stored in the browser.</p>
<p>Google confirmed it will be engaging proactively with the CMA about the design and testing of both technology proposals, as they sit within the Privacy Sandbox, further noting the competition watchdog will be getting direct input from the ICO during this process. So, again, U.K. regulators will now have a front row seat at the table where the proposed changes are being discussed.</p>
<p>And Google added that it believes its proposed commitments represent a significant step in reassuring the market.</p>
<p>Whether this &#8220;collaboration&#8221; results in tweaks to the Privacy Sandbox that are &#8220;pro-competition&#8221; but worse for people&#8217;s privacy remains to be seen.</p>
<p>It would be a massive failure of the CMA-ICO claims of joint working <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">(&#8220;to ensure that both privacy and competition concerns can be addressed&#8221;) if so. But it&#8217;s fair to say that users&#8217; rights have all too often been ignored by privacy regulators faced with the frenzied lobbying of adtech interests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Still, in seeking to co-opt competition regulators to their cause, the adtech lobby may at least force a regulatory reckoning on a key issue. And, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/competition-challenge-to-facebooks-superprofiling-of-users-sparks-referral-to-europes-top-court/">elsewhere in Europe</a>, abuse of privacy is being seen as a competition concern too. So they should be careful what they wish for. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bangalore-based neobank Open is in advanced stages of talks to raise about $100 million, according to two sources familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Temasek, the Singaporean government&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund, and General Atlantic are positioning to co-lead the Series C financing round, which values the Indian startup at pre-money $600 million, the sources told TechCrunch, requesting anonymity as the matter is private. Open was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/indias-open-neo-bank-raises-30-million-to-help-businesses-automate-their-finances/">valued at about $150 million</a> in its Series B funding round two years ago.</p>
<p>Existing investor Tiger Global, PayPal, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/paypal-is-shutting-down-domestic-payments-business-in-india/">shuttered its domestic operations in the world’s second-largest internet market</a> earlier this year, as well as Google and Amazon are in talks to participate in the new round, the sources said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indian news outlet Economic Times <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/amazon-google-and-visa-are-open-to-neo-banking/articleshow/83321544.cms">first reported</a> about the size of the imminent round and identified Google and Amazon as probable investors earlier this week. The round hasn&#8217;t closed yet, so terms may change and not all investors may end up backing Open. The startup&#8217;s founder and chief executive Anish Achuthan declined to comment.</p>
<p>Open operates as a neobank that offers nearly all the features of a bank, with additional tools to serve the needs of businesses. The startup offers its clients services such as automated accounts, payment gateway, credit cards, automated bookkeeping, cash flow management and tax and compliance management solutions.</p>

<p>Realizing the opportunity that they can’t tap the entire market, several banks in India have in recent years started to collaborate with fintech startups to expand their reach in the South Asian nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Banks are doing their best to defend their turf by focusing on several fronts – eco system building (led by HDFC Bank), open approach to fintech partnerships (led by ICICI Bank), overall digital experience as an acquisition tool (led by Kotak and Axis) etc. But [they] continue to play catchup as they lack the focus/ expertise in each channel (Banking super apps and APIs are fast becoming hygiene). Fintech revenues are already ~10% of private banks’ fee income, but could grow &gt;3x in the next 3 years,&#8221; wrote analysts at Bank of America in a report late last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Banks no doubt want to own the pipe and relationships, but are unlikely to succeed except in very specific segments,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>In recent months, however, some banks have begun to <a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/05/neobanks-run-into-a-big-bank-problem/">re-evaluate their engagement strategy with neobanks</a>, Indian news and analysis publication the CapTable reported last month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Beauty and wellness businesses have come roaring back to life with the decline of COVID-19 restrictions, and a startup that&#8217;s built a platform that caters to the many needs of small enterprises in the industry today is announcing a big round of funding to grow with them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fresha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fresha</a> &#8212; a multipurpose commerce tool for independent wellness and beauty businesses such as hair, nail and skin salons, yoga instructors and more, based first and foremost around a completely free subscription platform for those businesses to schedule bookings from customers &#8212; has picked up $100 million.</p>
<p>Fresha plans to use the funds to expand the list of countries where it operates, to grow the categories of companies that use its services (mental health practitioners is one example; fitness is another) and to build more services complementing what it already provides, helping customers do their work by providing them with more insights and data about what they do already. It will also be making acquisitions to expand its customer base.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>General Atlantic is leading this Series C, with Huda Kattan, Michael Zeisser of FMZ Ventures and Jonathan Green of Lugard Road Capital also participating, along with past investors Partech, Target Global and FJ Labs.</p>
<p>Fresha has raised $132 million to date, and it&#8217;s not disclosing its valuation. But as a point of reference, when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/shedul-b-round/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed its Series B</a> (as Shedul; the company rebranded in February 2020), it was valued at $105 million.</p>
<p>Chances are that figure is significantly higher now.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wABnmBZvu2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/shedul-b-round/">Shedul, the booking platform for salons and spas, raises $20M Series B at a $105M valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Shedul, the booking platform for salons and spas, raises $20M Series B at a $105M valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/shedul-b-round/embed/#?secret=wABnmBZvu2" data-secret="wABnmBZvu2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Fresha&#8217;s current range of services include a free-to-use platform for booking appointments; free software for managing accounts; a payments service that includes both a physical point of sale and digital interface; and a wider marketplace both to provide goods to the businesses (B2B); and for the businesses to sell goods to customers (B2C).</p>
<p>The London-based company has 50,000 business customers and 150,000 stylists and professionals in 120+ countries (mostly in the U.K., the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Europe), with some 250 million appointments booked to date.</p>
<p>And while many businesses did have to curtail how they operated (and in some countries had to stop operating altogether), Fresha found that it was attracting a lot of new business in part because of its &#8220;free&#8221; model that meant customers didn&#8217;t have to pay to maintain a booking platform at a time when they weren&#8217;t taking bookings, but could use Fresha to generate revenues in other ways (such as through the sale of goods, vouchers for future services and more.)</p>
<p>So in a year when you might have thought that a company based around providing services to industries that were hard hit by COVID would have also been hard-hit, in fact Fresha saw a 30x increase in card payment transactions versus the year before, and more than $12 billion worth of booking appointments made on its platform.</p>
<p>In a market that is very crowded with tech companies building platforms to book beauty (and other) services and to manage the business of independent retailers &#8212; they include giants like Lightspeed POS, as well as smaller players like Booksy (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/booksy-raises-70m-war-chest-to-acquire-salon-appointment-apps-expand-internationally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also recently raised</a>) and <a href="https://www.styleseat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StyleSeat</a>, but also players like Square and PayPal, and many others &#8212; the core of Fresha&#8217;s offering is a booking platform built as a totally free product.</p>
<p>Why free? To attract more users to its other services (such as payments, which do come at a price), and because co-founders William Zeqiri (CEO) and Nick Miller (product chief) &#8212; pictured above, respectively left and right &#8212; think this the only way to build a business like this in a crowded market.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that software is a commodity,&#8221; said Zeqiri in an interview. &#8220;A lot of our competitors are beating each other on price to the bottom. We wanted to consolidate the supply side of the software, gather data about the businesses, how they use what they use.&#8221;</p>
<p>That data led, first, to identifying the need for and building out software and launching its B2B and B2C marketplaces, and the idea is that it will likely lead to more products as it continues to mature, whether it&#8217;s better analytics for its current customers so that they can better price or develop their services accordingly, or entirely new tools for new categories of users.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Booksy raises $70M war chest to acquire salon appointment apps, expand internationally&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/booksy-raises-70m-war-chest-to-acquire-salon-appointment-apps-expand-internationally/embed/#?secret=DL5pKIfbvw" data-secret="DL5pKIfbvw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Meanwhile, the services that it already provides, like payments, have taken off like a shot, not least because they&#8217;ve served a need for any virtual transactions, like selling vouchers or items.</p>
<p class="p1">Miller noted that while a lot of its customers actually interface with tech with a lot of reluctance &#8212; they are the essence of &#8220;physical&#8221; retailers when you think about it &#8212; they also found themselves having to use more digital services simply because of circumstances. &#8220;Looking back at what happened, tech adoption accelerated for our customers,&#8221; said Miller. He said that current customers usage for the point-of-sale systems and online payments is roughly equal.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Fresha&#8217;s investor list is notable for its strategic mix and might shed some light on how it grows. Kattan, a &#8220;beauty influencer&#8221; and the founder of Huda Beauty, is investing by way of HB Investments, a strategic venture arm; while Zeisser&#8217;s FMZ focuses on &#8220;experience economy&#8221; investments today, but he himself has a long history working at tech companies building marketplaces, including years with Alibaba as head of its U.S. investment practice. These speak to areas where Fresha is likely interested in expanding its reach &#8212; more marketplace activity; and perhaps more social media angles and exposure for its customers at a time when social media really has become a key way for beauty and wellness businesses to market themselves.</p>
<p>“Fresha has emerged as a leader powering the beauty and wellness industry,” said Aaron Goldman, Global co-head of financial services and managing director at General Atlantic, in a statement. “William, Nick and the Fresha team have built a product that is resonating with the market and creating long-term value through the intersection of its payments, software and marketplace offerings. We are thrilled to be partnering with the company and believe Fresha has significant opportunity to further scale its innovative platform.”</p>
<p>“I’ve witnessed firsthand the positive impact Fresha has for beauty entrepreneurs,&#8221; added Kattan. &#8220;The company is a force for good in the growing community of beauty professionals around the globe, who are increasingly adopting a self-employed approach. By making top business software accessible without any subscription fees, Fresha lets professionals focus on what they do best — offering great experiences for their customers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tiger Global is in talks to lead a $30 million round in Indian edtech startup Classplus, according to sources familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The new round, which includes both primary investment and secondary transactions, values the five-year-old Indian startup at over $250 million, two sources told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The new round follows another ~$30 million investment that was led by GSV recently, one of the sources said. The new round hasn&#8217;t closed, so terms may change.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Classplus &#8212; which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/03/classplus-coaching-centers-teachers-online/">built a Shopify-like platform for coaching centers</a> to accept fees digitally from students and deliver classes and study material online &#8212; also raised $10.3 million in September last year from Falcon Edge’s AWI, cricketer Sourav Ganguly and existing investors RTP Global and Blume Ventures. That round had valued Classplus at about $73 million, according to research firm Tracxn.</p>
<p>Classplus didn’t respond to a request for comment. Sources requested anonymity, as the matter is private.</p>

<p>As tens of millions of students — and their parents — embrace digital learning apps, Classplus is betting that hundreds of thousands of teachers and coaching centers that have gained reputation in their neighborhoods are here to stay.</p>
<p>The startup is serving these hyperlocal tutoring centers that are present in nearly every nook and cranny in India. &#8220;Anyone who was born in a middle-class family here has likely attended these tuition classes,” Mukul Rustagi, co-founder and chief executive of Classplus, told TechCrunch last year.</p>
<p>“These are typically small and medium setups that are run by teachers themselves. These teachers and coaching centers are very popular in their locality. They rarely do any marketing and students learn about them through word-of-mouth buzz,” he said then.</p>
<p>Rustagi had described Classplus as “Shopify for coaching centers.” Like Shopify, Classplus does not serve as a marketplace that offers discoverability to these teachers or coaching centers and instead it offers a way for these teachers to leverage its tech platform to engage with customers.</p>
<p>This year, Tiger Global has backed &#8212; or in talks to back &#8212; about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/">two dozen startups in India</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla finally held the long-awaited, and once rescheduled, &#8220;delivery event&#8221; for its ultra-fast Model S Plaid at its factory in Fremont, California. The electric vehicle company will begin with 25 deliveries on Friday evening, expanding to several hundred cars per week and a thousand cars per week in the next quarter, CEO Elon Musk said at the event.</p>
<p>There were no huge surprises with the newest iteration of the Model S, which features a new battery pack design, an improved heat pump, carbon over-wrapped rotors on the motors and a new record for drag coefficient of 0.208, a figure that Musk emphasized as perhaps a poke at up-and-comer Lucid Motors. The Lucid Air, which is slated to go into production later this year, has a drag coefficient of 0.21.</p>
<p>While wielding a sledgehammer as prep for &#8220;breaking a few records,&#8221; Tesla Model S designer Franz von Holzhausen kicked off the event, introducing Musk himself, who drove a shiny black Model S around the test track, gliding right onto stage to the dulcet sounds of dubstep.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This is nine years since we delivered the first model S, the first car produced here in Fremont, so almost a decade, and I think we&#8217;ve really taken it to a whole new level with Plaid,&#8221; said Musk to an audience of adoring fans. &#8220;Some of you may know that our product plan is stolen from &#8216;Spaceballs,&#8217; we&#8217;ve gone Plaid speed. So&#8230;why make this really fast car, that&#8217;s crazy fast and everything, and I think there is something that&#8217;s quite important to the future of sustainable energy, which is that we&#8217;ve got to show that an electric car is the best car, hands down. It&#8217;s gotta be clear, like, man, sustainable energy cars can be the fastest cars, can be the safest cars, can be the most kick-ass cars in every way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The four-door electric sedan goes from 0 to 60 in 1.99 seconds, which Musk says breaks the two-second barrier that no production car has ever been able to break. It produces 1,020 horsepower, has a top speed of 200 miles per hour (with the proper tires) and can complete a quarter mile in 9.23 seconds, according to Musk and the company&#8217;s website. The battery can travel 390 miles on a single charge, but Musk added the car can go to 412 miles with the dual motor configuration (The Model S Plaid has a tri-motor set up). The improved charging speed gives drivers 187 miles of range in just 15 minutes.</p>
<p>The new Model S also has a new battery pack, but Musk didn&#8217;t elaborate past that detail. He spent considerable time describing the carbon-sleeved rotors for the motor, which Musk claims is a first for a production electric motor due to the difficulty of pulling it off. The end result is a motor that goes up to 20,000 RPM.</p>
<p>The new heat pump that powers the Plaid&#8217;s HVAC system has 30% better cold weather range and requires 50% less energy for cabin heating and freezing conditions, meaning little degradation in cold weather, said Musk.</p>

<p>The interior of the Model S also has a number of updates, some that have already been revealed, including a yoke steering wheel — which has raised eyebrows and has the attention of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration — a panoramic main screen and ventilated front seats. The GPU is apparently at the level of a PlayStation 5. (TechCrunch noticed that someone was playing CD Projekt Red&#8217;s Cyberpunk 2077 in the vehicle at one point during the event.)</p>
<p>The software of the car is designed to learn from the driver&#8217;s behavior, adapting to the driver&#8217;s needs so that if, say, you tend to back out of your driveway in a certain way, the car geocodes to that location and eventually does that action for you via the autopilot system.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll just keep minimizing the amount of input that you need to do until the car just reads your mind,&#8221; said Musk.</p>
<p>The first deliveries of the vehicle, which starts at $129,990, come the same week<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/06/elon-musk-officially-hits-the-brakes-on-tesla-model-s-plaid/"> Musk officially announced plans to cancel production of the Model S Plaid+</a>, what was meant to be a faster version of the Plaid version of the Model S. Tesla stopped taking pre-orders for the vehicle on its website back in May, prompting speculation that the Plaid+ was off the table.</p>
<p>“Model S goes to Plaid speed this week,” Musk tweeted on Sunday. “Plaid+ is canceled. No need, as Plaid speed is just so good.”</p>
<p>Musk described driving it as akin to powering a spaceship in a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1398504702988390400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1398504702988390400%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2021%2F06%2F06%2Felon-musk-officially-hits-the-brakes-on-tesla-model-s-plaid%2F">tweet</a> due to the car&#8217;s indescribable &#8220;limbic resonance,&#8221; whatever that means.</p>

<div class="p-rich_text_section">Archer Aviation unveiled its autonomous electric two-seater aircraft dubbed &#8220;Maker&#8221; on Thursday, which it will use for testing as it works toward certification of a larger piloted five-seater announced in March 2020.</div>
</div>

<p id="speakable-summary">The aircraft unveiled on Thursday is not what would take to the skies should the company reach commercial operation in 2024. However, Archer’s Head of Certification Eric Wright told TechCrunch that starting with an autonomous vehicle allows the company to move through the testing process more efficiently.</p>
<p>“The [two-seater] Maker aircraft is a stepping stone in the path to certification,” Wright explained. He said it was “a testbed that really helps us to increase our knowledge and awareness on say, the flight control systems and the electric propulsion and the things that we&#8217;re putting into the certified aircraft, and to help the [Federal Aviation Administration] gain confidence in that design as we put it through its paces, and of course, they will be involved in watching that development occur.”</p>
<p>Both Maker and the unnamed five-seater aircraft bear similarities in their specs: both have a “tilt-rotor” design, meaning that of the total 12 rotors on the aircraft, the front six can tilt position. This tilting mechanism is what allows the aircraft to ascend vertically like a helicopter and move forward like an airplane.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The two also have six independent battery packs each for safety purposes, as the rest of the batteries should operate even in the case that one fails. It’s these batteries that give the crafts a 60-mile range at 150 miles per hour. While the two-seater design has a 40-foot wingspan and clocks in at around 3,300 pounds, the larger aircraft will likely weigh more, Wright said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2164862" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164862" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2164862" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/archer-maker2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="559" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/archer-maker2.jpg 1678w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/archer-maker2.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/archer-maker2.jpg?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/archer-maker2.jpg?resize=768,419 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/archer-maker2.jpg?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/archer-maker2.jpg?resize=1536,838 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/archer-maker2.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2164862" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://archer.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Archer <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The Palo Alto-based company also said it anticipates Maker will generate only 45 decibels of sound from 2,000 feet. The noise specification is especially important for electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) companies that have air taxi aspirations. Mass adoption will only likely be acceptable &#8212; both by the public and by regulators &#8212; if the aircraft is sufficiently quiet.</p>
<p>Archer had been slowly trickling information on Maker over the past few months, including releasing a high-quality rendering of the two-seater after the company announced it had landed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/archer-lands-1-1b-order-from-united-airlines-and-a-spac-deal/">a $1 billion order with United</a>. (The release of those renders helped trigger <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/wisk-aero-sues-archer-aviation-for-alleged-patent-infringement-trade-secret-theft/">a lawsuit</a> from rival eVTOL developer Wisk Aero alleging trade secret misappropriation.) The event on Thursday marks the first time the public has been able to see an actual aircraft from the startup that’s valued at $3.8 billion.</p>
<p>When asked why the debut aircraft is autonomous, Wright said it would help the company move more efficiently through the testing and validation process. “By making the vehicle autonomous you can do things quicker without having the pilot in the aircraft actually having to fly it,” Wright said. “So you can look at the response that the aircraft has to the inputs, from an autonomous standpoint, much quicker, much more efficiently.”</p>

<p>While it may be years yet that autonomous air taxis are ferrying people across cities, Archer, like other eVTOL developers, does see autonomy in its long-term blueprint &#8212; as operational aircraft, rather than simply facilitating a larger certification process.</p>
<p>“If we&#8217;re going to have a really large impact on transportation, I think it&#8217;s really difficult to think about doing that in a piloted way really long term,” Archer CEO Brett Adcock told TechCrunch in a separate interview. “I think piloted is for sure the right way to enter the market as relates to getting into the airspace and getting certified and making that happen, basically, right away. And then I think over time, in order to drive up safety for both passengers and the network, it&#8217;s really going to be important to move to autonomous airspace. So I think [autonomy] is inevitable to the extent the industry scales really well and gets big.”</p>
<p>The three-year-old startup aims to launch commercial operations in 2024 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/archer-aviation-aims-to-launch-network-of-urban-air-taxis-in-los-angeles-by-2024/">starting in Los Angeles and Miami</a>. The company’s system simulation team is using a simulation tool called Prime Radiant to determine where to place its vertiports. That team is led by Jon Petersen, the former head of data science at Uber Elevate, Uber’s air mobility arm that was later sold to Joby Aviation in December 2020.</p>
<p>Adcock also said the company has had conversations with ride-sharing companies about working together to integrate the first- and last-mile car trips that will inevitably be needed with the air taxi routes.</p>
<p>In advance of the proposed 2024 launch date, Adam Goldstein, co-founder of Archer, said the company is working with its partner, the automaker Stellantis, on two facilities: one that would deliver traditional aerospace volumes in the hundreds of aircraft per year, and a future facility that would build an even higher volume.</p>
<p>Archer has similar manufacturing needs as an automaker, Goldstein said, &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">where we use lightweight carbon fiber for a lot of the parts, we have electric motors, batteries all that like autos do.&#8221; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After years of speculation, Didi Chuxing, China&#8217;s ridesharing behemoth, finally unveiled its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764757/000104746921001194/a2243272zf-1.htm#dl10201_selected_consolidated_financial_data">IPO filing</a> in the U.S., giving a glimpse into its money-losing history.</p>
<p>Didi didn&#8217;t disclose the size of its raise. Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/didi-ipo/update-2-chinas-didi-reveals-us-ipo-filing-sets-stage-for-blockbuster-new-york-float-idUSL3N2NS42U">reported</a> the company could raise around $10 billion at a valuation of close to $100 billion, though The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/didi-chuxing-chinas-ride-hailing-giant-unveils-u-s-ipo-filing-11623355962">cited</a> a valuation upward of $70 billion. Uber&#8217;s market cap currently exceeds $90 billion.</p>
<p>Cheng Wei, Didi&#8217;s 38-year-old founder, owns 7% of the company’s shares and controls 15.4% of its voting power before the IPO, according to the prospectus. Major shareholders to reap returns are SoftBank Vision Fund, which owns 21.5% of the company, Uber with 12.8% and Tencent at 6.8%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The nine-year-old company, which famously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/didi-chuxing-confirms-it-is-buying-ubers-business-in-china/">acquired Uber&#8217;s China operations in 2016</a>, is more than a ride-hailing platform now. It has a growing line of businesses like bike-sharing, grocery, intra-city freight, financial services for drivers, electric vehicles and Level 4 robotaxis, which it defines as &#8220;the pinnacle of our design for future mobility&#8221; for its potential to lower costs and improve safety.</p>
<p>Didi set up an autonomous driving subsidiary that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/softbank-pours-500m-into-didi-in-chinas-biggest-autonomous-driving-round/">banked $500 million from SoftBank&#8217;s second Vision Fund</a> in May last year. The unit now operates a team of over 500 members and a fleet of over 100 autonomous vehicles. It&#8217;s also designing EVs for ride-hailing as China pushes taxis and ridesharing companies to phase out fossil fuel vehicles.</p>
<h2>Market dominance</h2>
<p>For the 12 months ended March, Didi served 493 million annual active users and saw 41 million transactions on a daily basis. It had 156 million monthly users in Q1, well above Uber&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/ubers-mixed-q1-earnings-portray-an-evolving-business/">98 million</a> in the period.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Mobility</span> services in China have consistently accounted for over 90% of Didi&#8217;s revenues. The company has tried to expand its presence in a dozen overseas countries like Brazil, where it bought local ride-hailing business 99 Taxis. And more than 97% of Didi&#8217;s China-based mobility revenues &#8212; which also include taxi hailing, chauffeur and carpooling, a lucrative business that was revamped following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/06/didi-safety-pivot/">two deadly accidents</a> &#8212; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">came from ride-hailing between 2018 and 2020.</span></p>

<p>Third-party data also speaks to Didi&#8217;s dominance. Aurora Mobile, an app tracking firm, <a href="https://www.jiguang.cn/reports/532">showed</a> that Didi had 77.6 million active users in March. Its closest rival Geely-backed Caocao was less than one-tenth of its size.</p>
<p>Didi had been operating in the red from 2018 to 2020, when it finished the year with a $1.6 billion net loss, but managed to turn the tide in the first quarter of 2021 by racking up a net profit of $837 million. It noted that the increased profit was primarily due to investment income from the deconsolidation of Chengxin, its cash-burning grocery group buying initiative, and an equity investment disposal.</p>
<p>Revenue from Q1 also more than doubled year-over-year to $6.6 billion. Uber, in comparison, racked up $2.9 billion in revenue for the period.</p>
<p>Didi plans to spend 30% of its IPO proceeds on shared mobility, electric vehicles, autonomous driving and other technologies. Thirty percent will go toward its international expansion and another 20% will be used for new product development.</p>
