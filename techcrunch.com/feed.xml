										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Threat intelligence giant Recorded Future announced Tuesday that it has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/recorded-future-acquires-securitytrails-301453543.html">acquired</a> SecurityTrails, an internet inventory startup that collects and banks current and historical domain and IP address data, for $65 million.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the deal were not immediately disclosed. A spokesperson for Recorded Future confirmed the acquisition price.</p>
<p>SecurityTrails collects and maintains vast amounts of current and historical internet records, such as domain name records, registration data, and DNS information, giving organizations visibility into what their threat attack surface is — that is, the networks and servers that are accessible from the wider internet.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253137" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The two companies have a long-standing relationship already. SecurityTrails became a technology partner in 2018 — a year after it was founded — providing Recorded Future with data for its intelligence platform, which customers use to improve their security standing and fend off adversaries.</p>
<p>The deal will deepen technological ties between the two companies. In remarks, Recorded Future&#8217;s co-founder and chief executive Dr. Christopher Ahlberg said that the combined technology from the two companies makes life &#8220;miserable for the adversary.&#8221;</p>
<p>The acquisition comes less than a year after Recorded Future invested in SecurityTrails from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/recorded-future-has-a-new-20m-fund-for-early-stage-startups/">its newly established Intelligence Fund</a> for early-stage startups. Recorded Future was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/insight-partners-bags-threat-intel-company-recorded-future-for-780m/">bought by Insight Partners</a> in April 2019 for $780 million.</p>
<p>Chris Ueland, SecurityTrails&#8217;s co-founder and chief executive, said the two companies &#8220;naturally complement each other in terms of providing risk landscape visibility.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Skydio&#8217;s self-flying drone is getting a host of new software, hardware and services updates to ring in the new year.</p>
<p>The Bay Areas-based drone company is revamping their flagship drone with a number of features designed around usability, along with a major software update focused on bringing more control to users without forcing them to take manual control of the drone. The team is also delivering a new service plan called Skydio Care designed to give drone owners a protection plan that supplements their existing warranty but allows for rapid replacement of accidentally damaged devices.</p>
<p>Over the past several years, Skydio has been in an interesting position as a young American drone company with both consumer and enterprise clients. The startups has raised more than $340 million from top venture capitalists on the promise it can take drones mainstream with AI-aided controls that simplify user onboarding.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252743" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Its latest device &#8212;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> an updated version of its Skydio 2 drone called the Skydio 2+ &#8212; aims to serve both customers. The big update here increased flight range thanks to 5Ghz Wifi radio and two pop-up antennas which extend maximum range from 3.5 km to 6 km. The 2+ also sports a higher-density battery pack which adds a few minutes to its maximum flight time, now 27 minutes.</span></p>

<p>As has always been the case, the star of this drone is its computer vision-aided intelligence which allows the drone to pilot itself using a series of onboard cameras. The company is expanding its ambitions with a new software feature called KeyFrame, which will be available for both the Skydio 2+ and original Skydio 2.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2253190" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-10.14.11-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="426" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-10.14.11-AM.png 1868w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-10.14.11-AM.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-10.14.11-AM.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-10.14.11-AM.png?resize=768,481 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-10.14.11-AM.png?resize=680,426 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-10.14.11-AM.png?resize=1536,962 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-10.14.11-AM.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The AI-powered feature allows for more cinematic capture by giving the user the power to define the individual shots they want to capture with the device&#8217;s app but then allowing the Skydio drone to handle the trouble of moving between those shots while creating a sweeping video that nails all of the key points of interest.</p>
<p>The software feature is one of the most powerful yet to come to the device and may help onboard enterprise clients who are still skittish to play around with the self-flying drones software. Skydio has another effort to entice the nervous: a new service plan called Skydio Plus which brings flat rate accidental damage repair to the device. Users will be able to choose 1-year or 2-year support plans for $149 and $249 respectively which allow users to replace broken or lost drones for flat rates. The first replacement of a damaged drone will cost just $150 for subscribers while a lost drone will require users to pay up $550 to replace it under the extended warranty plan.</p>
<p>The Skydio 2+, which starts at $1,099 for a basic package and taps out at $2,169 for a Pro Kit is available for order now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Intel subsidiary Mobileye is partnering with Chinese automaker Zeekr to develop an all-electric autonomous vehicle for consumers. The vehicle will be sold in China starting in 2024 and eventually roll out to other markets, the companies said Tuesday without naming specific countries or timeline.</p>
<p>The companies made the announcement Tuesday at the 2022 CES tech trade show in Las Vegas. Mobileye also announced separate deals with Ford and Volkswagen Group to use its mapping technology to support their respective advanced driving assistance systems.</p>
<p>The planned Zeekr autonomous vehicle will combine Mobileye&#8217;s chips with Zeekr parent company Geely Holdings&#8217; electric vehicle architecture, which includes redundant braking, steering and power. The company didn&#8217;t show what that vehicle might look like (the main photo shown in this article is of the Zeekr 001 EV, which includes Mobileye tech).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253097" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The upcoming vehicle will have so-called Level 4, or L4, capabilities, a term that means it will be able to handle all aspects of driving for the human in certain conditions. This might mean the technology will only work on certain roadways or urban centers or when weather conditions are ideal.</p>
<p>The Mobileye tech will include six of its EyeQ5, or fifth generation, system-on-chips, which will be used to process incoming data from sensors as well as incorporate the company&#8217;s branded &#8220;Road Experience Map&#8221; mapping technology and Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS)-based driving policy.</p>
<p>Mobileye also announced that it is scaling up research and development efforts in China with plans to open a local data center and boost with workforce there.</p>
<p>The Mobileye-Zeekr news comes less than a month since Waymo, Alphabet&#8217;s autonomous driving technology arm, announced it was partnering with Chinese automaker Geely to build an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/28/waymo-partners-with-geely-to-make-electric-avs-for-ride-hail-in-the-us/">all-electric, self-driving ride-hailing vehicle</a>. The companies said they would integrate Waymo&#8217;s AV system into Geely&#8217;s Zeekr vehicles for use in U.S. markets &#8220;in the years to come.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mobileye, best known for its chips that support advanced driver assistance systems, has also been developing automated vehicle technology for several years. Its full self-driving stack &#8212; which includes redundant sensing subsystems based on camera, radar and lidar technology &#8212; is combined with its REM mapping system and RSS driving policy.</p>
<p>Mobileye&#8217;s REM mapping system crowdsources data by tapping into consumer and fleet vehicles equipped with its system on chip to build high-definition maps that can be used to support ADAS and autonomous driving systems. That data is not video or images but compressed text that collects about 10 kilobits per kilometer. The mapping technology is accessed via the cloud to provide, in real time, up-to-date information on the drivable paths ahead.</p>
<p>Mobileye already has agreements with BMW, Nissan and Volkswagen to collect that data on vehicles equipped with the EyeQ4 chip — the most recent chip equipped in vehicles — which is used to power the advanced driver assistance system. On fleet vehicles, Mobileye collects data from an after-market product it sells to commercial operators. Today, more over 1 million vehicles harvesting REM data – now up to over 25 million kilometers per day. Mobileye has used all of this crowd-sourced, anonymized information to create a database of precise, high-definition maps that it has branded Mobileye Roadbook.</p>
<p>Mobileye is now expanding its relationship with Volkswagen Group to take the map data that is being collected and apply it to the automaker&#8217;s travel Assist 2.5 driver assistance system. The expanded partnership was also announced at CES.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Mobileye&#8217;s Roadbook will be used to increase the functionality of VW&#8217;s ADAS. For instance, where available, lane-keeping assistance will be provided in many areas without visible lane markings, according to Mobileye.</p>
<p>The companies said Tuesday that Roadbook-enhanced Travel Assist feature will be available soon in Volkswagen, Škoda and Seat electric vehicle models based on Volkswagen&#8217;s MEB platform.</p>
<p>Mobileye also announced Tuesday that Ford will begin using Mobileye&#8217;s REM mapping technology in future versions of available Ford&#8217;s hands-free advanced driver assistance system called BlueCruise. The companies did not share a timeline for when the mapping tech would be integrated into Ford&#8217;s ADAS system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">CES may be going ahead as a shortened, pared-down operation this year, but we’re still seeing a decent swathe of announcements prepared for the event still coming out into the wild, in particular among chipmakers who power the world&#8217;s computers. Intel has been a regular presence at the show and is continuing that with its run of news today, focusing on the newest, 12th generation of its mobile chip with versions aimed both at enterprises and consumers, alongside updates to its Evo computing platform concept, new 35- and 65-watt processors for desktop, and vPro platform launches.</p>
<p>With some of the lineup announced back in October (it has now dropped the Alder Lake naming that appeared still to be in use then) today&#8217;s news is arguably the biggest push that Intel has made in years to promote its processors and build for a range of use cases, ranging from consumers through to more intense gaming, through to enterprise applications and IoT deployments.  After what some described as a lacklustre 11th-generation launch, here Intel is unveiling no less than 28 new 12th-generation Intel Core mobile processors, and an addition 22 desktop processors.</p>
<p>Intel claims that the mobile processors are clocking in speeds of up to 40% faster than its previous generations</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253010" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Intel‘s new performance hybrid architecture is helping to accelerate the pace of innovation and the future of compute,” said Gregory Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of Intel’s Client Computing Group, in a statement. &#8220;We want to bring that idea of ubiquitous computing to life,&#8221; he added in a presentation today at CES.</p>
<p>The H-series of the 12th Gen Intel core mobile processors come in four main categories, i3, i5, i7, and i9. The i9-12900HK is the fastest of the range of eight and are one of the first from Intel to build performance and efficient cores together on the same chip to better handle heavy workloads. They come with frequencies of up to 5GHz, 14 cores (6 for performance, 8 for efficiency) and 20 threads for applications that are multi-threaded, and they also offer<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> memory support for DDR5/LPDDR5 and DDR4/LPDDR4 modules up to 4800 MT/s. Intel says this is a first in the industry for H-series mobile processors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">They offer support for Deeplink for optimized power usage; Thunderbolt 4 for faster data transfers (up to 40 Gbps) and connectivity; and Intel&#8217;s new integrated WiFi 6E, which Intel dubs its &#8220;Killer&#8221; WiFi and will be available in nearly all</span> laptops running Intel’s 12th generation chips. The interesting thing about this latest WiFi version is that it essentially optimizes for gameplay and other bandwidth-intensive activities: latency is created by putting the most powerful applications on channels separate from the rest of the applications on a device that might also be using bandwidth (these are relegated to lower bandwidth channels) that now essentially run in the background. Bands can also be merged intelligently by the system when more power for a specific application is needed. All this will be available from February 2022, Intel said.</p>
<p class="p1">H-series, it added, is now in full production, with Acer, Dell, Gigabyte, HP, Lenovo, MSi, and Razer among those building machines using it, some 100 designs in all covering both Windows and Chrome operating systems.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">In terms of applications that Intel is highlighting for its chip use, in addition to enterprises and more casual consumers, it continues to focus on gaming. No surprise there, given the demands of the most advanced games and gamers today, which have become major drivers for improving compute power. To that end, Intel is making sure its chips are in that mix with the 12th-generation chip.</p>
<p class="p1">That has included both investing in gaming companies (such as Razer), as well as working closely with developers to optimize speeds on its processors. Intel said that work with Hitman 3, for example, so that its chips could support the audio and graphics processing in the game increased frame rates by up to 8%.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tuning games to achieve maximum performance can be daunting,” says Maurizio de Pascale, chief technology officer at IO Interactive, in a statement. &#8220;But partnering with Intel and leveraging their decades of expertise has yielded fantastic results – especially optimizing for the powerful 12th Gen Intel Core processors. As an example, anyone who plays on a laptop</p>
<p class="p1">Content application remains another major part of the market for Intel, with customers building software and hardware optimized for its chips including Adobe, Autodesk, Foundry Blender, Dolby, Dassault, Magix and more. Indeed, the processor now sites at the centre of all of these as they live as digital activities. They also represent a large number of verticals that Intel can target, including product designers, engineers, broadcasting and streaming, architects, creators, scientific visualization.</p>
<p>The 22 new processors getting unveiled are coming in both 65 watt and 35 watt varieties. Alongside the higher wattage (and thus higher energy consuming) chip, Intel also launched a new Laminar cooler.</p>
<p>Another strand of Intel&#8217;s work over the last several years has been to approach the specifications of computers running its chips in a more holistic way to integrate what it is building with where it can be put to use, by way of its Evo platform and Project Athena. Intel said that there are not more than 100 co-engineered designs using the 12th-generation chips based on these, ranging from foldable displays to more standard laptops, with many of them launching during the first half of this year.</p>
<p>Evo specifications already cover responsiveness, battery life, instant wake, and fast charge, and Intel said that a new addition to that range will be a new parameter, &#8220;intelligent collaboration&#8221;, which will be focused on how many of us are using computers today, for remote collaboration, videoconferencing and the features that make it better such as AI-based noise cancellation, better WiFi usage, and enhanced camera and other imaging effects. This will be likely where its $100-$150 million acquisition of screen mirroring tech provider Screenovate, which it <a href="https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-intel-acquires-israeli-co-screenovate-1001393421" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> in December, will fit.</p>
<p>At a time when Intel continues to face a lot of competition from the likes of AMD and Nvidia, and Apple <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-01-02/what-s-apple-aapl-releasing-in-2022-iphone-14-airpods-pro-2-imac-pro-ipads-kxxmcej5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makes yet more moves</a> to distance itself from the company, continuing to move ahead and reinforce the partners that it does have, and build an ecosystem around that, is the strategy that the company will continue to pursue, as long as it keeps up its end of the innovation bargain.</p>
<p>“Microsoft and Intel have a long history of partnering together to deliver incredible performance and seamless experiences to people all over the world,” said Panos Panay, chief product officer at Microsoft, in a statement. &#8220;Whether playing the latest AAA title, encoding 8K video or developing complex geological models, the combination of Windows 11 and the new 12th-gen Intel Core mobile processors means you’re getting a powerhouse experience.&#8221;</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/volochluis/">Luis Voloch</a> is the CTO and co-founder of <a href="https://www.immunai.com/">Immunai</a>. He was previously Israel Tech Challenge’s head of data science, worked on varied machine learning efforts at Palantir and led the machine learning initiatives for ML modeling of DNA data at MyHeritage.	</div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">What do deep neural networks and cancer immunotherapy have in common?</p>
<p>While both are among the most transformational areas of modern science, 30 years ago, these fields were all but ridiculed by the scientific community. As a result, progress in each happened at the sidelines of academia for decades.</p>
<p>Between the 1970s and 1990s, some of the most prominent computer scientists, including Marvin Minsky, in his book &#8220;Perceptrons,&#8221; argued that neural networks (the backbone of most modern AI) would never work for most applications. He exposed flaws in the early conceptions of neural networks and argued that the whole approach was ineffective.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253052" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, during the 1980s through the 2000s, neural network pioneers and believers – Geoffrey Hinton, Joshua Bengio, and Yann LeCun – continued their efforts and pursued their intuition that neural networks would succeed. These researchers found that most of the original ideas were correct but simply needed more data (think of ImageNET), computational power and further modeling tweaks to be effective.</p>
<p><a href="https://awards.acm.org/about/2018-turing">Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, and Yann LeCun were awarded the Turing Award</a> in 2018 (the Computer Science equivalent of a Nobel prize) for their work. Today, their revelations have made neural networks the most vibrant area of computer science and have revolutionized fields such as computer vision and natural language processing.</p>
<p>Cancer immunology faced similar obstacles. Treatment with IL-2 cytokine, one of the first immunomodulatory drugs, failed to meet expectations. These outcomes slowed further research, and for decades, cancer immunology wasn&#8217;t taken seriously by many cancer biologists. With the effort and intuition of some, however, it was discovered decades later that the concept of boosting the immune system to fight cancer had objective validity. It turned out that we just needed better drug targets and combinations, and eventually, researchers demonstrated that the immune system is the best tool in our fight against cancer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/publications/conquest/immunotherapy-innovator-jim-allisons-nobel-purpose.h36-1592202.html">James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo</a>, who pioneered the class of cancer immunotherapy drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors, were awarded the Nobel Prize in 2018.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though widely accepted now, it took decades for the scientific establishment to accept these novel approaches as valid.</p>
<p>Machine learning and immunotherapy have more in common than historical similarities. The beauty of immunotherapy is that it leverages the versatility and flexibility of the immune system to fight different types of cancers. While the first immunotherapies showed results in a few cancers, they were later shown to work in many other cancer types. AI, similarly, utilizes flexible tools to solve a wide range of problems across applications via transfer and multi-task learning. These processes are made possible through access to large-scale data.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s something to remember: The resurgence of neural networks started in 2012 after <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920309756/pdf?md5=8c3d8439f8f7c362aef0d755bc86d40f&amp;pid=1-s2.0-S2351978920309756-main.pdf">the AlexNet architecture demonstrated 84.7% accuracy</a> in the ImageNET competition. This level of performance was revolutionary at the time, with the second-best model achieving 73.8% accuracy. The ImageNET dataset, started by Fei-Fei Li, is robust, well-labeled and high-quality. As a result, it has been integral to how far neural networks have brought computer vision today.</p>
<p>Interestingly, similar developments are happening now in biology. Life sciences companies and labs are building <a href="https://www.life-sciences-usa.com/product/amica-database-annotated-multi-immunai-group-biological-chemical-2001-32935.html">large-scale datasets with tens of millions of immune cells labeled consistently</a> to ensure the validity of the underlying data. These datasets are the analogs of ImageNET in biology.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re already seeing these large, high-quality datasets giving rise to experimentation at a rate and scale that was impossible before. For example, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0229-2">machine learning is being used to identify</a> immune cell types in different parts of the body and their involvement in various diseases. After identifying patterns, algorithms can &#8220;map&#8221; or predict different immune trajectories, which can then be used to interpret, for example, why some cancer immunotherapies work on particular cancer types and some don&#8217;t. The datasets act as the Google Maps of the immune system.</p>
<p>Mapping patterns of genes, proteins, and cell interactions across diseases allows researchers to understand molecular pathways as the building blocks of disease. The presence or absence of a functional block helps interpret why some cancer immunotherapies work on particular cancer types but not others.</p>
<p>Mapping pathways of genes and proteins across diseases and phenotypes allows researchers to learn how they work together to activate specific pathways and fight multiple diseases. Genes can be part of numerous pathways, and they can cause distinct types of cells to behave differently.</p>
<p>Moreover, different cell types can share similar gene activities, and the same functional pathways can be found in various immune-related disorders. This makes a case for building machine learning models that perform effectively on specific tasks and transfer to other tasks.</p>
<p>Transfer learning works in deep learning models, for example, by taking simple patterns (in images, think of simple lines and curves) learned by early layers of a neural network and leveraging those layers for different problems. In biology, this allows us to transfer knowledge on how specific genes and pathways in one disease or cell type play a role in other contexts.</p>
<p>AI research that addresses the effects of genetic changes (perturbations) on immune cells and their impact on the cells and possible treatments is increasingly common in cancer immunology. This kind of research will enable us to understand these cells more quickly and lead to better drugs and treatments.</p>
<p>With large-scale data fueling further research in immunotherapy and AI, we are confident that more effective drugs to fight cancer will appear soon, thus giving hope to the <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics#:~:text=Statistics%20at%20a%20Glance%3A%20The%20Burden%20of%20Cancer%20Worldwide,million%20cancer%2Drelated%20deaths%20worldwide.">over 18 million people who are diagnosed with cancer</a> every year.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Over the past decade, the Israeli cybersecurity industry has secured its place as a formidable wellspring of technological innovation. No longer famous only for its high level of human technological capital born and bred in elite army intelligence units, the Israeli industry has matured into a veritable ecosystem of its own. With enough capital in this booming ecosystem to grow massive category leaders and cultivate internal M&amp;A, Israeli startups are now major players in the global cybersecurity industry.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/2020-was-a-record-year-for-israels-security-startup-ecosystem/">last year’s recap</a> of the Israeli cybersecurity ecosystem, we anticipated that the record-breaking rounds of 2020 and marked-up valuations would continue in 2021, but upon collecting and assessing this past year’s data, we were taken aback by the magnitude. Israeli cybersecurity startups in 2021 raised a stunning $8.84 billion, more than triple the amount in 2020 ($2.75 billion). Investments last year were distributed across 135 rounds, up from 109 in 2020, with 15 startups raising more than one funding round last year.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity market today has limited patience, and a &#8220;go big or go home&#8221; mindset has permeated as founders focus on laying the groundwork for reaching unicorn status, building multibillion-dollar companies, going public and more. Cybersecurity in Israel has become a polarized market that accepts only two types of startups: potential unicorns and actual unicorns.</p>

<p>With such early and constantly growing investments, the industry has taken on a new approach that favors the survival of the fittest. It quickly becomes clear who will stay the course and catapult to growth and success, and who will look for the nearest exit with no time to linger in limbo.</p>
<h2>Off to a running start</h2>
<p>In order to achieve this growth, founders are making their goals distinctly clear in investment board rooms. They require more funding for a strong head start and later on for entering the unicorn club at record speed. Fortunately, such sizable amounts of capital are readily available.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252465" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252465" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2252465" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/YLV_SOTCN2021_A-Polarized-Industry.jpg" alt="Capital allocation for growth rounds in 2021 skewed towards the later stages" width="1024" height="645" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/YLV_SOTCN2021_A-Polarized-Industry.jpg 1310w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/YLV_SOTCN2021_A-Polarized-Industry.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/YLV_SOTCN2021_A-Polarized-Industry.jpg?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/YLV_SOTCN2021_A-Polarized-Industry.jpg?resize=768,484 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/YLV_SOTCN2021_A-Polarized-Industry.jpg?resize=680,428 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/YLV_SOTCN2021_A-Polarized-Industry.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2252465" class="wp-caption-text">Capital allocation for growth rounds in 2021 skewed toward the later stages. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> YL Ventures</p></div></p>
<p>The total amount raised in seed rounds last year increased slightly to $233 million from $203 million in 2020, but Series A rounds surged 140% to a whopping $693 million from $288 million a year earlier. At the other end of the spectrum, growth rounds (Series C and above) rose 300% to an astounding $6.46 billion in 2021 from $1.63 billion in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;As entrepreneurs, [2021] has drastically changed the industry’s rules,&#8221; says Assaf Hefetz, co-founder of Snyk, an Israeli cloud-native application security unicorn. &#8220;As threats abound and with skyrocketing demand for innovative solutions, Israeli cybersecurity startups now have an invaluable opportunity to grow big and grow fast. The table stakes are higher [ … ] and in such a competitive arena you have to stand out, or fold.”</p>

<p>The average seed round increased by 35% to $7 million from $5.2 million. As investments rise, so does the bar for entry into the market. Only 58 new startups were founded in 2021 compared with 2020’s 64, a testament to the competitive and highly ambitious landscape.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Formlabs launched on Kickstarter nearly a decade ago, it stood out from the (then) crowded field of 3D printing startups by offering an accessible approach to high-res stereolithography.</p>
<p>It was a big deal, introducing a technology that had thus far been relegated to far more expensive industrial machines. It’s paid off for the company, which achieved double unicorn status earlier this year, even as much of the competition has fallen away. The company says it has sold more than 90,000 printers to date.</p>
<p>Today at CES, the MIT spinout announced a pair of new printers &#8212; the Form 3+ and Form 3B+. As the names imply, the new printers are updates to the Form 3 and 3B, announced back in 2019. The main update here is speed &#8212; promising exposure and printing that’s up to 40% faster than earlier models. That comes courtesy of more powerful, higher intensity lasers for the resin curing process. The new Build Platform 2, meanwhile, promises faster and easier removal of prints.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251760" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Formlabs created the professional desktop printer market, and our Form 3 has become a best-seller,” CEO Max Lobovsky said in a release tied to the CES news. “The Form 3+ is the next iteration designed to help users go from idea to part in hand as quickly and easily as possible.</p>
<p>Also new for the show is a new ESD (electrostatic discharge) resin for printing, designed specifically for electronics manufacturing, automotive and aerospace applications.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Omniverse</a> is Nvidia&#8217;s platform for allowing creators, designers and engineers to collaboratively build virtual worlds. It&#8217;s the company&#8217;s platform that brings together design tools and assets from first- and third-party applications into a single hardware and software ecosystem. Until now, Omniverse and the various Nvidia tools that support it were in beta, but at CES today, the company took off the beta label and made Omniverse generally available to creators.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xWJtFXYlAPc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The company says Omniverse has already been downloaded by almost 100,000 creators and with today&#8217;s update, it is bringing a number of new features to the platform, too. These include the Omniverse Nucleus Cloud, a service for sharing large Omniverse 3D scenes that will make it possible for creators and clients to collaborate on scenes in a way that&#8217;s similar to working on a cloud-shared document (and without having to move a ton of data for every small change).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252714" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2253077" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253077" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253077" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="577" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg 1829w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253077" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nvidia</p></div></p>
<p>At the core of Omniverse is the Universal Scene Description format, which makes it easy to import assets from a wide variety of existing tools. But sometimes, you just want a basic 3D asset and are willing to pay for it, so Nvidia also now added support for 3D marketplaces and libraries from the likes of TurboSquid by Shutterstock, CGTrader, Sketchfab and Twinbru in the Omniverse Launcher. Reallusion’s ActorCore, Daz3D and e-on software’s PlantCatalog will soon launch their own Omniverse-ready assets, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You can now add another set of Nvidia-based graphics cards to the graphics cards you probably won&#8217;t be able to buy anytime soon, as the company today launched the GeForce RTX 3050 for desktops.</p>
<p>Starting at $249, the budget-friendly card &#8212; assuming Nvidia and its partners can produce enough to keep prices from escalating &#8212; will feature 8GB of GDDR6 memory and promises to be able to run the latest games at over 60 frames in a 1440p resolution with ray-tracing enabled. Like its more powerful brethren in the company&#8217;s 30-series, it will feature third-generation Tensor cores to power Nvidia&#8217;s DLSS for smart upscaling and AI workloads, as well as second-generation RT cores for ray-tracing.</p>

<p>Nvidia noted that 75% of gamers are still using GTX GPUs, which should make the RTX 3050 a compelling upgrade for many. The 2016 GTX 1050, for example, isn&#8217;t quite able to run modern games at 60 fps anymore, and even the more recent GTX 1650 now often struggles to do so.</p>
<p>Cards based on the new chip will launch on January 27.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253074" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081832.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253074" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253074" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081832.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="521" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081832.jpg 1837w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081832.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081832.jpg?resize=300,153 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081832.jpg?resize=768,391 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081832.jpg?resize=680,346 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081832.jpg?resize=1536,782 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081832.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253074" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nvidia</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to these budget chips, Nvidia also teased an RTX 3090 Ti, which looks like it will be a monster of a GPU, but didn&#8217;t provide any real details about it. We&#8217;ll know more later this month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For laptop gamers and creators, Nvidia also today announced the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti laptop GPU, which promises to offer more performance than a desktop Titan RTX machine. Laptops with this chip will start at $2,499. On a more budget-friendly note, the new GeForce RTX 3070 Ti GPU for laptops will launch on machines that start at $1,499 and offer 70% more performance than 2070 Super laptops at a 1440p resolution.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253066" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081547.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253066" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253066" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081547.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="479" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081547.jpg 1786w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081547.jpg?resize=150,70 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081547.jpg?resize=300,140 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081547.jpg?resize=768,359 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081547.jpg?resize=680,318 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081547.jpg?resize=1536,719 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081547.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253066" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nvidia</p></div></p>
<p>And 1440p, it&#8217;s worth noting, is what Nvidia is now pushing for e-sports games, with a new category of gaming monitors that will be able to handle up to 360 fps at 1440p, starting with new 360 fps display from Asus and 300 fps support on a set of new displays from AOC, MSI and ViewSonic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At CES, Nvidia today <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2022/01/04/geforce-now-ea-att-samsung-ces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put a strong emphasis</a> on its GeForce Now game streaming service, its competitor to the likes of Google&#8217;s Stadia (that&#8217;s still around, right?), Amazon&#8217;s Luna and Microsoft&#8217;s increasingly popular Xbox Cloud Gaming service. All of these use a different business model, with GeForce Now making it easy for players to bring to the service games they bought elsewhere, with Nvidia offering a restricted free tier and then charging a membership fee for access to its servers, starting at $10 per month.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced a number of new partnerships, as well as the news that Electronic Arts Battlefield 4 from 2013 and Battlefield V from 2018 are now available for streaming on the service. Not exactly Day One releases, but nice to have, I guess.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s maybe more important is that Nvidia continues to expand the overall GeForce Now ecosystem. In this case, that means a deal with AT&amp;T, which will give its customers on a 5G device on a 5G &#8220;unlimited&#8221; plan a free six-month GeForce Now priority membership. Nvidia says the two companies are &#8220;teaming up as 5G technical innovation collaborators,&#8221; but we&#8217;re basically talking about a marketing deal here. The whole promise of 5G is low latency after all.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252744" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Intel subsidiary Mobileye plans to bring a new supercomputer to market designed to give passenger cars, trucks and SUVs autonomous driving powers.</p>
<p>The company introduced Tuesday at the 2022 CES tech trade show a new system-on-chip called EyeQ Ultra that is purpose-built for autonomous driving. The company said the first silicon for the EyeQ Ultra SoC, which is capable of 176 trillion operations per second (TOPS), is expected at the end of 2023 with full automotive grade production in 2025.</p>
<p>The company also introduced at CES its next-generation EyeQ system-on-chip for advanced driver-assistance systems called EyeQ6L and EyeQ6H. The EyeQ6L is designed to support so-called Level 2 ADAS and is expected to reach the start of production by mid-2023. The EyeQ6H, which won&#8217;t go into production until 2024, will support ADAS or partial autonomous vehicle capabilities. This higher-performing chip will be able to provide all advanced driving assistance functions, multi-camera processing (including parking cameras), and will host third-party apps such as parking visualization and driver monitoring.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252805" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Mobileye is perhaps best known for supplying automakers with computer vision technology that powers advanced driver assistance systems. Is first EyeQ chip launched 2004 and was used in vehicles to prevent collisions. It&#8217;s been a booming business for Mobileye, which as of late last year the company has shipped its 100 millionth EyeQ SoC.</p>
<p>In recent years, the company has pursued what seemed like a dual strategy of supplying automakers with the chips they need for advanced driving assistance system while it developed and tested its own autonomous vehicle technology. In 2018, Mobileye even expanded its focus beyond being a mere supplier to becoming a robotaxi operator.</p>
<p>Those two paths are now converging, fulfilling a longtime strategy of Mobileye president and CEO Amnon Shashua who describes consumer AVs as the &#8220;end game for the industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mobileye has been developing automated vehicle technology for several years now. Its full self-driving stack &#8212; which includes redundant sensing subsystems based on camera, radar and lidar technology &#8212; is combined with its REM mapping system and a rules-based Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) driving policy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mobileye&#8217;s REM mapping system crowdsources data by tapping into consumer and fleet vehicles equipped with its EyeQ4, or fourth-generation system on chip, to build high-definition maps that can be used to support in ADAS and autonomous driving systems. That data is not video or images but compressed text that collects about 10 kilobits per kilometer. The mapping technology, which has informed the development of this new EyeQ Ultra chip, is accessed via the cloud to provide, in real time, up-to-date information on the drivable paths ahead.</p>
<p>Mobileye has agreements with six OEMs, including BMW, Nissan and Volkswagen, to collect that data on vehicles equipped with the EyeQ4 chip, which is used to power the advanced driver assistance system. On fleet vehicles, Mobileye collects data from an after-market product it sells to commercial operators. Today, more over 1 million vehicles harvesting REM data – now up to over 25 million kilometers per day, according to Mobileye.</p>
<p>The EyeQ Ultra continues to build off of previous generations of its SoC architecture. The EyeQ Ultra crams the processing power of 10 EyeQ5s in a single package, according to Mobileye. The company said EyeQ Ultra, which is engineered with Mobileye software, are paired with additional CPU cores, ISPs and GPUs and are capable of processing input from two sensing subsystems &#8212; one camera-only system and the other radar and lidar combined &#8212; as well as the vehicle&#8217;s central computing system, the high-definition REM map and RSS driving policy software.</p>
<p>Automakers keen on selling cars, trucks and SUVs to consumer that are capable of autonomous driving would theoretically use this yet-to-be-available chip to execute that goal. The EyeQ Ultra doesn&#8217;t include the sensors like radar and lidar. Instead it processes all of that incoming information. It&#8217;s up to the automaker customer to decide exactly how the EyeQ Ultra chip might be used. For instance, an automaker might offer new vehicles capable of autonomous driving only on highways while another might focus on automation in urban areas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sanjay Bhargava, the head of Starlink India, has stepped down from his role weeks after the Indian government ordered the SpaceX division to stop taking orders for the devices as it doesn&#8217;t have the license to operate in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>In a LinkedIn post, Bhargava said he was leaving the firm for &#8220;personal reasons.&#8221; His departure comes just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/spacexs-starlink-forms-india-subsidiary-aims-to-deploy-200000-active-terminals-by-2022/">three months after he took the job</a> as country director and chairman of the board of Starlink India. Earlier today, Starlink India told customers that it will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/spacex-starlink-to-refund-india-government-order/">issuing refunds</a> to those who had preordered the device. [H/T: <a href="https://twitter.com/anmolm_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anmol Maini</a> of <a href="https://keepingupwithindia.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keeping Up With India</a> newsletter]</p>
<p>Elon Musk, SpaceX chief executive, welcomed Bhargava, a former PayPal executive, last year to Starlink India and tweeted that he &#8220;deserved a lot of credit for making X/PayPal succeed.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253032" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A SpaceX spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Starlink, which has shipped more than 100,000 terminals to customers, shared big ambitions for India last year. The company has plans to deploy over 200,000 active terminals in over 160,000 districts in India by the end of December 2022, Bhargava said earlier.</p>
<p>The firm began taking preorders for Starlink terminals in the country last year and over 7,000 people signed up. Starlink was working with local influential think tank Niti Aayog to identify districts in India to conduct trials for the device. During his short tenure, he engaged with several industry stakeholders to explore ways to collaborate.</p>
<p>In late November, the Indian government put the brakes on those efforts after it ordered Starlink to stop “booking/rendering the satellite internet service” in the country without first obtaining the license. Indian telecom regulator TRAI also asked Starlink to &#8220;desist from soliciting telecom business and collecting related fees&#8221; without securing the relevant authorizations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In its email to customers on Tuesday, Starlink said it had no clarity on the “timeline for receiving licenses to operate” in the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.powerfoyle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Powerfoyle</a> creates a material that harvests power from any light source, and <a href="https://www.mayht.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mayht</a> creates a new type of speaker driver. Smash the two together and you&#8217;ve got a Bluetooth speaker that can keep going long after you&#8217;ve rattled through your favorite playlists. The two companies showed off its prototype at CES this year.</p>
<p>Mayht&#8217;s Heartmotion technology replaces conventional drivers to create speakers 10 times more compact, a lot flatter and lightweight to boot. The company promises that this level of magic is achieved without compromising on sound quality, range or output.</p>
<p>“While consumer electronics have grown more powerful and compact in recent years, the core speaker technology within has hardly evolved over the past 100 years,&#8221; says Mayht Chief Executive Mattias Scheek. &#8220;I truly believe our Heartmotion speaker technology is the revolution the industry has been dreaming of, but never thought possible. They will finally be able to create the sound experiences people want from everyday consumer electronics and automotive audio systems.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250770" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In addition to fitting in a much smaller form factor with far lighter weight than conventional speaker technologies, the drivers require less power than comparable audio devices currently on the market offering similar performance. It&#8217;s a hell of a flex, then, to see the speaker tech married up with <a href="https://www.exeger.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exeger</a>&#8216;s Powerfoyle solar cell materials. These transform any type of indoor or outdoor light into energy. The solar-powered material can be used to create self-charging solar-powered products, and this prototype is one real-world example of how this tech might just show out there as a consumer product. Also at CES, <a href="https://www.bluetigerheadsets.com/bluetigersolare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Tiger Headsets showed off its Solare</a>, which is also powered by the same solar-charging tech.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meditation app <a href="https://www.calm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calm</a> has launched its first foray into physical activity with its new &#8220;Daily Move&#8221; short-form video series. The company says the new feature guides users through simple exercises to get them moving. The video series will be featured daily in the app. The activities feature elements from yoga, tai chi, Pilates, stretching, dance, walking and more. Each video is between three to five minutes in length and is designed to be performed at any point in a user&#8217;s day.</p>
<p>Calm says it aims to give users a way to form daily habits around physical activity that can be done in a few minutes. It notes that Daily Move is meant to give users a different kind of movement that focuses on a mind-body connection in a consistent and accessible way. Calm sees the new feature as an entry point into mindful content for people who find traditional meditation a difficult place to start.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not high-energy fitness, rather it’s a movement offering that is built on acceptance, gratitude, and self-love for your body,&#8221; said Mads Johnsen, the chief product officer at Calm, in an email to TechCrunch. &#8220;With gentle movement that can be done in a few minutes, at any point in your day, our hope is that the Daily Move allows Calm members to build a daily habit of fun and mindful movement to enhance joy in the present moment.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252517" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In a recent study conducted by Calm, the company found that people are engaging with the softer side of working out to improve their mental health, with walking and stretching rising to the top of their weekly activities, two and three times higher than high intensity workouts like cardio and weight lifting.</p>
<p>In terms of the future, Johnsen says Calm plans to &#8220;continue to evaluate new product offerings. We are always listening to our community to hear what our members want and how we can continue to bring value to their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>The launch of Daily Move comes as Calm recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/meditation-app-calm-introduces-new-family-plan-with-six-accounts/">introduced a new &#8220;Premium Family&#8221;</a> subscription plan that includes up to six accounts. The new offering is available globally for $99.99 per year, whereas a premium individual plan costs $69.99 per year. Members of a family plan don’t need to live in the same household, which is sometimes the case for family subscription plans offered by apps. All plan members get their own personal accounts that allow them to track their progress, celebrate personal milestones and select their favorite meditations and sleep stories.</p>
<p>Calm, along with other meditation apps, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/meditation-and-mindfulness-apps-continue-their-surge-amid-pandemic/">fared well during the ongoing pandemic</a> and seen a surge in users. In December 2020, Calm raised $75 million in Series C funding, pushing the company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/calm-raises-75m-more-at-2b-valuation/">valuation to $2 billion</a>. Prior investor Lightspeed Venture Partners led the round, which also saw participation from Insight, TPG and Salesforce CEO and new Slack owner Marc Benioff, among others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;ve seen no shortage of smart door locks over the years, but it seems as if the giants in the industry are starting to wake up to the future as well. At CES, keeping-the-doors-closed giant Schlage introduced its Schlage Encode Plus Smart WiFi Deadbolt, which introduces the ability to open your doors at a touch of your phone or Apple Watch.</p>
<p>The technology is built on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/ios-15-adds-all-the-little-features-that-were-missing/">Apple&#8217;s recent Home Key innovations, introduced in iOS 15</a>. The tech enables you to add a house key to your Apple Wallet, which uses NFT technology to communicate with the locks around you. A tap of your phone or Apple Watch (dramatically exclaiming &#8220;Open Sesame&#8221; or &#8220;Open Schlage&#8221; is presumably optional, although the company&#8217;s press release didn&#8217;t specify whether that was the case), and you&#8217;re in.</p>
<p>A lot of the advantages from the technology come from <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/unlock-your-door-with-a-home-key-iph0dc255875/ios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being able to distribute keys easily</a> &#8212; you can give a guest a temporary key to your home; for example if your dog walker needs to bring Fido back after you&#8217;ve had to run out for a cappuccino, or the plumber turns up earlier than expected and is threatening to leave unless they can get access to your place.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252023" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Schlage Encode Plus lock is among the first to support Apple’s latest enhancement to the HomeKit experience with home keys capability. I think it&#8217;s a welcome addition to the ecosystem; Schlage has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 years of lock-making experience</a>, and when it comes to smart home tech, it&#8217;s often easier to add smarts to products that work great in the first place, than building a whole product around a helping of Bluetooth and IoT chipsets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Throughout our 100-year history, we have remained committed to revolutionizing the user experience with convenient and secure home access our customers can trust,&#8221; said Dave Ilardi, general manager at Schlage, a brand of Allegion. &#8220;We’re excited about our collaboration with Apple that brings together two highly regarded brands with a history and reputation for delivering innovation to the connected home. The Schlage Encode Plus Smart WiFi Deadbolt provides homeowners with an even simpler and secure way to access their homes. This is just another step in our vision to create purposeful experiences that deliver simplicity and peace of mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cool thing is that the technology in question still works in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/09/apple-watchs-battery-life-could-be-its-achilles-heel/">&#8220;power reserve&#8221; mode</a>, which means that even if your phone or Apple Watch is on its last breath, it can still be used to open the doors for a few additional hours.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apart from the tap-to-open wizardry, the Schlage Encode Plus lock is pretty similar, features-wise, to the <a href="https://www.schlage.com/en/home/smart-locks/encode.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schlage Encode</a> Wi-Fi enabled lock; you&#8217;re still able to check whether your doors are locked, and lock/unlock from your phone. You can set up access codes from the app with certain time windows, so you can give someone access for a particular time slot with a certain code, whether permanent, temporary or recurring. The locks also keep real-time activity logs, so you can see which code has been used to open which lock, and when. The lock also supports Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa for lock control.</p>
<p>The tap to unlock feature is only available through Apple&#8217;s <em>home keys </em>feature, which is only available on iOS or Apple Watch devices, so Android users will have to make do without that feature for now, although of course they would be able to use Google Assistant or the Schlage app to control the locks.</p>
<p>The Schlage Encode Plus Smart WiFi Deadbolt will be available for purchase late this spring and will retail for $299.99.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cybersecurity breaches are at a high watermark, and so any company serious about expanding its credibility and business in enterprise IT has to continue investing in tackling it. To that end, Google is kicking off the new year by stepping up its operations in cloud-based and enterprise security. Today the company confirmed that it has acquired <a href="https://www.siemplify.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siemplify</a>, an Israel-based cybersecurity startup that specializes in end-to-end security services for enterprises, typically referred to as security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) services.</p>
<p>The acquisition was rumored in <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3926412,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier reports</a> in the Israeli <a href="https://www.themarker.com/technation/.premium-1.10513506?utm_source=App_Share&amp;utm_medium=Android_Native&amp;utm_campaign=Share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press</a>, and now <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/raising-the-bar-in-security-operations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.siemplify.co/blog/siemplify-is-joining-forces-with-google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siemplify</a>&#8216;s CEO and co-founder Amos Stern have both confirmed the acquisition, noting that Siemplify will be integrated into Google Cloud Platform, and specifically its <a href="https://chronicle.security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chronicle</a> operation.</p>
<p>Google and Siemplify did not respond to our questions asking about the price but our sources close to the deal have confirmed that it is $500 million (a figure also mentioned in the earlier reports).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252995" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Chronicle was originally founded as an enterprise security company with Google &#8220;X&#8221;, the company&#8217;s older moonshot effort. It migrated into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/chronicle-xs-security-moonshot-moves-to-google-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google itself by way of Google Cloud in 2019</a> as part of the search giant&#8217;s efforts to expand its enterprise revenues, by expanding the functionality and services around its cloud services business, in hot pursuit of Microsoft&#8217;s Azure and Amazon&#8217;s AWS, the two leaders in that market.</p>
<p>Siemplify had raised $58 million in total, with its last round back in May 2019. Investors included Georgian, 83North, Jump Capital and G20 Ventures, as well as a number of individuals. Although Siemplify has its head office now in New York, the company was founded and still has R&amp;D operations in Israel, which would make this Google&#8217;s first cyber acquisition out of the country.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s acquisition comes at a critical time in the world of cybersecurity. The bigger picture is that security breaches show no sign of abating, a situation that is being propelled by ever-more sophisticated approaches from malicious hackers; and an ever-more tempting target, as organizations and consumers bring more and more of their infrastructure and everyday activities online and into the cloud.</p>
<p>Chronicle was built as a platform designed for cybersecurity telemetry: specifically tracking the movement of data across all devices and networks, as a way of getting a clue to detecting and stopping breaches. SOAR platforms are the customer-interface element of that activity: they are used by security operations specialists to manage and monitor activity, begin the process of remediation (either automatically or manual) and to log everything to help prevent the same thing from happening in the future. As Google adds more services and automation to woo more customers, adding SOAR capabilities is the logical next step for the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The Siemplify platform is an intuitive workbench that enables security teams to both manage risk better and reduce the cost of addressing threats. Siemplify allows Security Operation Center analysts to manage their operations from end-to-end, respond to cyber threats with speed and precision, and get smarter with every analyst interaction. The technology also helps improve SOC performance by reducing caseloads, raising analyst productivity, and creating better visibility across workflows,&#8221; Sunil Potti, GM of Google Cloud Security, wrote in a blog post announcing the acquisition. &#8220;Our intention is to integrate Siemplify’s capabilities into Chronicle in ways that help enterprises modernize and automate their security operations.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Justworks released an updated IPO filing today, providing fresh financial results and a look at what the company may be worth when it debuts.</p>
<p>For those of you in search of a single number, using a simple share count, Justworks could be worth more than $2 billion at the top end of its current range.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But that&#8217;s hardly enough information. So this morning, The Exchange is going to calculate the company&#8217;s various simple and fully diluted valuation marks, run multiples using its most recent quarter&#8217;s results, and compare all the data to the firm&#8217;s final known private valuation.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220366 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>I had wanted to write up a 2022 IPO primer this morning, discussing the upcoming Reddit and Via IPOs, but that will have to wait a day. The Justworks <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001623414/000162828022000133/justworkss-1a1.htm">S-1/A filing is here</a>, if you want to follow along. Let&#8217;s talk SMB-focused HR software!</p>
<h2>Justworks&#8217; recent financial performance</h2>
<p>If you missed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/justworks-files-to-take-its-smb-focused-hr-themed-saas-business-public/">our first look into the Justworks story</a>, let&#8217;s catch you up: The company has two core business lines. The first, called subscription, is what Justworks charges for access to its service &#8212; things like &#8220;HR expertise, employment and benefit law compliance services, and other HR-related services,&#8221; per its filing.</p>
<p>The other, larger component of its top line is called &#8220;benefits and insurance-related revenue.&#8221; The former is pretty high margin, the latter less so.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the company did on an aggregated basis in its November 31, 2021, quarter:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252971" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252971" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2252971 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-8.26.05-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="154" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-8.26.05-AM.png 701w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-8.26.05-AM.png?resize=150,34 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-8.26.05-AM.png?resize=300,68 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-8.26.05-AM.png?resize=680,154 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-8.26.05-AM.png?resize=50,11 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2252971" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Justworks S-1/A filing</p></div></p>
<p>As you can see, Justworks posted fairly material growth on a year-over-year basis, and even better gains in terms of gross profit. If you are surprised that the company&#8217;s resulting gross profit is so small compared to its revenues, recall that Justworks is not merely a software company; its revenues include lots of that lower-margin &#8220;benefits and insurance-related revenue&#8221; that we noted above.</p>
<p>More simply, the company is in the SMB HR space, so its software unlocks customer activity that will not generate SaaS-like margins. Still, the company&#8217;s aggregate results detail growth and very limited losses. So we can note that the company&#8217;s revenue mix is different from what we see from most software companies while also not being rude about that fact.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Seoul Robotics, an AI-based perception software company, wants to turn first- and last-mile logistics hubs for automotive and trucking into mind hives, wherein one sensor tower controls the movements of a fleet, like a conductor of an orchestra, guiding hundreds of vehicles into place.</p>
<p>After two years of piloting its tech with BMW, the startup announced at CES its first commercial deployment with the German car manufacturer to automate fleet logistics at its manufacturing facility in Munich, deploying technology that it refers to as &#8220;autonomy through infrastructure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The vehicles that are guided by Seoul Robotics&#8217; newest product, the Level 5 Control Tower (LV5 CTRL TWR), are not autonomous themselves. All that is required of them is to have an automatic transmission and connectivity, according to HanBin Lee, CEO of Seoul Robotics.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252408" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A web of sensors and computers with Seoul Robotics&#8217; 3D perception software, &#8220;Sensr,&#8221; is strategically placed on infrastructure throughout a facility. That infrastructure then perceives information about the environment surrounding the vehicles, performs computations, makes predictions and sends commands to the vehicles themselves, which Lee said can be done today safely without a human safety operator or human in the loop at all.</p>
<p>At BMW, the LV5 CTRL TWR relies mainly on around 100 lidar sensors that have been placed through the facility, but Lee said in the future, the company wants to introduce cameras and radar for sensor redundancy.</p>
<p>Most autonomous vehicle companies are entirely focused on creating self-driving vehicles, complete with all their own sensors and onboard compute power that will enable a vehicle to drive in urban environments and on highways. At least for autonomous freight, those companies still require a human to take over at certain points, like navigating within logistics hubs or, in the case of BMW, moving newly manufactured vehicles from the assembly line to vehicle distribution centers.</p>
<p>Autonomous trucking company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/tusimple-completes-its-first-driverless-autonomous-truck-run-on-public-roads/"> TuSimple just successfully completed its first driver-out program</a>, driving on an 80-mile stretch of highway from facility to facility, but the startup still requires humans to manage certain operations on the ground. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/waymo-via-is-scaling-up-autonomous-trucking-operations-in-texas-arizona-california/">Waymo is building autonomous trucking hubs to facilitate its transfer hub model</a>, which involves a combination of automated and manual driving in which human drivers handle first- and last-mile deliveries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>LV5 CTRL TWR is not meant to be deployed on highways. Rather, it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>aims to fill in the gaps and cut costs for OEMs, trucking companies, car rental companies and potentially even airports at the first and last mile.</p>
<p>&#8220;The nature of the facility is that it&#8217;s a very tightly packed parking lot, and it&#8217;s a fleet of vehicles trying to drive around in this small facility &#8212; somebody needs to orchestrate it, somebody needs to be the control tower and make sure the vehicles are going into the designated spot at the right timing,&#8221; Lee told TechCrunch. &#8220;Even if those vehicles become autonomous one day, the Level 5 Control Tower is necessary because it&#8217;s a vehicle management system. Not to mention Level 4 and Level 5 is pretty far off, while this system is providing the benefit right away of basically being a robotaxi within a very confined space.&#8221;</p>
<p>OEMs, car rental companies and trucking companies dedicate thousands of employees to simply moving vehicles from Point A to Point B within their own facilities. Not only is this an unnecessary use of labor, but a lot of damage and accidents also occur when people &#8212; likely locals taking part-time gigs rather than highly trained drivers &#8212; drive in congested spaces, said Lee.</p>
<p>By providing information from multiple vantage points, like behind trucks and around corners, the sensor tower should eliminate blind spots, thus reducing collisions and creating a more reliable process, the company said.</p>
<p class="p1">One of the challenges companies creating Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) software run up against is latency issues. Out in the world, V2X controls are being shared with vehicles through public 4G and 5G LTE, but because Seoul Robotics operates on private grounds, like those owned and operated by BMW, it sends information on private networks where it can ensure bandwidth is dedicated to its own use cases. Besides, the vehicles at these facilities are only allowed to drive up to 13 miles per hour.</p>
<p>A perk of using advanced V2X to automate on private property is that there is no need to work with the government on securing driver-out permits, and almost no risk of vulnerable road users succumbing to an accident, according to Lee.</p>
<p>Another challenge V2X companies have faced in the past, particularly on public roads, is the cost associated with purchasing and installing hardware, but Lee said from a logistics standpoint, the unit economics work out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lidar is much cheaper nowadays, at only $1,000 to $2,000 per sensor, and the full deployment of the system costs a couple million dollars,&#8221; he said. &#8220;OEMs pay upfront for the hardware cost, so we don&#8217;t pay for hardware or installation, and once the system is installed, we&#8217;re basically being paid an installation fee and a licence-per-vehicle monthly fee. Because of the money they&#8217;re saving on labor and potential damage, their ROI can be as short as one or two years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other companies are working on similar technology. In 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/23/daimler-and-boschs-driverless-parking-feature-can-legally-operate-without-human-supervision/">Bosch and Daimler joined forces to pilot automated valet parking</a>, and Lee said there are a number of startups that have yet to publicly announce their tech but that also bid for the BMW gig.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://twitter.com/JessicaNamKim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jessica Kim</a>, chief executive officer of </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.ianacare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ianacare</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, understands these statistics deeply as she made the difficult choice to leave her job in 2016 to care for her mom full time, as do nearly a third of working caregivers. Kim co-founded ianacare in 2018 after spending more than seven years caring for her mom during a cancer battle.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Today, caregiver support is the most overlooked gap in healthcare and employee benefits. As per the National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC) <a href="https://www.caregiving.org/caregiving-in-the-us-2020/#:~:text=The%202020%20update%20reveals%20an,compared%20to%20five%20years%20ago" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a>, about 61% of caregivers are women, while 39% are men. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252846" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“For far too long, caregiving has been treated as an individual issue, and we’ve asked people to make the choice to either work or care for their families. We cannot authentically discuss keeping women in leadership or the workforce at large without addressing their care need,” Kim said. </span></p>
<p>The Boston-based startup built a platform that provides tech-enabled caregiver support through employers and health plans. Its mission is to encourage, empower and equip family caregivers with resources and communities, so no one has to do it alone.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ianacare announced this morning it has raised a $12.1 million Series A funding led by </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.greycroft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Greycroft</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> with participation from 8VC, SemperVirensVC, Able Partners and Brown Alumni Group. Previous backers, including Slow, Founder Collective, Indicator Venture, Entrée Capital and CueBall also made follow-on investments in the round. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The fresh capital, which gives ianacare a total of $16.7 million raised to date, </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">will be used to scale sales, the internal team and operations needed to meet the rising demand of companies looking to support family caregivers in their workforce. Ianacare currently has seven full-time employees and will expand the team to more than 25 by the end of this year.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“For caregivers, ianacare is the front door to all the different types of support they will need in the home environment,” Kim said in an email interview. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Through its free mobile app, users can organize and mobilize friends and family onto one team for easy coordination of everyday tasks, such as dropping off groceries, picking up medication from the pharmacy, providing respite care and more, Kim said. This feature, also known as personal social circles, is available to download for all consumers and is used nationwide, even if their employer is not currently an enterprise partner, Kim added.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The startup works with employers and institutions to offer a cost-effective and scalable enterprise solution as a benefit to working caregivers. Its enterprise solution, launched in March 2021, covers more than 400,000 lives through existing partnerships with employers like </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.anthem.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Anthem</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, an insurance company. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;As we look ahead to launching with some of the nation&#8217;s largest employers in 2022, we are on track to grow to cover more than 1 million lives,&#8221; Kim said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To differentiate itself from other companies in the space, ianacare&#8217;s solution provides “unlimited access of online chat, phone, video with professional caregiver coaches,” which is just one of the five layers of support it offers, Kim said. Also, the platform is a one-stop shop solution, connecting family caregivers to all the layers of support personalized for their specific home, work and care situation. It can detect gaps in care and proactively fill those needs with resources available to the caregiver and care recipient, Kim continued. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252874" style="width: 503px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252874" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2252874" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ianacare_Mockup-update-categories-No-Appoint-Medic.png?w=287" alt="ianacare" width="493" height="516" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ianacare_Mockup-update-categories-No-Appoint-Medic.png 1699w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ianacare_Mockup-update-categories-No-Appoint-Medic.png?resize=144,150 144w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ianacare_Mockup-update-categories-No-Appoint-Medic.png?resize=287,300 287w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ianacare_Mockup-update-categories-No-Appoint-Medic.png?resize=768,802 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ianacare_Mockup-update-categories-No-Appoint-Medic.png?resize=651,680 651w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ianacare_Mockup-update-categories-No-Appoint-Medic.png?resize=1470,1536 1470w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ianacare_Mockup-update-categories-No-Appoint-Medic.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ianacare_Mockup-update-categories-No-Appoint-Medic.png?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2252874" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ianacare / ianacare app</p></div></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“There are so many activities built into the care plan that fall to family caregivers &#8212; like medication management, transportation to and from appointments, managing dietary needs. Creating a true infrastructure of care in the home environment requires access, knowledge and guidance,” said Steven Lee, COO and co-founder of ianacare. “What we realized was that thousands of resources and services already exist, but they are highly fragmented and difficult to find. The power of technology allows us to bring large systems together, enable simpler connection and coordination and deliver highly personalized experiences at scale.”  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The scalability of the ianacare platform has remained a focus and will become increasingly important in order to meet the fundamental increase in care happening in the home, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The ranks of family caregivers are on pace to exceed 75 million Americans over the next 10 years; ianacare calculated the figure based on the rates of growth in caregiving in these </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.caregiving.org/caregiving-in-the-us-2020/#:~:text=The%202020%20update%20reveals%20an,compared%20to%20five%20years%20ago" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">stats</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> &#8212; growing at more than 10 million every five years. There would be a tremendous impact on the U.S. healthcare system, society, culture and workplace without proper support structures, the company said. </span></p>
<p>Family caregivers, with an average age of 59, have higher rates of anxiety, depression and disturbed sleep than non-caregivers, according to a report by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/21/health/coronavirus-home-caregivers-elderly.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a>. The startup claims that those with access to ianacare’s platform reported an 83% increase in productivity, a 30% decrease in stress and burden and 96% reported feeling supported by their employer, in a recent study of working family caregivers at Anthem conducted by Healthcore.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“For the last several years, we’ve had a strong thesis that the caregiving space was ripe for innovative impact. When we saw the comprehensive nature of ianacare’s platform and the passion behind the founders’ personal experiences, we knew they were the right team to lead this incredible transformation,” said partner of Greycroft, Ellie Wheeler, who will join the ianacare board to support its next phase of growth. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brands like Muzak have made a big business out of building catalogues of licensed audio content for commercial venues &#8212; the infamous &#8220;elevator music&#8221; &#8212; and today a company that&#8217;s aiming to do the same for video has picked up a big round of funding as its business continues to see strong momentum, despite the many dampeners brought on public life from the COVID pandemic. <a href="https://atmosphere.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atmosphere</a>, which creates and streams ad-supported, free licensed video channels &#8212; often without any sound &#8212; for broadcast in public places like bars, restaurants and doctors&#8217; offices, has raised $100 million &#8212; $80 million in the form of a Series C and a further $20 million in debt.</p>
<p>Sageview Capital is leading this round, with Valor Equity Partners and S3 Ventures also participating. Valor &#8212; the VC that has backed the likes of SpaceX and Gopuff, and several media tech startups like Reddit and esports startup Cloud9 &#8212; led Atmosphere&#8217;s <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/atmosphere-closes-25-million-series-b-investment-from-valor-equity-partners-301275396.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series B round of $25 million</a> less than a year ago, in April 2021. Bridge Bank is providing the $20 million debt facility.</p>
<p>Atmosphere isn&#8217;t disclosing its exact valuation but Leo Resig, the co-founder and CEO, tells me it&#8217;s &#8220;not quite a unicorn, but we are close.&#8221; (In other words, in the high hundreds of millions.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252925" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This would be a big step up for Atmosphere, which has now raised $140 million after spinning out from Chive Media (the video content platform) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/23/atmosphere-series-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2019</a> and was, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/266979-43/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a>, valued at $275 million in April 2021.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s also coming on the heels of strong growth in what might have otherwise been challenging times for the company and its particular business model. Resig told me that in the last year, it has more than doubled its customer footprint to 19,000 (it was 9,000 business venues a year ago), and it now streams some 250,000 hours of content daily to some 20 million unique viewers. Resig said that it&#8217;s getting 215,000 impressions per advertisement, &#8220;comparable to a TV rating.&#8221; That is a lucrative comparable: the TV ad market is a $70 billion opportunity today, he added.</p>
<p>Its mix of content, meanwhile, is not exactly comparable with what you might get from a cable subscription: it sources and curates video from third-parties (some unknown and some well-known brands like Red Bull, with one very big name coming to its screens later this week); and it combines that with content that it creates itself (such as a new news format). Virtually all of it is sound-free and captioned with summary text on screen.</p>
<p class="p11">&#8220;One hundred percent of the content we stream is audio optional,&#8221; Resig said. He added that more than 99% of the venues that use its services had already been broadcasting TV with the sound off anyway, so that is what it set out to create with its own channels: video content that can be engaging without the sound on, by default. &#8220;Like any good business, we find a problem and fix it.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The opportunity for Atmosphere (and for its investors) is in tapping that gap in the market, with the belief that companies creating content want to find new users, and they will be willing to consider the Atmosphere format as part of that effort.</p>
<p>In addition to a big social media brand that Atmosphere is announcing as a partner later this week, the company said that it&#8217;s in conversation with a number of others, including professional sports organizations, to build channels of their own on the Atmosphere platform.</p>
<p>Atmosphere has identified an interesting disparity in how media is streamed in public places. Much like music, video streaming requires specific licensing when it is used in commercial venues, and as such paid TV in those environments &#8212; when it is being used legally &#8212; works out as a more expensive subscription than it would be for a consumer using it in a private home.</p>
<p>That economic premium represented a prime opportunity to Atmosphere: create TV content specifically for public venues, and price it significantly cheaper than basic paid TV &#8212; free, in fact, supported instead by ads &#8212; and package it up with hardware that it supplies (Apple TV, although business customers can use their own if they already have it), so that it can be plugged into a TV in the venue. (Note: there is a $99 activation fee when customers first sign on, so not totally free.)</p>
<p>Along with the economic model, Atmosphere also rethought what venues wanted in their spaces, too: the lack of sound and keeping the content short and watchable without being distracting turns out to fit perfectly with how people tend to watch media in public places.</p>
<p>Atmosphere&#8217;s initial push was to sell to bars and restaurants, although that business has unsurprisingly seen a lot of setbacks in the last two years with COVID-19. The company in that period decided to diversify and sell to other kinds of venues, such as doctors&#8217; and other offices, as well as other public places like gyms, where people typically might have to spend time waiting for something, or doing something that doesn&#8217;t take all their concentration or needs a distraction. That turned out to be a growing market: today some 60% of Atmosphere&#8217;s customers are still bars and eateries (which ideally will also come back into growth as the pandemic hopefully subsides), but the other 40% is a wide mix of others. Current customers include Meineke Car Care, Burger King and Texas Roadhouse.</p>
<p class="p11">“We were impressed with Atmosphere’s unique strategy for connecting advertisers with hyper-focused markets. We believe their capabilities will be well-received among advertisers and businesses that adopt the service,” said Dean Nelson from Sageview, in a statement. “Given the company’s proven business model and strong growth, we’re excited to partner alongside Atmosphere at a stage when scaling its operation is most critical.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p class="p11">Atmosphere is not the only game in town for these kinds of services: the company behind Muzak, which is now called <a href="https://us.moodmedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mood Media</a>, also has branched out into video solutions, among a number of others targeting people outside the home. The proposition remains a compelling one for the platform that can not only make it as easy as possible to integrate with a business&#8217;s existing infrastructure, but finds a way to make it profitable for everyone involved. For Austin-based Atmosphere, it has squared away how to address the former, but the latter remains a question: Resig, who co-founded the company with his brother John, confirmed that Atmosphere has yet to make a profit; the projection is that the funding and further scaling will lead there, too.</p>
