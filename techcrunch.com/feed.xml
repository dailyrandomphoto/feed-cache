										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even though the only thing the robot can do right now is pull weeds, <a href="https://www.aigen.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aigen</a> is adamant it isn&#8217;t building a weed-whacking robot. It claims to be on a mission to terraform the earth, and says it has a path toward making agriculture carbon positive. It must have made a compelling argument, because it just announced a $4 million seed round led by <a href="https://www.nea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NEA</a>, with participation from <a href="https://agfunder.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AgFunder</a>, <a href="https://www.globalfounderscapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Founders Capital</a> and <a href="https://regen.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReGen Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>The company is building solar-powered, autonomous robots that can zoom around in fields, using computer vision to tell friend from foe and plant from weed. In its first incarnation, the robot &#8212; in a fine &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACmydtFDTGs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hot dog / not hot dog</a>&#8221; impersonation &#8212; simply bumbles about, covering up to three acres of farmland per day.</p>
<p>&#8220;My relatives are farmers in Minnesota, and I&#8217;ve been talking with them for quite some time. They&#8217;re really experiencing some trouble with traditional agriculture approaches. Even the diehard people that love chemicals, that love tilling the earth and other practices that have been releasing carbon in the atmosphere for thousands of years are starting to realize, hey, maybe we should be open to other ways to do this,&#8221; reflects Richard Wurden, CEO at Aigen. He is particularly passionate about throwing agriculture&#8217;s carbon output in reverse. &#8220;Right now, agriculture is about 16% of carbon emissions. In the future, it has the potential to go negative, by reducing diesel emissions, soil compaction, chemical usage and reducing tilling.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258249" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The basic premise the startup makes is that overall, photosynthesis is carbon negative: Plants take CO<sub>2</sub> from thin air and turn that into sugars &#8211; &#8211; carbohydrates, to be exact. In effect, the plants are taking carbon out of the air and sticking it back into the earth. Aigen argues that by changing technology and the ways agriculture is done, carbon neutrality &#8212; or even negativity &#8212; is within reach. The weed-picking robot is merely the first step along the company&#8217;s path, the founders claim &#8212; create something that has real value now, in order to expand the platform and fulfill more and more of its mission further down the line.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are collecting data through images. There&#8217;s multiple cameras on the robot, and we are using an AI onboard that we&#8217;ve pre-trained to identify plants and various objects. Once we know what we are looking at, we either remove or propagate the plants with two robot arms underneath the robot,&#8221; explains Kenny Lee, the company&#8217;s COO, making an argument for the company&#8217;s smaller, lighter robots. &#8220;Heavy machinery compresses the soil, which means that the roots grow sideways, instead of down. That&#8217;s a problem, because you can&#8217;t put the carbon the plants capture deep into the ground. By using fewer tractors and large commercial devices, you can change how agriculture works.&#8221;</p>

(It is unclear whether the robot actually has a horn or a whistle, so that sound effect is entirely a fiction of your correspondent&#8217;s imagination.) <strong>Image Credits: </strong>Aigen</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Aigen’s technology leverages best-in-class AI and robotics to provide an elegant solution to several of humanity’s biggest problems,&#8221; said Andrew Schoen, partner at NEA,&#8221; Their product unlocks nature’s superpower to sequester substantial amounts of atmospheric carbon at planetary scale.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company declined to disclose the valuation of its fundraise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Supply chain issues continue to have a major impact on smartphone manufacturers per <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/canalys-global-smartphone-market-Q4-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly released figures</a> from analyst firm Canalys &#8212; global shipments grew only 1% year over year in the final quarter of 2021. The numbers come on the tail of<a href="https://canalys.com/newsroom/worldwide-smartphone-sales-q3-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Q3 reports</a>, which saw an overall drop of 6%, citing similar issues over component supply.</p>
<p>The firm also factors in a resurgence of COVID-19, courtesy of the omicron variant, which has sent a number of locals into shutdown reminiscent of the pandemic’s early days roughly two years ago. Canalys notes that this impact is greatest among the smaller manufacturers in the market, who have had the greatest issues finding new suppliers.</p>
<p>“Component manufacturers are eking out additional production, but it will take years for major foundries to significantly increase chip capacity,” the firm’s Mobility VP Nicole Peng said in a statement tied to the new figures. “Smartphone brands are already innovating to make the most of their circumstances, tweaking device specs in response to available materials, approaching emerging chipmakers to secure new sources for ICs, focusing product lines on the best-selling models and staggering new product releases.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258805" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2258807" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2258807" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2258807" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-18-at-11.09.43-AM.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="758" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-18-at-11.09.43-AM.jpg 1666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-18-at-11.09.43-AM.jpg?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-18-at-11.09.43-AM.jpg?resize=300,222 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-18-at-11.09.43-AM.jpg?resize=768,569 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-18-at-11.09.43-AM.jpg?resize=680,504 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-18-at-11.09.43-AM.jpg?resize=1536,1138 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-18-at-11.09.43-AM.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2258807" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Canalys</p></div></p>
<p>Larger companies remain less impacted overall by shortages and bottlenecks. The quarter also saw Apple return to the overall top spot in the global market, after three quarters away. The company’s rise is attributed to the success of the iPhone 13 and an extremely solid performance in Mainland China &#8212; the world’s largest smartphone market.</p>
<p>Apple’s overall marketshare ticked up from 12% to 23% of the market since last quarter. The previous drop owed in part, to the company’s trouble meeting demand in a number of regions in recent quarters.</p>
<p>“Apple’s supply chain is starting to recover, but it was still forced to cut production in Q4 amid shortages of key components and could not make enough iPhones to meet demand,” says analyst Sanyam Chaurasia. “In prioritized markets, it maintained adequate delivery times, but in some markets its customers had to wait to get their hands on the latest iPhones.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Samsung, meanwhile, dropped to second, from 23% to 20% of the total market. Chinese manufacturers Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo rounded out the top five for Q4.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Automaker Ford and ADT, a company that provides home and business security and alarm monitoring services, have launched a joint venture called Canopy that aims to address vulnerabilities in current vehicle security offerings.</p>
<p>Canopy will initially offer an aftermarket accessory that can be mounted onto a vehicle to monitor its surroundings and alert drivers of issues like theft or vandalism.</p>
<p>While built-in vehicle alarm systems help deter some thefts, they&#8217;re by no means foolproof. <a href="https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-auto-theft" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In 2020, the FBI estimated that $7.4 billion was lost to motor vehicle theft</a>, which includes both the theft of vehicles themselves and their contents. Canopy&#8217;s product, which has been operating in pilots over the past 10 months with trucking companies in the U.S. and cargo vans in the U.K., aims to combine Ford&#8217;s vehicle camera systems expertise with ADT&#8217;s monitoring service to help commercial and retail customers avoid vehicle theft.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258584" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Canopy is ADT&#8217;s first foray into automotive security, and is a product of FordX, the automaker&#8217;s new venture incubator that collaborates with other companies to quickly build, acquire and pilot new transportation technologies. In 2018, FordX worked on Jelly, a dockless e-scooter sharing company, which was the basis for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/07/ford-buys-electric-scooter-startup-spin/">Ford&#8217;s acquisition of Spin</a>. Canopy appears to be the next step in Ford&#8217;s strategy to expand its portfolio of scalable mobility solutions outside of its traditional business lines.</p>
<p>Canopy&#8217;s self-sticking accessory works with any vehicle make or model and is expected to be sold online and at various brick-and-mortar stores by early 2023. It relies on a stack of sensors, including camera, radar and acoustic sensors, to collect data about the vehicle&#8217;s surroundings. An operating system independent from the car&#8217;s own then processes the data, and shares back to cloud servers via LTE or WiFi. Any possible thefts will be reported to the vehicle owner via a mobile app or to one of ADT&#8217;s 5,000 monitoring agents, according to Leah Page, VP of mobile security and strategic projects at ADT.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you think about the element ADT brings to the product, it&#8217;s really about helping to bring in AI solutions,&#8221; Page told TechCrunch. &#8220;So that&#8217;s knowing the difference between a bird going by and somebody breaching the cargo bed of your truck to steal something. Once that event happens it does come into ADT and then our monitoring agents know how to react. That can be anything from just alerting the owner or an emergency contact all the way through to alerting the police, depending on the situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Down the line, Canopy intends to release another monitoring system that integrates into any car&#8217;s hardware and relies on that vehicle&#8217;s cameras and sensors to perform the same safety features. Ford will be Canopy&#8217;s first integration, but the aim is to make all of Canopy&#8217;s tech available to any automaker.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In order to make this offer really meaningful to customers, we had to do it in a way that was multi-make and would enable us to address the security concerns for the vehicles that are already out on the road today,&#8221; Christian Moran, director of FordX and interim CEO of Canopy, told TechCrunch. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking at one solution that can run across a myriad of trucks and vans, which are our target vehicles to start in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Canopy initially set out with a focus on commercial customers, thinking of both large fleets carrying priceless cargo and small business owners who have thousands of dollars worth of tools and equipment in the beds of their trucks and are often the victims of theft. That&#8217;s still going to be the first target for rollout beginning early next year. Throughout the pilots, however, use cases for the average consumer started to come up, as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got tremendous feedback from people who put bikes or kayaks in the back of their truck or van while going out on the trail, and those items are very expensive so they want them to be protected,&#8221; said Moran. &#8220;In addition, although this was not one of our original features, we heard from a number of pilot participants that one of their favorite features was actually livestreaming around their vehicle when it was dark out at night. So imagine walking into a dark, empty parking lot and you can use the app to see around your vehicle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the course of the pilots, Canopy ended up turning over evidence to vehicle owners of two different theft attempts, said Moran, adding that customers could use Canopy&#8217;s footage to work with police and insurance companies.</p>
<p>Together, Ford and ADT have invested a total of $105 million in the JV, with Ford chipping in $63 million and ADT $42 million. The money will be used to hire across the product, engineering and go-to-market teams in the U.K. and the U.S., as well as setting up the supply chain and logistics for the aftermarket product so it can scale over the next few years.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We talked about the future of work with former Microsoft senior executive and angel investor Eric Boustouller, who joined French multi-stage VC firm C4 Ventures last fall.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With tech companies such as Meta once again <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-return-to-office-delay-march-2022-023508939.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">postponing workers&#8217; return to the office</a>, it is clear that remote work will be a big part of our world in 2022 and beyond. This makes &#8220;future of work&#8221; a hot topic among investors, but that means different things to different people.</p>

<p>To get a better understanding of what kind of opportunities &#8220;future of work&#8221; encompasses from an investor perspective, The Exchange called on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericboustouller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eric Boustouller</a>, who joined French multi-stage VC firm <a href="https://c4v.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C4 Ventures</a> last fall.</p>
<p>An industry veteran whose former roles include presiding over Microsoft in Western Europe and being CEO of Solocal, Boustouller also has a track record as an angel investor, with a sweet spot for B2B SaaS.</p>

It is the last that we discussed at length with him. What follows is a selection of topics from our conversation, edited for length and clarity.</p>
<h2>&#8216;Future of work&#8217; is not entirely new</h2>
<p><strong>Eric Boustouller: </strong>Some 15 years ago, at Microsoft, we were talking about &#8220;the new world of work.&#8221; It has now become &#8220;the future of work.&#8221;</p>
<p>You may remember how a few years ago, then-CEO Steve Ballmer was calling out the so-called &#8220;consumerization of IT.&#8221; What was it all about? It was just that at the time, it became clear, and it&#8217;s even more obvious now, that people at work and consumers want the same tools at home and in the office. That was a disruption: It was no longer the IT department that was driving the show anymore, but the users themselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last August, Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/twitter-report-misinformation/">introduced</a> a new feature in select markets, including the U.S., that invited users to report misinformation they encountered on its platform &#8212; including things like election-related or Covid-19 misinformation, for example. Now the company is rolling out the feature to more markets as its test expands. In addition to the U.S., Australia, and South Korea, where the feature had already gone live, Twitter is rolling out the reporting option to users in Brazil, Spain, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>The company also offered an update on the feature&#8217;s traction, noting that the company has received more than <a href="https://twitter.com/yoyoel/status/1483094056347443202">3.7 million</a> user-submitted reports since its debut. For context, Twitter has around 211 million monetizable active daily users, as of its most <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Final-Q3'21-Shareholder-letter.pdf">recent earnings</a>, 37 million of which are U.S.-based and 174 million based in international markets.</p>
<div>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/yoyoel/status/1483094056347443202">Yoel Roth</a>, Twitter&#8217;s head of site integrity, the &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of content the company takes action on for misinformation is identified proactively through automation (which accounts for 50%+ of enforcements) or proactive monitoring. User-submitted reports via the new feature, however, Twitter to identify patterns of misinformation &#8212; an area where Twitter has seen the most success so far from the feature, Roth says. This is particularly true in areas like non-text-baed misinformation like media and URLs that link to content hosted off Twitter&#8217;s platform.</div>
<div></div>
<div>But he also noted that when Twitter reviewed a subset of individual reported tweets, only around 10% were considered &#8220;actionable&#8221; compared with 20-30% in other policy areas, as many tweets analyzed didn&#8217;t contain misinformation at all.</div>
<div></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today we&#39;re expanding this test feature to folks tweeting from Brazil, Spain, or the Philippines. Till now we&#39;ve received around 3M reports from you all, calling out Tweets that violate our policies &amp; helping us understand new misinformation trends. </p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258788" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Stay tuned for more to come. <a href="https://t.co/wB3P66Dl1Q">https://t.co/wB3P66Dl1Q</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1483076718730649607?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In markets where the feature is available, users can report misinformation by clicking the three-dot menu in the upper-right of a tweet, then choosing the &#8220;report tweet&#8221; option. From there, they&#8217;ll be able to click the option &#8220;it&#8217;s misleading.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Twitter already offered a way to report violating content on its platform before the addition of the new flagging option, its existing reporting flow didn&#8217;t offer a clear way to report tweets containing misinformation. Instead, users would have to pick from options like &#8220;it&#8217;s suspicious or spam&#8221; or &#8220;it&#8217;s abusive or harmful,&#8221; among others, before further narrowing down how the specific tweet was in violation of Twitter&#8217;s rules.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The ability to flag tweets as misinformation allows users to more quickly and directly flag content that may not fit into existing rules, as well. But the reports themselves are tied into Twitter&#8217;s existing enforcement flow, where a combination of human review and moderation is used to determine if a punitive action should take place. Twitter had also said the reported tweets would be sorted for review based on priority &#8212; meaning tweets from accounts with a large following or those showing higher levels of engagement would be reviewed first.</p>
<p>The feature is rolling out at a time when social networks are being pressured to clean up the misinformation they&#8217;ve allowed to spread across their platforms, or risk regulation that will enforce such cleanups and perhaps even enact penalties for not doing so.</p>
<p>The flagging option is not the only way Twitter is working to fight misinformation. The company also runs an experiment called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/twitter-starts-rolling-out-birdwatch-fact-checks-inside-tweets/">Birdwatch</a>, which aims to crowdsource fact-checking by allowing Twitter users to annotate misleading tweets with factual information. This service is still in pilot testing and being updated based on user feedback.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two of the world&#8217;s largest e-commerce players <a href="https://jdcorporateblog.com/jd-com-and-shopify-ink-strategic-partnership-to-simplify-cross-border-e-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are joining joined hands</a>. Major Chinese online retailer JD.com has formed a strategic partnership with Ottawa-based Shopify to help global brands tap China&#8217;s enormous appetite for imported goods, as well as helping Chinese merchants sell overseas.</p>
<p>The news is turning heads in China&#8217;s cross-border e-commerce community. The first part of the deal will put the JD-Shopify alliance in direct competition with Alibaba. The JD nemesis has a sprawling import business, which counted 35,000 international brands<a href="https://www.alizila.com/chinas-gen-z-lead-demand-for-imports-on-alibabas-tmall-global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> as of late</a>. Last year, over 6,000 brands entered China via Alibaba.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hUibYAIIAt"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/05/alibaba-acquires-netease-kaola-in-deal-worth-2-billion/">Alibaba acquires NetEase Kaola in deal worth $2 billion</a></p></blockquote><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258720" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Alibaba acquires NetEase Kaola in deal worth $2 billion&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/05/alibaba-acquires-netease-kaola-in-deal-worth-2-billion/embed/#?secret=hUibYAIIAt" data-secret="hUibYAIIAt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>JD has been importing goods into China for years, but the existing brand onboarding process can take as long as a year. JD, often described as the Amazon of China for its heavy investment in logistics, will create a fast track for Shopify-powered brands to start selling to JD&#8217;s 500 million active buyers in as soon as four weeks. The platform will use tools like automated translation and price conversation to get sellers ready and will be flying goods via its fleet of cargo flights between the U.S. and China to start with.</p>
<p>JD doesn&#8217;t only intend to help brands market and sell in China. The company has also rolled out a neat supplier sourcing service for Shopify store owners called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhYJwnVDnc&amp;ab_channel=JDWorldwideApps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JD Sourcing</a>. Sellers will submit a product request via JD Sourcing, and once JD confirms the product is available in its inventory, the Chinese e-commerce company will get it to one of its overseas warehouses, ready to be listed on Shopify stores and sent to consumers via drop-shipping.</p>
<p>The other part of the deal, which is to bring Chinese goods overseas via Shopify&#8217;s direct-to-consumer solution, competes in a very crowded space. Amazon has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/chinese-products-get-pulled-from-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">building itself up as a gateway for Chinese exporters</a>, employing an army of staff in the country to scour and manage merchants. While Amazon&#8217;s recent crackdown on fake reviews has sent shockwaves through China&#8217;s e-commerce industry, the Seattle-based titan remains a highly attractive channel for exporters, thanks to its market dominance.</p>
<p>To cope with stricter platform policies, many Amazon sellers are increasingly investing in product design and branding. Others choose to take up acquisition offers from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/markai-china-amazon-aggregator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand aggregators, also called Amazon roll-ups</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The JD-Shopify collaboration could offer a new alternative for Chinese exporters. Shopify has long been an option for those that want to amplify their brands, but autonomy comes with more work, requiring sellers to be more hands-on with marketing and logistics fulfillment.</p>
<p>Through the Shopify partnership, JD promises to &#8220;simplify access and compliance for Chinese brands and merchants looking to reach consumers in Western markets&#8221; and support them to &#8220;set up their DTC channels through Shopify.&#8221; Cross-border shipping will be taken care of by JD.</p>
<p>The two e-commerce giants appear to complement each other nicely &#8212; Shopify brings the range of products and JD offers its extensive global warehousing and shipping infrastructure. It&#8217;s an alliance worth watching.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">The airline industry claims a “catastrophic” event could unfold on Wednesday when AT&amp;T and Verizon activate their new C-Band 5G networks. In a letter obtained by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-major-us-airline-ceos-urge-action-avoid-catastrophic-5g-flight-2022-01-17/?taid=61e5bf0cd96d620001fd8b5b&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>, the CEOs of several prominent passenger and cargo airlines, including Delta, United and Southwest, warn interference from 5G cell towers could affect the sensitive safety equipment on their planes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless our major hubs are cleared to fly, the vast majority of the traveling and shipping public will essentially be grounded,&#8221; they state in the letter, which was sent to the heads of the White House Economic Council, Federal Aviation Administration and Federal Communications Commission, as well as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. &#8220;Immediate intervention is needed to avoid significant operational disruption to air passengers, shippers, supply chain and delivery of needed medical supplies.&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>The airlines have asked that AT&amp;T and Verizon not offer 5G service within 2 miles of some of the country’s busiest and most vital airports. They’re also urging the federal government to ensure “5G is deployed except when towers are too close to airport runways until the FAA can determine how that can be safely accomplished without catastrophic disruption.&#8221; The agency <a href="https://www.engadget.com/faa-5g-buffer-zones-airports-133305569.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">established 5G buffer zones</a> at 50 airports on January 7th.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258760" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The letter is the latest development in the ongoing back and forth between the airline and wireless industries. AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Verizon spent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-c-band-spectrum-auction-225551917.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><ins>nearly $80 billion</ins></a> at the start of 2021 to secure the repurposed C-Band spectrum the FCC had put up for auction. In November, AT&amp;T and Verizon agreed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-verizon-delay-c-band-5g-due-to-faa-164549890.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1"><ins>delay</ins></a> their C-Band rollouts to January 5th to help the FAA address any interference concerns.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Los Angeles-based sports training platform Mustard this week announced a $3.75 million round. Led by Lake Nona Sports &amp; Health Tech Fund, this latest raise follows a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/04/mustard-raises-1-7m-to-improve-athletic-mechanics-with-ai/">$1.7 million round</a> back in late-2020, bringing the firm’s funding-to-date up to $6 million.</p>
<p>New investors this time out are Mark Cuban, OneTeam Partners, Ronnie Lott, Justin Rose, the Major League Soccer Players Association and the United States Women&#8217;s National (Soccer) Team Players Association, joining a list of existing investors that includes big name athletes like quarterback Drew Brees and pitching legend Nolan Ryan.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are so many young athletes out there who could be future Olympians, MLB pitchers, or high school state champions in whatever sport they&#8217;re passionate about,&#8221; Brees said in a statement offered up to TechCrunch. &#8220;For me, that was football. Unfortunately, many young athletes lack access to the type of coaching I received. I believe Mustard truly levels the playing field, making elite training accessible and affordable for young, aspiring athletes, and I&#8217;m proud to support their mission.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257791" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2258109" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2258109" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2258109" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Rocky-and-Tom.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Rocky-and-Tom.jpg 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Rocky-and-Tom.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Rocky-and-Tom.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Rocky-and-Tom.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2258109" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mustard</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The expanded roster of investors comes as the firm looks to expand its coaching offerings beyond baseball &#8212; the root of its…quirky name (i.e. “put a little mustard” on a pitch). The list of additional sports includes golf, soccer and football. Golf seems like an easy enough jump from baseball, in terms of offering feedback to an athlete executing a move from a relatively stationary position. The company says part of the funding will go toward hiring additional team members to help them expand the offering.</span></p>
<p>“Our new investors bring force-multiplying experience and connections across all major American sports,” CEO Rocky Collis said in a release. “As we expand our platform to include additional major sports beyond baseball, athletes everywhere will be able to learn their personal recipe for improvement, regardless of their resources.”</p>
<p>Mustard’s sensor-free approach to data capture is what it hopes will set it apart from other offerings. The technology is a relatively low barrier of entry on this front, using a smartphone camera to collect mechanics of a given movement through a team that includes a number of former Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM) employees. From there, the app offers feedback, in the form of a &#8220;report card.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brooklyn-based Upward Farms this week unveiled plans to launch a massive 250,000-square-foot vertical farm. Set for an early-2023 opening, the site will be located in Northeastern Pennsylvania’s Luzerne County. It’s a massive footprint for a vertical farm &#8212; particularly for a category that prides itself on limited land use. The roughly six acres of land puts the farm at multiple times the size of the competition’s space. The location is Upward’s third farm.</p>
<p>The farm will specifically focus on microgreens &#8212; a popular choice for indoor farming, due to its flexibility and limited spatial requirements versus other crops. Rather than the hydroponic or aeroponic growing method used by most of the competition, Upward relies on aquaponics, a looped system that utilizes fish to grow plants through the production of natural fertilizer.</p>
<p>The interesting twist to the system is that the company also sells its farm-grown bass. In December, the company announced that &#8212; in addition to selling produce at select New York Whole Foods locations &#8212; it would begin selling striped bass at Greenpoint Fish and Lobster in Brooklyn.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258143" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>“With this new facility, we’ll be able to reach some of the most populous areas of the US, and nearly 100 million Americans, within a single day of distribution versus the week it can take to receive products from the west coast,” co-founder and CEO Jason Green said in a release. “This is a local success story with massive global implications for how and where food is grown, and the next generation of manufacturing technology.”</p>
<p>After getting up and running, Upward plans to begin sales from the farm in early 2023. The company, which raised a $121 million Series B last year, also plans to expand to additional markets in the coming year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Using a mobile phone app, a farmer can assign a job to one of the tractors, like mowing the field.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://agtonomy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agtonomy</a> co-founder and CEO Tim Bucher was born and raised on a farm and was deep into his own farming business when he took a computer course while at UC Davis and got hooked.</p>
<p>It was that parallel agriculture/technology career that led him to start Agtonomy, a hybrid autonomy and tele-assist service startup that turns tractors and other equipment into autonomous machines to provide a low-cost, technology-enabled labor force for local farms to manage such equipment.</p>
<p>It came out of stealth mode last September with $4 million in seed funding from a group of backers that included Grit Ventures, GV and Village Global.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258220" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Grit and GV came back again to invest in the South San Francisco-based company and were part of a $5 million seed extension, led by Toyota Ventures, with participation from Flybridge, Hampton VC, E²JDJ and Momenta Ventures. The latest funding gives Agtonomy $9 million in total funding to date.</p>
<p>Having just raised funding, Bucher wasn’t expecting to raise again so soon, but when he saw the outlook for 2022 that agtech was going to be the No. 1 “hot area” for the year and beyond, he decided to take the additional funding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Five years ago, it was hard to get any VC attention related to agtech, but there has just been overwhelming interest from investors, and though we are just starting out, local agriculture needs help now,” he added. “The funding will accelerate our trials and additional partners and essentially turbo-charge our activities and ability to double down at the speed in which we are moving, which includes expanding the team.”</p>
<p>Bucher anticipates having 50 trials going and to double the company’s 20-person headcount in the next few months.</p>
<p>Agtonomy is as simple as calling an Uber driver, he said. Using a mobile phone app, a farmer can assign a job to one of the tractors, like mowing the field. He believes self-driving technology like this, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/john-deeres-self-driving-tractor-arrives-later-this-fall/">what other companies like John Deere are doing</a>, will help to alleviate the decades of labor shortages in farms around the world.</p>
<p>The company has a small fleet of what he called “proof of concept” electric vehicles that have been operating for a year at Bucher’s Trattore Farms. He says the farm work on his farm is almost entirely done with these vehicles.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;John Deere’s self-driving tractor arrives later this fall&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/john-deeres-self-driving-tractor-arrives-later-this-fall/embed/#?secret=nEhXueKdsI" data-secret="nEhXueKdsI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Bucher expects a commercial launch to happen in 2023, and the company will initially start with a few hundred tractors. In comparison, some 300,000 tractors are sold each year, he added. The tractors can be anywhere from $500,000 to $1 million, with companies like John Deere typically going after big farms.</p>
<p>In contrast, Agronomy’s autonomous vehicles will cost around $50,000, which Bucher believes will encourage larger farms to purchase a swarm of smaller machines that can run 24 hours a day, be more environmentally friendly and not tear up the land.</p>
<p>Jim Adler, the founding managing director of Toyota Ventures and an executive advisor at Toyota Research Institute, said in a written statement that “fully autonomous vehicles will become a reality on farms where they are more desperately needed much more quickly than they will on city streets.”</p>
<p>Similarly, Bucher believes that many of the autonomous vehicles today cater to more “convenience technologies,” while companies in the agtech space are building similar vehicles in what he calls “necessity technology.”</p>
<p>“It is kind of a perfect storm with consumer demand, climate change, electrification and labor shortage in farming,” he added. “We can solve these much sooner in agtech than having the other kinds of autonomous technology in our lives. With ours, it allows all of us to eat good food.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.getclockwise.com/">Clockwise</a>, a time management and smart calendar tool, has raised $45 million in Series C funding led by Coatue, with participation from Atlassian Ventures and existing investors Accel, Greylock Partners and Bain Capital Ventures. This latest round brings the company&#8217;s total amount of funding raised to $76 million. Clockwise uses artificial intelligence to help teams free up their workdays and avoid the challenges associated with remote and hybrid workplaces, such as burnout.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2016 by Gary Lerhaupt, Matt Martin and Mike Grinolds. The trio met while working at RelateIQ, a company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/11/salesforce-buys-big-data-startup-relateiq-for-up-to-390m/">Salesforce bought for $390 million</a> in 2014. They found that they shared a common goal, which was to create a way to give people more time for focused work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clockwise is the solution to the modern workday,&#8221; Clockwise CEO Matt Martin told TechCrunch in an email. &#8220;Clockwise optimizes your team&#8217;s schedules to create more time in everyone&#8217;s day — so we can feel present when we&#8217;re working together and focused when we&#8217;re working on our own. We enable a new way of working that genuinely respects people&#8217;s time and helps create a healthy, sustainable future of work.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257723" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Since the platform&#8217;s launch in 2018, Clockwise has rescheduled 4,000,000 flexible meetings. It has also created more than 2,000,000 hours of uninterrupted &#8220;Focus Time&#8221; for teams. Focus Time is a feature that helps users visualize how much time they have for focused work by automatically creating a block in their calendars. Clockwise has optimized calendars for more than 10,000 organizations, including Netflix, Twitter, Coinbase, Atlassian, Asana and Airtable.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2257742" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257742" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2257742" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/clockwise_product_onboarding_focus-time-sync.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/clockwise_product_onboarding_focus-time-sync.png 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/clockwise_product_onboarding_focus-time-sync.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/clockwise_product_onboarding_focus-time-sync.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/clockwise_product_onboarding_focus-time-sync.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/clockwise_product_onboarding_focus-time-sync.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/clockwise_product_onboarding_focus-time-sync.png?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/clockwise_product_onboarding_focus-time-sync.png?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/clockwise_product_onboarding_focus-time-sync.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257742" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clockwise</p></div></p>
<p>Clockwise currently competes with several other smart calendar and scheduling tools such as <a href="https://calendly.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=2074601018&amp;utm_term=calendly&amp;utm_content=80202694281&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA24SPBhB0EiwAjBgkhlAOFEvIYl9iCTbGdj33xBB_wo-25OHoh9hKrF5fzncDpiM6At6MdBoCIYEQAvD_BwE">Calendly</a>, <a href="https://doodle.com/en/">Doodle</a>, <a href="https://reclaim.ai/">Reclaim</a> and more. Martin says Clockwise differs from other smart calendar platforms because the company is creating a new category it calls &#8220;time orchestration,&#8221; a modern way to bring schedules together at the organizational level.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re in the early days of this category, so we mainly compete with people who don’t realize that their attempts to optimize their individual workday can negatively impact their teammates&#8217; productivity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The magic of Clockwise is that we orchestrate companies&#8217; workdays, running up to one million calendar permutations for any given team to create the best possible schedule for everyone.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Clockwise will use this latest investment to advance its AI technology and continue to bring its platform to more teams across the globe. The company is hiring across all of its departments, with 25 open positions and another 100 openings planned for this year.</p>
<p>In terms of the future, Martin says Clockwise will continue to grow and expand to find more ways to free up people&#8217;s workdays. He says although Clockwise is currently only designed to manage internal meetings, the platform could dramatically improve the broader scheduling experience in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re investing in advanced AI and ML models to both create Focus Time and power high-quality meetings,&#8221; Martin said. &#8220;Clockwise has a lot of exciting new products and enhancements ahead, including bringing this new way of working to the hundreds of millions of people using Microsoft 365.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clockwise&#8217;s Series C investment follows its $18 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/19/clockwise-ceo-matt-martin-how-we-closed-an-18m-series-b-during-a-pandemic/">Series B</a> funding round announced in June 2020. The round was led by Bain Capital Ventures.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Late last year, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-reportedly-stepping-down-from-twitter-ceo-role/">stepped down</a> from his position in order to give his full attention to his other company Square,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/square-is-changing-its-name-to-block/"> now called Block</a>, which had become increasingly invested in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency &#8212; just like Dorsey himself. Now we&#8217;re starting to see the results of Block&#8217;s embrace of crypto, as this morning Cash App announced it&#8217;s integrated with the Lightning Network, allowing its U.S. users to send bitcoin for free to anyone worldwide.</p>
<p>The feature had been slowly rolling out to Cash App customers <a href="https://blockworks.co/cash-app-integrates-lightning-network-for-bitcoin-payments/">before</a> today, but Cash App had not yet made a formal announcement. The company says the rollout is expected to complete over the &#8220;coming weeks,&#8221; reaching all U.S. Cash App customers.</p>
<p>Once live, Cash App users will be able to send bitcoin internationally to any external compatible wallet, including those for family or friends or a self-managed wallet, like <span id="m_-2547697169449701502gmail-docs-internal-guid-46ae0d90-7fff-4d8b-4c23-3298da80600c"><a href="https://chivowallet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://chivowallet.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1642553699191000&amp;usg=AOvVaw028gej59uUBXZpEkhABwOj">Chivo Wallet</a>, </span><span id="m_-2547697169449701502gmail-docs-internal-guid-c477eabe-7fff-aa05-f3e9-bf1907a1196e"><a href="https://bluewallet.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bluewallet.io/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1642553699191000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2bD1DIO9cNU0VuEPpsLYVC">BlueWallet</a>, or </span><span id="m_-2547697169449701502gmail-docs-internal-guid-09010419-7fff-df37-1418-b14ac92c6627"><a href="https://muun.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://muun.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1642553699191000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3X7A3w8LQKj5qDL9-7RzZn">Muun Wallet</a>, for example. Users will also be able to send bitcoin to any merchant that accepts Lightning Network payments, with zero fees. While this isn&#8217;t yet a mainstream activity, a few merchants have begun to accept Lightning payments, allowing customers to do things like <a href="https://ln.pizza/">order a pizza over the Lightning Network</a> or <a href="https://www.bitrefill.com/buy">buy gift cards</a>. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258742" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span id="m_-2547697169449701502gmail-docs-internal-guid-09010419-7fff-df37-1418-b14ac92c6627">The Lightning Network&#8217;s integration into Cash App could also help to empower the growing creator economy, as fans could send bitcoin to show their support for an individual creator or cause if they accepted Lightning payments. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2258750" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cash-App-Lightning-Network.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="484" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cash-App-Lightning-Network.png 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cash-App-Lightning-Network.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cash-App-Lightning-Network.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cash-App-Lightning-Network.png?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cash-App-Lightning-Network.png?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cash-App-Lightning-Network.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Cash App explains the advantages of this system, noting that typical Bitcoin network transactions can take some time to process and see higher fees, compared with Lightning Network &#8212; whose name is meant to convey its speedier capabilities. Its transactions also take place independently of the blockchain (off-chain), <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/what-is-the-lightning-network-in-bitcoin-and-how-does-it-work">which helps</a> to reduce the fees, time, and energy usage that would otherwise be involved. But the Lightning Network will still benefit from the blockchain&#8217;s technology and decentralization, as the transactions taking place on the network are later consolidated and recorded to the main Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<p>Dorsey himself had demonstrated interest in the Lightning Network, <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1092892320842706944">tweeting</a> back in 2019 that it was a &#8220;cool example&#8221; of the experimentation taking place among #BitcoinTwitter users. More recently, Block&#8217;s bitcoin-focused company, Spiral, <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/jack-dorseys-spiral-announces-the-lightning-dev-kit">presented</a> its Lightning Development Kit (<a href="https://lightningdevkit.org/">LDK</a>) which offers a way to easily integrate bitcoin payments into any application. The new Lightning integration on Cash App is also powered by Spiral&#8217;s LDK &#8212; and Cash App is also the first and largest payments app to integrate with LDK at this time, the company notes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The rollout of LDK is also an example of Block&#8217;s strategic vision in action, where one arm may build the tools that are adopted by other Block-owned businesses.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Rather than just sales teams using it, the company saw marketing and customer success teams adopt the technology, too.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After securing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/sales-experience-platform-walnut-raises-15m-to-improve-product-demonstrations/">$15 million Series A</a> in August, <a href="https://www.walnut.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walnut</a>, a company that creates sales and marketing demo experiences, is back to announce its new round of $35 million in Series B financing.</p>
<p>Walnut’s no-code platform enables teams to create customized product demonstrations quickly, be able to integrate them into their sales and marketing processes and then generate insights from the demos.</p>
<p>Since the Series A, the company grew a staggering 700% in annual recurring revenue, co-founder and CEO Yoav Vilner told TechCrunch. It is now working with nearly 100 SaaS customers, including Adobe, Dell, Medallia, NetApp, Treasure Data, Funnel, People AI and ContractBook.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258208" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Right after we published the announcement, we got a lot of interest from investors,” Vilner added. “We had been trying to cope with the demand that we had, and so my original plan was to raise later on, but with the way we were continuing the pace, felt that this could be the right timing. Three months between rounds is unusual, but what we were building was definitely ready for more money.”</p>
<p>Felicis Ventures is leading the latest round that gives the company $56 million in total funding to date. Vilner says the firm’s name was one he kept hearing over and over, and he and co-founder Danni Friedland were interested in Felicis’ fund for SaaS and software, thinking it would be the right fit.</p>
<p>Joining Felicis are existing investors NFX, Eight Roads Ventures and A Capital and a group of strategic angel investors, including Salesforce president and CMO Sarah Franklin, Okta co-founder Frederic Kerrest, TripActions co-founder and CEO Ariel Cohen and Papaya Global co-founder and CEO Eynat Guez.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable Walnut to grow its team in the U.S., Europe and Israel from 55 to closer to 100, Vilner said. In addition, the company will focus on technology and product development.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We will finally be able to meet the demand and grow our manpower across countries and build a wider platform to help the sales funnel at different touchpoints,” he added. “We are building a new category that doesn’t really even have a name yet, but our goal is revolutionizing the sales space.”</p>
<p>Felicis general partner Viviana Faga and vice president Jake Storm are lead investors in the round and say they are calling what Walnut is doing “sales experience,” and that the company is helping go-to-market teams interact with customers. That became harder during the global pandemic when people weren’t as interested in speaking with sales people, Faga said.</p>
<p>She believes it was the right time for a tool, like Walnut’s, so that companies could ramp up their demos. And, rather than just sales teams using it, the company saw marketing and customer success teams adopt the technology. As a result, Storm sees Walnut riding two waves: a push for more efficient sales enablement and bottom-up growth.</p>
<p>“When we met Yoav and Danni, we knew that they were going to build a huge team, and after we saw the waitlist of users begging to use Walnut, we knew it was the solution needed in the world,” Faga added.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Gaming giant Activision Blizzard, under the gun from investors over sexual harassment controversies and ongoing executive turmoil, has pulled the escape cord: the company has agreed to be acquired by Microsoft in a $68.7 billion all-cash deal, inclusive of the company&#8217;s net cash.</p>
<p>Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has been <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/activision-blizzard-ceo-might-step-154146773.html">rumored to step down</a> amid ongoing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/blizzard-sec-investigation/">SEC investigations</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680">sexual harassment scandals</a> in his company, which employs nearly 10,000 people (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-26/activision-blizzard-staff-sign-petition-supporting-labor-lawsuit?sref=gni836kR">more than 2,000</a> current and former employees signed a letter last year calling the company&#8217;s responses to a discrimination lawsuit &#8220;abhorrent and insulting,&#8221; and more recently,<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/11/18/activision-employees-petition-kotick-resignation/"> over 1,000</a> employees signed a petition calling for Kotick&#8217;s resignation.) The Wall Street Journal reported that Kotick <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680">knew for years</a> about sexual misconduct and rape allegations at his company, but he did not act. Yet with this acquisition, Microsoft says that Kotick will remain CEO. As a whole, Activision Blizzard will report to Microsoft Gaming CEO and Head of Xbox Phil Spencer.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a company, Microsoft is committed to our journey for inclusion in every aspect of gaming, among both employees and players,&#8221; Spencer wrote in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2022/01/18/welcoming-activision-blizzard-to-microsoft-gaming/">blog post</a> this morning, implicitly addressing the ongoing unrest at Activision Blizzard. &#8220;We also believe that creative success and autonomy go hand-in-hand with treating every person with dignity and respect. We hold all teams, and all leaders, to this commitment. We’re looking forward to extending our culture of proactive inclusion to the great teams across Activision Blizzard.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258746" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If Kotick remains at the helm, it&#8217;s not likely that the news of this acquisition will assuage workers&#8217; concerns. Activision Blizzard employees have staged<a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/blizzard-activision-lawsuit-walkout-controversy-explained"> several walkouts</a> protesting not just the ongoing sexual misconduct scandals, but also, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/01/17/warzone-bugs-raven-qa-strike/">layoffs</a> of quality assurance contractors for &#8220;Call of Duty.&#8221; Jessica Gonzalez, a Senior Test Analyst, announced her resignation in late November after making a name for herself as one of the loudest internal voices for a change in the company, emerging as a leader in its <a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK">ABetterABK</a> workers alliance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your inaction and refusal to take accountability is driving out great talent and the products will suffer until you are removed from your position as CEO,&#8221; Gonzalez <a href="https://twitter.com/BlizzJess/status/1465714592189849613">wrote</a> in a resignation message in Blizzard&#8217;s internal Slack, which she shared on Twitter. &#8220;This may seem harsh, but you had years to fix the culture and look at where the company currently stands.&#8221;</p>
<p>In November, Spencer <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-26/activision-blizzard-staff-sign-petition-supporting-labor-lawsuit?sref=gni836kR">wrote in an email</a> to Xbox staff that he was “evaluating all aspects of our relationship with Activision Blizzard and making ongoing proactive adjustments&#8221; in light of the allegations against the company. In a conversation with the New York Times last week &#8212; before news of the Activision Blizzard acquisition was known &#8212; Spencer was asked about his company&#8217;s relationship with the besmirched gaming giant.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t about, for us as Xbox, virtue-shaming other companies,&#8221; Spencer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/10/opinion/sway-kara-swisher-phil-spencer.html?showTranscript=1">said</a>. &#8220;Xbox&#8217;s history isn&#8217;t spotless.&#8221; At a Microsoft party at the 2016 Game Developers Conference, the company hired schoolgirl dancers, exemplifying the same <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/activision-blizzard-sued-by-california-over-frat-boy-culture">&#8220;frat boy&#8221; culture</a> that&#8217;s caused so much <a href="https://kotaku.com/activision-blizzard-sued-by-california-over-widespread-1847339746">strife</a> women across the gaming industry. &#8220;That was a painful moment in our history of Xbox,&#8221; Spencer added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This deal will make Microsoft the third-largest gaming company in the world by revenue, per their own </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://news.microsoft.com/2022/01/14/microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard-to-bring-the-joy-and-community-of-gaming-to-everyone-across-every-device/">press release</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, falling behind Tencent and Sony. Activision Blizzard is home to mega-franchises like &#8220;World of Warcraft,&#8221; &#8220;Call of Duty&#8221; and &#8220;Candy Crush,&#8221; while Microsoft Gaming produces Xbox consoles. Microsoft says it will include Activision Blizzard games in its cloud gaming subscription Game Pass, which recently reached 25 million subscribers. Meanwhile, Activision&#8217;s games boast nearly 400 million monthly active users.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>This acquisition isn&#8217;t Microsoft&#8217;s only several-billion-dollar deal in recent memory. In late 2020, Microsoft announced its plans to acquire ZeniMax Media Inc., parent company to Bethesda Game Studios and other publishers, which produced popular games like &#8220;Edler Scrolls,&#8221; &#8220;Doom&#8221; and &#8220;Fallout.&#8221; So, the purchase of Activision Blizzard could raise concerns in the Department of Justice about Microsoft creating a gaming monopoly. Meta, for example, is currently facing an antitrust suit regarding its growing VR business. But ironically, this acquisition might give Meta a bit more competition in the virtual reality space.</p>
<p>“Gaming is the most dynamic and exciting category in entertainment across all platforms today and will play a key role in the development of metaverse platforms,” said Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO, Microsoft.</p>
<p>This purchase &#8212; which values Activision Blizzard at $95 per share, above its market rate &#8212; is expected to close in 2023, though the boards of both Microsoft and Activision Blizzard have approved the transaction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">User onboarding has been a longstanding and persistent challenge in the world of apps. Developers grapple with design and technical constraints; publishers and users might have different priorities when it comes to engaging with a service; the content of those services is changing all the time; and perhaps most of all, people are all different and so their experiences with an app will be, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.appcues.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Appcues</a> &#8212; one of the startups building technology both to identify onboarding issues and then providing low-code, non-technical solutions to fix them quickly &#8212; is today announcing a $32.1 million Series B round. The funding is a sign not just of the demand in the market for more tools to address all of this, but of Appcues&#8217; traction in doing so.</p>
<p>“Product experience matters more than ever. Yet it can still take weeks to get something live in your product,” said Jackson Noel, co-founder and CEO of Appcues, in a statement. The company claims that its tools can deliver insights and user onboarding fixes for customers in hours.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258731" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Series B is being led by NewSpring, with new backer Columbia Partners and previous investors Sierra Ventures and Accomplice also participating. Boston-based Appcues plans to use the funding for product development and to expand internationally. It has raised just under $48 million to date. From what we understand, the valuation is in the region of $200 million-$300 million.</p>
<p>The funding is coming alongside strong growth. Appcues says that it now has some 1,500 customers &#8212; they include Freshworks, FullStory, Lyft, Zapier, Kaplan, Hopin, Pluralsight and Vidyard &#8212; and that its cloud-based platform to date has served almost 2 billion experiences to more than 200 million users.</p>
<p>Appcues has been around <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/23/appcues-now-backed-by-1-2m-lets-anyone-personalize-a-product-experience-without-writing-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2014</a>, when it got its start as a SaaS toolset for marketers to create quick prompts on sites without having to involve developers in the process, with a specific emphasis on user onboarding flows. The company&#8217;s product today also covers flows to improve feature adoption, to nudge people to take feedback surveys, and to get visitors to read announcements but is still built on the same premise: giving non-technical people the ability to create dialogues to improve how their digital interfaces work.</p>
<p>The process starts with an SDK that can either be installed as a line in an app&#8217;s codebase or integrated by way of Segment. This tracks events on the site, and that becomes the basis for how it works.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The SDK is key to how Appcues works, Noel said in an interview: &#8220;It feels like a native extension, not an external app,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our goal is to triple down on that area and helping our users create the best product experiences.&#8221; He said this also differentiates it from others in the same general field, who might be focusing on app flows, or employee training or something else.</p>
<p>Appcues&#8217; users &#8212; they can be UX people, product managers, interactive marketers, or yes developers &#8212; can now access this data by way of a Chrome extension to see what&#8217;s working as intended, and what is not, on their apps or sites; and they can start to build new events or flows in response to these. Different flows and events can be created for different segments of users, depending on where they are coming from into an app; or how they are already using it. Users can then track how well these new flows and events are working, and tweak them, or add new flows, as needed.</p>
<p>User experience arguably is even more important today than it has ever been before: not only do people have shorter attention spans for things that work badly (we are all spoiled for choice when it comes to digital services); but companies are working with more and more complexity and putting a lot of eggs into their digital baskets, which are often the only platforms being used to engage with customers. Getting something wrong here can make or break a business in ways that didn&#8217;t exist before.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s no surprise that there are a number of companies also building technology to address this, and that doing so can be very big business. Others include WalkMe (which is now <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-16/insight-backed-walkme-falls-in-debut-after-287-million-ipo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public</a>), <a href="https://www.pendo.io/news/pendo-raises-150-million-to-help-companies-deliver-software-that-meets-rising-user-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pendo</a> (now also en route to an IPO), and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/whatfix-nabs-90m-to-help-workers-onboard-and-get-the-most-out-of-their-it-stacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whatfix</a> (which is more focused on organizations&#8217; internal user onboarding) and many more.</p>
<p>One notable part of Appcues&#8217; toolset is that it&#8217;s aimed at non-technical users; but the other is its focus on analytics: this both helps users of its app get a better picture of what issues there might be, and for whom; as well as to identify whether their attempts to fix it are working&#8230; or not.</p>
<p>And it seems that no matter how advanced or numerous the tools to fix user onboarding, the simple need for them in the first place is not going away, and is only getting more critical.</p>
<p>“Over the past five years, we’ve witnessed a shift where a software company’s product experience has become the number one lever to their business success,” said Marc Lederman, co-founder and general partner at NewSpring, in a statement. “We’re incredibly excited about the impact Appcues provides for its customers and look forward to supporting Jackson and the Appcues team on this next stage of growth.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Fairplay provides a sales advance as funding in exchange for a flat fee and a steady revenue share of earnings until the capital is paid back.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mexican revenue-based investment startup <a href="https://getfairplay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairplay</a> secured $35 million in Series A funding to invest in the online marketing campaigns of direct-to-consumer e-commerce brands and marketplace sellers in Latin America.</p>
<p>The investment round consists of $15 million in equity, co-led by Dila Capital and Kayyak Ventures, and participation from Speedinvest and Elevar Equity, and $20 million in debt led by Architect Capital. Existing investors in the round also included QED Investors, Nazca and several individual investors, including Kavak CEO Carlos García, Jüsto CEO Ricardo Weder and ZeBrands CEO Carlos Salinas. In total, the company has raised $40 million.</p>
<p>Fairplay co-founder and CEO Manolo Atala started the company with Andrew Devlyn in 2019. He told TechCrunch that small business owners often have to choose between putting money into their inventory, logistics or marketing campaigns, and a wrong choice could have significant impact on the company’s growth. Those who do invest in marketing usually put a majority of their spend into channels like Google or Facebook, he added.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258237" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Traditional loan options are often long and complex processes that could tie a business owner to aggressive guarantees, Atala said. Looking to make the choice easier for entrepreneurs reliably earning sales, Fairplay provides a sales advance as funding in exchange for a flat fee and a steady revenue share of earnings until the capital is paid back. Rather than give the money to the client, the company pays the client&#8217;s providers directly.</p>
<p>Aside from leveraging the debt, the new funding will go toward growing Fairplay’s headcount. Atala expected to double its 38 employees in the next few months.</p>
<p>The company is working with a wide range of clients &#8212; for example, small companies selling $15,000 per month up to large DTC companies selling $10 million per month. The average investment Fairplay makes is about $85,000, Atala said.</p>
<p>“Most of the money goes to inventory because the cycle from when you order to when you start selling a product is around 45 to 60 days,” he said. “By providing this capital, we are helping e-commerce companies shorten the cycle to avoid cash flow constraints.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/ecommerce/mexico#revenue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mexican e-commerce market</a> is poised to reach $45 million in 2022, and Atala says Fairplay is also seeing that growth. The company’s third quarter of 2021 was the best in its history, growing 250% in originations over the second quarter and more than 200% in revenue. He was expecting two-digital growth in the fourth quarter and a five-fold growth in 2022.</p>
<p>QED Investors partner Mike Packer, who is on Fairplay’s board, says the company is in the middle of a “megatrend” that is affecting e-commerce infrastructure in Latin America. He saw Fairplay’s early traction two years ago and has been watching Atala and Devlyn build out their team with a talented pool of people, create the product and test their hypothesis.</p>
<p>“We are seeing a current explosion that has been pulled forward five-plus years into one year of growth,” Packer said. “All of the commerce and transactions moved online, while growth was happening, the infrastructure was lacking. We see massive opportunity to enable businesses to run more smoothly, and Fairplay is in the middle of that.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic hasn&#8217;t been easy for anyone, but the food service industry has been hit <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/aliciakelso/2022/01/14/most-independent-restaurants-experienced-a-sales-decrease-of-more-than-50-in-december/?sh=6404cf885fa8">particularly hard</a>. More than <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/omicrons-affect-restaurant-industry-shows-dire-restaurant-relief/story?id=82248396">90,000 restaurants</a> and bars have closed, leaving workers unemployed in an already precarious industry. And those who kept their jobs faced the stressful demands of customer-facing work in a pandemic.</p>
<p>In response to the changed industry landscape, food service veterans are launching their own businesses, whether they&#8217;re delivering take-out meals in their neighborhood or mailing cans of kombucha around the country. &#8220;People tell them that they make great cakes, or that their sourdough is better than everybody else&#8217;s, or their hot sauce is amazing,&#8221; explained Castiron founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markjosephson/">Mark Josephson</a>. &#8220;And they dream of selling and building a business, but they end up spending 75% of their time on things other than what they&#8217;re good at.&#8221; He&#8217;s talking about everything that isn&#8217;t cooking: building a website, keeping track of finances and other administrative tasks.</p>
<p>So, he created <a href="http://castiron.me">Castiron</a>, an e-commerce solution for independent chefs. Today, Castiron announced a $6 million seed funding round from Bowery Capital, Foundry Group and High Alpha. A veteran of the tech industry, Josephson is a three-time CEO &#8212; he previously helmed outside.in, which sold to AOL, later leading Bit.ly for seven years &#8212; but Castiron is the first company he&#8217;s founded.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258304" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Launched in October, Castiron provides its users (which it calls &#8220;food artisans&#8221;) with customizable e-commerce websites, which include dynamic inventory management, order fulfillment tools, newsletter and marketing tools and more. Castiron doesn&#8217;t start making money until the food artisan makes money &#8212; then, the platform takes 10%, plus a standard 2.9% + $0.30 payment processing fee.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2258311" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/castiron-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="394" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/castiron-2.png 4768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/castiron-2.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/castiron-2.png?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/castiron-2.png?resize=768,445 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/castiron-2.png?resize=680,394 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/castiron-2.png?resize=1536,889 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/castiron-2.png?resize=2048,1186 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/castiron-2.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;In deciding to start this company, it was important to me after having done five, six or seven different startups that with this one, we were truly aligned with our customers. So I only want to be successful if our customers are successful,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;Our customers are risk averse, so it&#8217;s important that we have a no-risk product for customers to try.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right now, Castiron only operates in the United States, where laws pertaining to home food businesses (cottage food laws) vary from state to state. But given the increasing rate of unemployment since the onset of the pandemic, many states have <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2021/10/29/pandemic-prompts-officials-to-relax-rules-on-home-businesses">made it easier</a> to legally run independent food businesses. Currently, Josephson estimates that about 40% of Castiron&#8217;s users run local delivery businesses, 40% sell products for pickup, and 20% ship their goods out. He said that &#8220;several hundred&#8221; users have set up shop on Castiron, but that this seed round will help fund a hiring push to scale the business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This push of entrepreneurs who are building small businesses is a huge part of our economy going forward,&#8221; Josephson noted. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been in media, digital media, software marketing, and there&#8217;s nothing like this. And like, honestly, I have boxes of chocolate chip cookies, and roasted coffee beans, and biscotti, and sourdough, and hot sauce showing up at my house. It&#8217;s like, what&#8217;s what&#8217;s wrong with that? What could be better?&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hot bowl of pad thai simmers in front of you. The taste and texture is exactly what you might expect from a quick takeout dinner, but it&#8217;s not just a meal – it’s medicine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This hypothetical bowl of pad thai, would be part of a cancer-fighting regimen created by startup Faeth Therapeutics. The meal itself would be specifically tailored to “starve your tumor” (which has been genetically scrutinized by scientists already), and work in combination with established cancer drugs and therapies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This “precision nutrition” approach to cancer treatment is admittedly  new, but Faeth therapeutics, founded in 2019, is hoping to be the first to bring this approach into the clinic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What really led to the founding of the company is three independent groups of world class scientists, each realizing that we were basically ignoring a massive part of human biology and the treatment of cancer,” Anand Parikh, founder and CEO of Faeth Therapeutics tells TechCrunch. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258591" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I jokingly call this the Manhattan Project of cancer biology. They were each approaching this problem differently, but  landed on this idea that we have to change nutrition for cancer patients in order to not only potentiate existing therapeutics, but also to help develop new ones that target these nutrient vulnerabilities.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.faeththerapeutics.com/">Faeth Therapeutics</a> announced a $20 million seed round on Tuesday</span><b>. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This represents the 15-person company’s first round of external financing. The round was co-led by Khosla Ventures and Future Ventures. It also includes participation from S2G Ventures, Digitalis, KdT Ventures, Agfunder, Cantos and Unshackled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first things to notice about Faeth Therapeutics is the scientific team behind it. Faeth’s cofounders include: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siddhartha Mukherjee, author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Emperor of All Maladies </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(winner of a <a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/siddhartha-mukherjee">2011 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction</a>) and an oncologist at Columbia University; Lewis Cantley, director of Weill Cornell’s Meyer Cancer Center and discoverer of the PI3K signaling pathway, and Karen Vousden, Chief Scientist of Cancer Research UK, and Group Leader at the Francis Crick Institute. Vousden is known for her work on the p53 tumor suppressor protein. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cantley and </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrc2715"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vousden</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in particular, have been some of the first to deeply probe the connection between metabolism and cancer treatment. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrclinonc.2018.28"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PI3K</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a cell signaling pathway that affects cell metabolism, growth, survival and proliferation, but is often dysregulated in cancer patients. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are drugs that look to target this pathway, however Cantley’s work suggests that some patients end up with hyperglycemia, which might end up triggering this dysregulated pathway anyway. Instead, he has shown that lowering insulin levels through </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6197057/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dietary interventions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help avoid that re-activation, and aid the drug&#8217;s performance. For example, </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0343-4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a mouse study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed that placing mice on a keto diet (low-carb, high fat) could reduce glycogen stores and prevent spikes that might be hampering the drug’s effectiveness.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the preclinical research has been intermittently promising, but still requires a lot more work (as Mukherjee <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/magazine/its-time-to-study-whether-eating-particular-diets-can-help-heal-us.html">notes</a> in his own op-ed describing Cantley’s work).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But Parikh notes that there’s still a lot of room to improve this research, and approach nutrition based medicine in a more targeted way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think what a lot of people have done is say: keto diet, glioblastoma, let’s go. But there’s a layer deeper than that,” he says. [Note: the keto diet has also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6589986/">been deployed</a> in certain glioblastoma cases]. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If a person has pancreatic cancer, we&#8217;ve figured out that the way that a pancreatic tumor works, you may have higher needs for certain nutrients. In this case, maybe amino acids. And what we do is we create diets that are depleted in those particular amino acids.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A big part of Faeth’s mission, adds Parikh, is to use this funding to expand and deepen research in this area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nutrition and health are clearly linked, and nutrition </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5181206/#:~:text=Conclusion%3A%20Adherence%20to%20a%20high,overall%20mortality%20in%20this%20population."><span style="font-weight: 400;">does have an impact</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on cancer outcomes. But this is an area of research that can draw some well-deserved skepticism. When it comes to diet and health, it can be easy to fall from scientific fact, into myth territory pretty easily. Critically, this research isn’t touting a “miracle diet” or a “diet-based cure” for cancer. Rather the company is aiming to interrogate how nutrition can become a “fifth pillar” of cancer care through scientific study. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faith is already gearing up three trials that will look to interrogate the connection emerging from preclinical research.  </span><a href="http://v"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A metastatic pancreatic cancer trial combining</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a reduced amino acid diet with a gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">chemotherapy regimen is in development. The company also </span><a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05183295?term=Faeth+Therapeutics&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has another trial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aimed at metastatic colorectal cancer. Finally, a trial on insulin-suppressing diets will be posted on clinicaltrials.gov in the coming weeks, per Parikh. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should the connection prove powerful enough to warrant a treatment, Parikh imagines a version of cancer care where high quality meals (like the aforementioned Pad Thai) and cancer drugs can work together to achieve better outcomes. A patient would still go through radiotherapy or chemotherapy, but go home and have doctor-prescribed meals delivered to their door (Parikh adds that the meals have been developed by “world-class chefs). Then, the patient would follow up with a nutritionist if concerns arise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for now, Parikh says the focus will be almost entirely on bringing this research into the clinical stage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They&#8217;ve done as much work as they possibly can pre-clinically and so we&#8217;ve raised this round to move into the clinic. And we&#8217;re doing early stage trials to confirm safety, obviously, but also see whether there&#8217;s a signal of efficacy as well,” he says. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This week Darrell and Jordan talk with Real CEO and Founder, Ariela Safira. Real is a therapy platform that aims to make mental healthcare more accessible by offering group sessions and curriculums a user can engage with any time. While in college, Ariela had her first encounter with the mental health care system and realized that people were only seeking help for their mental health when they were in crisis. She then spent years studying the ways people seek care and how therapy could be more accessible and effective. In this conversation as they dive into everything from the research that lead her to found Real to religion to the merits of Goop. CW: suicide and attempted suicide.</p>
