										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s difficult to get credit if you don’t have credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the problem that startup </span><a href="http://www.tomocredit.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TomoCredit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is trying to solve. Co-founder and CEO Kristy Kim came up with the concept for the company after being rejected multiple times for an auto loan while in her early 20s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim, who immigrated to the U.S. from South Korea with her family as a child, was disappointed that her lack of a credit history proved to be such an obstacle despite the fact she had a job “and positive cash flow.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So she teamed up with Dmitry Kashlev, a Russian immigrant, in January of 2019 to create a solution for other foreign-born individuals and young adults facing similar credit challenges. That fall, the startup (short for Tomorrow’s Credit) was accepted into the Barclays Accelerator, powered by Techstars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San Francisco-based fintech offers a credit card aimed at helping first-time borrowers build credit history, based on their cash flow, rather than on their FICO or credit report ratings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Tomo announced a $7 million seed funding round that included participation from a slew of investors including KB Investment Inc. (KBIC) &#8212; a subsidiary of South Korean consumer bank, Kookmin Bank &#8212; along with Barclays, Knollwood Investment Advisory, BAM Ventures, Passport Capital, Ulu Ventures and Strong Ventures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angel and individual investors also put money in the round, including: Backstage Capital founder Arlan Hamilton, ex-Venmo COO Michael Vaughan and James Kim, former head of finance at Tinder. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 30 million young adults are considered “cash rich” but with limited credit histories, making their only option to use debit cards, according to the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/who-are-credit-invisible/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TomoCredit is a credit card that operates with a debit card model that is issued by Community Federal Savings Bank, a member of the FDIC. Users make payments on a seven-day automatic payment schedule with no fees or APR applied. Credit limits average around $3,000, but can scale to a maximum of $10,000.  Borrowers can link to their investment accounts to increase their credit limits.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We set out to build something that wasn’t just more inclusive, but fundamentally different from existing consumer credit card offerings,” Kim said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She emphasizes the card is not just for immigrants, but for anyone that is considered “no file or thin file” when it comes to credit history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting rejected for the auto loan made Kim realize that in the U.S., “everything is really difficult without a credit score.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It doesn&#8217;t matter whether you have income or savings or not,” she said. “I thought it would be really nice if we could leverage different data sources, especially cash flow data, instead of credit history. We are living in 2021 and open banking is popular, so it&#8217;s easier to get access to open banking data. And we leverage your cash flow data to underwrite you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another unique aspect of Tomo’s model, Kim believes, is that it makes money through merchant fees and not through the consumers who use its card. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unlike incumbent credit card issuers, we aren’t incentivized by slapping fees on borrowers for making late payments &#8212; we make money as our cardholders spend &#8212; so we grow as you grow,” Kim added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TomoCredit cards became available in late summer 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We didn&#8217;t expect much, to be honest, because it was our first launch and we didn&#8217;t do any marketing,” she recalls. “However, we are able to get over 300,000 people signing up, and then we are able to pre-approve half of them. Since then, we have been aggressively issuing cards.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand for the company’s card skyrocketed last year after it “went viral” on YouTube and Reddit, Kim said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right after we launch, we got huge jumps in traffic. We found out that many YouTubers were commenting and reviewing Tomo, and the comments were from people who were looking for our solution to build credit score fast and efficiently.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Tomo has over 10,000 active users and the company plans to issue cards to the remaining pre-approved applicants by this summer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was curious if Tomo had trouble convincing investors considering the risk it would be taking on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim acknowledged having to help them overcome the “emotional and psychological hurdle” of the risk involved with issuing a credit card to people with no credit history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I had to help them understand that the environment is changing,” she said. “When you look at the new generation of consumers, especially Gen Z and millennials, you will see that the majority of them have a thin file or no file at all. And that&#8217;s not their fault. People have different personal finance behavior than in the past, which makes it harder for traditional lenders to evaluate them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backstage Capital founder Arlan Hamilton is one of the investors TomoCredit won over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I spend a lot of my time these days investing in and catalyzing products that right the wrongs that my family and so many others endured as I was growing up,” she wrote via email. “One of those themes is in establishing and maintaining good credit and having an alternative to predatory lending. Tomo Credit feels to me like it is tackling this in a hugely scalable, mainstream way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mariquit Corcoran, group chief innovation officer at Barclays, said she was impressed by Kim’s &#8220;tenacity and passion&#8221; when she first presented her idea of solving “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> real-life problem facing many people who have traditionally struggled to access credit and build a financial profile.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I look forward to watching their growth and impact in changing the way an individual’s credit worthiness is determined,” she wrote via email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Tomo plans to use its new capital to triple its headcount of 15, mostly with the goal of hiring full stack and data engineers. Recently, it tapped a former LendingClub exec, Chaomei Chen, to serve as its acting chief risk officer. The startup also plans to use the money in part toward product development, such as adding more interactive features.</span></p>
<p>Tomo is not the only fintech with an alternative credit model. <a href="https://x1creditcard.com">X1 Card</a> sets limits <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/x1-card-is-a-credit-card-based-on-your-income-not-your-credit-score/">based on your current and future income</a> instead of your credit score. And, Grow Credit is a startup<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/23/using-spotify-and-netflix-payments-to-build-your-credit-score-grow-credit-has-a-service-for-that/"> that launched in 2019</a> to help customers build out their credit scores by providing a credit line for online subscriptions like Spotify and Netflix.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.listentopodz.com">Podz</a> is the latest startup trying to solve the problem of podcast discovery, with backing from investors like M13, Katie Couric and Paris Hilton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though podcasts have gained a lot of momentum — there are <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-podcast-listeners-will-surpass-100-million-this-year">100 million folks in the U.S. who listen to podcasts</a> — we still haven’t seen that crossover behavior, where audio becomes a part of everyday lives,&#8221; CEO Doug Imbruce argued. &#8220;We think that’s because the experience experience discovering and consuming podcasts is ancient. It literally feels like browsing the web in 1997.&#8221;</p>
<p>Imbruce&#8217;s name may be familiar to longtime TechCrunch readers, as he was previously the chief executive at Qwiki, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/29/qwiki-techcrunch-disrupt-winner/">won the Startup Battlefield</a> at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2010 (Cloudflare was one of the runners up), then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/02/yahoo-acquires-qwiki-for-around-50-million/">acquired by Yahoo</a> a few years later.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By Imbruce&#8217;s own admission, Qwiki never quite lived up to his hopes for remaking online media consumption, but he said that its vision of &#8220;machine-created media&#8221; offered &#8220;a taste of the future&#8221; — a future that he&#8217;s hoping to help usher in with Podz.</p>
<p>The problem that the startup aims to solve is pretty straightforward. Since podcasts often consist of 30 or 60 minutes or more of spoken-word audio, they&#8217;re difficult to browse, and when you discover new ones, it&#8217;s usually through word-of-mouth recommendations or clunky search tools.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/13/sparemin-headliner/">tools like Headliner</a> makes it easier for podcasters to promote their content with short clips on social media, Podz automates that creation process and makes those clips the centerpiece of the listening experience.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111232" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111232" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2111232" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Podz_Gif.gif?w=680" alt="Podz demo" width="680" height="453" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111232" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Podz</p></div></p>
<p>In the Podz mobile app, users browse what the startup calls an &#8220;the first audio newsfeed,&#8221; consisting of 60-second podcast clips. These clips are designed to highlight the best moment from each podcast, making it easier to sample a much wider array of titles than the ones you currently subscribe to. Each clip should stand on its own, but if you want to dive deeper, you can save the full episode for listening later.</p>
<p>These clips are created automatically, and Imbruce said &#8220;the beating heart of the Podz platform&#8221; is a machine learning model that &#8220;identifies the most engaging parts of podcasts.&#8221; The model was trained on more than 100,000 hours of audio, in consultation with journalists and audio editors.</p>
<p>For example, here are the clips chosen from the three most recent episodes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">the Original Content podcast</a> — our reviews of <a href="https://pdzs.co/aed8446b4e094b7e9627ae0d539a1527">&#8220;Soul,&#8221;</a>, <a href="https://pdzs.co/0809bb751e614bd08d4c7cb5773d07d6">&#8220;The White Tiger&#8221;</a> and <a href="https://pdzs.co/d63e21288e8f425982eff412f88ba431">&#8220;Bridgerton.&#8221;</a> Each clip seems reasonably self-contained, and although I was a little dismayed to discover that they all focused on me (rather than my more eloquent co-hosts), a Podz spokesperson explained that&#8217;s because the app focuses on &#8220;the highest density speakers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Podz newsfeed is personalized to your interests (and, if you choose, it can also draw on the podcasts you follow in Apple Podcasts and the accounts you follow on Twitter). Imbruce said it should become smarter over time as it observes listener behavior.</p>
<p>He added that the team is hoping to introduce more creative and monetization tools for podcasters over time: &#8220;We are really hopeful that we can both increase amount of audio being created by 10x and increase the monetization of audio by 100x.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Imbruce, the Podz founding team includes CTO Seye Ojumu, Head of Design Rasmus Zwickson and iOS lead Greg Page. The startup has raised $2.5 million in pre-seed funding from <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">M13, Canaan Partners, Charge Ventures, Humbition, as well as notable angel investors like Couric, Hilton (who&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/04/arts/paris-hilton-podcast.html">launching her own podcast</a>) and Mara Schiavocampo (<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-trend-reporter/id1438771346">The Trend Reporter</a>).</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are living in a golden age of audio, but only 1% of podcasts reach an audience of 5,000+,&#8221; M13 General Partner Latif Peracha told me in a statement. &#8220;<span class="il">Podz</span> plans to grow the audience for existing audio but the real focus will be on growing new audio by leveraging their creator tools. Already, the average podcast listener subscribes to seven podcasts but follows almost 30 on <span class="il">Podz</span>.  Early signals make us optimistic the team can build a transformative product in the category.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archer Aviation, the electric aircraft startup targeting the urban air mobility market, has landed United Airlines as a customer and an investor in its bid to become a publicly traded company via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archer Aviation said Wednesday it reached an agreement to merge with special purpose acquisition company Atlas Crest Investment Corp., an increasingly common financial path that allows the startup to eschew the once traditional IPO process. The combined company, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange with ticker symbol &#8220;ACHR,&#8221; will have an equity valuation of $3.8 billion. </span></p>
<p>The company said it expected to receive $1.1 billion of gross proceeds, including $600 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE, from investors such as United Airlines, Stellantis and the venture arm of Exor, Baron Capital Group, the Federated Hermes Kaufmann Funds, Mubadala Capital, Putnam Investments and Access Industries. Ken Moelis and affiliates, along with Marc Lore, who is one of Archer&#8217;s primary and initial backers, are investing $30 million in the PIPE.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The combined company will also hold about $500 million cash in trust. Prior to the SPAC deal, Archer had raised $60 million in a seed and Series A round.</p>
<p>Separately, the <span style="font-weight: 400;">Palo Alto, California-based startup announced that United Airlines agreed to invest in the company. Under the terms of its agreement, United has placed an order for $1 billion of Archer’s aircraft. United has the option to buy an additional $500 million of aircraft. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archer has yet to mass produce its electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, which designed to travel up to 60 miles on a single charge at speeds of 150 miles per hour. Archer plans to unveil its full-scale eVTOL later this year and is aiming to begin volume manufacturing in 2023. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111319" style="width: 3410px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ARCH_Aircraft_02_walking_COMP06_STE_QC.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111319" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2111319 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ARCH_Aircraft_02_walking_COMP06_STE_QC.jpg" alt="Archer Aviation Aircraft" width="3400" height="2267" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ARCH_Aircraft_02_walking_COMP06_STE_QC.jpg 3400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ARCH_Aircraft_02_walking_COMP06_STE_QC.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ARCH_Aircraft_02_walking_COMP06_STE_QC.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ARCH_Aircraft_02_walking_COMP06_STE_QC.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ARCH_Aircraft_02_walking_COMP06_STE_QC.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ARCH_Aircraft_02_walking_COMP06_STE_QC.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ARCH_Aircraft_02_walking_COMP06_STE_QC.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ARCH_Aircraft_02_walking_COMP06_STE_QC.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3400px) 100vw, 3400px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2111319" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Archer Aviation</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is betting that its deal with United Airlines and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/air-taxi-startup-archer-is-partnering-with-automaker-fca-on-production-of-its-electric-aircraft/">previously announced partnership</a> with automotive conglomerate Stellantis combined with capital raised through its SPAC merger, will help speed up its efforts towards commercialization. </span></p>
<p>United CEO Scott Kirby couched the investment has one of the ways the airline will help decarbonize air travel.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">By working with Archer, United is showing the aviation industry that now is the time to embrace cleaner, more efficient modes of transportation,&#8221; Kirby said. &#8220;With the right technology, we can curb the impact aircraft have on the planet, but we have to identify the next generation of companies who will make this a reality early and find ways to help them get off the ground.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Amazon Marketplace roll-up play is well and truly underway. In the latest development, <a href="https://www.thras.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thrasio</a> &#8212; one of the biggest and earliest movers in the market to consolidate third-party sellers on the platform, with the promise to provide better economies of scale to manage and grow those businesses &#8212; announced that it has raised another <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thrasio-raises-another-750-000-000--301225078.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$750 million</a> at a valuation that could be between $3 billion and $4 billion.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by existing backers Oaktree and Advent, and it includes participation from previous unnamed investors. (That list of equity backers has <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/266344-84/company/profile#general-info" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">included</a> Peak6, Western Technology Investment, and Jason Finger, the co-founder of one of the early players in food delivery startups, Seamless.)</p>
<p>Thrasio said it will be using the money to continue its rapid pace of buying up more third-party sellers in the &#8220;Amazon FBA ecosystem&#8221;, a reference to smaller merchants that sell and distribute their products using the &#8220;<a href="https://services.amazon.co.uk/services/fulfilment-by-amazon/features-benefits.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fulfilment By Amazon</a>&#8221; service from the e-commerce giant.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Thrasio continues its exceptional growth,&#8221; said </span><span class="xn-person" style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Joshua Silberstein, who co-founded and co-leads the company with Carlos Cashman</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. &#8220;Over the past two months, we&#8217;ve been acquiring </span><span class="xn-money" style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">$1.5 million</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in revenue </span><i style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">per day.&#8221; </i>Those are his italics. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Thrasio is now closing two or three deals every week.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Thrasio to date has acquired nearly 100 FBA businesses says that it reached that number by way of evaluating 6,000 possible companies and 14,000 &#8220;category-leading products.&#8221;</p>
<p>Six thousand may sound like a big number, but <a href="https://www.feedbackexpress.com/amazon-1029528-new-sellers-year-plus-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one estimate</a> puts the number of third-party sellers on Amazon at around 5 million, a number that appears to be growing exponentially at the moment, with more than 1 million sellers joining the platform last year.</p>
<p>The size of the opportunity, plus the Amazon-proven promise of economy of scale in the world of e-commerce, are likely two reasons why we have seen so many startups emerging looking to roll them up.</p>
<p>Thrasio&#8217;s $750 million fundraise is an all-equity venture round. A spokesperson for the company said it was not disclosing valuation but in January, when it closed a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/advent-backed-retailer-thrasio-raises-500-million-in-debt-deal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">debt round of $500 million</a>, it was reported that the company was valued at $3 billion.</p>
<p>That was a debt round so it&#8217;s not clear whether that was taking into account this upcoming equity injection, or if we could consider this equity round on top of that. This means that a reasonable estimate, based on the $3 billion figure, could be anything between $3 billion and $4 billion, but quite possibly more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite possible more&#8221; because the news comes at a particularly overheated time in this specific area of e-commerce.</p>
<p>Thrasio&#8217;s news came out yesterday afternoon, only hours after we reported on a new rival called Branded, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launched its own roll-up business on $150 million in funding</a> and with a critical detail: one of the &#8220;co-founders&#8221; is the deep-pocketed European VC firm <a href="https://www.targetglobal.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Target Global</a>.</p>
<p>And that comes on the heels of others in this space &#8212; they include, in addition to Thrasio and Branded, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Berlin Brands Group</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SellerX</a>, <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/press-releases/heyday-emerges-from-stealth-with-175m-series-a-funding-to-accelerate-marketplace-native-brands-15493868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heyday</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heroes</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/perch-raises-123-5m-to-grow-its-stable-of-d2c-brands-that-sell-on-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perch</a> and more &#8212; collectively raising or committing from their own balance sheets well over $1 billion in aid of their own efforts to buy up small but promising third-party merchants.</p>
<p>For its part, Thrasio notes that the funding was raised quickly and diluted existing shareholders by<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> 11.1%, and that it has now raised $1.75 in equity and debt.</span></p>
<p>Thrasio products do not carry any kind of Thrasio branding. But I&#8217;m guessing that as Thrasio and its rivals look for a better edge and aim to give the impression of more quality (rather than the fly-by-night feeling that some of these sellers have today), we may see more of that coming out.</p>
<p>Brands that it owns include Vybe Percussion deep tissue massage gun, Circadian Optics bright light therapy lamps, and skincare products from Sdara Skincare, Thrasio said.</p>
<p>In the competition for the best of these, Thrasio claims its marketing and analytics can help these newcomers &#8220;compete with top household name labels, quickly becoming the trusted items that consumers turn to for their everyday needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The feverish pace of fundraising in the area of FBA roll-ups feels very much like a bubble in the market &#8212; not least because none of these still-young companies have yet to prove that the strategy to buy up and consolidate these sellers is a useful and profitable one.</p>
<p>(The only one that has stated that it is profitable, Berlin Brands Group, has done so on its existing business model, which has involved building a variety of third-party sellers from the ground up itself, not buying up others, with whatever legacy baggage they may carry, good or bad.)</p>
<p>Thrasio is very much in the go-big-or-go-home stage of scaling with funding, and in its favor, although it&#8217;s only three years old (founded in 2018), that age has made it one of the oldest and more proven in this current wave.</p>
<p>&#8220;In ten years, omnichannel retail will be the backbone of the entire consumer products ecosystem &#8211; but today, it&#8217;s still in its genesis. Every day, the very fabric of this market is twisting as it continues to evolve,&#8221; said Cashman in a statement. &#8220;Our balance sheet isn&#8217;t built to win yesterday&#8217;s battles &#8211; it is designed to pursue the accelerating opportunities that accompany these kinds of seismic changes in an industry.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Freelancers who work well together in teams are the target for <a href="https://www.collective.work">Collective</a>, a French startup that&#8217;s launching a software-as-a-service marketplace today. (Not to be confused with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/collective-a-back-office-platform-that-caters-to-businesses-of-one-just-landed-a-hefty-seed-round/">Collective</a>, a US-based startup that offers back-office tools for the self employed running a business-of-one.)</p>
<p>Collective (the French &#8216;teams&#8217; edition) is co-founded by Jean de Rauglaudre and Vianney de Drouas, and is backed by the SaaS-focused startup studio/venture builder, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/08/startup-studio-efounders-has-a-portfolio-valuation-of-1-billion/">eFounders</a>, which covers expenses during the first 18 months (so how much it ends up investing depends but typically runs to at least a few thousand euros.)</p>
<p>&#8220;As a former freelancer, I was really attracted by this new way of working,&#8221; says de Rauglaudre, discussing why Collective is focusing on &#8220;independents teaming up by mutualizing skills, networks and work methodology in a quest to go faster, think bigger, and find more meaning&#8221;, as he puts it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p data-type="unstyled" data-id="5d393e80-9883-43af-9b48-5cae7dd37f98"><span data-type="comment" data-id="CUEyN5uhag">It argues that the indie &#8216;collectives&#8217; </span>phenomenon has only been accelerated as a result of the coronavirus pandemic &#8212; with companies faced with more uncertainty looking for more resilient and flexible options.</p>
<p>The pair of founders worked with eFounders to hone their fledgling idea. &#8220;We understood that collective was the ultimate next step on this market. Though, we noticed that those forms today do not scale (because of so many admin issues), do not shine (because they do not thrive under a standardized reality), and work alone (while solo freelancers have a lot of tools and benefit from a legal existence, collectives are still undeserved). Therefore, we &#8216;imaginated&#8217; Collective!&#8221; de Rauglaudre tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111405" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111405" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2111405" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo2.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo2.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111405" class="wp-caption-text">Collective&#8217;s co-founders, Jean de Rauglaudre and Vianney de Drouas (Image credits: Collective)</p></div></p>
<p>For teams of skilled indie workers the lure of Collective is a promise that it combines the benefits of working in an agency &#8212; because its SaaS platform automates a bunch of back-office functions like proposals, invoices, contracts and payments &#8212; with the flexibility of still being freelance and thus able to pick and choose projects and clients.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exhaustive&#8221; back-office is the promise from de Rauglaudre. (Which &#8212; yes &#8212; does include chasing clients for late/non payment of invoices. When we checked that detail he dubbed the service &#8220;a perfect combination of flexibility (inherent to collective models) and security (related to our back-office)&#8221;. Late freelancer payments are of course an infamous pain-point that&#8217;s been targeted by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/23/former-startup-battlefield-competitor-satago-raises-4-6m-to-help-small-businesses-get-paid/">other startups</a> over the years; but Collective is coming with the full back-office package.)</p>
<p>Additionally, Collective offers freelancer teams marketplace visibility &#8212; and thus help with their client pipeline.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been soft launched for one month at this point and in that time says 18 collectives have been formed on its marketplace, comprising more than 150 freelancers in total.</p>
<p>Early collectives operating on its marketplace are offering &#8220;varied&#8221; expertise &#8212; from software development, design, product management, and growth &#8212; and are already working with five companies. Collective also says it&#8217;s speaking with more than 80 companies as it starts its push for scale.</p>
<p data-type="unstyled" data-id="8004a44a-7b01-400c-9280-4c18e657156e">&#8220;We did not expect such huge interest in so little time, coming both from independents and companies,&#8221; adds de Rauglaudre in a statement. &#8220;This confirms our initial realization: That people and companies are looking for more flexible ways of working and that it is by joining forces that we can reach higher. What we&#8217;re seeing is the very beginning of the teamwork revolution.&#8221;</p>
<p data-type="unstyled" data-id="66e5f611-5214-4e31-a54b-bdd8dc48ea19">&#8220;While solo freelancers benefit from a legal existence and have dedicated platforms, collectives are still under-served,&#8221; says eFounders co-founder Thibaud Elziere in another supporting statement. &#8220;They all operate under different legal structures and struggle to find work because they don&#8217;t have the right tools. Collective aims to become the go-to solution to help collectives exist, find work and scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>In terms of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/27/the-freelancer-generation-why-startups-and-enterprises-need-to-pay-attention/">underlying trends</a> Collective is aiming to tap into, de Rauglaudre points to &#8220;skyrocketing&#8221; rates of independent work over the past decade (150%+).</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wiikYLrafZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/27/the-freelancer-generation-why-startups-and-enterprises-need-to-pay-attention/">The Freelancer Generation: Why Startups And Enterprises Need To Pay Attention</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Freelancer Generation: Why Startups And Enterprises Need To Pay Attention&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/27/the-freelancer-generation-why-startups-and-enterprises-need-to-pay-attention/embed/#?secret=wiikYLrafZ" data-secret="wiikYLrafZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As they investigated further, he says they noticed that more and more freelancers are working together in various forms &#8212; suggesting that around a fifth of independents &#8220;work as a collective consciously or not&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We estimate that +10M freelancers are merging in collectives worldwide but with very various forms (structured or not). They want to team up to increase their revenues (competing against agencies and not solo freelancers) while improving their working mode (not alone any more),&#8221; he suggests.</p>
<p>In terms of target sectors/skills for the marketplace to serve (and serve up), he doesn&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a single template &#8212; but Collective is starting by focusing development (on the &#8216;collectives&#8217; supply side) on design, product, tech, data and growth marketing; and (on the client demand side) on large scale-ups and tech companies.</p>
<p>The business model at this stage is for it to a charge markup (5%-15%) on the client side. The lower fee is charged is the platform isn&#8217;t providing the client; while the higher figure is if it is, per de Rauglaudre.</p>
<p>Once all the bells and whistles are ready with the SaaS &#8212; in about another month &#8212; he says it will also charge a monthly fee on the collective side.</p>
<p>Given the branding clash with the SF-based back-office startup <a href="https://www.collective.com">Collective</a>, the French team may want to take that time to consider a name change &#8212; maybe &#8216;<em>Collectif&#8217; </em>could work? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f643.png" alt="🙃" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/a16z-is-now-managing-16-5-billion-after-announcing-two-new-funds/">$16.5 billion in assets under management</a>, has poured millions into an edtech startup that sells virtual STEM lab simulations to institutions.</p>
<p>Copenhagen-based <a href="https://www.labster.com/">Labster</a>, which sells virtual science laboratory simulations to schools, announced today that it has raised $60 million in a Series C round led by the prominent Silicon Valley firm, including participation from existing investors GGV Capital, Owl Ventures and Balderton Capital. Labster has now raised $100 million in total known venture capital to date.</p>
<p>Like many edtech companies, Labster has found itself centered and validated as the pandemic underscores the need for remote work. In April, Labster signed a contract to bring its services to the entire California Community College network, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/labsters-latest-partnership-and-what-it-tells-us-about-the-future-of-remote-learning/">which includes more than 2.1 million students. </a>Months later, the startup brought on $9 million in equity funding to bring GGV’s Jenny Lee onto the board and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/labster-lands-new-cash-to-bring-its-virtual-reality-science-lab-software-to-asia/">expand its Asia operations</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“A16z is very excited about investing in technology companies that have a big impact and potential to become massive global successes’,” CEO and co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bodekaer?originalSubdomain=ch">Michael Bodekaer Jensen</a> said. “The fact that Labster is a platform innovating learning at scale is really what attracted them.”</p>
<p>The new capital will help Labster increase its staff, grow into new regions that include Latin America and Africa, as well as invest in new product development to better support teachers.</p>
<p>Jensen says that today’s raise, which is singularly larger than any capital Labster has raised prior, “dramatically increased” the valuation of the company. Jensen did confirm that Labster has not yet hit the $1 billion mark in terms of valuation, nor did he comment on whether the startup had hit profitability or not.</p>
<p>What Jensen did share, though, is that he thinks Labster’s new capital brings the startup one step closer to two big goals: serve 100 million students in the next few years, and become a platform to “enable anyone in the world to customize and build their own simulations on their platform.”</p>
<p>“We’re not a content company,” the co-founder said. “We’re a platform for immersive learning.”</p>

<p>Currently, Labster sells its e-learning solution to support and enhance in-person courses. Based on the subscription an institution chooses, participants can get differing degrees of access to a virtual laboratory. Imagine a range of experiments, from understanding bacterial growth and isolation to exploring the biodiversity of an exoplanet. Along with each simulation, Labster offers 3D animations for certain concepts, re-plays of simulations, quiz questions and a virtual learning assistant.</p>

<p>Jensen is hinting that the startup might finally be able to move past pre-determined learning tracks and into the world of customizable immersive learning. Other startups, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/inspirit-seed/">Inspirit,</a> are also aiming to bring the creativity associated with games such as Minecraft or Roblox to the day-to-day schoolwork of students around the world.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Inspirit launches to bring Minecraft creativity to biology class&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/inspirit-seed/embed/#?secret=jlsmUXxTMr" data-secret="jlsmUXxTMr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With platform ambition, Labster is pausing its virtual reality efforts, which requires acquiring headsets at scale.</p>
<p>“VR is good for learning, but we need to make sure that we understand and provide services and solutions that work with the hardware that institutions already have and are available,” he said, adding that many institutions have been unable to afford headsets for all students. The fact that Labster is stepping away from virtual reality and framing itself as an immersive learning environment is more than a branding decision, but suggests that the future of scalable edtech might look less like goggles and more like a customizable web page.</p>
<p>“In the early days there was definitely a little naïve entrepreneurial mindset to build it and suddenly all teachers will come,” Jensen said. “[VR] was in no way as revolutionary as we hopped and thought of.”</p>
<p>New investments for the startup include Labster Portal, which is a dashboard for teachers to understand how individual students are using the immersive simulations and what lessons make sense to embed together. The company is also focused on landing partnerships with institutions, on either a country or state-wide level or district-level. Jensen says that the bigger the contract, the bigger the discount because it saves them money on onboarding costs. Labster recently signed a deal to bring its technology to the entire country of Denmark.</p>
<p>Labster currently has more than 2,000 colleges, universities and high schools on its platform.</p>
<p>“Post-COVID, the growth will slow,” Jensen said. “When we have conversations with institutions we are increasingly talking about post-COVID and continuing how we can further use Labster in new and innovative ways.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://uptime.app/">Uptime</a>, the self-described &#8220;knowledge hacking&#8221; app, has raised $16 million in seed funding, after officially launching on iOS in January.</p>
<p>Positioned as a &#8220;micro-learning&#8221; platform,&#8221; Uptime presents five-minute &#8220;knowledge hacks&#8221; from books, courses and documentaries. The idea is to let you quickly &#8220;grasp ideas and insights from trusted authors, instructors, and creative minds,&#8221; without spending too much of your precious time. In return, content creators &#8212; from those on The New York Times bestseller list to the most relevant courses and Academy Award-winning documentaries &#8212; get a new way to reach audiences who may go on to purchase the full works.</p>
<p>In other words, chalk this up as part content aggregator and discovery, and part lead generation for the actual content creators. Built, of course, for the short attention spans of millennials and Gen Z. Or so the pitch goes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Hacks are presented in a unique visual story format, designed to be inspirational and make learning effective, fun, engaging, and shareable – all verified by a team of experts,&#8221; explains the company. &#8220;At the end of each Hack, the user is presented with the option to buy the book, watch the full documentary or sign up for the course from the original source&#8221;.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111060" style="width: 346px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111060" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2111060" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3f427dde-927a-44d1-8355-566e237cbe74_Takeaction.png?w=336" alt="Image of Uptime app" width="336" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3f427dde-927a-44d1-8355-566e237cbe74_Takeaction.png 468w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3f427dde-927a-44d1-8355-566e237cbe74_Takeaction.png?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3f427dde-927a-44d1-8355-566e237cbe74_Takeaction.png?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3f427dde-927a-44d1-8355-566e237cbe74_Takeaction.png?resize=336,680 336w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3f427dde-927a-44d1-8355-566e237cbe74_Takeaction.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111060" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Uptime</p></div></p>
<p>The seed funding comes from Uptime&#8217;s founders &#8212; serial entrepreneurs Jamie True and Jack Bekhor, who previously founded LifeWorks (acquired in 2018 for $325 million), and former YouTube and Facebook executive Patrick Walker &#8212; alongside other private investors. They include Lord David Alliance, ex-CEO of Tesco Sir Terry Leahy and unnamed members of private equity firm Thomas H Lee (THL).</p>
<p>&#8220;The global edtech market was valued at around [over] $89 billion last year, with people spending hundreds of dollars on online courses, building up their soft skills and watching documentaries,&#8221; says Uptime&#8217;s Patrick Walker. &#8220;It’s a huge opportunity for educational content creators but for customers, it leads to information overload and it can be hard to cut through and find the quality in what feels like an oversaturated market.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Uptime, we wanted to create something that could be a one-stop shop for knowledge. Instead of sifting through bestseller lists, endless sites of digital courses, and video platforms for documentaries, Uptime presents the best content from only the most trusted experts, organisations and sources. People can select the topics they’re interested in and gain access to the key elements of the content in snackable, easy-to-watch visual stories, audio and text&#8221;.</p>
<p>Uptime&#8217;s founders say the platform is aimed at anyone who wants to learn but only has a short amount of time, energy and/or limited resources to do so. &#8220;It’s perfect for Gen Z, millennials, parents, anyone with an interest in enhancing their personal or career prospects, and a desire to fill their time with constructive and uplifting content,&#8221; says Walker.</p>
<p>One criticism that could be levied at an app like Uptime is that it is another example of a parasitic aggregator, essentially monetising other people&#8217;s work. Its makers argue the opposite, and say that the app is actually helping to deliver a new audience to a creator’s work by providing a taster.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of each Hack, there is a link for people to go on and purchase the book, course or documentary, thereby delivering new audiences to creators,&#8221; adds Walker. &#8220;The authors and creators we’ve reached out to are extremely enthusiastic about their work being on Uptime. We’ve had support from the likes of Lily Cole, Oobah Butler and Dr Tara Swart&#8230; The idea is that everyone can benefit from Uptime; the users and the content creators&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snap has partnered with ShareChat’s Moj app to integrate its Camera Kit into the Indian app as the American social giant looks to accelerate its growth in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>This is the first time Snap has partnered with an Indian firm for its Camera Kit technology, which unlocks a range of augmented reality features, the two companies said. (Snap has partnered with a handful of firms including Triller for Camera Kit globally.)</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.mohalla.video&amp;hl=en_IN&amp;gl=US">Moj</a> creators will be able to use Snap’s AR technology from within the app, while some of the lenses their creators produce will be made available to Snap users, executives with the firms told TechCrunch in an interview.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Wednesday’s move comes amid an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/google-and-snap-in-talks-to-invest-in-india-social-network-sharechat/">ongoing fundraise effort by ShareChat</a>, which operates Moj and is a popular social network in India that caters to users in over a dozen local languages, which is in talks with Google, Snap, Twitter and other investors, TechCrunch reported last month.</p>
<p>Ben Schwerin, SVP of Content and Partnerships at Snap, said in an interview that today’s collaboration is the beginning of a relationship between the two firms, but declined to comment on any investment talks.</p>
<p>Schwerin said the collaboration with eight-month-old Moj will enable Snap to expand the reach of its AR technology to more users in India. Snap, which for years struggled to make inroads in India, has seen an impressive growth in the country in recent quarters.</p>
<p>Snap had about 80 million monthly active users in India in the month of December (according to mobile insight firm App Annie, data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch), up from about 25 million a year ago.</p>
<p>ShareChat has amassed over 160 million monthly active users in India, while its Moj app, which was launched after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">New Delhi banned TikTok in June</a> last year, had about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/indias-sharechat-raises-40-million-says-its-short-video-platform-moj-now-reaches-80-million-users/">80 million users in September last year</a>, according to the startup.</p>
<p>Scores of startups in India are attempting to cash in on TikTok&#8217;s ban in the country. Indian conglomerate Times Internet&#8217;s MX Player has launched MX TakaTak, and news aggregator DailyHunt has expanded to short-form video with Josh. Their parent firm this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/07/dailyhunt-and-joshs-parent-firm-raises-over-100-million/">announced a fundraise of over $100 million</a>, two months after Google participated in another over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">$100 million round into the startup</a>.</p>
<p>Global giants are also not shying away from the opportunity. Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/facebook-expands-instagram-reels-to-india/">launched Instagram Reels in India last year</a>, and YouTube <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/youtube-launches-its-tiktok-rival-youtube-shorts-initially-in-india/">launched Shorts</a>, which is already garnering over 3.5 billion daily views in India, it said last month.</p>
<p>Moj, which has released 30 Snap-powered lenses for its community at the launch, will develop over 400 lenses in the coming years, some in collaboration with Snapchat Official Lens Creators in India, it said.</p>
<p>“There’s going to be an incredible selection of AR lenses that are customized and localized for Moj’s audience, and we think there’s going to be lots of innovation and usecases that we couldn’t have seen on Snap alone,” said Schwerin, adding that creators have developed over 1.5 million lenses for Snap.</p>
<p>Gaurav Mishra, SVP of Product at ShareChat, said in an interview the partnership will enable Moj users to engage much more deeply with the community and stand above the crowd. He declined to share the level of resources ShareChat was planning to deploy for the creation of lenses. Both the firms declined to disclose financial terms of the deal.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/hardik">Hardik Shah</a>, who works at <a href="https://superfan.studio">SuperFan Studio</a>, one of the largest AR creative firms in India, told TechCrunch the proliferation of Snap’s AR tech will improve the quality of lenses and filters most people in India have access to.</p>
<p>“Brands need to realise that ‘What Disney characters are you’ is very 2019 and should be discarded as an idea in 2021. It’s OK not to do an AR Experience than going ahead with outdated and stale production,” he said. The following videos are some of SuperFan Studio&#8217;s work atop the Snap platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.klarna.com">Klarna</a> is turning its mobile app into a banking app in Germany. Customers living there can now open a consumer bank account and get a Visa debit card.</p>
<p>For now, Klarna is launching bank accounts for a limited number of users. The company expects to roll it out more broadly in the coming months.</p>
<p>What you get is a full-fledged bank account with a German IBAN to receive money, set up direct deposits and debits. The debit card works with Google Pay and Apple Pay. You get two free ATM withdrawals per month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With today’s launch, Klarna wants to build a financial super app. Klarna started as a payment method for e-commerce websites. It lets you pay for expensive goods over multiple installments. Merchants get paid when the initial transaction occurs, with Klarna transparently managing credit lines for customers.</p>
<p>With the company’s mobile app, you can track your past purchases and your upcoming payments. The app also lets you access a marketplace of stores, track deliveries and set up price-drop notifications.</p>
<p>But you couldn’t get a full overview of your finances with this data. Adding a bank account provides full visibility in everything that lands on your bank account and leaves your bank account.</p>
<p>It could open up some new opportunities for credit lines. For instance, if you pay in store for something really expensive with your Klarna card, you could receive a notification that suggests spreading out your expense over three months.</p>
<p>Klarna also plans to add savings goals and savings accounts. The startup has already launched savings accounts in Sweden. It offers flexible and fixed-term savings accounts.</p>
<p>Klarna has built its own core banking system, which means that it doesn’t rely on a banking-as-a-service partner to manage your bank account. It’ll compete with other digital banks in Germany, such as <a href="https://n26.com">N26</a> and <a href="https://vivid.money">Vivid Money</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most people who use AI-powered translation tools do so for commonplace, relatively unimportant tasks like understanding a single phrase or quote. Those basic services won&#8217;t do for an enterprise offering technical documents in 15 languages — but <a href="https://www.lengoo.com/">Lengoo&#8217;s</a> custom machine translation models might just do the trick. And with a new $20M B round, they may be able to build a considerable lead.</p>
<p>The translation business is a big one, in the billions, and isn&#8217;t going anywhere. It&#8217;s simply too common a task to need to release a document, piece of software, or live website in multiple languages — perhaps dozens.</p>
<p>These days that work is done by translation agencies, which employ expert speakers to provide translation on demand at a high level of quality. The rise of machine translation as an everyday tool hasn&#8217;t affected them as much as you might think, since the occasional Portuguese user using Google&#8217;s built-in webpage translation on a Korean website is very much a niche case, and things like translating social media posts or individual sentences isn&#8217;t really something you could or would farm out to professionals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In these familiar cases &#8220;good enough&#8221; is the rule, since the bare meaning is all anyone really wants or needs. But if you&#8217;re releasing a product in 10 different markets speaking 10 different languages, it won&#8217;t do to have the instructions, warnings, legal agreements, or technical documentation perfect in one language and merely fine in the other nine.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon launches a Live Translation feature for Echo devices&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/amazon-launches-a-live-translation-feature-for-echo-devices/embed/#?secret=QNN98ffdcU" data-secret="QNN98ffdcU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lengoo started from a team working on automating that workflow between companies and translators.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next step to take obviously was automating the translation itself,&#8221; said CEO and founder Christopher Kränzler. &#8220;We&#8217;ll still need humans in the loop for a long time — the goal is to get the models to the level where&#8217;s they&#8217;re actually usable and the human has fewer translations to make.&#8221;</p>
<p>With machine learning capabilities constantly being improved, that&#8217;s not an unrealistic goal at all. Other companies have started down that road — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/deepl-schools-other-online-translators-with-clever-machine-learning/">DeepL</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/lilt-is-building-a-machine-translation-business-with-humans-at-the-core/">Lilt</a>, for instance, which made their cases by showing major improvements over Google and Microsoft frameworks, but never claiming to remove humans from the process.</p>
<p>Lengoo iterates on their work by focusing on speed and specificity — that is, making a language model that integrates all the jargon, stylistic preferences, and formatting requirements of a given client. To do this they make a custom language model by training it not just with the customer&#8217;s own documents and websites, but by continually adding in feedback from the translation process itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have an automated training pipeline for the models,&#8221; said Kränzler. The more people contribute to the correction process, the faster the process gets. Eventually we get to be about three times faster than Google or DeepL.&#8221;</p>
<p>A new client may start with a model customized on a few thousand documents from the last couple years. But whenever the model produces text that needs to be corrected, it remembers that particular correction and integrates it with the rest of its training.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111071" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lengoo-correction-diagram.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111071" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2111071" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lengoo-correction-diagram.png" alt="Diagram showing how fewer corrections are needed after the AI receives additional feedback." width="450" height="479" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lengoo-correction-diagram.png 1587w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lengoo-correction-diagram.png?resize=141,150 141w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lengoo-correction-diagram.png?resize=282,300 282w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lengoo-correction-diagram.png?resize=768,817 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lengoo-correction-diagram.png?resize=639,680 639w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lengoo-correction-diagram.png?resize=1444,1536 1444w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lengoo-correction-diagram.png?resize=47,50 47w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2111071" class="wp-caption-text">An exciting bar graph. After 30 iterations, the segments requiring no corrections have doubled, and those requiring few are much increased.</p></div></p>
<p>While the &#8220;quality&#8221; of a translation can be difficult to quantify objectively, in this case there&#8217;s no problem, because working as a human translator&#8217;s tool means there&#8217;s a quality check built right in. How good the translation is can be measured by &#8220;correction distance,&#8221; essentially the amount of changes the human has to make to the model&#8217;s suggested text. Fewer corrections not only means a better translation, but a faster one, meaning quality and speed both have objective metrics.</p>
<p>The improvements have won over customers that were leery of over-automation in the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the beginning there was resistance,&#8221; admitted Kränzler. &#8220;People turn to Google Translate for everyday translations, and they see the quality is getting better — they and DeepL have been educating the market, really. People understand now that if you do it right, machine translation works in a professional use case. A big customer may have 30, 40, 50 translators, and they each have their own style&#8230; We can make the point that we&#8217;re faster and cheaper, but also that the quality, in terms of consistency, goes up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although customizing a model with a client&#8217;s data is hardly a unique approach, Lengoo seems to have built a lead over rivals and slower large companies that can&#8217;t improve their products quick enough to keep up. And they intend to solidify that lead by revamping their tech stack.</p>
<p>The issue is that due to relying on more or less traditional machine learning technologies, the crucial translator-AI feedback loop is limited. How quickly the model is updated depends on how much use it gets, but you&#8217;re not going to retrain a large model just to integrate a few hundred more words&#8217; worth of content. It&#8217;s expensive computationally to retrain, so it can only be done sporadically.</p>
<p>But Lengoo plans to build its own, more responsive neural machine translation framework that integrates the various pipelines and processes involved. The result wouldn&#8217;t improve in real time, exactly, but would include the newest information in a much quicker and less involved way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of it as a segment by segment improvement,&#8221; said applied research lead Ahmad Taie (segments vary in size but generally are logical &#8220;chunks&#8221; of text). &#8220;You translate one segment, and by the next one, you already have the improvements made to the model.&#8221;</p>
<p>Making that key product feature better, faster, and easier to implement customer by customer is key to keeping clients on the hook, of course. And while there will likely be intense competition in this space, Kranzler doesn&#8217;t expect it to come from Google or any existing large companies, which tend to pursue an acquire-and-integrate approach rather than an agile development one.</p>

<p>As for the human expert translators, the field won&#8217;t replace them but may extend their effectiveness by, eventually, as much as an order of magnitude, which may shrink the workforce there. But if international markets continue to grow and with them the need for professional translation, they might just keep pace.</p>
<p>The $20M round, led by Inkef Capital will allow Lengoo to make the jump to North American markets as well as additional European ones, and integrate with more enterprise stacks. Existing investors Redalpine, Creathor Ventures, Techstars (out of which program the company originated), and angels Matthias Hilpert and Michael Schmitt all joined in the round, along with new investors Polipo Ventures and Volker Pyrtek.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alexa von Tobel has always felt strongly that too many people are shut out of the stock market. She felt this as a 23-year-old who didn&#8217;t have $5,000 to open a brokerage account. She felt it while building LearnVest, a financial planning startup she launched in 2009 and sold in 2015 to Northwestern Mutual for what she says was ultimately $375 million. In fact, von Tobel &#8212; who two years ago launched her<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/inspired-capital-founded-by-alexa-von-tobel-and-penny-pritzker-just-closed-its-debut-fund-with-200-million/"> own venture firm</a> with fellow entrepreneur and former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker &#8212;  cares so much about the yawning gap between investors and non-investors that she has written books about how to take control of one&#8217;s money. (Perhaps unsurprisingly, she is also a certified financial planner.)</p>
<p>Little wonder that in late January, for a podcast that von Tobel routinely hosts for Inc., she <a href="https://www.inc.com/alexa-von-tobel/robinhood-continues-its-quest-to-occupy-wall-street.html">interviewed</a> Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev about the company&#8217;s quest to make investing accessible to all. Neither foresaw what would happen days later, when a Reddit community of amateur investors didn&#8217;t try to occupy Wall Street so much as turn it upside down by using Robinhood, in part, to drive up the share price of companies like GameStop and AMC Theatres &#8212; then unwind those positions. As a 21-year-old college student who lost $150,000 over the course of several days told the outlet Vice, &#8220;This whole thing has <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5b354/this-whole-thing-has-numbed-me-to-money-gamestop-investors-after-the-crash">numbed me to money</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>What happened? Education, in the view of von Tobel, who says it never became an integrated part of bigger picture. While the GameStop saga has &#8220;brought a lot of new learnings and new things that people have to process and consider,&#8221; paramount among these is the inadequate financial training that Americans receive.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I want the tools to be democratized, where everyone can get equal access to the financial system,&#8221; said von Tobel in a lively chat with us late last week that you can <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/fintech-founder-vc-alexa-von-tobel-on-gamestop-robinhood/id1498270180?i=1000507965151">hear here</a>. &#8220;But I also want equal education, and that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re woefully falling behind as a society. It&#8217;s not taught in high schools, colleges, or grad schools. Very few schools even teach the basics.&#8221;</p>
<p>The issue only grows more important to address each year, she says. People are living longer, and they&#8217;re more responsible than ever for their financial well-being. Meanwhile, because of innovations in fintech, including at Robinhood &#8212; which became wildly popular very quickly precisely because it dispensed with many of the barriers to participating in the stock market &#8212; there is little to keep someone from making lousy decisions with outsize consequences.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s to be done? For starters, she suggests that society begin to place as much emphasis on financial health as physical wellness. &#8220;If you&#8217;re close to having a major health crisis, doctors do a really good job of saying, &#8216;Here&#8217;s all the things that you need to do to protect yourself; here&#8217;s what needs to happen. The same needs to exist in the financial world.&#8221;</p>
<p>It will take a number of stakeholders, she believes. One of these is &#8220;platforms &#8211; all of them &#8212; that provide you with [financial] tools and resources, so you can understand the kind of risks you&#8217;re taking on [to the extent] that they can provide it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another, she said, is regulators, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Created in 2010 to safeguard consumers in banking, mortgage, credit card and other financial transactions, the CFPB&#8217;s very constitutionality was called into question by the Trump administration, yet its guidance is sorely needed, suggests von Tobel. (&#8220;Regulation is always a step behind, and that&#8217;s a little bit of what we&#8217;re feeling&#8221; as a society right now.)</p>
<p>Of course, the third and biggest stakeholder of all is the U.S. educational system, says von Tobel, adding that &#8220;you need all three, working in unison&#8221; in order to have real impact.</p>
<p>As for any structural changes in the meantime that von Tobel thinks should happen &#8212; according to CNBC, for example, Robinhood is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/robinhood-lobbying-targets-legislation-that-could-hurt-its-business-model-.html">preparing to lobby against</a> a trading tax that&#8217;s been floated as a way to dampen some of the frenzied activity seen in recent weeks &#8212; she declines to &#8220;pontificate too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, she said she thinks that &#8220;getting a Citadel and everyday Americans on equal footing is where we want to end up,&#8221; and she isn&#8217;t without hope that we&#8217;ll get there.</p>
<p>For example, she thinks crypto is &#8220;here to stay&#8221; and that the infrastructure being created around it will be positive for innovators as well as end users. She&#8217;s also expecting &#8220;<a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/19349/when-will-the-self-driving-wallet-arrive">self-driving wallets</a>&#8221; that pay bills and make investments to become the new normal, and she thinks they could minimize some of the financial distress we might continue to see otherwise.</p>
<p>Considering the chaos of late, the latter almost sounds too easy, but the &#8220;wallet is simply a math equation every day,&#8221; she says. &#8220;If you have so much [money] available free, where should it go? What&#8217;s the most optimal place? It&#8217;s a math equation that updates every single hour, and I do think elements of it will be self-driving based on your goals and what you want to accomplish.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she puts it, &#8220;I can&#8217;t wait for the day that that actually exists in a way where it automates on its own. I do believe that&#8217;s the future.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://iroko.ng/">IROKO</a>, a Nigerian-based media company, could file to go public in the next 12 months on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) Alternative Investment Market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/jasonnj">Jason Njoku</a> and <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/bastian-gotter-733b6340">Bastian Gotter</a> in 2011, IROKO boasts the largest online catalog of Nollywood film content globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to this <a href="https://www.theafricareport.com/64445/nigeria-nollywood-set-to-hit-the-market-as-iroko-targets-londons-alternative-bourse/">report</a>, the media company will raise between $20 million and $30 million valuing the company at $80 million to $100 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October 2019, Njoku <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2019/10/25/irokotv-is-going-public/">hinted</a> that the company was going public either on the London Stock Exchange or a local exchange on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the CEO kept mute about the whole process the following year </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">due to how tumultuous it was for the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the company had plans to increase its average revenue per user (ARPU) in Africa for its video-on-demand service, iROKOtv, from $7-8 to $20-25</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Through the first four months of the year, it seemed IROKO was set to achieve that. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But amid pandemic-induced lockdown fears, consumer discretionary spending reduced in Nigeria and other African markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. What followed was a 70% drop in subscription numbers, and in May, <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/05/01/iroko-places-28-of-its-nigerian-staff-on-unpaid-leave/">28% of the company&#8217;s staff</a> went on unpaid leave</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But unlike the numbers iROKOtv local markets put up, its international subscribers grew 200% during the lockdown, hitting a $25-30 ARPU range</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, more bad news came in August when the CEO announced that the company was laying off 150 people. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Njoku cited the naira devaluation, regulatory onslaught by the country&#8217;s broadcast regulator, and a reduced outbound marketing team as reasons behind this decision</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the company spending $300,000 or more every month on growth, it decided to halt <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/08/31/why-iroko-done-scaling-africa/">any scaling efforts on the continent</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">IROKO instead focused on its international market, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the U.S and the U.K where it has been able to execute a 150% price increase from $25 per year to $60 per year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Njoku said to this decision set the company straight leaving it in a stronger cash position than it had been for years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The costs of pursuing Africa growth is what was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> resized </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dramatically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We were so focused on defending Africa and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ended up doing nothing. Zero marketing or anything to drive that,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;We pulled back to focus on where our economics actually makes sense. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our international business </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">organically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grew double-digit in 2020 and we expect it to continue this way for the foreseeable future</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IROKO isn&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">entirely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> giving up on the African market, instead, think of it in stealth mode. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to its dominance over the past eight years as one of the strongest independent SVOD companies in Africa, it is hard not to see the company in pole position to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">benefit from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> any improvements made on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, IROKO makes 80% of its revenue outside Africa and listing on a foreign exchange will help </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consolidate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its efforts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Njoku, the Nigerian Stock Exchange or other local exchanges do not have a history of listing early-stage tech companies; therefore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the London Stock Exchange makes more sense in the short term</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IROKO is also seeking a market cap of about $100 million, which is small for the primary market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why the media company is choosing to list on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the LSE</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A sub-market of the LSE, the AIM </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is built</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">specifically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for small-cap companies. Still, there are plans in the future for IROKO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to progress to the main market as its valuation grows &#8212; something</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> U.K sports betting company, GVC and online fashion retailer, ASOS have done in the past.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most companies when going public, tend to raise more money than their private equity days. But it&#8217;s quite different with IROKO. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company which secured around $30 million in total with its last priced round (Series E) in January 2016, plans to raise less or a similar amount when going public in 2022</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In what seems like a down round, I asked Njoku why the company isn&#8217;t planning to raise more?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We don&#8217;t need more. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, $10 million to $15 million will be for corporate development; the rest will be secondaries for shareholders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a private company, IROKO&#8217;s valuation was never priced above $70 million so anything in our target range wouldn&#8217;t be a down round at all,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Especially if you consider in that time we exited ROK for close to the total amount of capital we raised for IROKO; we have returned $11 million to early investors and shareholders already</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We still have material capital left from the ROK-Canal+ acquisition coming in every 6 months until 2023</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When IROKO sold ROK Studios to Vivendi-owned Canal+ in July 2019, the terms of the deal remained undisclosed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But from the CEO&#8217;s statement, an estimate of the acquisition could be around $30 million. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&#8217;s particularly impressive is that the proceeds from the deal likely sustained the company through a rough patch in 2020 and might well do so after its IPO in 2022</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p>Joining IROKO in plans to go public within the next two years is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/interswitch-to-revive-its-africa-venture-fund-ceo-confirms/">Interswitch</a>, a Nigerian-based payments company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/nigerias-interswitch-confirms-1b-valuation-after-visa-investment/">valued at $1 billion</a>. But u<span style="font-weight: 400;">nlike Interswitch, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2002, IROKO has been operating for just 10 years. Within that time, the only internet company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/12/african-e-commerce-startup-jumias-shares-open-at-14-50-in-nyse-ipo">to have gone public is Jumia</a>, and it did so after seven years. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">IROKO is expected to achieve this feat in its 11th year of operation and Njoku, who holds an 18% stake in the company, believes it&#8217;s enough time to take the next step</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What we can achieve in private, we can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">equally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> achieve as a public company. We will likely open up the IPO to our loyal members too so they can capture the value too, which I am super excited about. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing about IROKO is that we have always been pioneers and we&#8217;re okay being super experimental. I plan to open-source the entire process so any other African company coming behind &#8212; if we&#8217;re successful &#8212; will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">benefit from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> our experience,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; he said of the journey ahead. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter said on Wednesday it has taken actions on more than 500 accounts and reduced visibility of some hashtags in India to comply with &#8220;several&#8221; orders from the Indian government after New Delhi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/india-sends-warning-to-twitter-over-lifting-block-on-accounts-and-noncompliance-of-order/">threatened legal action against executives with American social network</a>.</p>
<p>Twitter had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/twitter-restricts-over-a-dozen-high-profile-accounts-in-india-following-legal-demand/">suspended hundreds of Twitter accounts</a>, several with links to farmers&#8217; protests on agricultural reforms, at the request of New Delhi early last week, but then reversed its decision within hours citing users&#8217; freedom of speech. The company said on Wednesday that it was re-suspending most of those accounts, in some cases, permanently, and preventing certain terms from appearing in the Trends section.</p>
<p>The company said Twitter handles are only being blocked in India and will remain visible outside of the country as it believes orders by the Indian government are inconsistent with local law. It also said that no accounts belonging to news media entities, journalists, activists, and politicians were taken down. &#8220;To do so, we believe, would violate their fundamental right to free expression under Indian law. We informed MeitY [Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology] of our enforcement actions today,&#8221; it said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Over the course of the last 10 days, Twitter has been served with several separate blocking orders by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India, under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act,&#8221; the company <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_in/topics/company/2020/twitters-response-indian-government.html">wrote in a blog post.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Out of these, two were emergency blocking orders that we temporarily complied with but subsequently restored access to the content in a manner that we believe was consistent with Indian law. After we communicated this to MeitY, we were served with a non-compliance notice,&#8221; the San Francisco-headquartered firm added.</p>
<p>Millions of farmers have been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-farms-protests/tractors-trucks-block-indias-roads-as-farm-protests-widen-idUSKBN2A605V">protesting New Delhi&#8217;s new laws</a> for more than two months. Twitter, which reaches more than 75 million users through its apps in India, has emerged as the single-most important online forum for people seeking to voice their opinion on this subject.</p>
<p>Singer Rihanna, who has more followers on Twitter than any Indian actor or politician, tweeted a CNN news story last week about the protests and asked “why aren’t we talking about this!?” The Indian government maintains that the new laws are aimed at helping farmers and consumers by streamlining the agricultural supply chain. New Delhi also temporarily shut internet services near the protests in and around national capital last month.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">why aren’t we talking about this?! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FarmersProtest?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FarmersProtest</a> <a href="https://t.co/obmIlXhK9S">https://t.co/obmIlXhK9S</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Rihanna (@rihanna) <a href="https://twitter.com/rihanna/status/1356625889602199552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Several users had also tweeted using the hashtag #modiplanningfarmersgenocide that were aimed at New Delhi&#8217;s agriculture reforms. The company said several accounts and hashtags violated the Twitter Rules, particularly inciting violence, abuse, wishes of harm, and threats that could trigger the risk of offline harm.</p>
<p>A Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch that hashtags that were merely supporting farmers or their protests have not been restricted.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/twitter-restricts-over-a-dozen-high-profile-accounts-in-india-following-legal-demand/">one of its orders to Twitter earlier this month</a>, India had expressed concerns that many users were sharing false and intimidatory statements and provocative messages. During its brief period of compliance with the order last week, Twitter had suspended handles of several high-profile accounts such as The Caravan (a news outlet that conducts investigative journalism), political commentator Sanjukta Basu, activist Hansraj Meena, actor Sushant Singh, Shashi Shekhar Vempati, chief executive of state-run broadcasting agency Prasar Bharti, and at least two politicians with Aam Aadmi Party — Preeti Sharma Menon and Jarnail Singh — that governs the National Capital Territory of Delhi were also blocked.</p>
<p>After Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/twitter-restricts-over-a-dozen-high-profile-accounts-in-india-following-legal-demand/">lifted the block</a>, New Delhi issued a more serious warning to Twitter and its executives, citing the nation&#8217;s Section 69A, which allows &#8220;punishment with an imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fines.&#8221; New Delhi said that Twitter cannot &#8220;assume the role of a court and justify non-compliance&#8221; in India.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue to advocate for the right of free expression on behalf of the people we serve and are actively exploring options under Indian law — both for Twitter and for the accounts that have been impacted. We remain committed to safeguarding the health of the conversation occurring on Twitter, and strongly believe that the Tweets should flow,&#8221; the company said today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a large win for the Korean startup ecosystem, dating powerhouse Match Group <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/match-group-to-acquire-hyperconnect-301225320.html">announced this afternoon</a> that it would buy social networking company Hyperconnect for a combined cash and stock deal valued at $1.73 billion.</p>
<p>Hyperconnect, which is projected to have $200 million in revenue in 2020 (up 50% from 2019) according to the company, offers two apps — Azar and Hakuna Live — which allow users to connect to each other across language barriers. The two are complementary, with Azar focused on one-to-one video chats and Hakuna Live focused on the online live broadcast market. In their press statement, the companies noted that 75% of Hyperconnect’s revenue originates in Asia.</p>
<p>It’s the largest acquisition to date by Match Group, which also owns the popular dating apps Tinder and Hinge along with many other assorted properties.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One theme of the acquisition and Hyperconnect’s story is technology. The company built what it describes as “<a href="https://hyperconnect.com/en/tech/">the first mobile version</a>” of <a href="https://webrtc.org">WebRTC</a>, a now well-developed standard that is designed to offer resilient peer-to-peer connections between users without relying on a company to serve as a middleman server.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="r5Psvy0trb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/28/1123773/">The WebRTC Race Begins Today</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The WebRTC Race Begins Today&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/28/1123773/embed/#?secret=r5Psvy0trb" data-secret="r5Psvy0trb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For instance, a video chat between two participants would be transmitted directly between the two of them using WebRTC, without the video being broadcast through Hyperconnect&#8217;s servers. That&#8217;s designed to improve reliability by removing latency while also reducing the cost of bandwidth for the service to Hyperconnect. WebRTC is now a well-deployed open-source standard, with companies <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/webrtc-the-technology-that-powers-google-meet-hangout-facebook-messenger-and-discord-cb926973d786">such as Google using it in products like Google Meet</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to its innovative work on WebRTC, Hyperconnect built infrastructure to support two users who speak and text in different languages to interact with each other directly through its apps using real-time translation. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/hyperconnect">In a marketing post on Google Cloud</a>, Hyperconnect is a marquee customer of the cloud service’s speech, real-time translation and messaging APIs.</p>
<p>In the companies’ joint press statement, both sides emphasized R&amp;D and engineering as key wins for the deal. That begs the question then what Match Group is looking to build with its massive new purchase? While the group has largely confined itself to dating, live broadcast and other media verticals may well be in its sights once it acquires the technology from Hyperconnect.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close in 2021Q2.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://openocean.vc/">OpenOcean</a>, a European VC which has tended to specialise in big data-oriented startups and deep tech, has reach the €92 million ($111.5 million) mark for its third main venture fund, and is aiming for a final close of €130 million by mid-way this year. LPs in the new fund include the European Investment Fund (EIF), Tesi, pension funds, major family offices and Oxford University’s Corpus Christi College.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katya-almasque-vc/?originalSubdomain=uk">Ekaterina Almasque</a> — who has already led investments in IQM (superconducting quantum machines) and <a href="https://sunlight.io">Sunlight.io</a> (multi-cloud hyper-converged infrastructure) and is leading the London team and operations for the firm — has been appointed as general partner. Before joining, Almasque was a managing director at Samsung Catalyst Fund in Europe, led investments in Graphcore’s processor for Artificial Intelligence, Mapillary’s layer for rapid mapping and AIMotive’s autonomous driving stack.</p>
<p>The enormous wealth of data in the modern world means the next generation of software is being built at the infrastructure. Thus, the fund said it would invest primarily at the Series A level with initial investments of €3 million to €5 million, across OpenOcean’s principle areas of artificial intelligence, application-driven data infrastructure, intelligent automation and open source.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>OpenOcean’s team includes Michael “Monty” Widenius, the “spiritual father” of MariaDB, and one of the original developers of MySQL, the predecessor to MariaDB; Tom Henriksson, who invested in MySQL and MariaDB; as well as Ralf Wahlsten and Patrik Backman.</p>
<p>Tom Henriksson, general partner at OpenOcean, commented: “Ekaterina… brings an immense amount of expertise to the team and exemplifies the way we want to support our founders. Fund 2020 is an important step for OpenOcean, with prestigious LPs trusting our approach and our knowledge, and believing in our ability to identify the very best data solutions and infrastructure technologies in Europe.”</p>
<p>Almasque said: “The next five years will be critical for digital infrastructure, as breakthrough technologies are currently being constrained by the capabilities of the stack. Enabling this next level of infrastructure innovation is crucial to realising digitisation projects across the economy and will determine what the internet of the future looks like. We’re excited by the potential of world-leading businesses being built across Europe and are looking forward to supporting the next generation of software leaders.”</p>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch she added: “It&#8217;s very rare to find such a VC so deep in the stack which also invested in one of the first unicorns in Europe and really built the open source ecosystem globally. So for me, this was absolutely an interesting team to join. And what OpenOcean was doing since inception in 2011 was very unique among pioneering ecosystems, such as big data analytics… and it remains very pioneering, pushing the frontiers in artificial intelligence and now quantum computing. This is what really attracts me, and I think there is a very, very big future.”</p>
<p>In an interview Henriksson told me: “What we are seeing is that our economy is shifting more and more towards the digital, data-driven economy. It started with few industries, but now we see a larger shift, including new industries like healthcare, like manufacturing.”</p>
<p>Asked about the effects of the pandemic on the sector, he said: “Obviously we see a lot of startups who are plugging into things like the UiPath platform. This is very relevant for the pandemic. Because the companies that had started automating strongly before the pandemic hit… they&#8217;ve actually accelerated and they find benefits for their teams and organisations and actually the people are happier because they have better automation technologies in place. The ones that didn&#8217;t start before [the pandemic hit] they&#8217;re a little behind now.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA has <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-contract-to-launch-initial-elements-for-lunar-outpost">announced</a> that SpaceX will take two major parts of the Gateway lunar orbiter that will function as a pit stop for future moon missions. The Power and Propulsion Element and Habitation and Logistics Outpost — which together will form the first usable lunar space station — will go up in 2024 on a Falcon Heavy, with an estimated price tag of $332 million.</p>
<p>The Falcon Heavy, which provides a far larger lift capacity than SpaceX&#8217;s now commonly used Falcon 9, has only had two commercial launches since its successful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Bd8lN0gwN0">test launch in early 2018</a> (with Starman and a Tesla Roadster, you may remember). Arabsat-6A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/trifecta-spacex-launches-first-mission-on-falcon-heavy-and-lands-all-three-boosters/">launched in April of 2019</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/24/spacex-successfully-launches-falcon-heavy-rocket-with-two-flight-proven-booster-cores/">STP-2 a few months later</a>, but since then the Heavy hasn&#8217;t seen any action. (Several missions are planned for the next year, however.)</p>
<p>NASA&#8217;s selection of the launch vehicle as the one that will bring these two crucial components to lunar orbit is a huge endorsement, however, and may actually snowball into more work down the line if the agency&#8217;s own Space Launch System continues to be delayed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The PPE and HALO, as the two pieces are called, provide the essentials for a self-sustaining lunar orbital habitat: essentially the pressurized cabin and the power source that keeps it operational and allows maneuvering. So you could say they&#8217;re fundamental.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re also big, and can&#8217;t be sent up in 10 different pieces on smaller rockets. But there are precious few heavy launch vehicles available — and it looks like they decided that SpaceX&#8217;s was the best bet, having flown three successful missions already.</p>
<p>This mission is valued at $332 million in launch and related costs, so it&#8217;s a serious investment that will require a lot of collaboration between SpaceX, NASA, Northrop Grumman (which is building the HALO) and Maxar (making the PPE).</p>

Not particularly roomy, but you can&#8217;t beat the view. Image: NASA</p></div></p>
<p>For now launch is set for no earlier than may of 2024, but that date may (and in fact is highly likely to) slip as various delays accrue. The whole Artemis program is experiencing a period of reality alignment, and while new target dates haven&#8217;t been given for all the ambitious plans made during the last four years, few of the old ones have been repeated the way they were as recently as last fall. Nevertheless even a five or six-year plan to return to the moon&#8217;s surface is still quite ambitious, considering — as has become the standard NASA refrain — &#8220;we&#8217;re going there to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll likely hear more about the new timeline as the agency comes to grips with it itself over the next few months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic has upended many aspects of urban life but perhaps the most visible upheaval is to citydwellers&#8217; social lives, with curfews calling time on traditional night life across much of the Western world and social distancing putting a chilly spin on opportunities for getting together with people outside your usual circle. Who knew leaving the house was going to seem like such a mission?</p>
<p>Opportunities to escape the city entirely &#8212; such as by jetting off somewhere &#8212; remain severely limited or even impossible right now, depending on where you live. And for many urbanites COVID-19 may feel as if it&#8217;s turned the advantages of city living on its head, despite lockdowns generally not being as hard-line as they were at times last year and vaccines now (slowly) being rolled out.</p>
<p><a href="https://sharifyapp.com/en/">Sharify</a> is a startup that reckons it can help with the weird flatness of pandemic city living. It&#8217;s a real-time events app (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/sharify-la-ciudad-está-viva/id1361789529">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.sharifyapplabs.sharify&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a>) that wants to bring back a little of the serendipitous joy of urban living by making it easier to discovery things going on around you — maybe even just a few blocks away. To do this it&#8217;s combined real-time event listings with a map view (via the medium of emoji-style icons plus filters) to quickly and cheerfully surround you with stuff that&#8217;s happening in the vicinity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CjcOwQ291U"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/23/work-trips-are-making-a-5-billion-comeback/">Work trips are making a $5 billion comeback</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Work trips are making a $5 billion comeback&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/23/work-trips-are-making-a-5-billion-comeback/embed/#?secret=CjcOwQ291U" data-secret="CjcOwQ291U" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Though the business idea predates COVID-19, Sharify isn&#8217;t blind to the changes wrought by the pandemic. And the app displays a star icon next to events that are deemed COVID-19 &#8216;safe’ &#8212; a subtle promotion meaning the organizer has measures in place to reduce the risk of contagion, such as controlling venue capacity, providing disinfectant hand gel and ensuring tables/seating are safety spaced. (Which may well be legal requirements for a venue to be open for business, of course.)</p>
<p>At the same time, the app lets users share their own meeting plan with other users &#8212; potentially encouraging a bunch of strangers to meet up to play some music or hang out in the park or whatnot &#8212; so its appropriateness for the pandemic moment in which we find ourselves does depend on how you use it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s open to social swings or roundabouts, you could say. (And limits on when/how clubs and bars can open may well be pushing a socially oriented and app-savvy demographic toward alternative ways (and tools) to mingle with strangers.)</p>
<p>More broadly, Sharify invites users to rethink the concept of travel and trips &#8212; asking them to refocus their attention and energy on discovering entertaining things to do without having to go far or plan far ahead. Because, well, what else can anyone really do right now? Apart from stay at home ofc.</p>
<p>The app does have two &#8216;view&#8217; modes: One for events geared towards locals and/or a dedicated &#8216;tourist&#8217; view to cater to those wanting to do more typical sightseeing &#8212; though content for the latter is obviously thinner on the ground at the moment. (And, well, &#8216;tourism&#8217; as a concept is starting to feel rather quaint and old-fashioned vs properly exploring your own backyard.)</p>
<p>Officially Sharify is launched in Barcelona, Madrid and New York City &#8212; but says it&#8217;s &#8220;expanding quickly&#8221; and touts being &#8220;present&#8221; in 25+ cities around the world (presumably with a lighter events cadence vs those three).</p>
<p>I tested the app in Barcelona and quickly found a bunch of local events that looked interesting &#8212; at least compared to another night of thumbing through the Netflix catalogue &#8212; from a Banksy art exhibition, to a stand up comedy show (in English!), lots of theatre, a bunch of markets, yoga classes and a skateboarding event all going on within, at most, a couple of miles and days from where I&#8217;ve been spending the vast majority of my time for, like, almost a whole entire year.</p>
<p>Just the act of seeing stuff <em>still going on</em> in a city which, frankly, hasn&#8217;t felt very familiar or open for much of anything for close to 12 months was a bit of an eye opener.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2111138,2111139,2111137,2111136"]</p>
<p>After so much time locked down indoors maybe we all need a bit of a nudge/visual reminder that life is still going on &#8212; and socializing is still possible (with appropriate safety measures and distancing) &#8212; beyond the front door and away from the Zoom screen (or any other screen tbh). Even if I&#8217;m not about to sign up for everything I spotted in the app. But feeling like I <em>could</em> is almost exciting enough.</p>
<p>As well as providing key details about each event (when, where, any website etc), Sharify lets you signal an intent to go that&#8217;s visible to other users by &#8216;joining&#8217; an event. It also hosts per event chat where those who have joined are invited to &#8220;talk to people who join the plan&#8221; &#8212; which is another neat little nudge to get users excited about going to a local thing, maybe without their usual friend group in tow.</p>
<p>Sharify isn&#8217;t disclosing how many users it has but it says it has 100,000+ monthly event views (3K+ daily), and 5,000+ events every month. (On Google Play the app has had 10,000+ installs.)</p>
<p>Where users create their own plans to advertise to others it touts an impressively high &#8220;join&#8221; rate of 95%. (Albeit saying you&#8217;re going to something you found via an app isn&#8217;t the same as actually turning up.)</p>
<p>To encourage users to discover and attend others&#8217; events, Sharify displays a smilie face on the map in locations where several people are up for &#8216;sharing plans&#8217; &#8212; listing the number of people theoretically up for joining in stuff around there and nudging you to &#8216;create a plan in this area&#8217; to tap into that potential guest pool.</p>
<p>It also lets you drill down to check out micro profiles of these (public) socially interested locals &#8212; displaying a first name, perhaps a photo and any &#8216;interests&#8217; if they&#8217;ve chosen to select some from its curated lists of culture, hobbies, sports and social activities etc. (Happily there&#8217;s no option to message individual users via their profile so no fear of stupid in-app spam.)</p>
<p>Location-based and social sharing is not new, of course. Indeed, it’s an idea that&#8217;s been around the tech block so many times the sound of a &#8216;real-time events map&#8217; probably triggers a fuzzy feeling of &#8216;haven&#8217;t I seen this before somewhere?’ The deja vu may be real but context is ever shifting, is the point. Or, to put it another way, here and now, in an open-ended pandemic, going about finding something to do probably looks and feels quite a bit different to how you did it, pre-March 2020.</p>
<p>Put simply: Best laid plans are toast. Friends who don&#8217;t live in the same city are likely reachable only on Zoom or by text. And at very least you’re dealing with hard limits on how far you can range for your entertainment in time and space.</p>
<p>Local and/or virtual is the new global, all of a sudden. So Sharify reckons its real-time events map is just the ticket/tonic in this curtailed context &#8212; by cheerfully surrounding you with nearby stuff to do. The 2017-founded startup says it&#8217;s been growing &#8220;despite&#8221; the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re stuck at home, and we saw all the Netflix series. Is there any plan near my home for this afternoon? Event agendas simply don&#8217;t work in this user case. That&#8217;s why we built a real-time map,&#8221; says co-founder and CEO Gemma Prenafeta. &#8220;And the problem we will face in some months from now: I&#8217;m not stuck at home anymore. Where do I find new events easily?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As Sharify is a collaborative platform, we let people share their own events for free, we scrape different event sources such as Google and Tiqets, and we highlight those businesses that want to promote themselves,&#8221; she adds, giving a succinct explainer on how the app populates the map view with stuff to do.</p>
<p>Social maps aren&#8217;t new, of course &#8212; and features like Snap Map, which was added to Snap&#8217;s social network via its acquisition of Zenly, certainly has a bit of overlap (while Sharify&#8217;s smiley octopus logo on a yellow background has more than a little of Snap&#8217;s ghost in look and feel), though Snap Map is more obviously focused on friends&#8217; location and social sharing vs Sharify being about event discovery, first and foremost. (Friends may follow from this real-life socializing, is the suggestion.)</p>
<p>There are also event discovery network startups (like calendar-focused IRL). But, again, with such a glance-friendly map view, Sharify is paying closer attention to immediacy/hyper-local event discovery vs IRL &#8212; which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/streaming-events-calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/streaming-events-calendar/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612983354970000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG2ZAgydUaVguFCdskQ8rbG150y3A">pivoted to helping people surface virtual events</a> as the pandemic shuttered lots of real world events last year and has since focused on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/now-with-over-10m-monthly-users-irl-turns-its-events-website-into-a-social-network/">building out its own social network</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;immediacy&#8217; factor is key at Sharify, as you can see what&#8217;s happening, in real-time,&#8221; says Prenafeta. &#8220;We say going to a local event is a kind of &#8216;Local Trip&#8217;. Traveling before was about taking flights, now it&#8217;s about taking a Bird or a eCooltra to an event nearby.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether mapping real-time events is a standalone business or a feature/tool that could just be added to a dominant platform/social network is perhaps a more pressing question for this fledgling startup. And it&#8217;s notable that tech (and mapping) giant Google added a &#8216;Community Feed&#8217; to Maps late <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/google-maps-takes-on-facebook-with-its-own-news-feed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/google-maps-takes-on-facebook-with-its-own-news-feed/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612983354970000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGvMhNyTTXE8I0LwcjFbb4BXX__JQ">last year</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook has also had an &#8216;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/events/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612983354970000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGeY3dtzOSQTWT1x__S1Q5FpMimIw">Events Near Me</a>&#8216; feature on its platform for years. Albeit, anything listed inside its walled garden has to contend with all the baggage Facebook brings with it. So an indie app with a fresh approach should have a chance to attract users who wouldn&#8217;t be caught dead on Facebook (even in a pandemic).</p>
<p>Sharify has certainly come up with a really effortless way to spark a sense of possibility &#8212; to <em>feel</em> like you can cut through the monotony of lockdown life &#8212; just by firing up a super simple overview of stuff going on around you.</p>
<p>It then layers on some more powerful tools that are designed to help you find others to do stuff with, which adds a subtle but maybe deeper hook in these socially distanced times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Life is still pretty locked down, and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s more important than ever to know what&#8217;s open and what isn&#8217;t, close to our house,&#8221; suggests Prenafeta. And, well, it&#8217;s pretty hard to argue with that.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s looking beyond the pandemic too &#8212; back to more normalcy and anticipating helping local businesses announce their reopenings, once that&#8217;s possible. The team is &#8220;currently working on a seed investment round to prepare for the post-pandemic momentum&#8221;, she says.</p>
<p>So far the Barcelona-based startup has raised a pre-seed and an angel round led by IESE Group, per Prenafeta &#8212; with a total of €501,000 (~$600k) invested to date into what has turned out to be a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/23/location-vs-communication/">contextually fresh twist</a> on the old <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/03/24/die-solomo-die/?_ga=2.181080743.1271714929.1612696774-1757155993.1533833482">SoMoLo</a> trend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hyundai Motor Group is back with a new &#8220;walking car&#8221; robot that can use its wheels to roll along a path or stand up and navigate tougher terrain on its legs. This time, the concept is designed to carry cargo and is small enough to be carried by a drone.</p>
<p>The TIGER robot — short for transforming intelligent ground excursion robot — is the first &#8220;uncrewed&#8221; ultimate mobility vehicle (UMV) concept to come out of New Horizons Studio, the Mountain View, California facility that is home to Hyundai Motor Group&#8217;s UMV development. Tiger follows in the wheeled-footsteps of Elevate, a larger concept vehicle designed to carry people that the company unveiled in 2019 at the CES tech trade show.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111210" style="width: 1182px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111210" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2111210 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg" alt="Hyundai walking elevate robot" width="1172" height="649" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg 1172w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg?resize=768,425 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg?resize=680,377 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1172px) 100vw, 1172px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2111210" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screenshot/Hyundai</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While concepts don&#8217;t always translate into real products, New Horizons Studio head John Suh told TechCrunch that his aim is to bring Tiger to life &#8220;as soon as possible,&#8221; adding that it would likely be a five-year process.</p>
<p>Suh said the team will spend the next two years focused on solving some core technical problems to establish a baseline design. In 2023 and 2024, the team will get to the beta-product stage and advanced testing will begin before finally becoming a product customers can buy.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s version of the Tiger is based on a modular platform architecture, just like its larger cousin. The robot has a leg and wheel locomotion system, 360-degree directional control, a storage bay that can carry goods and a range of sensors for remote observation. It&#8217;s also designed to connect to a drone, which can charge the robot while flying it to its destination.</p>
<p>The Tiger has two modes that are deployed depending on the terrain. On smoother, less complex surfaces, the robot&#8217;s legs retract and the vehicle uses all four wheels to move. If the vehicle gets stuck or faces an obstacle like a small wall, berm or log, it can stand up, lock the wheels and then walk.</p>
<p>This is the first version of Tiger — known as X-1 for experimental — suggesting New Horizons will be bringing out more variants in the future. This one was created in partnership with engineering design software company Autodesk and concept design firm Sundberg-Ferar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What, you are no doubt asking, is a worm a blob? Well, it’s a blob of worms, obviously. More specifically, it’s a blob of California blackworms. It’s not a flock, nor a swam nor a school. It’s a big, undulating mass of a Lumbriculus variegatus tangled up, but somehow moving as one.</p>
<p>Roboticists, of course, have a long, storied history of drawing inspiration from nature. This time out, a team <a href="https://www.newswise.com/articles/collective-worm-and-robot-blobs-protect-individuals-swarm-together?ta=home">at Georgia Tech</a> studied the aforementioned worm blob in hopes of learning gaining insight into its unusual form of locomotion. The researchers believe they can apply some of the learnings to rethink the way robots move.</p>
<p>The team published its findings in an academic journal earlier this month. According to the research, the blobs &#8212; which range from 10 to 50,000 individual organisms &#8212; are a kind of survival mechanism to adapt to things like changing temperatures. A few individuals are capable of moving the larger group, with around two or three being required to move a group of five.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed-vimeo embed breakout embed--video" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/510314087" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>The researchers set up a series of six 3D-printed robots with two arms and two light sensors a piece. Mesh and pins on the arms allowed the robots to become entangled with one another.</p>
<p>“Depending on the intensity, the robots try to move away from the light,” researcher Yasemin Ozkan-Aydin said in a release tied to the news. While there was no direct communication between the robots, they effectively operated as a group. “They generate emergent behavior that is similar to what we saw in the worms.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111163" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111163" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2111163" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg?resize=1536,1022 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg?resize=2048,1362 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111163" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Georgia Tech</p></div></p>
<p>The scientists think that sort of collective action can be applied to make individual robots more collaborative and cohesive units. “Often people want to make robot swarms do specific things, but they tend to be operating in pristine environments with simple situations,” Professor Daniel Goldman says of the research. “With these blobs, the whole point is that they work only because of physical interaction among the individuals. That’s an interesting factor to bring into robotics.”</p>
