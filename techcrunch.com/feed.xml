										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile website building platform <a href="https://onuniverse.com/">Universe</a> has launched a new update that brings advanced creative controls, enhanced themes, block features and more to its grid-based web builder. Universe allows users to create a custom site or open an e-commerce store directly from a mobile phone through a simplified grid system without the need for coding. The new update, GRID System II, aims to simplify previously complex coding processes into intuitive gestures to make the website-building process easier.</p>
<p>“What makes Universe special is the grid system and what we’re announcing today is a big upgrade of that grid system. It’s going to allow people to do a lot more without any technical knowledge,” Universe CEO and founder Joseph Cohen told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>The website building process is based on simple building blocks where the platform gives users a wide grid that they can drop content into. The new update brings redesigned creative controls with an improved graphical interface, which allows for control around block padding in the grid, along with granular text spacing. Cohen stated that users are now able to make the grid denser and can go up to seven columns wide. The new interface also includes enhanced color selection tools.</p>
<p>Further, Universe users can now also select from 30 new themes for their site or create their own. Prior to the addition of themes, every block was independently styled on a case-by-case basis. Now with the introduction of themes, users are able to apply consistent design elements across fonts, page backgrounds and button colors. The themes are applied to all surfaces of users’ sites, including text, backgrounds, headlines and colors.</p>
<p>“We have made 30 amazing themes that you can apply to your whole site. You could also go in and create your own theme from scratch. You can match or customize any of the ones that we give you out of the box. And any of the changes that you make will be applicable to your whole site. It&#8217;s basically a way of changing all the styles across the whole site in a visual and easy-to-use way,” Cohen stated.</p>
<p>Users can also now access new text styles, which allow them to classify text as titles, subtitles, captions and more. The company outlines that users can use the title indicator to boost SEO and enhance accessibility for their sites.</p>
<p>The new update also introduces a new layers feature that allows users to overlay blocks on top of each other. Previously, creators were unable to put two blocks, such as an image block and text block, on top of each other. With this new layers feature, users are given a lot more creative freedom with the design of their website.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Universe has also launched a new grid block feature that allows creators to combine different blocks in a sub-grid to create a cluster. It essentially lets you add a block to your site that creates another grid within that block, which can be used to add things like a photo gallery. Grid blocks allow for precise block arrangements to be placed on the grid. The sub-grid can then be dragged to any location on the page.</p>
<p>Although some may see Universe as a competitor to other popular website-building tools such as Shopify and Wix, Cohen says Universe is quite different.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212174" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FINAL_GRIID_Subgrid_Phone-Only.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212174" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2212174" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FINAL_GRIID_Subgrid_Phone-Only.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2212174" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Universe</p></div></p>
<p>“We invented a new interface called the grid, which basically allows someone who isn&#8217;t technical or isn&#8217;t a professional designer to create a totally custom website. There are other systems like Squarespace, Shopify, Weebly and Wix, but those are website builders that are desktop-based and template-based. Universe is not template-based, we do have templates available but it is not a template-based system. It&#8217;s not constrained by templates, so the grid itself is our interface for creation.”</p>
<p>In terms of usage, Cohen outlined that Universe has seen an increase in users amid the COVID-19 pandemic as many people started new businesses or side hustles and were looking to create websites. Early on in the pandemic, Universe released the ability for users to sell and ship products on their sites. As a result, users aren’t required to sign up for a third-party e-commerce tool, such as Shopify.</p>
<p>“Since the pandemic started, our business has really ballooned over the past year and a half. In terms of overall growth, we have more or less 10x the business in terms of the number of active sites that are created,” Cohen noted.</p>
<p>Further, Cohen outlined that Universe saw an increase in users from the influencer community who want a “link in bio” site, which is essentially a URL at the end of an Instagram profile&#8217;s bio that redirects users to a website outside of Instagram. The redirected site is often used to sell products, link to other social media accounts, showcase a portfolio and more. Cohen said <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">that 40 percent of the sites created on Universe are for “link in bio” purposes and that these types of sites are Universe’s biggest growing areas of business, in addition to commerce.</span></p>
<p>Cohen says that Universe currently has hundreds of thousands of active sites and that the company plans to continue to launch more consumer-friendly updates in the future as the platform continues to grow.</p>
<p>“With this update, we’re leaping forward but we will continue to iterate this grid system for decades and in the fullness of time, anything that’s possible on the internet will be possible with our grid system. This includes the core creative elements but also the commerce capabilities around building a business,” Cohen stated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s stock took a dive Monday as the site suffered one of its worst outages of the past decade with services across its entire suite of products going offline while the tech company struggled to even bring its own internal services back online.</p>
<p>The stock ended the day down nearly 5%, with Facebook shedding tens of billions in market cap value as the company sorted through the pieces attempting to diagnose what triggered the outage, and investors looked to calculate what lasting damage to the site could look like. Facebook stock has been on a tear in 2021, reaching a $1 trillion market cap in early July, though the share price has stalled in recent months with the market cap currently resting just south of $920 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GraphWear, a company pursuing needle-free approaches to glucose monitoring, has closed a $20.5 million Series B round. This series B round is a vote of confidence by investors in GraphWear’s approach: to monitor key metrics in the body, like glucose, without breaking the skin at all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GraphWear Technologies was founded in 2015 by Rajatesh Gudibande and Saurabh Radhakrishnan, who had both completed master’s degrees in nanotechnology at the University of Pennsylvania. Specifically, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">GraphWear is developing a skin-surface level wearable made of graphene (more on this material later). The sensor is small, about the size of an Apple Watch – but the key piece of technology is actually housed on the bottom. It’s a thin slice of graphene that fits onto the back of the watch, or onto a sticker that can be worn on the abdomen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This series B round, says Gudibande, will be focused on helping the company build upon previous validation studies of the wearable, completing a pivotal trial, and submitting for FDA clearance. The round was led by Mayfield with participation from MissionBio Capital, Builders VC and VSC Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Holy Grail problem has been: can you really know what is happening in your blood without using things to prick your skin and draw blood out,” says Ursheet Parikh the co-leader of Mayfield&#8217;s engineering biology investment practice. “We think GraphWear has made progress and is likely to be one of the first companies to actually bring a product that can get to hundreds of millions of people.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuous glucose monitoring has been a recent push within the diabetes community. There have been several continuous glucose monitors approved in recent years, like the FreeStyle Libre, <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpma/pma.cfm?id=P160030">approved by the FDA in 2017</a>. That device still uses a  subcutaneous filament on an arm patch to measure glucose levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These devices have clear upsides for people with Type I diabetes (people whose bodies make little or no insulin). That’s about </span><a href="https://www.diabetes.org/resources/statistics/statistics-about-diabetes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.6 million people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the US alone. The American Diabetes Association notes that most people who regularly inject insulin “should be encouraged” to use self-monitoring glucose technologies, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">including </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">continuous glucose monitors, in </span><a href="https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/43/Supplement_1/S77"><span style="font-weight: 400;">its 2020 guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for people with Type II diabetes (</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/type2.html#:~:text=Healthy%20eating%20is%20your%20recipe,adults%20are%20also%20developing%20it."><span style="font-weight: 400;">about 34 million Americans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), or for people who don’t regularly inject insulin, there’s a bit more debate. <a href="https://khn.org/news/article/continuous-glucose-monitoring-blood-sugar-little-evidence-beneficial-type-2-diabetes-patients/">Some argue</a> that regularly monitoring glucose (which is what continuous glucose monitors do) isn&#8217;t worth it for these populations.  For example <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2630691">one 2017</a> <em>JAMA Internal Medicine </em>study found that routine self-monitoring of glucose didn&#8217;t lead people to improve their A1c levels (a key diabetes biomarker) after one year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That study, though, evaluated people who regularly used finger-stick tests, rather than non-invasive continuous glucose monitors. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the American Diabetes Association still </span><a href="https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/43/Supplement_1/S77"><span style="font-weight: 400;">notes that</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, if used properly, continuous glucose monitors in conjunction with insulin therapy, can be useful tools for these people as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GraphWear’s sensor takes a nanotechnology-based approach to continuous glucose monitoring. And, unlike other continuous glucose monitors, which may require a small retractable filament or finger sticks to evaluate blood glucose, the device doesn’t break the skin at all, says Gudibande. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The graphene has an electric field that drags the molecules up,” Gudibande explains. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re talking about about 200 molecules,” he continues. “It then ‘tastes’ it, converts it to an electrical signal, and then transports via Bluetooth your phone that can chart and display glucose values continuously.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that these sensors are actually measuring the glucose present in interstitial fluid, not the glucose present in blood. However, there’s evidence glucose measured from the interstitial fluid </span><a href="http://v"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“correlates well with plasma glucose”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, per the American Diabetes Association’s 2020 guidelines, so measurements taken this way are still clinically relevant for people with diabetes. Gudibande adds &#8220;our own empirical clinical data suggests the same.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graphwear has already completed one </span><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04226846"><span style="font-weight: 400;">feasibility study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the wearable sensor on 40 patients with both Type I and Type II diabetes. They tested the device’s glucose monitoring against glucose measures collected from venous blood draws. Results have not yet been released. However, Gudibande says that GraphWear’s accuracy was “comparable” to that of the traditional sensor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glucose monitoring aside, another big picture element to consider when it comes to GraphWear is the material the sensor is made of: graphene. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graphene is a single-atom thin carbon sheet. It happens to be an </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2014.14676"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exceptional conductor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of electricity, and is strong, light, and flexible. Since graphene was <a href="https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200910/physicshistory.cfm#:~:text=The%20man%20who%20first%20discovered,State%20Physics%20in%20Chernogolovka%2C%20Russia.">discovered in 2004</a>, the material has generated a lot of hype – it was </span><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/click_online/9491789.stm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supposed to be the next silicon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though that hasn’t quite happened yet.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still the </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/27/graphene-wonder-material-national-security-china-uk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UK</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, China, and </span><a href="https://graphene-flagship.eu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the EU</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are investing heavily in production of graphene at an industrial scale. And there are some graphene products leaking on the market already (it’s in bikes, shoes, sensors and tennis rackets, to name a few applications highlighted in a </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-019-0555-2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 review paper)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GraphWear can keep the graphene used in its sensors “pristine,” says Gudibande, which allows it to be highly sensitive to glucose molecules that it may encounter. The company, says Parikh, can also manufacture the material at scale, and is developing new applications of nanotechnology that could be useful beyond sensing glucose. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, the team has patented a way to </span><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2017216641A3/en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">polarized fluids as transistors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If your glucose molecules are on the skin, it becomes like a transient transistor that shows up,” says Parikh. “That is a new class of transistor, and that’s a fundamental innovation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The glucose monitoring, though, is a smart first step for the company, because there&#8217;s a decently clear pathway to approval. If the company’s upcoming pivotal trial demonstrates that it’s similar to other continuous glucose monitors it could pursue FDA 510(k) clearance. Though, as Gudibande acknowledges, there could be some unforeseen pitfalls. For instance, it&#8217;s possible that GraphWear&#8217;s noninvasive approach could put it in a class of its own. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So there’s a risk to that, of whether we will be 510(k),” Gudibande says. “But the process for that will be anywhere from six to fourteen months. Our goal is to get through the trials and submit to the regulatory body.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If GraphWear can deliver on measuring other biomolecules using its graphene platform, they could use the platform to detect other molecules or continuously monitor what’s going on inside the body. This Series B round, though, will be focused on delivering the first step: a clinically evaluated, graphene-based sensor.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Infrastructure as code (IaC) has been gaining wider adoption among DevOps teams in recent years, but the complexities of data center configuration and management continue to create problems — and opportunities.</p>
<p>We surveyed top investors in IaC startups to find out more.</p>
<p>Overall, they see a lot of room for growth given all of the manual work still done by DevOps teams across organizations of all sizes.</p>
<p>However, IaC itself requires highly trained engineers to implement and manage within organizations, and there’s a shortage of software infrastructure engineers with IaC skills. This could favor IaC startups that are trying to offer complete solutions to customers.</p>
<p>At the same time, some large companies will continue to manage data centers internally and thus build out automation internally instead of with outside startups.</p>
<p>We spoke to:</p>

<h2><strong>Sheila Gulati, managing director, Tola Capital</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Can infrastructure as code be the solution for the implementation and configuration of servers, similar to how cloud was the solution for physical servers? Which areas do you think IaC’s capability to set up any cloud resource will be most used?</strong></p>
<p>The world of the modern cloud has shifted how we think about infrastructure altogether. We live in a multicloud and many-cloud world and these paradigms are redefining the modern cloud era. IaC can be used for any type of cloud workload or architecture, but it is a necessity for anyone building on the modern cloud. This is especially true for modern cloud architectures such as serverless applications, containerized applications running Kubernetes, AI/ML and more. Modern cloud architectures provide many benefits such as increased innovation, faster time to market, improved reliability and reduced costs. However, this has increased the burden of managing cloud infrastructure. The number of cloud services available is growing every year and modern architectures are composed of many loosely coupled, interdependent services and APIs. The result is that the number of cloud resources that people must manage is going up at a tremendous pace. The only way to manage this complexity is with IaC.</p>
<p>Today, we are seeing a new generation of IaC platforms that are designed from the ground up to meet the demands of the modern cloud. For example, <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/">Pulumi</a> and its cloud engineering platform is helping infrastructure teams and developers tame cloud complexity by enabling them to write code in the languages that they know and love, and use software engineering practices to build, deploy and manage cloud infrastructure. In contrast to legacy IaC tools that use domain specific languages, modern IaC platforms give practitioners the full power of programming languages, which make it easier to manage the complex interdependencies of modern cloud applications. They allow developers to use existing software development tools, including IDEs, package managers and test frameworks, which enable them to build faster and reuse best practices, while testing more frequently.</p>
<p><strong>Do you see IaC’s ability to streamline processes attracting startups in competitive sectors looking to get their product across the line first?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The companies in our portfolio who have embraced IaC and cloud engineering principles are also the ones most intent on rapid product development and streamlining their ability to bring new products to market faster. This requires investment in engineering talent, the platform and engineering practices.</p>
<p>It is important to take advantage of new cloud innovation to accelerate innovation and leverage IaC to more build products to efficiently meet customer needs. To support this it is critical for there to be partnership across providers within the IaC space to deliver the components that work together to support engineering teams.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have seen teams that lean into more modern development platforms able to hire better developers more easily — a concern of every tech company today. The cultures that are more dev-forward and that are truly embracing the shift-left movement are where the best developers want to work!</p>
<p><strong>Why are companies hesitant to adopt infrastructure as code? Can you outline the different ways IaC providers can market themselves to build their appeal?</strong></p>
<p>IaC should be the obvious choice for any company that’s interested in delivering cloud applications at scale, reliably, and at high velocity. The concerns of the past are now obsolete. However, companies may hesitate to adopt it due to the cultural and process changes required, the risks of migrating an existing application, or they may not have the right skills on their team. In the past, we also had IaC platforms that required the use of domain-specific languages. All of this taken together can make the ramp to productivity seem steep.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Homo sapiens is truly a diverse species. We appear distinct from each other based on our origins in various regions of the planet; we communicate using thousands of languages; we have different thought patterns based on our experiences, heritage and cultures. Our brains are all unique; we analyze issues and make decisions using all of these properties &#8212; and many others.</p>
<p>These factors all directly affect how we do business and how we use tools to execute our duties. Doing business well is challenging enough for most people, but people with neurodiverse characteristics &#8212; professionals who &#8220;think different,&#8221; as the late Steve Jobs used to say &#8212; are a unique breed whose talent is too often underappreciated or untapped inside companies, which often value standardization and prefer limited deviations from normal work patterns.</p>
<h2>The role of neurodiversity</h2>
<p>Neurodivergent people process information differently from the way the mainstream does. Examples of this are people on the autism spectrum, with dyslexia, or those with attention deficit disorder, or ADD. Experts believe as much as <a href="https://adhdaware.org.uk/what-is-adhd/neurodiversity-and-other-conditions/">40% of the population</a> is neurodivergent.</p>
<p>Many think the percentage is even higher in the sales profession, given that good salespeople often are more persistent and think &#8220;out of the box.” It’s not unlikely that someone on any given sales team is a superstar salesperson but has neurological variants affecting how they interact with information and with others. That makes a particularly interesting argument for the wisdom of integrating neuroatypical people into sales organizations and enabling them to thrive.</p>
<p>For example, salespeople use customer relationship management (CRM) software systems, where all records, workflows and analytics are standardized and the user experience is constrained to the <em>one</em> way the system was configured.</p>
<p>But not everybody can use such a complicated and rigid system optimally, especially when the user interaction layer is so strictly limited. Most neurodiverse people especially have difficulty with “opinionated” applications that tend to impose a certain way of working on the user, sometimes without considering all aspects of the user’s humanness &#8212; their unique way of processing information and navigating workflows. This is why in most sales organizations, the top-performing sales reps are often the ones who update the CRM least and why most salespeople use basic note-taking applications, tasks and spreadsheets to manage their own pipeline of deals.</p>
<p>Neurodiverse professionals bring different perspectives and strengths to the table and often challenge the status quo. It is this diversity of thought that gives an organization strength in special ways.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>What do companies have to gain from neurodiverse talent?</h2>
<p>JP Morgan created a neurodiversity pilot program in 2015 called Autism at Work, and the <a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/news-stories/neurodiverse-hiring-brings-social-and-business-benefits">results were notable</a>. Employees in the program were 48% faster at completing tasks and 92% more productive than their peers. Preliminary <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/05/neurodiversity-as-a-competitive-advantage">results from another pilot program</a> at Australia’s Department of Human Services found that the organization’s neurodiverse software testing teams were 30% more productive than neurotypical teams.</p>
<p>Most autistic people are known to possess intense attention to detail. A 7-year-old boy on the autism spectrum, for example, has memorized the details of every shipwreck in history. This type of focus and appetite for information has remarkable potential when harnessed in the right roles. Autistic talent is often ideally suited to some of the fastest-growing segments of the knowledge economy, including data analytics, tech services and software engineering. In fact, Tesla CEO Elon Musk<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/12/business/elon-musk-aspergers/index.html"> recently revealed</a> that he has Asperger’s syndrome, a form of autism.</p>
<p>In another neurodiversity area, out-of-the-box thinkers are often dyslexic. Consider some of the dyslexic people who have changed the world: Steve Jobs, Richard Branson and Bill Gates, to name a few. What they have in common is the ability to look at the world differently.</p>
<h2>The software dilemma</h2>
<p>More and more companies are getting the message: Neurodivergent employees should be appreciated as a huge source of talent and contributions. At the same time, increased awareness of social injustices of all kinds in the wake of the events of 2020 has spurred more organizations to recognize neurodiversity as part of their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.</p>
<p>But to this point, the focus has largely been on how hiring, training, onboarding processes, and even office design (when we all return to offices) can be more inclusive for neurodivergent people. For example, SAP and Microsoft have expanded efforts to hire more neuroatypical employees.</p>
<p>Those initiatives are important, but we believe software companies need to go a step further and change their approach at the core design level.</p>
<p>A lot of software imposes a certain way of working on users, with little to no care about how everything feels and flows from the user’s perspective. And along the way, this rigid system ends up excluding many people who are neurodiverse. As a result, users face challenges in their day-to-day jobs because the tools they’ve been provided don&#8217;t fit with how they process information and navigate their workflows, all in the name of standardization, and organizations then suffer from poor adoption of their tools and systems.</p>
<p>No vendor does this intentionally; it’s just that it’s difficult to do and do well. But it should become a core value for every software company to pursue empathetic software design that imagines and caters to all users, and helps everyone be equally efficient and productive. It starts with recognizing and appreciating that not all “users” are the same, which then leads to designing more flexible and approachable software that a larger percentage of people can use naturally.</p>
<p>If sales organizations have more than their share of neurodivergent people, imagine the effect that the wrong kind of tools can have — say, CRM software that demands a person with ADHD handle a plethora of tedious data entry tasks. Imagine all the frustration, lost potential and damaged morale because a skilled, neurodiverse salesperson simply was given the wrong tools for them to demonstrate their full potential.</p>
<p>The time has come for the industry as a whole to expand its thinking about software user experience and include flexibility as a key design principle.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[How strong of a cloud business has Informatica managed to build, and how winsome is its economic profile? It has yet to set an IPO price range, but there are reports of a valuation as high as $10 billion.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Informatica <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1868778/000119312521289749/d169828ds1.htm">filed to go public</a> late last week, some six years after it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/08/informatica-could-feel-a-tight-squeeze-from-its-new-owners/">taken private by two private equity teams for $5.3 billion</a>. The data-focused company used its passage through the private markets to execute a move to the cloud, work that came to a head in early 2021, when Informatica announced its <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/informaticas-journey-to-the-cloud/">dive into the lakehouse market</a>, where Databricks plays today.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll explore the company&#8217;s IPO filing to figure out just how strong of a cloud business it has managed to build and how winsome its overall economic profile appears. While the company has yet to set an initial IPO price range giving us an indicator of where it might be valued, there are media reports of a valuation <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-01/permira-backed-technology-company-informatica-files-for-ipo">as high as $10 billion</a>.</p>
<p>A number that big demands exploration. Let&#8217;s get into the numbers.</p>
<h2>Inside Informatica&#8217;s business</h2>
<p>Turning back the clock to 2015, the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2015/04/22/727263/11123/en/Informatica-Reports-First-Quarter-Results.html">final Informatica earnings release</a> that we could find from its last run at being a public company is dated April 22, 2015. That was just days after the company&#8217;s takeover was announced, so the timing makes sense.</p>
<p>At the time, Informatica reported revenues of $250.5 million, up 3% from its year-ago comp. That revenue growth number was more than anemic but did contain an interesting seed of good news, namely that &#8220;subscription revenues&#8221; at the company were up 47% on a year-over-year basis. Sure, every company wants you to focus more on its growth business than its overall performance, but the subscription result was pretty strong, even if it was from a modest base figure ($21.3 million).</p>
<p>And in that final period &#8212; the quarter ended March 31, 2015 &#8212; Informatica generated $32.2 million in operating income and $21.6 million worth of net income. At the time it went private, Informatica was profitable and slow growing, albeit with a new business arm that was putting up pretty notable revenue expansion.</p>
<p>What happened over the last half-decade or so?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dapper Labs, the NFT startup behind NBA Top Shot which was recently valued above $7.5 billion, made an interesting acquisition this morning, telling <a href="https://decrypt.co/82517/dapper-labs-nfts-daos-collectives-brud">Decrypt</a> that they have purchased virtual influencer startup Brud and will be bringing the entire 32-person team aboard.</p>
<p>Brud is best known for its digitally rendered social media influencer characters, specifically one named Lil Miquela. The startup spawned several other players in the space when it caught investor attention back in 2018 but the virtual influencer space hasn&#8217;t seen any explosions in interest and has stayed a pretty niche space over the years. The company&#8217;s cache of characters have lived fictionalized lives on Instagram, racking up followers as the startup earned a $125 million valuation. Dapper didn&#8217;t disclose what it paid for Brud.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Twitter friends, I am very excited to announce today that Brud has been acquired by <a href="https://twitter.com/dapperlabs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dapperlabs</a>!</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The most pertinent question here is what does an NFT startup like Dapper want with Lil Miquela (now, just Miquela)?</p>
<p>Well, it seem that the short of it is &#8212; not that much? Brud&#8217;s founder Trevor McFedries has been getting deeper into the crypto world and moving his startup&#8217;s focus towards collective decision-making through decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) which is where Dapper&#8217;s central interest seems to lie. McFedries is already the co-founder of one of the more popular DAOs called &#8220;Friends With Benefits&#8221;. DAOs can help users team up to make investment decisions as a collective and they&#8217;ve grown more popular in the past year as developers in the crypto space have started crafting bolder projects in the space.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While McFedries says the company will continue to develop Miquela, he will now lead a division inside Dapper Labs called Dapper Collectives focused on making DAOs more user-friendly and accessible to a new generation of crypto web users while leveraging the company&#8217;s Flow blockchain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founders seeking to raise their first round of capital may feel overwhelmed by the prospect. There is definitely plenty of capital out there, but there are also a lot of startups clamoring for it.</p>
<p>To help new entrepreneurs figure out this dilemma, we invited three investors to speak at a panel titled, &#8220;How to Raise Your First Dollars,&#8221; during TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 so they could share their best tips on what you should do as you attempt to raise that money, as well as strategies for who to pitch to, when to pitch and how to pitch.</p>
<p>Index Ventures partner <a href="https://www.indexventures.com/team/nina-achadjian/">Nina Achadijan</a> started out by urging founders to first consider whether they actually really need to raise venture capital. &#8220;It’s a phenomenal time to be an early-stage entrepreneur. There&#8217;s more capital than ever before and there&#8217;s a willingness to accept technology from consumers and businesses,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And quite frankly, there&#8217;s a lot of platform shifts that are very exciting for early-stage entrepreneurs. But the first thing you need to do is ask yourself: Do you really need to raise venture capital? There are so many incredible businesses that can be built that actually don&#8217;t need VC funding.&#8221;</p>
<p>Achadijan said founders should first get clarity on what they would be using the money for. Secondly, she said, they should consider whether they want to eventually exit the company via an IPO or a sale. Once a founder decides to raise capital, the next step would be to make a list of companies that are either similar to theirs either in business model or by industry. Then using Crunchbase or PitchBook, she then recommends making a list of VCs that backed those companies, including angel investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what you can start to do is go down that list and say, ‘It seems like this person focuses 100% on what I&#8217;m doing; I&#8217;m definitely going to talk to them,&#8217; or &#8216;This person has backed similar business models and I&#8217;m really excited to hear their perspective on my space or my industry!&#8217; And then once you have your target list … you can start to get introductions and basically start the process of fundraising,” she said.</p>
<p>Canvas Ventures’ co-founder and general partner <a href="https://www.canvas.vc/team-member/rebecca-lynn">Rebecca Lynn</a> agreed with the exercise. In particular, she recommended listing what’s &#8220;non-negotiable&#8221; in terms of the investor and amount of money raised, and what would be a &#8220;nice to have.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Parliament&#8217;s lead and shadow rapporteur for a major reboot of the bloc&#8217;s digital rulebook have called for an investigation following the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety/">Facebook whistleblower leaks</a>.</p>
<p>One of the MEPs has also called for incoming EU rules to directly tackle business models that favor &#8220;disinformation and violence over factual content&#8221;.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://en.alexandrageese.eu/joint-statement-alexandra-geese-christel-schaldemose-on-the-relevance-of-the-facebook-leaks-to-the-dsa-legislative-process/">joint statement</a>, the lead rapporteur for the EU&#8217;s Digital Services Act (DSA), Christel Schaldemose (S&amp;D), and Alexandra Geese (shadow rapporteur for the Greens/EFA), said they are in touch with the former Facebook employee turned whistleblower, Frances Haugen.</p>
<p>In an interview with <em><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-misinformation-public-60-minutes-2021-10-03/">60 Minutes</a></em> today, Haugen revealed herself as the source of a raft of recent leaks to the Wall Street Journal which has reported on the internal documents for a number of stories &#8212; including that Facebook&#8217;s internal research suggested Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-wsj-teen-girls/">made teenage girls&#8217; anxiety and body image issues worse</a> and that the tech giant operated policy carve outs for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-files-xcheck-zuckerberg-elite-rules-11631541353?mod=article_inline">whitelisting celebritie</a>.</p>
<p>The two MEPs said the leaks make it clear that Big Tech must not be allowed to continue to regulate itself.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s executive moved forward in<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/"> December</a> last year with a major reboot to the digital rule book &#8212; introducing the DSA and another piece of regulation that&#8217;s specifically targeted at tech giants&#8217; market power (aka the Digital Markets Act), kicking off a process of (ongoing) negotiations between EU institutions to amend and adopt legislation to extend platforms&#8217; accountability.</p>
<p>The support of the European Parliament is required to pass the digital policy packages. And Geese is unlikely to be alone in calling for stronger measures than were contained in the Commission&#8217;s original DSA proposal in light of the latest ugly Facebook revelations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Kb67b2i9hQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety/">Facebook whistleblower reveals identity, says company &#8216;chooses profits over safety&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook whistleblower reveals identity, says company &#8216;chooses profits over safety&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety/embed/#?secret=Kb67b2i9hQ" data-secret="Kb67b2i9hQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the joint statement, Schaldemose said that large tech companies have shown they are &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">simply not capable&#8221; of responsible self regulation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The governing of our shared spaces on social media must be done through democratically controlled institutions just as we have done in the parts of our society that do not lie in the digital realm. We must demand transparency from the tech companies and we must allow civil society, law makers and scholarly experts to have insight into the building blocks of the algorithms. This is the only way that we can have a public debate about the effects of these algorithms,&#8221; she also said. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Today, we know this from the files, there are arbitrary protections of celebrities and a huge focus on negative, wrong and conflict-ridden content that threaten to undermine the very democratic conversation that we once hoped, the social media platforms could strengthen. To keep that hope alive and to allow all voices the ability to join in on the conversation, we must put firm demands to the companies governing these spaces.”</p>
<p>Geese went further &#8212; calling for the DSA to be strengthened in light of Haugen&#8217;s whistleblowing &#8212; arguing that the exposures are game-changing and make the case for regulating whole business models when they benefit from the amplification of disinformation at the expense of truthful content.</p>
<p>“I am extremely grateful for the courage of the whistleblower that finally gives us insights we need to effectively legislate. The revelations couldn’t be more timely for the work on the DSA,&#8221; said Geese. &#8220;The huge volume of documents and the person’s deep expertise are impressive. Until now, neither the public nor legislators have been able to gain such a deep insight into the mechanisms that have become far too powerful. The documents finally put all the facts on the table to allow us to adopt a stronger Digital Services Act.</p>
<p>&#8220;The conversation confirms my view that we need strong rules for content moderation and far-reaching transparency obligations in Europe. In a democracy we cannot tolerate an internet where some people have the right to promote violence and hatred in spite of the rules and others see perfectly legal content taken down by automated filters.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to regulate the whole system and the business model that favours disinformation and violence over factual content – and enables its rapid dissemination. We also need consistent enforcement in Europe. It is naïve to appeal to corporate self-regulation and responsibility. We as elected politicians have the responsibility for democratic discourse and must exercise it in the legislative process.”</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Lx5VmAdZSI">her interview with <em>60 Minutes</em></a>, Haugen was quizzed about a complaint made to Facebook in 2019 by major political parties across Europe &#8212; which were said to have raised concerns with the tech giant that its algorithmic preferences was forcing them to &#8220;skew negative&#8221; in their communications on its platforms and that was leading them to adopt more extreme policy positions.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are forcing us to take positions that we don&#8217;t like, that we know are bad for society, we know if we don&#8217;t take those positions we won&#8217;t win in the marketplace of social media,&#8221; said Haugen, summarizing the parties&#8217; concern in the interview.</p>
<p>Facebook was contacted for a response to the MEPs&#8217; joint statement.</p>
<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/european-politicians-call-facebook-investigation-after-whistleblower-revelation-2021-10-04/">Reuters</a>, the tech giant reiterated its customary claim that it has &#8220;been advocating for updated regulations where democratic governments set industry standards to which we can all adhere&#8221;.</p>
<p>Haugen has said that she made the decision to turn whistleblower after becoming frustrated that Facebook was not responding to such concerns and that executives at the company were instead prioritizing its financial performance over making changes to its content-sorting algorithms that could reduce the platform&#8217;s negatively polarizing effects on society.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook has thousands of [content] options it could show you. And one of the consequences of how Facebook is picking out that content today is it optimizing for content that gets engagement or reaction. But its own research is showing that content that is hateful, that is divisive, that is polarizing &#8212; it&#8217;s easier to inspire people to anger than it is to other emotions,&#8221; Haugen also told <em>60 Minutes</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/eu-parliament-backs-tighter-rules-on-behavioural-ads/">A year ago</a> the European Parliament voted to back a call for tighter regulations on behavioral ads &#8212; such as those which power Facebook&#8217;s content-sorting social media business &#8212; advocating for less intrusive, contextual forms of advertising and urging EU lawmakers to consider further regulatory options, including asking the Commission to look at a phase-out leading to a full ban.</p>
<p>With ever more ugly revelations coming out of Facebook &#8212; seemingly on a weekly basis &#8212; momentum could well build in the European Parliament for taking a far tougher line on engagement-based business models.</p>
<p>Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg got a frosty reception from MEPs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/22/zuckerberg-didnt-make-any-friends-in-europe-today/">back in 2018</a> &#8212; the last time he took an in-person, publicly streamed meeting with a part of the institution, in that case in the wake of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/14/facebook-suspends-200-suspicious-apps-out-of-thousands-reviewed-so-far/">Cambridge Analytica data misuse scandal</a>.</p>
<p>Asked about the MEPs&#8217; statement today, a Commission spokesperson told the Reuters news agency that its position in favor of regulation is &#8220;clear&#8221;, adding: &#8220;The power of major platforms over public debate and social life must be subject to democratically validated rules, in particular on transparency and accountability.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With its subscription-based legal services platform, <a href="https://lawpath.com.au/">Lawpath</a> wants to become the Asia Pacific’s LegalZoom (in fact, LegalZoom is one of its investors). Based in Sydney, Australia, Lawpath serves small businesses with services like legal documents, customized legal workflows, e-signatures, business registration, and on-demand lawyers. The company announced today it has raised $7.5 million AUD (about $5.5 million USD) to expand into new markets, including upcoming launches in New Zealand and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013, Lawpath currently has about 230,000 users, and says it is used to help form 5% of new companies in Australia.</p>
<p>Participants in this round, which brings Lawpath’s total raised to $14 million AUD, include the Gonski family; Adore Beauty chair Justin Ryan; Sandbar Investments; Ooh! Media and Readytech chair Tony Faure; LegalZoom director Khai Ha; and Bryant Stibel founding partner Gonzalo Troncoso. Existing investors Adcock Private Equity and LegalZoom also returned for this raise.</p>
<p>In addition to international expansion, the funding will also be used to double Lawpath’s current team of 40 people, especially for its product and software departments.</p>

<p>Dominic Wollrych, co-founder and chief executive officer of Lawpath, said he decided to create Lawpath while working for a large law firm, where he realized that many legal services are inaccessible to small businesses. About 98% of businesses in the world are SMEs, he told TechCrunch in an email, and 87% of them don’t seek legal help because of cost and access issues.</p>
<p>“There are million of legal transactions that happen every day that small businesses don’t seek legal advice on simply because they can’t afford to and it’s leaving them unprotected,” he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lawpath’s customers are typically businesses that make under $5 million in revenue and have up to 20 employees. About 40% of them work in online sectors, like e-commerce or the gig economy, and there has recently been an increase in professional service providers, like financial planners, accountants and other lawyers, signing up for the platform.</p>
<p>The company’s plans start at $29 AUD a month, and its most popular tier is the $89 per month “Legal Advice” plan, which includes unlimited 30-minute phone calls with a lawyer. Other services include <a href="https://lawpath.com.au/business-registrations">business registration plans </a>that automatically sets up a company, completes government and tax registration, and manages ongoing legal and compliance tasks, and a <a href="https://lawpath.com.au/quick-quotes">lawyer marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>Wollrych said Lawpath has seen an uptick in use during the pandemic as more companies rely on its team accounts, legal document collaboration features and e-signature tool to perform remote work. Demand for its business registration and legal plan subscriptions have also increased as people launch side hustles during lockdowns.</p>
<p>In terms of localization as it expands geographically, Lawpath’s SaaS platform acts as the underlying infrastructure for legal documents, APIs and lawyers, so it can move into new markets quickly, Wollrych said.</p>
<p>“We saw Lawpath following a similar path to accounting platform Xero,” he added. “Xero is an accounting infrastructure that small businesses use to complete their accounting. Xero has moved into many new markets by injecting local accounting methods into its platform. Lawpath can do the same for legal and become the ‘Xero of Law.’”</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a>. I <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">also tweet</a>.</p>
<p>Sorry that the show is so delayed today, it&#8217;s utterly my fault. Regular service returns Wednesday, and we&#8217;ll make to not be late on a Monday again this year! Here&#8217;s what we got into on the show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tech shares are falling in America in a larger domestic selloff &#8212; but once again we&#8217;re seeing high-valued technology stocks lose the most ground. Software companies are having a particularly rough morning.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety/">Facebook whistleblower situation</a> remains the biggest news item in the technology world this morning, dominating aggregators and conversation. Precisely what comes next isn&#8217;t clear, I reckon, but Facebook shares haven&#8217;t lost enough ground yet to be a worry for the firm; that could change with another few days&#8217; declines, however.</li>
<li>What else was on our mind? <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-doesnt-make-videogames-but-its-the-hottest-player-in-gaming-11633147211">Apple&#8217;s epic gaming profits</a>, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/10/03/what-we-can-learn-from-chinas-proposed-ai-regulations/">new AI guidelines from China</a>, and <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/mergers-money-investments-in-chips-hit-record-level-as-tech-giants-look-to-design-their-own/">data concerning just how much money semiconductor startups are raising</a>. It&#8217;s more, but is it <em>enough</em>?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/indian-edtech-giant-byjus-valued-at-18-billion-in-new-funding/">Byju&#8217;s raised $300 million</a>, this time at an $18 billion valuation. Its upcoming IPO will help set the tone for global edtech valuations.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/ladder-raises-100m-on-a-900m-valuation-for-a-platform-selling-flexible-term-life-insurance/">Ladder raised $100 million</a>, proving that the insurtech market is still active. Sure, shares of public insurtech startups have taken a pounding in recent quarters, but there&#8217;s still plenty of private capital ready to make bets on the market.</li>
<li>And the Vision Fund 2 is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-03/softbank-is-cutting-more-deals-with-fewer-staff-than-ever-before">even more Vision Fund-y than we anticipated</a>!</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What&#8217;s the opposite of stonks?</p>
<p>Shares of technology companies are sharply lower in the United States today, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite falling 2.4% in early-afternoon trading.</p>
<p>Inside of the larger tech industry, things are even worse. The WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund, essentially a way to trade <a href="https://cloudindex.bvp.com/">the Bessemer Cloud Index</a> as an aggregate, is off some 5%. The Bessemer Cloud Index tracks a basket of public software companies, which provide their services largely through hosted (SaaS) or on-demand (API) methods.</p>
<p>TechCrunch doesn&#8217;t bring you intraday trading updates much, but because these come on the heels of larger declines, the damage is starting to pile up.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq is off 7.7% from its recent highs. That&#8217;s not <em>that</em> bad. It&#8217;s not even a technical correction, a movement that requires a 10% decline from recent highs. A bear market, as a reminder, is a <em>20%</em> correction from recent highs.</p>
<p>The SaaS and cloud market is in the worst shape, falling nearly 13% as of today&#8217;s declines. Public software companies are in a correction and are on their way toward a bear market if any more days like today crop up.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more afoot, of course. Shares of social giant Facebook are off a little more than 5% after the company endured &#8212; even for it &#8212; a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/">punishing news cycle in recent weeks</a>. A whistleblower who leaked internal Facebook material <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety/">came forward over the weekend</a>, leading to another round of coverage that Facebook would like to forget.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Then, today, Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-messenger-instagram-whatsapp-are-all-down/">entire suite of services</a> &#8212; Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp &#8212; went down due to an issue with its servers.</p>
<p>Shares of Facebook are off about 15.5% from recent highs, putting Zuckerberg&#8217;s empire in even worse shape than SaaS. This is despite a bullish advertising market.</p>
<p>All told, this is not the way that the stock market would have wanted to kick off its first full trading week of Q4. And because we&#8217;re expecting a few more IPOs before the end of 2021, it&#8217;s an ominous kickoff to the final public-offering push of the year.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Following <a href="https://www.engadget.com/app-store-titles-reportedly-scams-085833441.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">reports</a> that revealed that a significant percentage of top App Store apps were scams, Apple is allowing users to report such behavior, according to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22705405/apple-report-a-problem-button-app-store-scams" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1"><em>The Verge</em></a>. As part of iOS 15, the latest App Store update lets you &#8220;report a scam or fraud&#8221; for both free, in-app purchase (IAP) and paid apps, provided you&#8217;ve installed the app in question.</p>
<p>The feature, detailed by <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1444814469184425988" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">Kosta Eleftheriou</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mazkewich/status/1444780501949194256" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">Richard Mazkewich</a> on Twitter, goes even farther than the previous &#8220;Report a Problem&#8221; feature. You can now signal a scam or a fraud and not just “Report suspicious activity,” “Report a quality issue,&#8221; “Request a refund” or “Find my content” as before. Previously, you would have also needed to make an in-app purchase before you could highlight a scam or fraud, but that&#8217;s no longer the case.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Report a problem&#8221; feature itself returned to individual app listings for the first time in years, as <em>The Verge</em> pointed out. Prior to that, it was located at the bottom of the Apps or Games tabs and would send you to a separate website.</p>
<p>Apple essentially foreshadowed the changes when it released new App Store Review Guidelines in June. Several sections included changes that saw Apple taking a tougher stance on fraud, scams and developer misconduct, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apples-new-app-store-guidelines-aim-to-crack-down-on-fraud-and-scams" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> noted at the time.</p>
<p>Bad apps found on the Store included VPNs that duped customers into buying unneeded software, bad dating apps, QR readers and apps fraudulently claiming to be from major brands, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/06/06/apple-app-store-scams-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><em>Washington Post</em></a> revealed earlier this year. The apps may have defrauded users out of an estimated $48 million, according to the <em>Post</em>&#8216;s estimates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pioneered by Snapchat and cloned by Instagram, the &#8220;Stories&#8221; feature has become a <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/stories-takeover-social-media-apps/">staple</a> for modern-day mobile apps, from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/google-adds-stories-to-its-search-app-for-ios-and-android/">Google search</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/pinterest-story-pins/">Pinterest</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/spotify-test-lets-influencers-post-stories-to-introduce-their-own-playlists/">streaming apps</a> and more. And while the addition doesn&#8217;t work for everyone &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/linkedin-is-scrapping-its-stories-feature-to-work-on-short-form-video/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/">Twitter</a> recently shuttered their Stories features, for example &#8212; there&#8217;s enough demand for Stories out there on the market that a company called Storyteller has managed to create a revenue-generating business that provides &#8220;stories as a service.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s service allows anyone to add Stories to their app, or even their website, with little coding and setup required. Instead, Storyteller&#8217;s clients can integrate SDKs to add Stories to their app, then leverage a content management system (CMS) to author and publish their Stories, and track their performance.</p>
<p>The idea for <a href="https://www.getstoryteller.com/">Storyteller</a> spun out of the Edinburgh, Scotland-based specialist entertainment agency <a href="https://stormideas.com/">Storm Ideas</a>, founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/movingforwards?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_contact_details%3BdDYTtaQIS%2BaHm2qvLAfhGw%3D%3D">Bob Thomson</a>, which provides a range of services to media companies along with various social products. The agency was founded in 2009 after Thomson created an early way to customize online profile images called Twibbon, which took off rapidly. Over the past decade or so, Storm Ideas has matured into a 70-person company that now offers strategy, design, development and content for its clients across the sports and entertainment industries.</p>
<p>Along the way, Storm Ideas also came up with other concepts based on its clients&#8217; needs &#8212; like <a href="https://hailto.com/">HailTo</a>, a platform for distributing social assets to talent, which helped the agency grow its customer base.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211907" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211907" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2211907" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-UI-Sports.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-UI-Sports.png 6144w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-UI-Sports.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-UI-Sports.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-UI-Sports.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-UI-Sports.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-UI-Sports.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-UI-Sports.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-UI-Sports.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211907" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Storyteller</p></div></p>
<p>Storyteller emerged from that same process. Thomson says companies &#8212; and particularly U.S.-based media companies &#8212; would identify the idea to add a Stories feature, but would struggle to actually implement it.</p>
<p>&#8220;They need to build the [user interface] for it, and then they need to rebuild it for Android, iOS and web. And they need to build a whole backend for it to interact with. And then &#8212; often the kind of thing that gets forgotten &#8212; is that you also need tools to manage all that,&#8221; Thomson explains. &#8220;We felt there was an opportunity to look at a product that did all that for you.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Storyteller, the goal is to do for Stories what companies like Braze did for push notifications. That is, instead of building their own product from scratch, businesses can choose to implement an SDK for adding Stories to their own apps.</p>
<p>The first client for Storyteller was Hallmark &#8212; a company Storm Ideas already had a relationship with &#8212; which runs the Hallmark Movie Checklist app where users can track the movies they&#8217;ve watched. The company wanted a way to deliver to its hundreds of thousands of monthly users updates about new releases, featured selections and other timely content. Storyteller launched with Hallmark Movie Checklist in 2019, then steadily began offering the same toolset to its other agency clients in the months that followed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211911" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211911" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2211911" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hallmark-Movie-Checklist-App.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hallmark-Movie-Checklist-App.png 4608w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hallmark-Movie-Checklist-App.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hallmark-Movie-Checklist-App.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hallmark-Movie-Checklist-App.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hallmark-Movie-Checklist-App.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hallmark-Movie-Checklist-App.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hallmark-Movie-Checklist-App.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hallmark-Movie-Checklist-App.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211911" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Storyteller</p></div></p>
<p>Now, Storyteller &#8212; which is spinning out to become its own, separate business &#8212; is serving millions of users across a number of apps in sports and entertainment, though the company doesn&#8217;t have permission to identify its enterprise clients by name.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re into the double figures in terms of those big enterprise-type implementations,&#8221; says Thomson.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a great basis to go from. We&#8217;ve taken on some of the hardest challenges first. We&#8217;ve worked with these large companies doing integrations. Lots of stakeholders. Lots of internal politics, sometimes,&#8221; he says. &#8220;[We&#8217;ve done] a huge amount of work&#8230;But obviously, we want to also open this up to more and more medium-sized clients &#8212; those who maybe want to self-serve a little more or have more of a hands-off approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently, the focus is on clients in sports and media, as those are the markets Storm Ideas already served &#8212; not companies looking to add a consumer-facing product with user-generated content.</p>
<p>Through Storyteller, the clients gain access to a backend where they can create Stories by uploading and previewing images, videos and polls. They can categorize the content, build out publication schedules, and publish the data into the SDK, then track analytics. In the works is a new studio component that will offer easy-to-use content creation tools for smaller companies that may not have an in-house team producing content professionally using tools like Photoshop or Adobe After Effects, for instance.</p>

<p>This feature, expected before year-end, will allow clients to select templates and customize them with their own content. This could also make Storyteller more compelling for non-enterprise clients.</p>
<p>Today, the company is catering to these smaller customers with a range of plans starting at free plans for apps with just 25,000 monthly active users up to $849-per-month plans for larger apps with up to a million monthly users. Beyond that, enterprise pricing will come into play.</p>
<p>So far, Storyteller has been bootstrapped using agency profits, Thomson&#8217;s own money and early client revenue.</p>
<p>Storyteller&#8217;s team includes a core group of around 30 people joining from Storm Ideas who had already been dedicated to the project. It will continue to hire separately. And as Storyteller is sold to clients, if the customer needs help with the content production side of things, they&#8217;re referred back to the agency which provides this service.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211914" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211914" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2211914" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Analytics-2-PNG.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Analytics-2-PNG.png 4608w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Analytics-2-PNG.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Analytics-2-PNG.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Analytics-2-PNG.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Analytics-2-PNG.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Analytics-2-PNG.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Analytics-2-PNG.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Analytics-2-PNG.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211914" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Storyteller</p></div></p>
<p>Storyteller isn&#8217;t actively raising funding, but has not decided against it, given its long-term focus actually extends beyond the &#8220;Stories&#8221; product itself to include other ways brands and businesses may want to tell their stories.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way I see it is that what we&#8217;ve done is we&#8217;ve built a platform that has these key components &#8212; SDKs across the major platforms &#8212; iOS, Android, and web; APIs for them to communicate with a backend that is good at hosting, processing, and manipulating text, images, and video; and a CMS &#8212; a tool that&#8217;s good at authoring and scheduling&#8221; says Thomson.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211936" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211936" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2211936" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-Team-Building.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-Team-Building.jpg 11451w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-Team-Building.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-Team-Building.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-Team-Building.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-Team-Building.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-Team-Building.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-Team-Building.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-Team-Building.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211936" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Storyteller</p></div></p>
<p>Now that Storyteller has figured out &#8220;all the hard stuff,&#8221; as Thomson puts. it, like security, privacy and analytics, it makes sense to add support for other formats, like vertical video.</p>
<p>A number of apps have begun adopting vertical video outside of those trying to simply clone TikTok. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/netflix-launches-fast-laughs-a-tiktok-like-feed-of-funny-videos/">Netflix added vertical video in its app</a>, for instance. And others in the sports and media entertainment space have large libraries of content and clips that would make sense for an in-app video feed, too. Support for vertical video is now on the product roadmap, Thomson says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Storyteller may be a new product, but the leadership team behind it is anything but,&#8221; says Thomson. &#8220;We have gathered together an exceptional team of experienced and driven people to make this product the best that it can be. With a strong background in providing products and services to the world’s largest in the sports and entertainment industry, the Storyteller team is perfectly placed to bring Stories as a service to the world’s biggest businesses &#8212; and the small ones as well,&#8221; he adds.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Too much bullshit that is bad for the planet gets shrugged off under the protective armor of preserving shareholder value.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Taking a small detour today from traditional Exchange topics &#8212; we&#8217;ll get to some IPO news later on &#8212; to talk briefly about climate, climate tech and pessimism.</p>
<p>Last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/here-for-influencer-branded-mac-and-cheese/">on the podcast</a>, the Equity crew spent a bit of time digging into the planetwide impacts that our warming world will endure in the coming years &#8212; and the role that startups can play in combating climate change. There are some encouraging companies in the mix, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/droneseeds-36m-a-round-makes-it-a-one-stop-shop-for-post-wildfire-reforestation/">including DroneSeed</a>, which we all rather liked.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</strong></em></p>
<hr />
<p>Then again, who doesn&#8217;t like the idea of shooting seed pucks from drones to reseed forests? If you have ever taken part in a tree-planting day, using a drone instead of your hands sounds like a superbrilliant idea. I have done the work by hand and can&#8217;t really recommend it.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995211 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/kirstenkorosec">own Kirsten Korosec</a> wrote a long and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/the-enormous-challenges-and-abundant-opportunities-in-climate-tech/">rather good dig into the climate tech space</a>, which I recommend reading if you want to get a bit deeper on the subject.</p>
<p>All this is to say: Some startups are working on building companies that can profit while helping combat the rising tides, more frequent fires and more powerful storms that appear set to come our way in the coming decades. Which is to say that kids are going to have a tougher go of life than what you or I have enjoyed. Especially if you are older than I am.</p>
<p>It was in that particular mindset that I ran across a bit of commentary from former Y Combinator boss Sam Altman over the weekend that dug into the climate change issue from the lens of conversations with some younger folks.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1444690487110082565">the set of tweets</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2211882" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-04-at-11.21.01-AM.png?w=589" alt="" width="589" height="658" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-04-at-11.21.01-AM.png 589w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-04-at-11.21.01-AM.png?resize=134,150 134w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-04-at-11.21.01-AM.png?resize=269,300 269w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-04-at-11.21.01-AM.png?resize=45,50 45w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" /></p>
<p>There are a few threads in there worth tugging, but we&#8217;re focusing our attention on the youth-pessimism element for now.</p>
<p>Per Altman&#8217;s notes, smart college students are worried about climate change, which they view as both unstoppable and pressing. Per the OpenAI boss, college students are taking personal action &#8212; not having kids &#8212; over pushing for the sort of change that might arrest or reverse climate change. Structural change, I would say.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Global users are experiencing outages on Facebook, including all social networks the company owns, which include Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. When navigating to these websites, a server error will appear &#8212; Instagram shows a &#8220;5xx server error,&#8221; which indicates that this is an issue with Facebook&#8217;s servers.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>It appears that the outage is caused by a DNS (domain name server) fail &#8212; this is the naming structure that forms the web&#8217;s infrastructure. So, if you try to navigate to facebook.com right now, the internet won&#8217;t know where to find facebook.com.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based climate tech startup <a href="https://www.madeofair.com">Made of Air</a> has closed a €5 million (~$5.8 million) seed funding round, led by Norwegian sustainability-focused family fund, TD Veen.</p>
<p>Also participating are Patrick Pichette (former CFO of Google and chairman of the board of Twitter), EQT Group, Thomas Von Koch (CEO &amp; co-founder of EQT Group), Tuesday Capital, the co-founders of Pexip and Olympic gold medalist skier, Aksel Lund Svindal.</p>
<p>As the name (kind of) implies, Made of Air (MoA) is producing durable materials for a variety of use cases that make use of (pyrolyzed) wood waste in order to lock up carbon for long periods in the resulting hardened carbon-negative thermoplastic compound. (Which is literally made from biochar and bioplastics).</p>
<p>MoA is intending this carbon sequestration product to offer an alternative to fossil-based thermoplastics for use cases where the material has a long life, and it has some early experimental partnerships with car maker Audi (producing façade panels for an installation on its marquee dealership) and with the fashion chain H&amp;M (creating biomass-based sunglasses, among other experimental projects).</p>
<p>It also has a partnership with an unnamed U.S.-based furniture maker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our feedstock is a biomass waste stream from forestry. So the waste stream that we&#8217;re looking at is from sawdust and small chip sizes from the forestry industry and what&#8217;s happening is in the cut of the trees for timber products &#8212; usually for construction &#8212; you have a lot of products going down stream from that process and we are at the very end of that process,&#8221; explains founder and CEO Allison Dring.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is waste that otherwise is going to be landfilled or gasified or burned, and in all three of those cases you have the loss of the CO2 storage in the material.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In the pyrolysis step &#8212; so in the process of making it into biochar &#8212; we&#8217;re actually taking the CO2 that&#8217;s in the material and we&#8217;re converting it into pretty close to an elemental carbon. So in that stuff you actually lock into a material. It doesn&#8217;t retain in a gas form &#8212; which is a lot of indirect air capture, I think you hear about that &#8212; you have a gas sometimes then you have an issue about what to do with the gas &#8212; here we&#8217;re locked into elemental carbon which doesn&#8217;t go back to CO2.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 2016-founded materials startup has shipped over 10 tons of materials to date to more than four different customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are more strategic partners looking to decarbonize their supply chain with our carbon-negative materials,&#8221; says Dring. &#8220;Industries with the highest emission reduction needs are the built environment, automotive/mobility and consumer goods.&#8221;</p>
<p>While there can be environmental and other concerns attached to the biomass industry &#8212; such as if trees that wouldn&#8217;t otherwise be cut down are chopped down just to burn for energy or crops which could be used for food are instead burnt for fuel &#8212; Dring says they are not using biomass from non-forestry trees that could otherwise not be cut down and could be left to continue capturing carbon as they grow.</p>
<p>She also notes that the material they produce can be created from other types of biomass.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re looking at is that waste stream right now. Obviously we can do this with other biomass waste streams. We&#8217;re looking at how we can regionalize it,&#8221; she tells TechCrunch. &#8220;So it&#8217;s not about relying on one type &#8212; we can do this process with any plant material that has photosynthesized. What we don&#8217;t want to do is interrupt or cause any fluctuation in the food supply, so we don&#8217;t want to &#8212; by our demand for our product &#8212; create a monocrop on the other side for agriculture.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we are looking at non-food supplies or some kind of feedstock that comes from food waste that&#8217;s plentiful. So we look at the bush around coffee beans, for example &#8212; the woody, biomass waste from that is one potential waste stream. Or it could be like rice hulls or it could be the tomato stems. These kind of very good, high carbon content waste streams that we can hybridize so that we don&#8217;t cause a run on tomatoes for example.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We essentially try to look at it as there&#8217;s a natural process in the CO2 going back into the air as the biomass starts to decompose and what we&#8217;re doing is interrupting that cycle &#8212; to save the CO2 from going back in the air,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;And we can do that with these waste streams especially from wood really because the wood industry is an industry and the idea that carbon is stored in wood, and these products can be useful for example in building applications where you have a lifetime of sometimes 30, 50 years &#8212; we see that&#8217;s an industry that deserves to grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Making use of more timber in construction is one potential way to replace high CO2 materials like steel, she suggests.</p>
<p>&#8220;So this is an industry that we&#8217;re okay with taking up the waste &#8212; and as we scale up our model we think about what happens if the wood industry scales up and this is actually a good thing in terms of carbon storage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dring says MoA is aiming for its biomass-based thermoplastic to have the &#8220;typical fire resistant properties&#8221; expected from paneling materials in the building environment (both interior and exterior).</p>
<p>&#8220;This applies to mechanical properties as well,&#8221; she also notes. &#8220;In the built environment, we also look to replace other non-structural materials in addition to thermoplastics. In general, our materials target equal or superior performance to their fossil thermoplastic counterparts depending on use cases and aim to be drop-in ready for existing forming processes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup is not aiming for the biomass-derived material to be used in fast moving consumer goods or single use consumer products (like water bottles, coffee cup lids etc.); rather the material is designed for &#8220;durability&#8221; and intended as a replacement for &#8220;high emissions thermoplastics&#8221;.</p>
<p>So the types of potential products it could be used for are things like furniture, interior/exterior panelling, car dashboards and &#8220;closed-loop products&#8221; used by businesses within their own supply chains, for example.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our goal is carbon removal rather than just reduced emissions&#8221;, says Dring. &#8220;The compounds that we&#8217;re making are not biodegradable so these are durable thermoplastics that we&#8217;re making.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way that we&#8217;re seeing it is they&#8217;re a method for storing carbon in products but what we want are products with very long lifetimes &#8212; as long as we can&#8230; It&#8217;s about 50% of the plastic market is here and if you have biodegradables on one side, handling disposable products, there&#8217;s a lot of tech going on there; it&#8217;s very interesting. On the durable side manufacturers don&#8217;t have a lot of alternatives that are sustainable so this is the area that we&#8217;re looking at.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In our business model we are buying the feedstock and we&#8217;re just setting the precedent for how biomass streams are treated. We&#8217;re anticipating that a lot of our resources are moving from below ground to above ground and there is going to be an inherent value in these biomass streams and we&#8217;re just starting with what&#8217;s there,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>The cost to MoA&#8217;s customers of buying the material varies per use-case, according to Dring.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are differentiating according to product application,&#8221; she says, noting that the startup is only now heading into its first pilot production line (&#8220;so our prices are still a bit higher than where they will be when we&#8217;re at scale&#8221;).</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, just to give you a range in terms of thermoplastics, we&#8217;re between a fossil-plastic and a bioplastic in price. And obviously in scale we&#8217;re heading towards the fossil plastic to be competitive there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The end of life scenario for MoA&#8217;s material is also potentially a novel one. So where fossil-based thermoplastics can cause lasting environmental pollution, as they do not biodegrade and the economics around recycling can be challenging, Dring says its biomass-based material could be ground down and returned to the earth at the end of life.</p>
<p>Although of course it&#8217;s industry practice and consumer habit, not what&#8217;s theoretically possible, that will dictate what really happens to its pyrolyzed wood waste at the end of a product&#8217;s lifespan.</p>
<p>Dring says the startup&#8217;s product &#8220;is an entirely circular material&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a thermoplastic so basically at the end of life the products can be collected, they be ground down and reformed &#8212; so it really behaves like other plastics in that way. What&#8217;s special about our material versus those plastics is what we have is a pathway to the ground at the true end of life.</p>
<p>&#8220;So these products, after use cycles, can be ground down and actually put back in the ground and this is very significant for us, it&#8217;s significant for our partners &#8212; because what that essentially means is we&#8217;ve taken the carbon out of the ground 150 years ago we&#8217;ve pumped it up into the air, we&#8217;ve captured it through biomass, we&#8217;ve put it to work in a product and essentially we&#8217;re returning it to the ground. So this is the end of the carbon loop&#8230; and we think there aren&#8217;t many technologies that can do that permanently &#8212; and this is one of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you have products with these lifetimes &#8212; 10 to 50 years &#8212; we have more of a chance to actually put the carbon to work,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;So we can take it out of the air and we can actually embed it in those products and then we have, yes, questions about what happens at the end of life but we have more time to work that out and we will have averted, for many years, more harmful products.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course true circularity is still &#8220;a long way off&#8221; &#8212; and will require a whole village, not just a single startup with a novel material.</p>
<p>&#8220;We still have a lot of work to do with industry, to figure out how take-back works, and how we can collect waste at the end of a lifetime of a product and how we can safely do this thing &#8212; putting it back in the ground &#8212; but the potential is there, the pathway is there&#8230; There are lots of challenges &#8212; the biggest thing is we&#8217;re one company and the parallel I like to use is that you don&#8217;t want one company cleaning the plastics out of the ocean. You really need a joined up effort. And that&#8217;s very much how we see it,&#8221; says Dring.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a technology that&#8217;s capable of doing this &#8212; but we need support from partners, we need policy, we need waste collection, we also need consumer behavior &#8212; all of these things to join together to start to reformulate how we think about the end of a product&#8217;s life. And I think we&#8217;re kind of getting there with circularity [and the circular economy] and I think that&#8217;s an amazing step in thinking &#8212; and a lot in waste collection is changing because of that.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re asking is the next version beyond that &#8212; how do we de-cycle materials out of our system that can very rightly go in the ground? I can&#8217;t name how many challenges there are in there but I think there&#8217;s real momentum to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on the seed funding round in a statement, Kjell Skappel, CEO of TD Veen, said: “We are really impressed by what Allison, Daniel and the rest of the <span class="il">Made</span> of <span class="il">Air</span> team has accomplished to date and are proud to have led the round. We are convinced that the demand for carbon negative materials will grow substantially in the foreseeable future as industries look to lower their carbon footprint and future proof their supply chains.”</p>
<p>In another supporting statement, Pichette added: “With my personal experience in the forestry industry, it is clear that <span class="il">Made</span> of <span class="il">Air</span>’s potential for impact at scale is immense given the volume of feedstock materials available.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredspa/">Jared Spataro</a> has been with Microsoft for more than 15 years now, and he has been part of the transition from an on-prem software company to a SaaS business. Today his official title is corporate VP in charge of the company&#8217;s biggest SaaS product, Office 365. Spataro is going to join us on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=microsoftpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=microsoftpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October 27th at TC Sessions: SaaS</a> to talk about how his company made that grand transition successfully.</p>
<p>Today <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365">Microsoft Office 365</a> encompasses a variety of tooling, including Teams, the company&#8217;s collaboration platform, Outlook email and OneDrive storage, along with the Microsoft Office suite of productivity tools &#8212; Word, PowerPoint and Excel. There&#8217;s so much more too, including PowerBI, Yammer and SharePoint, to name but a few.</p>
<p>The division, which encompasses Office 365 and other online products, Productivity and Business, accounted for more than $14 billion <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2021-q4/press-release-webcast">in revenue in Q4 2021</a>. While not all of that came from Office 365, and Microsoft doesn&#8217;t really break it down much further, it did account for a good chunk of income for the software giant.</p>
<p>When Spataro joined the company back in 2006, he worked on the company&#8217;s content management product, SharePoint. He was senior director of that product in 2011 when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/25/its-official-microsoft-confirms-it-has-acquired-yammer-for-1-2-billion-in-cash/">the company bought Yammer for $1.2 billion</a>, a move that really helped the company begin that transition, and Spataro was at the center of that.</p>
<p>In those days, Microsoft would release new versions of SharePoint every three years, an immense new version with all the new bells and whistles, but most customers wouldn&#8217;t upgrade because they had a previous version that they had customized and weren&#8217;t about to do anything to put that at risk.</p>
<p>Microsoft was spending years on product development and many existing customers weren&#8217;t getting the benefits of the latest and greatest version. When the company bought Yammer, they acquired a company with a continuous delivery methodology and the Yammer team brought an entirely new modern development approach to Microsoft.</p>
<p>When Satya Nadella<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/04/microsofts-new-ceo-is-officially-satya-nadella/"> took over as CEO in 2014</a>, the company went all-in on the cloud just as Spartaro was moving to the Office side of the house as general manager. There he oversaw the company&#8217;s transition from boxed software to Office 365 SaaS.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;re going to talk to him about that transition and what it meant to the way software was produced and sold, and his role in helping Microsoft make that massive transformation.</p>
<p>In addition to our discussion with Spataro, the conference will also include Google’s Javier Soltero, Monte Carlo&#8217;s Barr Moses, as well as investors Sarah Guo and Kobie Fuller, among others. We hope you’ll join us. It’s going to be a thought-provoking lineup.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Qualcomm scored the purchase of Swedish automotive tech company Veoneer, nudging out Magna International with a higher bid.</p>
<p>Qualcomm and investment group SSW Partners said Monday they would acquire Veoneer for $37 per share in an all-cash transaction. At closing, SSW said it would sell Veoneer’s Arriver tech &#8212; an advanced driver assistance system stack that includes sensors and software &#8212; to Qualcomm and retain the Swedish company’s other Tier 1 supplier businesses.</p>
<p>Veoneer had previously agreed to sell itself to Magna. It looked like that deal would move forward, until Qualcomm submitted its bid <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/qualcomm-wants-to-buy-veoneer-for-4-6b-beating-magnas-offer/">for $800 million, or 18%, more</a>. Magna, which has a market capitalization of $25.3 billion compared to Qualcomm’s $164.8 billion, did not submit a counterbid.</p>
<p>This is not Qualcomm’s first major acquisition this year. The company, which is chiefly known for designing and manufacturing semiconductors and telecommunications equipment, is branching out. In January, Qualcomm agreed to acquire high-performance computing startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/two-year-old-nuvia-sells-to-qualcomm-for-1-4-billion/">Nuvia for $1.4 billion</a>, as it sought markets beyond telecoms. This latest purchase is especially bullish news for ADAS technology, which automakers are starting to roll out in new vehicles as a matter of course.</p>
<p>When Qualcomm submitted its bid to acquire Veoneer &#8212; nearly a month after Magna&#8217;s &#8212; it was not entirely a surprise. The two companies signed a collaborative agreement at the beginning of this year to develop software and chips for driver-assistance systems.</p>
<p>Veoneer will pay Magna a “breakup fee” of $110 million. The deal is expected to close next year.</p>
