										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With COVID-19 vaccinations just beginning, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> will ramp up its efforts to tamp down conspiracy theories that might discourage people from getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/covid19-vaccine.html">newly expanded rules</a> apply to debunked information about the adverse effects of getting vaccinated, misleading tweets claiming the vaccine is not necessary and conspiracies that claim COVID-19 vaccines are used to &#8220;intentionally cause harm to or control populations.&#8221; Twitter&#8217;s updated policy will go into effect on December 21.</p>
<p>Twitter will require users who tweet something that falls in one of those categories to delete the content before being allowed to tweet again. Addressing vaccine misinformation that doesn&#8217;t meet the threshold for removal, Twitter says that it will begin placing warning labels on &#8220;unsubstantiated rumors, disputed claims, as well as incomplete or out-of-context information about vaccines&#8221; starting in early 2021. Those tweets may also be hidden, have their engagement limited and be accompanied by public health information labels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company said that it will prioritize removing misinformation with the greatest potential to do harm, and we&#8217;ve asked Twitter if that decision is made based on how much exposure a tweet is getting or the nature of its content. The new policies will be enforced through a hybrid approach of automation and human moderation.</p>
<p>Early in the pandemic, Twitter created a set of new content policies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/twitter-coronavirus-covid-19-misinformation-policy/">specific to COVID-19 misinformation</a>, which was just beginning to take off. While bogus and potentially harmful misinformation about how the virus was transmitted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/10/coronavirus-5g-covid-19-conspiracy-theory-misinformation/">were the big worries then</a>, the company&#8217;s new policy update will address concerns that online misinformation might lead a significant portion of the population to refuse to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Having granular misinformation policies on the books is useful for future enforcement, but new rules aren&#8217;t worth anything if they aren&#8217;t enforced. We&#8217;ll be following misinformation around the COVID-19 vaccine as it becomes more widely available and keeping an eye out for how Twitter implements its latest effort to give conspiracies less oxygen on the platform.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">In November, Californians voted to pass <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2020/11/17/by-passing-proposition-24-california-voters-up-the-ante-on-federal-privacy-law/">Proposition 24</a>, a ballot measure that imposes new regulations on the collection of data by businesses. As part of the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), individuals will now have the right to opt out of the sharing and sale of their personal information, while companies must “reasonably” minimize data collection to protect user privacy.</p>
<p>For companies like Apple, Facebook, Uber and Google, all of which are headquartered in California, these new requirements may seem like a limitation on their existing data collection capabilities.</p>
<p>Looking more closely, it’s a nuanced story: By not only meeting the demands of these new regulations but exceeding them, companies have an opportunity to differentiate themselves from competitors to grow their bottom line, thanks to new technologies that put data privacy in the hands of consumers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Take Apple, the world’s most valuable tech company, as an example. When Google and Facebook — two of Apple’s largest competitors — were under fire for exploiting customer data, CEO Tim Cook saw an opportunity to turn privacy into a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>The tech giant rolled out a suite of new privacy-maximizing features, including a new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/">Sign In With Apple</a> feature that allows users to securely log in to apps without sharing personal information with the apps’ developers. More recently, the company updated its <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/">privacy page</a> to better showcase how its flagship apps are designed with privacy in mind.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			By not only meeting the demands of these new regulations but exceeding them, companies have an opportunity to differentiate themselves from their competition.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>This doubling down on privacy took center stage in the company’s marketing campaigns, too, with “Privacy Matters” becoming the central message of its prime-time air spots and its 10,000+ billboards around the world.</p>
<p>And of course, the company could hardly resist taking the occasional jab at its data-hungry competitors:</p>
<p>&#8220;The truth is, we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer — if our customer was our product,&#8221; said Cook in an <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/4/6/17197754/watch-apple-ceo-tim-cook-msnbc">interview with MSNBC</a>. &#8220;We’ve elected not to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple’s commitment to privacy not only puts them in a stronger position to comply with new CPRA regulations. It also sends a strong message to an industry that has profited off of customer data, and an even stronger message to consumers: It’s time to respect personal data.</p>
<h2>The growing demand for privacy</h2>
<p>The prioritization of consumer data privacy comes out of a need to address growing consumer concerns, which have consistently made headlines in recent years. Attention-grabbing stories such as the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal, as well as major breaches at companies such as <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/refunds/equifax-data-breach-settlement">Equifax</a>, have left consumers wondering whom they can trust and how they can protect themselves. And the research is pretty conclusive — consumers want more out of their businesses and governments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only 52% of consumers feel like they can trust businesses, and only 41% worldwide trust their governments (<a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/01/16/edelman-trust-barometer-reveals-lowest-levels-trust">Edelman</a>).</li>
<li>85% of consumers believe businesses should be doing more to actively protect their data (<a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2018-04-15-New-Survey-Finds-Deep-Consumer-Anxiety-over-Data-Privacy-and-Security">IBM</a>).</li>
<li>61% of consumers say their fears of having personal data compromised have increased in the last two years (<a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2018/06/consumer-data-privacy-research.html">Salesforce</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s hard to say exactly how this trust crisis will manifest in the global economy, but we’ve already seen several large boycotts, like the <a href="https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2018/09/05/it-turns-out-lots-of-people-actually-did-deletefacebook/">#DeleteFacebook</a> movement, and a staggering <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2018-04-15-New-Survey-Finds-Deep-Consumer-Anxiety-over-Data-Privacy-and-Security">75% of consumers</a> who say they won’t purchase from a company they don’t trust with their data.</p>
<p>And it’s not just Big Tech. From loyalty programs and inventory planning to smart cities and election advertising, it’s hard to overestimate the appetite — and effect — of using data to optimize processes and drive behavioral change.</p>
<p>As we look toward a new data-driven decade, however, we’re starting to realize the cost of this big data arms race: Consumers have lost trust in both the private and public sectors.</p>
<p>Private sector initiatives like Apple’s strengthened commitment to privacy, alongside public policy legislation like the CPRA, have the potential to not only build back consumer trust but to go even further beyond the minimum requirements. Thanks to new technologies like <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/inevitable-return-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a>, companies can transform their data privacy policies, while cutting costs, reducing fraud and improving customer experiences.</p>
<h2>The value of SSI</h2>
<p>Self-sovereign identity (or SSI) leverages a thin layer of distributed ledger technology and a dose of very advanced cryptography to enable companies to prove the identities of their customers, without putting privacy at risk.</p>
<p>At its simplest, SSI is a way of giving consumers more control over their personal information. It offers a way for consumers to digitally store and manage personal information (in the form of <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/gentle-introduction-verifiable-credentials/"> verifiable credentials</a>) that are issued and signed by a trusted authority (like a government, bank or university) in a way that can never be altered, embellished or manipulated. Consumers can then share this information when, where and with whom they wish as a way of proving things about themselves.</p>
<p>While sharing digital records online is nothing new, SSI changes the game in two fundamental ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Organizations can capture the required data, without overcollection. Unlike the physical credentials we carry in our wallets, like driver’s licenses and insurance cards, a digital verifiable credential can be divided into individual attributes, which can be shared separately.</li>
</ol>
<p>The classic example is walking into a bar and showing the bouncer your driver’s license to verify that you are of legal age. The card reveals the necessary data, but it also includes information that the bar has no business knowing — such as your name and address. With verifiable credentials, we can share proof of age without revealing anything else.</p>
<p>For sensitive cases, self-sovereign identity even allows us to cryptographically prove something about ourselves without revealing the actual data. In this case, we could provide a yes/no answer to whether we are of a legal age, without revealing our date of birth.</p>
<p>For individuals, data minimization represents a great stride forward in privacy. For organizations, it’s a way of avoiding the massive liability of storing and securing excess personally identifiable information.</p>
<ol>
<li>Correlation becomes much, much harder. While there are those who say privacy is a myth and our data will all be correlated anyway, self-sovereign identity protects us against many of the leading concerns with other digital identity solutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, if we look at other tools that give us some level of data portability, like single-sign-on, there is always a concern that a single player in the middle can track what we do online. There’s a reason those Facebook ads are eerily relevant: They know every site and app we have signed into using our Facebook profile.</p>
<p>With SSI, there’s no one player or centralized registry in the middle. Verifiers (those requesting an identity verification) can verify the authenticity cryptographically, meaning they don’t have to “phone home” to the original credential issuer and the credential issuer has no way of knowing when, where or to whom a credential was shared. No correlatable signatures are shared, and your digital identity is truly under your control and for your eyes only.</p>
<p>As a result, the consumer benefits from better privacy and security, while businesses benefit from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced fraud, with better, more accurate data verification at the time of account creation.</li>
<li>Reduced friction, with a dramatically faster sign-up process.</li>
<li>Reduced costs, both from time savings and from smarter KYC compliance (which normally costs large banks $500 million+ each year).</li>
<li>Increased efficiency, with less back-and-forth verifying third-party data.</li>
<li>Better customer experiences, with the ability to create a personalized, omnichannel customer experience without data harvesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>And it’s not science fiction, either. Several major governments, businesses and NGOs have already launched self-sovereign solutions. These include financial institutions like<a href="https://www.culedger.com/2019/11/culedger-completes-successful-pilot-program-of-mycuid-in-three-u-s-credit-unions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.culedger.com/2019/11/culedger-completes-successful-pilot-program-of-mycuid-in-three-u-s-credit-unions/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608228216191000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQv0di96-a7QwLmUef8suYqh0eQA"> UNIFY, Desert Financial and TruWest</a>, healthcare organizations like <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/can-blockchain-heal-ails-healthcare-lumedic-launches-new-quest-digital-identity-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.geekwire.com/2020/can-blockchain-heal-ails-healthcare-lumedic-launches-new-quest-digital-identity-standards/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608228216191000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEtxsfq0S5ZO7E77fqT-ScVE0toXQ">Providence Health</a> and the NHS, and telecom and travel giants like<a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/koreas-lg-cns-partners-with-evernym-for-decentralized-identity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ledgerinsights.com/koreas-lg-cns-partners-with-evernym-for-decentralized-identity/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608228216191000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGEg_yxFlnimWxbTVzifYaQ7AcZGg"> LG</a> and the International Air Transport Association.</p>
<p>It’s not clear how soon the technology will become ubiquitous, but it is clear that privacy is quickly emerging as the next competitive battleground. Newly passed regulations like CPRA codify the measures companies need to take, but it’s consumer expectations that will drive long-term shifts within the companies themselves.</p>
<p>For those ahead of the curve, there will be significant cost savings and growth — especially as customers start to shift their loyalty toward those businesses that respect and protect their privacy. For everyone else, it will be a major wake-up call as consumers demand to take back their data.</p>

The company, which makes business productivity tools for task management, goals and docs, raised its first bit of outside funding in mid-2020.</p>
<p>Just six months later, it has reached a $1 billion valuation after doubling its customer base and revenue increased ninefold as businesses embraced remote work.</p>
<p>The new funding and valuation after just a few months of hefty growth show just how closely investors are watching the productivity software space. I spoke with ClickUp CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/zeb-brian-evans" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="zeb-brian-evans">Zeb Evans <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> yesterday to get his insights on the challenges of hypergrowth and why it made sense to say &#8220;yes&#8221; to the check.</p>

<p><strong>TechCrunch: This has been an awfully busy year for your team. What&#8217;s happened since we talked about your Series A?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zeb Evans:</strong> The last time we chatted with you, we were at an inflection point where we had seen a lot of growth pre-COVID and then post-COVID we saw that growth continue. So we just really kept up those growth rates and really increased in some areas. Last time we chatted we had about 100,000 teams and now we&#8217;re over double that with over 200,000 teams that use our software.

<p><strong>That&#8217;s interesting, so it sounds like you&#8217;ve found a sweet spot in terms of team size?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, our number of users per team ends up being around 10 people or a little bit more than that. And that&#8217;s really stayed true from six months ago to today.</p>
<p><strong><em>How has your own team&#8217;s size changed?</em></strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re right around 200 people right now, so we&#8217;ve definitely more than doubled since the last time that we talked, and we&#8217;re going to double again hopefully in the next quarter so we&#8217;ve got an aggressive hiring plan to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Cool, so you&#8217;ve doubled your user base in six months as well as your team. How has your team adjusted to scaling so quickly?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good question. I think that the biggest thing that we&#8217;ve always focused on is shipping a new version of ClickUp every week. That is our differentiation. We&#8217;ve kind of created these iterative cycles called natural product market fit and it&#8217;s been hard to keep up with that. I mean, we&#8217;ve done it but as you scale, you know you have many more users and more considerations to take into every feature that you change and feature that you develop.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s been like the biggest thing we&#8217;ve been focused on and listening to that community that that is ever-growing every week. Obviously hiring is always top of mind also, and we haven&#8217;t done that as fast as we&#8217;d like to. But we&#8217;re making improvements there and we&#8217;re getting there.</p>
<p><strong>A lot of startups raised opportunistic rounds during what&#8217;s seemed to be a very hot market, at what point did you think that it might make sense to raise even more money after closing that Series A?</strong></p>
<p>So, our Series A was our first outside capital and we didn&#8217;t really know what that would do at the time. What we saw when we raised that fund was that we were able to really accelerate our vision and our product. We&#8217;ve used these resources very efficiently and we saw great unit economics come out of that. And also as you mentioned, it&#8217;s certainly a good time and a great market to be in — the productivity market is just the hottest right now. So it was kind of a trifecta of that but the real reason to raise was certainly to be able to continue that product growth and the acceleration of scaling that comes with raising money.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Texas announced Wednesday that it will sue <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> accusing the search giant of maintaining an illegal monopoly in online advertising. The suit, which has yet to appear in an official filing, was first announced in a video from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Texas will be joined by Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, South Dakota, North Dakota, Utah and Idaho, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-antitrust-google/texas-and-nine-other-u-s-states-sue-google-for-abusing-market-power-idUSKBN28Q2RL">reporting from Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t fair that google effectively eliminated its competition and crowned itself the head of online advertising,&#8221; Paxton said. Paxton argues that Google&#8217;s advertising practices and &#8220;anticompetitive conduct&#8221; give it too much power over the online advertising ecosystem, to the detriment of publishers.</p>

<p>Paxton&#8217;s name might sound familiar. He&#8217;s the state official who <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/12/10/ken-paxton-donald-trump-election-lawsuit/">led a recent lawsuit</a> disputing President-elect Joe Biden&#8217;s wins in the battleground states of Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin on behalf of Texas. The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/11/945617913/supreme-court-shuts-door-on-trump-election-prospects">unceremoniously rejected</a> the suit on the grounds that the state lacked the standing to file it. Paxton is also currently <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ken-paxton-austin-texas-crime-f8413d14842d848e69cf81bb4d2e87e2">under investigation by the FBI</a> for bribery allegations, making him a deeply controversial figure to lead such an effort.</p>
<p>The lawsuit from the coalition of states comes two months after the Justice Department <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/justice-department-will-reportedly-file-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-today/">filed its own antitrust suit against Google</a>. The DOJ&#8217;s effort is focused on <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-monopolist-google-violating-antitrust-laws">&#8220;anticompetitive and exclusionary practices&#8221;</a> in the company&#8217;s search and advertising business.</p>
<p>Last week, 46 states <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">announced a lawsuit</a> against Facebook over parallel antitrust concerns. That suit, which the state of Texas is also participating in, alleges that Facebook built a monopoly through predatory business practices like buying its rivals. The FTC also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ftc-seeks-to-break-up-facebook-alleging-illegal-monopoly/">filed its own lawsuit</a> against Facebook last week, alleging that the company is a monopoly and that its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp should be undone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> already made it clear that it isn&#8217;t happy about Apple&#8217;s upcoming restrictions on app tracking and ad targeting, but the publicity battle entered a new phase today.</p>
<p>Over the summer, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announced that beginning in iOS 14, developers will have to ask users for permission in order to use their IDFA identifiers for ad targeting. On one level, it&#8217;s simply giving users a choice, but since they&#8217;ll have to opt-in to participate, the assumption is that we&#8217;ll see a dramatic reduction in app tracking and targeting.</p>
<p>The actual change was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/apple-delay-ios-14-privacy-ad-tracking/">delayed until early next year</a>, but in the meantime Facebook suggested that this might <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/facebook-vs-apple-ad-tracking/">mean the end of its Audience Network</a> (which uses Facebook data to target ads on other websites and apps) on iOS.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Then, this morning, Facebook placed print ads in The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post declaring that it&#8217;s &#8220;standing up to Apple for small businesses everywhere,&#8221; and it published <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/speaking-up-for-small-businesses/">a blog post</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/apple-ios-14-speak-up-for-small-business">website</a> making the same argument.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s easy to see all of this as an attempt to put a more sympathetic face on a PR campaign that&#8217;s really just protecting Facebook&#8217;s ad business, Dan Levy — the company&#8217;s vice president of ads and business products — got on a call with reporters today to argue otherwise.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088221" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088221" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2088221" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ON-RECORD_AD-Standing-up-to-Apple-for-small-business.jpg?w=374" alt="Facebook ad" width="374" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ON-RECORD_AD-Standing-up-to-Apple-for-small-business.jpg 1663w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ON-RECORD_AD-Standing-up-to-Apple-for-small-business.jpg?resize=82,150 82w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ON-RECORD_AD-Standing-up-to-Apple-for-small-business.jpg?resize=165,300 165w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ON-RECORD_AD-Standing-up-to-Apple-for-small-business.jpg?resize=768,1397 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ON-RECORD_AD-Standing-up-to-Apple-for-small-business.jpg?resize=374,680 374w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ON-RECORD_AD-Standing-up-to-Apple-for-small-business.jpg?resize=845,1536 845w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ON-RECORD_AD-Standing-up-to-Apple-for-small-business.jpg?resize=1126,2048 1126w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ON-RECORD_AD-Standing-up-to-Apple-for-small-business.jpg?resize=27,50 27w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088221" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>For one thing, he said that with its &#8220;diversified&#8221; advertising business, Facebook won&#8217;t feel the impact as keenly as small businesses, particularly since it already acknowledged potential ad targeting challenges <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/facebook-q3-2020-earnings-snap/">in its most recent earnings report</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve already been factoring this into our expectations for the business,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In contrast, Levy said small businesses rely on targeting in order to run efficient advertising campaigns — and because they&#8217;ve got small budgets, they need that efficiency. He predicted that if Apple moves forward with its plans, &#8220;Small businesses will struggle to stay afloat and many aspiring entrepreneurs may never get off the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>Levy was joined by two small business owners, Monique Wilsondebriano of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/charlestongourmetburger/">Charleston Gourmet Burger Company</a> in South Carolina and Hrag Kalebjian of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/henryshouseofcoffee/">Henry&#8217;s House of Coffee</a> in San Francisco. Kalebjian that while business in the coffee shop is down 40% year-over-year, his online sales have tripled, and he credited targeted Facebook campaigns for allowing him to tell personal stories about his family&#8217;s love for Armenian coffee.</p>
<p>Wilsondebriano, meanwhile, said that when she and her husband Chevalo started a business selling their homemade burger marinade, &#8220;we did not have the option to run radio ads or TV ads, we just didn’t have a budget for that&#8221; — and so they turned to Facebook and Instagram. With the marinade now available in 50 states and 17 countries, Wilsondebriano said, &#8220;It makes me sad that if this update happens, so many small businesses won’t get that same opportunity that Cheval and I had.&#8221;</p>
<p>Levy also suggested that Apple&#8217;s bottom line might benefit from the changes — if developers make less money on ads from Facebook and other platforms, they may need to rely more on subscriptions or in-app transactions (with Apple collecting its much-discussed fee), and they might turn to Apple&#8217;s own targeted advertising platform.</p>
<p>A number of ad industry groups have taken also issue with Apple&#8217;s policy, with SVP Craig Federighi fighting back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/apple-takes-aim-at-adtech-hysteria-over-ios-app-tracking-change/">a speech criticizing what he called &#8220;outlandish&#8221; and &#8220;false&#8221; claims</a> from the adtech industry. In that speech, Federighi said Apple&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency feature is designed &#8220;to empower our users to decide when or if they want to allow an app to track them in a way that could be shared across other companies’ apps or websites.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, from the perspective of raising capital, 2020 has not been an awful time to be a startup founder. The world has changed, but the fundamentals of raising capital are the same. In the first half of the year, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/q2-2020-global-venture-report-funding-through-the-pandemic/">VCs invested $129 billion</a>, and Q3 is up 9% year-over-year, reports Crunchbase<sup id="fnref2"></sup>.</p>
<p>After the screeching halt to business in April subsided, founders and investors, people who are generally comfortable with uncertainty, got back to work raising and investing.</p>
<p>Choosing the right VC is one of the most important decisions startup founders will make. In good times, the choice can make or break a startup. When times are bad, it&#8217;s even more likely that the wrong VC partner could be the catalyst that starts a downward spiral. With many funds still looking to make investments before the end of the year and startups jockeying for cash, founders need to know how to find the right investor.</p>

<p>It’s not about simply choosing an investor — you are hiring your next boss. The investor should be someone you feel comfortable working with and working for.</p>
<p>You don’t want an investor who is checked out, but too much focus isn’t good, either. And, you don’t want an investor who is completely agreeable since your best outcome will be driven by a constructively demanding advisor.</p>
<p>My company, Quiq, had several term sheets when the dust settled on our Series B pitch meetings. Since the financial terms were similar, selecting an investor was made on a more subjective basis and boiled down to two fundamental questions:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Project Kuiper is perhaps one of the company&#8217;s most ambitious projects yet: Building a globe-spanning broadband wireless network to deliver affordable connectivity to underserved communities. Project Kuiper has made progress this year with a key FCC approval, and now it&#8217;s also created a prototype of a key piece of hardware that will help its future customers take advantage of the satellite network on the ground.</p>
<p>This is actually a big part of what will help make Project Kuiper a service that&#8217;s broadly accessible, and a development that puts the Amazon project in an industry-leading position with a unique advantage. The prototype developed by the team communicates on the Ka-band of the wireless spectrum, and is the smallest and lightest piece of hardware that can do that. It&#8217;s able to achieve speeds of up to 400 Mbps, and Amazon says that it&#8217;ll actually get better through future iterations.</p>
<p>For technical details on how this was accomplished and what it means for the final design, Amazon explains from a blog post describing the design process:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Our phased array antenna takes a different approach. Instead of placing antenna arrays adjacent to one another, we used tiny antenna element structures to overlay one over the other. This has never been accomplished in the Ka-band. The breakthrough allows us to reduce the size and weight of the entire terminal, while operating in a frequency that delivers higher bandwidth and better performance than other bands. Our design uses a combination of digital and analog components to electronically steer Ka-band beams toward satellites passing overhead.</p>
<p>The result is a single aperture phased array antenna that measures 12 inches in diameter, making it three times smaller and proportionately lighter than legacy antenna designs. This order of magnitude reduction in size will reduce production costs by an equal measure, allowing Amazon to offer customers a terminal that is more affordable and easier to install.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2087935" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087935" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2087935" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Project-Kuiper-Customer-Terminal-Animation.2020-12-16-10_01_29.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="562" /><p id="caption-attachment-2087935" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>The bottom line is that Amazon&#8217;s design for Kuiper can greatly reduce the cost and complexity of building the ground-based infrastructure that will be required in order to provide access to its network to end-users. It&#8217;s also low-latency, and Amazon has found that it can provide 4K streaming capabilities even during its testing with geostationary satellites today – which are as much as 50 times further out from where Project Kuiper satellites will eventually be positioned in low-Earth orbit.</p>
<p>Amazon isn&#8217;t yet sharing specific pricing information about what the terminal will eventually cost, beyond touting its affordability relative to existing solutions. I&#8217;ll be talking to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/">Amazon SVP of Devices and Services Dave Limp at TC Sessions: Space today</a>, and we&#8217;ll discuss the antenna along with everything else about the project.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m on an F1 OPT and am about to incorporate a startup with my two American co-founders. What were the biggest immigration changes in 2020 affecting us?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—Ambitious in Albany</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Ambitious:</p>
<p>Congrats on creating your startup. The Electoral College has voted and Biden is scheduled to take office on January 20, 2021. It may take him a few months to undo many of the Trump immigration changes, so there are several things for you to consider.</p>
<p>2020 gave many of us whiplash with all the things that happened! We braced for the worst in April after President Trump tweeted that he would suspend immigration to the U.S. In the end, the executive proclamations he issued in April and June fell far short of that and immigration remains possible.</p>
<p>However, these bans remain in effect until at least the end of 2020. The proclamations placed moratoriums on the issuance of green cards by the U.S. Embassies and consulates abroad, as well as H-1B, H-2B, J-1 and L-1 work visas. The Department of State has expanded the list of exceptions to these bans so many people now qualify.</p>
<p>One of the current constraints affecting the most people is that many embassies and consulates remain closed or are operating at significantly reduced capacity. Given that, we are recommending to our clients who are already in the U.S. to avoid leaving by seeking Extensions of Status, Changes of Status and Adjustments of Status with USCIS stateside.</p>
<p>The H-1B may be another promising visa option for your future as a founder. There are two ways to do it: “cap-subject” (the annual spring lottery) and “cap-exempt” (anytime of year). At a minimum, it’s easy for your startup to register you for the upcoming H-1B lottery in March 2021. It only costs $10 to register an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/episode-11-your-startups-first-h-1b/">H-1B candidate</a>. If you’re selected, your startup could file an H-1B petition on your behalf. If you are not selected, your startup can register you again in 2022.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

The committee formed earlier this year in June, shortly after two former employees, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/pinterests-22-5m-settlement-highlights-techs-inequities-say-former-employees-who-alleged-discrimination/">Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks</a>, went public with their allegations of racial and gender discrimination while working at Pinterest.</p>
<p>The committee, <a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/statement-by-the-board-of-directors">which retained law firm WilmerHale to conduct a workplace review</a>, spoke with more than 350 current and former employees to make its recommendations geared toward improving diversity, equity and inclusion at Pinterest. Here are a few of those recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>mandatory unconscious bias training for every employee, including managers and executives</li>
<li>offer additional trainings on inclusivity and unconscious bias</li>
<li>include &#8220;diverse employees&#8221; in interview panels with job candidates</li>
<li>reward employees for their efforts to support and promote DEI</li>
<li>publish a diversity report twice a year for at least two years; after two years, publish the report annually</li>
<li>establish criteria for promotion eligibility</li>
<li>enhance Pinterest&#8217;s harassment and discrimination policy</li>
<li>create a centralized workplace investigations team to ensure consistent and fair outcomes</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.pinterest-assets.com/m/137b577c199a60d3/original/Special-Committee-Communication-and-Recommendations-for-Pinterest.pdf">see all of the recommendations here.</a> Pinterest, in a statement to TechCrunch, said it&#8217;s committed to making those changes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We value our employees and know it’s our responsibility to build a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment for everyone at Pinterest,&#8221; a Pinterest spokesperson said. &#8220;Because we understand the urgency for change, we have taken actions over the past months to ensure everyone at Pinterest feels safe, welcomed and championed and believe we’re on a path to ensuring a culture where all employees feel included and supported.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a note to employees, Pinterest CEO Ben Silbermann said that everyone at the company will have an opportunity to discuss the recommendations and ask questions later this week. Silberman also said he felt encouraged that many of the suggestions &#8220;mirror efforts we already have underway to build a culture where all employees feel included and supported.&#8221;</p>

But that hefty payout highlighted some of the inequities in tech. Brougher filed her lawsuit in August, after Ozoma and Banks went public with their allegations. While Brougher walked away with millions, Ozoma and Banks received less than one year&#8217;s worth of severance.</p>
<p>“So we, like in many, many, many other cases, Black women put ourselves on the line, shared absolutely everything that happened to us, then laid the groundwork for someone else to swoop in and collect ‘progress,’ ” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/pinterests-22-5m-settlement-highlights-techs-inequities-say-former-employees-who-alleged-discrimination/">Ozoma previously told TechCrunch</a>. “No progress has been made here because no rights have been made with people who harm has been done to.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A few weeks after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/google-stadia-and-geforce-now-are-both-coming-to-ios-as-web-apps/">announcing</a> that iOS support was on the way, Google’s cloud gaming service now supports the iPhone and iPad. As expected, the company is using a web app to access the service. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> also says that you need to update to iOS 14.3, the latest iOS update that was released earlier this week.</p>
<p>If you want to try it out with a free or paid Stadia account, you can head over to <a href="https://stadia.google.com">stadia.google.com</a> from your iOS device. Log in to your Google account, add a shortcut to your home screen and open the web app.</p>
<p>After that, you can launch a game and start playing. Most games will require a gamepad, so you might want to pair a gamepad with your iPhone or iPad as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple’s iOS supports Xbox One and PlayStation 4 controllers using Bluetooth as well as controllers specifically designed for iOS. You can also play with the Stadia controller, but it’s optional. If you just want to check your inventory quickly, Stadia on iOS also supports touch controls.</p>
<p>Stadia works a bit like a console that runs in the cloud. You have to buy games for the platform specifically and you can then stream them from a data center near you. Recent additions include Cyberpunk 2077 and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla.</p>
<p>While you don’t have to pay an additional subscription to play those games, you can optionally become a Stadia Pro subscribers. In addition to games you bought on the platform, it lets you access a library of games and it unlocks 4K video. Stadia Pro costs $9.99 per month.</p>
<p>In other Stadia news, earlier this week, Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/2CsdusMniWOoFQitT03P7N/ubisoft-arrives-on-stadia">announced</a> that you could subscribe to the company’s unlimited subscription service Ubisoft+ and access games from Stadia. For now, it’s only available as a beta in the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mike Folgner has had his share of success building video editing tools, having <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2006/09/27/yahoo-has-acquired-jumpcut/?_ga=2.14223920.628333806.1605499470-187718115.1605050272">sold Jumpcut.com to Yahoo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/19/twitter-acquires-snappytv-to-expand-offerings-for-live-media-partners/">SnappyTV to Twitter</a>. But as he explained in <a href="https://medium.com/scenery-blog/unfinished-business-98e5fe532df3">a new Medium post</a>, he still sees &#8220;unfinished business&#8221; in the video industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, most major productivity software categories have made the leap from desktop software to the web,&#8221; Folgner wrote. &#8220;Despite significant progress in web technology, professional video tools have not made this leap. With WebGL, WASM, and other advancements this will change. We can now build performant, feature rich applications integrated with the fabric of the web.&#8221;</p>
<p>To create full-featured video editing software that works in the browser, Folgner has teamed up with Ryan Cunningham (his Jumpcut and SnappyTV co-founder) and Ashot Petrosian (who was a lead engineer at Jumpcut) to found a new startup called <a href="https://www.tensil.io">Tensil</a>, which is currently taking signups for anyone who wants to test the alpha version of its first product <a href="https://scenery.video/hello/">Scenery</a>.

<p>Since they&#8217;re still developing and testing the product, I didn&#8217;t get a chance to try Scenery for myself, but I got on a call with Folgner and Petrosian to discuss their plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you stop and think about what should a video editor be today, you won’t build the same tool that was built in the 1970s,&#8221; Petrosian told me.</p>
<p>For example, he said that rather than relying on the standard timeline view of existing video editors, Scenery will present a two-dimensional canvas, allowing editors to think &#8220;more like a graphic designer.&#8221;</p>
<p>More broadly, Petrosian said Scenery is meant to better reflect current video production and editing needs, helping teams produce videos more quickly and collaboratively. In fact, he suggested that describing Scenery as merely an editor is selling it short — it&#8217;s closer to &#8220;a video production system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Folgner added that by moving the process into the browser, Scenery can help non-editors get involved in the process, similar to the way that Figma brought new team members into the design process.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are really excited about rethinking video editing as a team sport,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After reaching a previous all-time high <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/technology/bitcoin-record-price.html">on November 30th, 2020</a> and December 1st, 2020, bitcoin is now trading well above $20,000 and has surpassed its previous peak price.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bitcoin-llc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bitcoin-llc">Bitcoin’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> value has rapidly increased over the past two months. According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">CoinMarketCap</a>, you could buy one bitcoin for $11,500 on October 16th.</p>
<p>As I’m writing this post, you can buy one bitcoin for $20,775.72 — it represents a 7.27% increase compared to yesterday’s price. It is now priced well over $20,000 on all major exchanges.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You might remember the bitcoin frenzy from 2017. At the time, Bitcoin nearly reached $20,000 and crashed shortly after. As always, the fact that bitcoin has been going up doesn’t mean that it’ll go up in the future.</p>
<p>This time, the rally seems a bit different as there’s not as much hype around bitcoin. As we’re entering a long economic crisis, some institutional investors are looking for alternative assets —&nbsp;and bitcoin is one of them. Some people could choose to hold their crypto assets for a longer time.</p>
<p>Still, there are a lot of new bitcoin investors who purchased just a fraction of a bitcoin on consumer fintech apps, such as Square’s Cash App, Robinhood and Revolut. Let’s see how the market evolves in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been more than two years since the Pentagon announced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/15/why-the-pentagons-10-billion-jedi-deal-has-cloud-companies-going-nuts/">$10 billion, decade long JEDI cloud contract</a>, which was supposed to provide a pathway to technological modernization for U.S. armed forces. While Microsoft was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/25/in-a-victory-over-amazon-microsoft-wins-10b-pentagon-jedi-cloud-contract/">awarded the contract in October 2019</a>, Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/aws-confirms-reports-it-will-challenge-jedi-contract-award-to-microsoft/">went to court</a> to protest that decision, and it has been in legal limbo ever since.</p>
<p>Yesterday marked another twist in this government procurement saga when <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> released its latest legal volley, asking a judge to set aside the decision to select Microsoft. Its arguments are similar to ones it has made before, but this time takes aim at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/04/dod-reaffirms-microsoft-has-won-jedi-cloud-contract-but-amazon-legal-complaints-still-pending/">the Pentagon&#8217;s reevaluation process</a>, which after reviewing the contract and selection process, still found in a decision released this past September that Microsoft had won.</p>
<p>Amazon believes that reevaluation was highly flawed, and subject to undue influence, bias and pressure from the president. Based on this, Amazon has asked the court to set aside the award to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>The JEDI reevaluations and re-award decision have fallen victim to an Administration that suppresses the good-faith analysis and reasoning of career officials for political reasons &#8212; ultimately to the detriment of national security and the efficient and lawful use of taxpayer dollars. DoD has demonstrated again that it has not executed this procurement objectively and in good faith. This re-award should be set aside.</p></blockquote>

<p>As you might imagine, Frank X. Shaw, corporate vice president for communications at Microsoft does not agree, believing his company won on merit and by providing the best price.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the losing bidder, Amazon was informed of our pricing and they realized they’d originally bid too high. They then amended aspects of their bid to achieve a lower price. However, when looking at all the criteria together, the career procurement officials at the DoD decided that given the superior technical advantages and overall value, we continued to offer the best solution,&#8221; Shaw said in a statement shared with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>As for Amazon, a spokesperson told TechCrunch, &#8220;We are simply seeking a fair and objective review by the court, regarding the technical errors, bias and political interference that blatantly impacted this contract award.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so it goes.</p>
<p>The Pentagon announced it was putting out a bid for a $10 billion, decade long contract in 2018, dubbing it JEDI, short for Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure. The procurement process has been mired in controversy from the start, and the size and scope of the deal has attracted widespread attention, much more than your typical government contract. It brought with it claims of bias, particularly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/oracle-loses-10b-jedi-cloud-contract-appeal-yet-again/">by Oracle</a>, that the bidding process was designed to favor Amazon.</p>
<p>We are more than two years beyond the original announcement. We are more than year beyond the original award to Microsoft, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/the-10b-jedi-contract-is-locked-loaded-and-still-completely-stuck/">it still remains stuck</a> in a court battle with two major tech companies continuing to snipe at one another. With neither likely to give in, it will be up to the court to decide the final outcome, and perhaps end this saga once and for all.</p>
<p><em>Note: The DoD did not respond to our request for comment. Should that change, we will update the story.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As businesses face a complex and evolving privacy landscape, a new tool called <a href="https://www.privacygrader.com">PrivacyGrader</a> can help them make sure they&#8217;re doing the right things.</p>
<p>The tool was created by Tom Chavez and Vivek Vaidya, as part of their new data compliance and security startup <a href="https://ketch.com">Ketch</a>. (Chavez and Vaidya also founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/superset/">the super{set} startup studio</a>; Ketch is part of the super{set} portfolio.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The truth of the matter is that we’ve cared a lot about these issues for a long time,&#8221; Chavez said. &#8220;What’s different today, in 2020, versus say a decade ago &#8230; is that it’s become an existential imperative for businesses.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In order to use PrivacyGrader, you need to have an authenticated email address tied to the website that you want analyzed — so you shouldn&#8217;t be able to see your competitors&#8217; grades.</p>
<p>Once your request and email address are validated, Vaidya said you should get an analysis back in less than 24 hours, which will score your site across more than 50 different factors, including trackers, storage of personal data and overall compliance with GDPR, CCPA and other regulations.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2X7f2J5BBY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/habu-launch/">Former Krux and Salesforce execs raise $15M for their marketing data startup Habu</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Former Krux and Salesforce execs raise $15M for their marketing data startup Habu&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/habu-launch/embed/#?secret=2X7f2J5BBY" data-secret="2X7f2J5BBY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For example, Chavez and Vaidya provided me with an analysis of TechCrunch, where we scored 56% overall (Chavez assured me that this &#8220;absolutely on par with what we&#8217;re seeing out there&#8221;). The report outlined the privacy experience for users in different countries and pointed to areas where we can do better.</p>
<p>Chavez emphasized that this isn&#8217;t meant to be the end of a company&#8217;s privacy discussion, but rather a high-level view that helps the product and legal teams know where to focus their attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of the scores &#8230; as an X-ray, not an MRI,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;re indicative, not conclusive, but they shed light across the key dimensions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presumably, Chavez and Vaidya are hoping companies that use PrivacyGrader will turn to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/unmagnify" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="unmagnify">Ketch&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> paid products for help, but Vaidya said they&#8217;ll continue improving the free service and treat it as a &#8220;first-class citizen product.&#8221;</p>
<p>Companies that have already used PrivacyGrader include Patreon, The Home Depot and Chubbies. For example, Patreon&#8217;s deputy legal counsel Priya Sanger said that the service &#8220;helped us identify improved data governance in order to effectively execute our marketing and sales strategy.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The super popular chat app <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/discord" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="discord">Discord <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is getting a much-requested feature starting today: mobile screen sharing.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, mobile screen sharing lets users capture and broadcast everything on their phone’s display and stream it to a group of friends. The company tells me they’ve been particularly focused on making it work well when there’s a lot of onscreen motion, allowing for things like game streaming or remote YouTube/TikTok viewing parties with high frame rates and minimal latency.</p>
<p>Streaming your mobile device’s display means sharing <em>everything</em> that floats across your phone’s screen &#8212; so if you don’t want random texts potentially popping up midstream, you’ll want to turn on your phone’s Do Not Disturb mode.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/8m5yaI8Xd40?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Discord <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/discord-video/">first picked up screen sharing abilities in 2017</a>, rolling it out alongside video chat. Since then, sharing your screen has required a desktop or laptop; this update brings iOS and Android devices into the mix. Mobile screen share streams can be broadcast to up to 50 viewers simultaneously, with no cap on how many users can be screen sharing in the same channel.</p>
<p>The feature should start rolling out today, but don’t be surprised if you don’t see it immediately; it’s going out in waves, so some will get it sooner than others. If the rollout goes as planned, all users with compatible devices should have it by end of day Thursday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.hightouch.io/">Hightouch</a>, a SaaS service that helps businesses sync their customer data across sales and marketing tools, is coming out of stealth and announcing a $2.1 million seed round. The round was led by <a href="https://afore.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://afore.vc/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608148064186000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHk5r70Lzi8w_IztNs0T-fW3nfnBw">Afore Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/slack-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/slack-fund&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608148064186000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE7Xo-GiIjauJhuUtqrLIvyh7bDEw">Slack Fund</a>, with a number of angel investors also participating.</p>
<p>At its core, Hightouch, which participated in Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2019 batch, aims to solve the customer data integration problems that many businesses today face.</p>
<p>During their time at Segment, Hightouch co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tejasmanohar/">Tejas Manohar</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshcurl/">Josh Curl</a> witnessed the rise of data warehouses like Snowflake, Google&#8217;s BigQuery and Amazon Redshift &#8212; that&#8217;s where a lot of Segment data ends up, after all. As businesses adopt data warehouses, they now have a central repository for all of their customer data. Typically, though, this information is then only used for analytics purposes. Together with former Bessemer Ventures investor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/guptakashish/">Kashish Gupta</a>, the team decided to see how they could innovate on top of this trend and help businesses activate all of this information.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2087974" style="width: 8725px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/founder-photos.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087974" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2087974 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/founder-photos.jpg" alt="hightouch founders" width="8715" height="2905" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/founder-photos.jpg 8715w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/founder-photos.jpg?resize=150,50 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/founder-photos.jpg?resize=300,100 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/founder-photos.jpg?resize=768,256 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/founder-photos.jpg?resize=680,227 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/founder-photos.jpg?resize=1536,512 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/founder-photos.jpg?resize=2048,683 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/founder-photos.jpg?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 8715px) 100vw, 8715px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2087974" class="wp-caption-text">HighTouch co-founders Kashish Gupta, Josh Curl and Tejas Manohar.</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;What we found is that, with all the customer data inside of the data warehouse, it doesn&#8217;t make sense for it to just be used for analytics purposes &#8212; it also makes sense for these operational purposes like serving different business teams with the data they need to run things like marketing campaigns &#8212; or in product personalization,&#8221; Manohar told me. &#8220;That&#8217;s the angle that we&#8217;ve taken with Hightouch. It stems from us seeing the explosive growth of the data warehouse space, both in terms of technology advancements as well as like accessibility and adoption. [&#8230;] Our goal is to be seen as the company that makes the warehouse not just for analytics but for these operational use cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>It helps that all of the big data warehousing platforms have standardized on SQL as their query language &#8212; and because the warehousing services have already solved the problem of ingesting all of this data, Hightouch doesn&#8217;t have to worry about this part of the tech stack either. And as Curl added, Snowflake and its competitors never quite went beyond serving the analytics use case either.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087977" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hightouch-graphic-v2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087977" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2087977" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hightouch-graphic-v2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="456" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hightouch-graphic-v2.png 4978w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hightouch-graphic-v2.png?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hightouch-graphic-v2.png?resize=300,134 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hightouch-graphic-v2.png?resize=768,342 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hightouch-graphic-v2.png?resize=680,303 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hightouch-graphic-v2.png?resize=1536,684 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hightouch-graphic-v2.png?resize=2048,913 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hightouch-graphic-v2.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2087977" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hightouch</p></div></p>
<p>As for the product itself, Hightouch lets users create SQL queries and then send that data to different destinations &#8212; maybe a CRM system like Salesforce or a marketing platform like Marketo &#8212; after transforming it to the format that the destination platform expects.</p>
<p>Expert users can write their own SQL queries for this, but the team also built a graphical interface to help non-developers create their own queries. The core audience, though, is data teams &#8212; and they, too, will likely see value in the graphical user interface because it will speed up their workflows as well. &#8220;We want to empower the business user to access whatever models and aggregation the data user has done in the warehouse,&#8221; Gupta explained.</p>
<p>The company is agnostic to how and where its users want to operationalize their data, but the most common use cases right now focus on B2C companies, where marketing teams often use the data, as well as sales teams at B2B companies.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087664" style="width: 431px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-15-132456.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087664" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2087664" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-15-132456.png" alt="" width="421" height="351" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-15-132456.png 574w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-15-132456.png?resize=150,125 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-15-132456.png?resize=300,250 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-15-132456.png?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2087664" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hightouch</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;It feels like there&#8217;s an emerging category here of tooling that&#8217;s being built on top of a data warehouse natively, rather than being a standard SaaS tool where it is its own data store and then you manage a secondary data store,&#8221; Curl said. &#8220;We have a class of things here that connect to a data warehouse and make use of that data for operational purposes. There&#8217;s no industry term for that yet, but we really believe that that&#8217;s the future of where data engineering is going. It&#8217;s about building off this centralized platform like Snowflake, BigQuery and things like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Warehouse-native,&#8221; Manohar suggested as a potential name here. We&#8217;ll see if it sticks.</p>
<p>Hightouch originally raised its round after its participation in the Y Combinator demo day but decided not to disclose it until it felt like it had found the right product/market fit. Current customers include the likes of Retool, Proof, Stream and Abacus, in addition to a number of significantly larger companies the team isn&#8217;t able to name publicly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AWS today <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-location-add-maps-and-location-awareness-to-your-applications/">announced</a> the preview of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/location/">Amazon Location</a>, a new service for developers who want to add location-based features to their web-based and mobile applications.</p>
<p>Based on mapping data from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/location/data-providers/">Esri and HERE Technologies</a>, the service provides all of the basic mapping and point-of-interest data you would expect from a mapping service, including built-in tracking and geofencing features.

<p>At its core, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Location provides the ability to create maps based on the data and styles available from its partners (with more partners in the works) and access to their points of interest. Those are obviously the two core features for any mapping service. On top of this, Location also offers built-in support for trackers, so that apps can receive location updates from devices and plot them on a map. This feature can also be linked to Amazon Location&#8217;s geofencing tool so apps can send alerts when a device (or the dog that wears it) leaves a particular area.</p>
<p>It may not be as fully featured as the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Maps Platform, for example, but AWS promises that Location will be more affordable, with a variety of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/location/pricing/">pricing plans</a> (and a free three-month trial) that start at $0.04 for retrieving 1,000 map tiles. As with all things AWS, the pricing gets more complicated from there, but seems quite reasonable overall.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear Everyone that works at AWS,</p>
<p>Thank you for giving us Amazon Location and helping us break away from the tyranny of Google Maps.</p>
<p>&#8211; The Developer community</p>
<p>&mdash; . (@cloud_opinion) <a href="https://twitter.com/cloud_opinion/status/1339250888163127298?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>While you can&#8217;t directly compare AWS&#8217;s tile-based pricing with Google&#8217;s plans, it&#8217;s worth noting that after you go beyond Google Map Platform&#8217;s $200 of free usage per month, static maps cost $2 per 1,000 requests.</p>
<p>After a <a href="https://www.geoawesomeness.com/developers-up-in-arms-over-google-maps-api-insane-price-hike/">number of pricing changes</a>, Google&#8217;s mapping services lost a lot of goodwill from developers. AWS may be able to capitalize on this with this new platform, especially if it continues to build out its feature set to fill in some of the current gaps in the service.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Now more than ever both the importance and limitations of the global delivery infrastructure are on full display. But while Amazon and others try to speed up last-mile delivery using drones, Dash Systems hopes to expedite the middle mile — with military-inspired airdrops putting pallets of parcels down at their penultimate destinations, even in the most inaccessible of locations.</p>
<p>Air-based delivery generally consists of four steps. First, an item is taken from the warehouse to the airport. Second, it goes by well-packed large cargo planes from there to another major hub, say from New York to Los Angeles. Third, a truck or smaller plane takes these to their regional destination, a sorting or distribution facility. Fourth, they go out on the familiar delivery trucks and end up on your doorstep.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s that third step that Joel Ifill, founder and CEO of Dash, felt could be improved. With an engineering background and experience building guided bombs for the military, he felt that there was an opportunity to apply some of the military&#8217;s point-to-point approach to the commercial sector. Why do you need to land at all?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We should be able to do one-day deliveries anywhere in the world,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;And when I say anywhere, I mean like the tip of Alaska. We&#8217;re already using airplanes, why do we have to have a billion-dollar airport to get it there?&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem, he said, is that the military-style of delivery (for airdrops, anyway, not smart bombs) isn&#8217;t particularly precise: &#8220;Great for storming the coast of Normandy, but not for landing in the parking lot of a post office. We thought we could engineer a solution that was both precise and useful on a commercial basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>What they came up with is perhaps best thought of as skydiving packages that can be dropped at multiple destinations in a single flight. &#8220;We call them pods,&#8221; Ifill said. &#8220;They have control surfaces and a tail kit, and then a method of slowing down and landing. It&#8217;s a turnkey solution you can load in the back of any plane.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dash-drop.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2087991" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dash-drop.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="555" /></a>Each pod can handle about 50 pounds of payload right now, which isn&#8217;t very much in the cargo world, but of course there can be as many of them as you want loaded in there.</p>
<p>But the pods are only part of the equation. The company is taking over a whole segment, and that means telling the pilot exactly where to go. The team focused on making it as simple as possible so very little training was required — all the pilot needs to do is get to the coordinates indicated by the system. And because there&#8217;s no need to land, the plane can deliver pods over a huge range. The Dash system calculates the best route and the pods, upon being released at their appointed coordinates, will get themselves where they need to go.</p>
<p>The hope is that this will simplify the middle-mile situation where slow ground vehicles or costly, fuel-guzzling aircraft are the only options. My concern that the whole concept sounded a bit expensive was met with understanding from Ifill and Bryan Miller, the company&#8217;s COO and chief pilot, who also has a a background in military air operations and engineering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Air cargo isn&#8217;t an intuitively understandable space,&#8221; Ifill admitted. &#8220;It accounts for less than half a percent of shipped weight, but a third of shipping income. Its primary value proposition is speed, not efficiency. The average utilization of cargo craft is less than 50%.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087994" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dash-time.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087994" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2087994" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dash-time.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="554" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dash-time.jpg 1143w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dash-time.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dash-time.jpg?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dash-time.jpg?resize=768,415 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dash-time.jpg?resize=680,368 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dash-time.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2087994" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dash Systems</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;The rural use case is easy to get,&#8221; said Miller, noting the difficulty and delays of delivering to rural communities in Alaska. Getting from the airport in Anchorage to a small post office in the bush is a huge challenge, but if planes could take off from Anchorage and just drop a pallet each on five small airports or helipads, that reduces perhaps dozens of hours of driving — if the roads are even open — to a single flight. And it&#8217;s a relatively safe and cheap one at that because you cut down on takeoffs and landings at airports where any number of Alaska&#8217;s charms may be in play: fog, ice, moose, wind and all the rest.</p>
<p>But there are lots of other places in the lower 48, Miller noted, that can&#8217;t get Amazon&#8217;s two-day delivery, for example, because the infrastructure simply isn&#8217;t there to complete the four steps listed above in that timeframe. But if the Prime packages went on a plane from SFO that would otherwise be only half full, and get dropped on the roof of a FedEx center on the way to the Petaluma airport, it saves everyone time and money.</p>
<p>Commercial contracts are all well and good, but the idea actually got its start in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, where in Puerto Rico, Ifill said, people had gone nearly two weeks without any deliveries because the communications infrastructure was so devastated. &#8220;We had to hike in with a satellite phone to ask the mayor what they needed,&#8221; he said, but actual delivery was a 45-minute flight from San Juan. If commercial air drops had been part of the existing system, it could have made things a lot easier.</p>
<p>So the company will continue pursuing the use case of helping reach destinations rendered temporarily inaccessible by disasters — but the main thing that will make it a successful business is augmenting the existing setup to make remote locations easier to deliver to. Ifill didn&#8217;t seem to think that going up against giants like FedEx and UPS was a problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;No new delivery lane has ever made an old one go out of business,&#8221; he said. This may very well increase their business. &#8220;We&#8217;re competing against the status quo — we don&#8217;t have a patent on gravity or throwing things out of airplanes, but to my knowledge we&#8217;re the farthest along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to own any aircraft,&#8221; said Miller. &#8220;We want to collaborate with all the companies already out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amazingly, the regulatory piece is not a big deal. You would think that dropping heavy items from airplanes near residences would be hard to get a permit for, but it&#8217;s actually all included in existing regulations. The pods aren&#8217;t considered drones, crucially, so they don&#8217;t have to register as such. So far they&#8217;ve dropped 5,000 pounds of cargo in their Alaska pilot flights.</p>
<p>The $8 million seed round was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/8vc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="8vc">8VC, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from Tusk Venture Partners, Loup Ventures, Trust Ventures, Perot Jain and MiLA Capital. It should help scale the team, Ifill said, and further develop the deployment and pod tech, which is functional but far from finalized. They already are looking at some commercial and government contracts for their first customers — as you can imagine, despite the military doing this for years, it&#8217;s a useful tool to have available to some remote outpost or facility.</p>
