										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With its new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apple-launches-the-m1-pro/">M1 Pro</a> and M1 Max chips, Apple declares all-out war on PCs, with a huge boost in performance, while sending battery consumption to the basement. The M1 Max is clearly gunning for the graphics professionals out there, but may also turn out to bring some more gaming capabilities to the Mac.</p>
<p>The M1 Max builds on the M1 Pro architecture, but adds a lot more oomph to the mix. The architecture features much higher bandwidth &#8211; up to 400GB/sec of memory bandwidth, which works out to about six times faster than the already blazingly fast M1 chip &#8211; and twice as fast as the just-announced M1 Pro chip.</p>
<p>The new chip features 57 billion transistors, and supports 64GB of unified memory &#8211; that&#8217;s the shared memory between the GPU and CPU. It shares the same 10-core CPU architecture of the M1 Pro, and bumps the GPU to 32 cores, and a new media engine for hardware-accelerated video processing for H.264 and HEVC. It also features two parallel video encoding engines, which will delight video editors and others doing heavy graphics lifting.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219528" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The most impressive claim is that the M1 Max claims to keep the same power consumption curve per watt &#8211; in other words, more heavy graphics lifting without burning through your battery in minutes.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2219578" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/power.png?w=650" alt="" width="650" height="384" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/power.png 650w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/power.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/power.png?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/power.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been less than year since the release of the first-gen Apple silicon-powered MacBook Pro, and here the company is already returning with a follow up. Of course, the 2020 version of the pro-focused laptop was a bit of a harder sell, with the lines not entirely clear between the M1 version of the Pro and Air.</p>
<p>Today’s news is a bid to rectify that. Apple just dropped a new version of the MacBook Pro that draws a much clearer line between the system and its perennial favorite thin-and-light sibling.</p>
<p>The new system is powered by the new M1 Pro and Max, souped up versions of the chip the company unveiled at today’s event. The company says the 10-core chip is capable of allowing up to 3x the memory bandwidth and up to of the M1, coupled with a 16 core GPU. The Max, meanwhile, bumps the GPU up to 32 cores. What&#8217;s clear is that the company is targeting its bread and butter creative pro demographic in ways it didn&#8217;t with last year&#8217;s models.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219406" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Unlike last year’s model, the new models, which are available in 14- and 16-inch models offer entirely new redesigns. They also feature built-in fans for high-performance applications, though the company says it will rarely turn on. The system also marks the end of the middling-received Touchbar, with a full function key in its place.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2219566" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-macbook-pro-2021-magsafe.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-macbook-pro-2021-magsafe.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-macbook-pro-2021-magsafe.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-macbook-pro-2021-magsafe.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-macbook-pro-2021-magsafe.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-macbook-pro-2021-magsafe.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-macbook-pro-2021-magsafe.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-october-event-macbook-pro-2021-magsafe.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>As one feature leaves, an old favorite returns. Magsafe is back. The third-gen charger sports a proprietary port, but users will be able to continue charging via the Thunderbolt/USB-C ports. The bezel has been reduced, instead opting for an iPhone-style notch at the top to house the webcam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As expected, Apple today announced a new chip &#8212; though with a name few people expected: the M1 Pro, a more powerful version of the M1 chip, which made its debut <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/apple-announces-the-m1-the-first-member-of-its-apple-silicon-family/">last November</a> and has since started to power a variety of Apple devices. Apple promises that the M1 Pro is up to 70% faster than the original M1.</p>
<p>In addition, it also launched the M1 Max, an even more powerful version of the Pro.</p>
<p>The M1 Pro is not quite the successor to the M1, but is essentially a more powerful version of the existing chip. Apple CEO Tim Cook called it &#8220;the next chip in the M1 family &#8212; and it&#8217;s a game-changer.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219449" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>The company says it rearchitected the chip and significantly upped the bandwidth available to the chip to 200GB/s. It can support up to 32GB of unified memory (which may be a bit of a disappointment to some pro users).</p>
<p>The 5nm-chip features more than and a total of 10 cores. Eight of those are high-performance cores, 2 are high-efficiency cores, in addition to 16 GPU cores (up from 8 in the original M1). In total, the SoC features 33.7 billion transistors &#8212; twice as many as the original M1. The chip, of course, also features Apple&#8217;s Neural Engine for AI apps.</p>
<p>The chip is able to support up to two external displays.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2019, Amazon introduced a more affordable way to stream Amazon Music in their home with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/18/amazon-music-echo-ads/">launch of a free, ad-supported music service</a> that streamed over its Echo speakers. Today, Apple is catching up with its debut of a new, lower-cost version of its Apple Music subscription it calls the &#8220;Voice plan.&#8221; Unlike Amazon&#8217;s service, the Voice plan is not free. Instead, it&#8217;s a more affordable, $4.99 per month subscription that limits consumers to only being able to access the Apple Music via Siri voice commands.</p>
<p>Explained the company at its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/apple-october-event-2021/">October event today,</a> the new Voice plan will allow customers, in 17 countries to start, to use Siri to play songs, playlists, and all stations in Apple Music when the service launches later this fall. This will also include access to a series of new playlists based on moods and activities. That means you&#8217;ll now be able to ask Siri to play you music for a dinner party or something that would help you to wind down at the end of the day, for example. Hundreds of playlists will be available, said Apple.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2219533" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-18-at-1.04.43-PM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219506" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Apple Music rivals, including Spotify, Amazon Music, and Pandora already offer such a feature &#8212; and have for years. So this is a matter of Apple playing catch up in the space with its own expanded set of editorially crafted mood and activity playlists. Currently, its editorial selections are more limited to its &#8220;Made for You&#8221; lineup which includes personalized playlists like your Favorites Mix, Chill Mix, New Music Mix and Get Up Mix.</p>
<p>While Apple says the new Voice plan can be used to access Apple Music across &#8220;all your Apple devices,&#8221; it&#8217;s clearly been designed with HomePod in mind &#8212; similar to Amazon&#8217;s free music streaming for Echo. If using a phone, tablet or computer, it wouldn&#8217;t necessarily make sense to speak to Siri to play music when you have a device with a screen. However, the service could possibly be interesting to those who primarily listen to Apple Music via their AirPods&#8230;and don&#8217;t mind speaking all their commands.</p>
<p>The new service joins the other Apple Music subscriptions, the Individual plan and Family plan, at $9.99 per month or $14.99 per month respectively. Like the Individual plan, the new Voice Plan is also limited to just 1 person per subscription, Apple said.</p>
<p>At launch, it will be available in Australia, Austria, Canada, China mainland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Taiwan, the U.K. and the U.S. The company didn&#8217;t offer an exact launch date besides &#8220;later this fall.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To complement the launch of the new service, Apple also announced new, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apple-announces-third-generation-airpods-with-new-design-spatial-audio/">third-gen AirPods</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apples-homepod-mini-gets-new-colors/">more colorful lineup</a> of HomePod mini smart speakers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AirPods are nearly five years old, and while the product line has seen some major additions over the years, things have looked pretty similar for the entry-level product.</p>
<p>Today, Apple debuted the third-generation AirPods, bringing the wireless earbuds closer in line with the capabilities and design of their higher-end AirPods Pro. The new design brings shorter microphone stems to the headphones, while a more contoured design dispenses of hard edges.</p>
<p>The headphones will retail for $179, a bump over the last generation&#8217;s $159 price point. Pre-orders start today and they will ship on October 26th.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219510" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not just an aesthetic upgrade, the new headphones now sport a 6 hour battery life alongside their new AirPods Pro-like charging case with MagSafe charging. Acoustically, the AirPods now have a newly-designed &#8220;low-distortion&#8221; driver powering the listening experience. You can also now listen to spatial audio, which was previously only available on the AirPods Pro And AirPods Max.</p>
<p>Other updates include sweat and water resistance (at last!) so that the headphones can thrive as better workout companions. They also are gaining the force-sensor input that the AirPods Pro use so you won&#8217;t be tapping to control the new headphones, you&#8217;ll be giving the stem of the AirPods a small squeeze.</p>
<p>Apple will continue selling the second-generation AirPods for $129.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Michigan-based startup <a href="http://www.one.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Next Energy</a> (ONE) has closed a $25 million Series A for tech that it says can double the range of EVs, as more and more startups take aim at surpassing the pitfalls of conventional lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<p>The 15-month-old company managed to attract major investors, including Bill Gates-founded Breakthrough Energy Ventures, which led the round. Assembly Ventures, BMW i Ventures (German automaker BMW’s venture fund), Singapore-based Flex and Volta Energy Technologies also participated.</p>
<p>ONE is developing a hybrid cell-to-pack system composed of two batteries: the Aries, a cobalt-free battery that the company says avoids fire risk from thermal runaway; and a battery range extender called the Gemini, which ONE estimates will be capable of a staggering 700-mile range on a single charge. The idea is that the Aries would be used for daily trips, while the Gemini could be used for the occasional longer trip. (ONE cites research on its website noting that 85% of vehicles are used at least once per year for a trip longer than 300 miles.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219484" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s this hybrid approach that may allow ONE to succeed where others have failed. Key to the hybrid concept is in the chemistries: the Aries is a lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) chemistry. This is significant because LFPs are an older, cheaper formula that’s conventionally viewed as less energy-dense than more powerful nickel-based battery chemistries. But ONE says its Aries battery pack has managed to increase range and reduce cost, all while avoiding the pitfalls of nickel-based batteries &#8212; namely, the reliance on scarce raw materials like nickel and cobalt.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qws3DdlXwz"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/what-teslas-bet-on-iron-based-batteries-means-for-manufacturers/">What Tesla’s bet on iron-based batteries means for manufacturers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What Tesla’s bet on iron-based batteries means for manufacturers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/what-teslas-bet-on-iron-based-batteries-means-for-manufacturers/embed/#?secret=qws3DdlXwz" data-secret="qws3DdlXwz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>ONE’s first customer, the identity of which the startup is not disclosing, will use the Aries as a replacement for a nickel-based pack, a company spokesperson said. If LFP batteries could be used as a drop-in replacement for nickel batteries, without the associated trade-offs in range and cost, it could be a game changer for the industry.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219485" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219485" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2219485" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ONE-CEO-Mujeeb-Ijaz.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="1416" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ONE-CEO-Mujeeb-Ijaz.jpeg 5085w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ONE-CEO-Mujeeb-Ijaz.jpeg?resize=108,150 108w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ONE-CEO-Mujeeb-Ijaz.jpeg?resize=217,300 217w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ONE-CEO-Mujeeb-Ijaz.jpeg?resize=768,1062 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ONE-CEO-Mujeeb-Ijaz.jpeg?resize=492,680 492w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ONE-CEO-Mujeeb-Ijaz.jpeg?resize=1110,1536 1110w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ONE-CEO-Mujeeb-Ijaz.jpeg?resize=1481,2048 1481w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ONE-CEO-Mujeeb-Ijaz.jpeg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219485" class="wp-caption-text">ONE CEO Mujeeb Ijaz. <strong>Image Credits: </strong>Our Next Energy</p></div></p>
<p>LFP batteries also tend to have a lower fire risk than nickel and cobalt chemistries, because they are more stable and require a much higher temperature to reach thermal runaway &#8212; a chain reaction that occurs when a battery cell is unable to discharge heat at the rate it&#8217;s being generated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>ONE was founded by Mujeeb Ijaz, a battery tech veteran who previously led the team at Ford developing its first hybrid fuel cell powertrain, before being poached from battery manufacturer A123 Systems to work on Apple’s mysterious car project. He founded ONE just one month after leaving the consumer tech giant.</p>
<p>The Aries will go into production at the end of 2022. ONE plans to manufacture the batteries in Michigan with a contract manufacturing partner, and the funding will be used to accelerate product development, Ijaz said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ViacomCBS CEO Bob Bakish this morning downplayed his company&#8217;s interest in a potential merger &#8212; like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/20/comcast-and-viacomcbs-consider-partnership-to-bolster-streaming-tv.html">one with its partner Comcast</a>. At the WSJ Tech Live conference today, the media company exec said the company&#8217;s current strategy was to focus on its &#8220;organic plan&#8221; in streaming, which would be the best path forward to create shareholder value. He also claimed it was still &#8220;early days&#8221; for its new service Paramount+, essentially downplaying the ideas that a merger would be necessary for the service to succeed.</p>
<p>Pressed for comment on the matter, Bakish didn&#8217;t give a direct answer as to whether the company is considering any M&amp;A deals, and instead touted the growth Paramount+ has been seeing throughout the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paramount+ is seven months old. So it&#8217;s very early days,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have nice subscriber acquisition in Q1 and Q2, frankly on the back of a pretty weak content slate,&#8221; he continued, adding that the slate would grow significantly later in the year. &#8220;We see nice momentum ahead of us. And that&#8217;s the lane I continue to feel we should be focused on,&#8221; Bakish noted.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219450" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Of course, describing Paramount+ as a new service is only somewhat accurate.</p>
<p>In reality, the service is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/paramount-the-successor-to-cbs-all-access-launches-march-4-in-the-u-s-canada-and-latin-america/">successor</a> to the company&#8217;s earlier streaming endeavor, CBS All Access, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/a-rebranded-and-updated-version-of-cbs-all-access-will-launch-this-summer/">rebranded</a> and expanded to include Viacom content following the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/13/viacomcbs/"> 2019 CBS and Viacom merger</a>. In a sense, it&#8217;s a new product with a larger library, but the core service has been around for years. And, as of yet, it has not been able to pose a viable threat to top rivals like Netflix or Disney+, for example, which have <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-adds-1-5-million-subscribers-in-q2-as-pandemic-growth-slows/">209 million+</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/business/disney-plus-subscribers.html">116 million subscribers</a>, respectively. In fact, CBS historically wouldn&#8217;t even break out numbers for CBS All Access separately from Showtime. That tradition continues at ViacomCBS which <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/paramount-plus-42-million-subscribers-viacomcbs-subscriptions-showtime-icarly/">announced</a> in Q2 the two platforms &#8212; Paramount+ and Showtime OTT &#8212; had together topped 42 million paid global subscribers in the quarter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s led to the company looking for other ways to drive growth &#8212; including, recently, through international joint ventures, like its new partnership with Comcast on <a href="https://www.skygroup.sky/article/comcast-and-viacomcbs-announce-skyshowtime-a-new-streaming-service-to-launch-in-select-european-markets">SkyShowtime</a> in Europe, for instance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite Bakish&#8217;s remarks downplaying M&amp;A, Comcast&#8217;s NBCU and ViacomCBS had been talking about the various ways they could work together, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nbcuniversals-streaming-strategy-raise-prospect-of-warnermedia-merger?rc=ajsw4d">reports have said</a>. This has included discussions of offering a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/20/comcast-and-viacomcbs-consider-partnership-to-bolster-streaming-tv.html">bundle</a> of their streaming services, Peacock and Paramount+. But a merger or acquisition could always be another option. While these types of deals are more complex, the question remains as to how either service will get scale in the current market by going it alone.</p>
<p>Bakish, speaking at today&#8217;s event, seemed to dismiss the idea that M&amp;A was the way to go for now, however.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, we&#8217;re focused on shareholder value creation. As we look at the landscape today, particularly where our stock trades at the moment, we believe the strongest route to shareholder value creation is executing against our organic plan in streaming,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Further pressed on the idea of a horizontal merger in order to achieve faster scale, Bakish recalled that not all deals work out as expected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Consolidation has been true in business for a very long time, whether that&#8217;s vertical mergers, horizontal mergers &#8212; that&#8217;s a tried and true business technique. By the way, a lot of deals get unwound too when they didn&#8217;t work out well. Ultimately it comes down to execution,&#8221; he said. He then touted the company&#8217;s asset base which includes a Hollywood film studio, 100-year old library, and significant ongoing production.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I look at that content asset and deploying against a  streaming platform &#8212; in this case, Paramount+ &#8212; there&#8217;s real momentum already and there&#8217;s real growth ahead. And I think that&#8217;s a very compelling lane to be in,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Leashes, you say? No leashes here, pal. No, Apple is apparently going <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/apple-is-going-unleashed-for-an-october-18-event/">fully off-leash</a> for today’s big presser. Today at <strong>10AM PT/1PM ET</strong>, it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/16/what-to-expect-from-apple-google-and-samsungs-big-events/">kicking off a big week of hardware news</a>, as part of a final industry push ahead of the holidays.</p>
<p>It was just over a month ago that the company unveiled a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-its-event-this-morning/">whole bunch of new devices</a>, including iPhones, iPads and the latest Apple Watch. So, what’s left? Macs, obviously. As Apple makes a line-wide transition to first-party silicon, we expect a number of new products, including (potentially) a new MacBook, Mac Mini and a larger iMac, all powered by the latest M1X chip.</p>
<p>Given that this is (likely) a last hurrah for the year, other products may well be on-tap, including a new version of Apple’s entry-level AirPods. Matthew and Darrell will be on hand, bringing you the news as it breaks. All of the information for watching the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apple-unleashed-macbook-pro-keynote-livestream/">livestream can be found here</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is set to announce new hardware today. The company is holding a (virtual) keynote at <strong>10 AM PT (1 PM in New York, 6 PM in London, 7 PM in Paris)</strong>. And you’ll be able to watch the event right here as the company is streaming it live.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/exM1uajp--A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/16/what-to-expect-from-apple-google-and-samsungs-big-events/">Rumor has it</a> that the company is set to announce some new Macs. Over the past year, Apple has updated its entry-level computers with new custom-designed M1 chips. And now, the company could bring its own chips to higher-end computers, such as a 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro, a new Mac Mini and a 27-inch iMac.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219196" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Apple could use this opportunity to redesign its laptops from the ground up with new display technologies, a new array of ports and a new form factor in general. But that’s not all. Apple has also been working on an updated version of its entry-level AirPods.</p>
<p>You can watch the livestream directly on this page, as Apple is streaming its conference on YouTube.</p>
<p>If you have an Apple TV, you can open the TV app and look for the ‘Apple Special Event’ section. It lets you stream today’s event and rewatch old ones.</p>
<p>And if you don’t have an Apple TV and don’t want to use YouTube, the company also lets you livestream the event from the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">Apple Events section</a> on its website. This video feed now works in all major browsers — Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome.</p>
<p>We’ll be covering the event and you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/live-from-apples-unleashed-event/">follow our liveblog</a> for live commentary.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">REvil, the notorious Russian-linked <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> gang responsible for the high-profile <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/kaseya-hack-flood-ransomware/">cyberattacks</a> on Kaseya, Travelex, and JBS earlier this year, has disappeared again after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/tor/">Tor</a> payment portal and data leak blog were allegedly hijacked.</p>
<p>The shutdown comes weeks after the group re-emerged following a months-long hiatus, during which the group went quiet after facing heat from the U.S. government in response <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/kaseya-hack-flood-ransomware/">to its attack on Kaseya</a>, which resulted in thousands of companies becoming infected with ransomware. News of the shutdown was first claimed by a threat actor known to be affiliated with the REvil operation in a post on a known criminal forum, first discovered by Recorded Future&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/ddd1ms/status/1449865145308651528">Dmitry Smilyanets</a>.</p>
<p>The threat actor&#8217;s post said the group&#8217;s Tor services were hijacked and replaced with a copy of the group&#8217;s private keys, likely from an earlier backup. &#8220;The server was compromised and they were looking for me,&#8221; the post reads. &#8220;To be precise, they deleted the path to my hidden service in the torrc file [used for configuring the Tor service] and raised their own so that I would go there. I checked on others — this was not. Good luck everyone, I&#8217;m off.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219367" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2219453" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219453" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2219453" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nginx-revil.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="446" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nginx-revil.jpg 1616w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nginx-revil.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nginx-revil.jpg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nginx-revil.jpg?resize=768,428 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nginx-revil.jpg?resize=680,379 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nginx-revil.jpg?resize=1536,856 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nginx-revil.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219453" class="wp-caption-text">What REvil&#8217;s Tor site looks like at the time of publication following an apparent hijack. (Image: TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p>At the time of writing, it isn&#8217;t clear who compromised REvil&#8217;s servers. A report by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/ransomware-fbi-revil-decryption-key/2021/09/21/4a9417d0-f15f-11eb-a452-4da5fe48582d_story.html">The Washington Post</a> in September said the FBI had obtained the group&#8217;s encryption keys for the companies hit by the Kaseya attack in July, but that the agency&#8217;s planned takedown never happened after the group disappeared. Others are <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-shuts-down-again-after-tor-sites-were-hijacked/">pointing to a possible takeover</a> by a former group member, known as &#8220;Unkn,&#8221; or Unknown, a long-time spokesperson for the group, who did not return when the rest of the group reemerged in September.</p>
<p>“Since there was no confirmation of the reason for his loss, we resumed work, thinking that he was dead,” the threat actor explained in their forum post. “But since we have today at 17.10 from 12:00 Moscow time, someone brought up the hidden-services of a landing and a bog with the same key as ours, my fears were concerned.”</p>
<p>VX-Underground, a website that hosts malware source code, samples, and papers, <a href="https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1449776517983215620?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">tweeted</a> that only Unknown and the forum-posting threat actor had REvil domain keys and that the ransomware group’s domain was recently accessed using Unknown&#8217;s keys.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether REvil — linked to the majority of ransomware detections in the second quarter this year, according to McAfee — is gone for good. But since the group’s surprise reappearance in September, it has struggled to recruit users, prompting the group to <a href="https://twitter.com/y_advintel/status/1446528895537356825">increase its affiliate commissions</a> to entice new threat actors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the course of the last decade or so, open source changed dramatically. What was once mostly a philosophical discussion about cathedrals, bazaars and the evils of Microsoft &#8212; which in turn lead to the people building compilers and the likes of the Linux kernel &#8212; became the de facto standard for how even traditional enterprises build modern software in the open. With that came new business models that now range from selling professional services for open source users to adding proprietary paid extensions with additional &#8220;enterprise&#8221; features and, increasingly, launching fully managed hosted SaaS versions of open source products.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, at our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=opensourcepost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=opensourcepost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a> event on October 27, we will talk about exactly that: how to build successful SaaS products on top of open source. To do so, Puppet CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abbykearns/">Abby Kearns</a>, Kong CEO, president and co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonicaghi/">Augusto &#8220;Aghi&#8221; Marietti</a> and Redpoint Ventures managing director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jcwarner/">Jason Warner</a> will join us.</p>
<p>Kearns is currently the CTO of IT automation service Puppet, which offers and open source version of its core tools, as well as a large ecosystem of open sourced modules that extend its services. But before joining the company, she was also the executive director of the Cloud Foundry Foundation, where she helped shepherd one of the largest and most active enterprise-focused open source projects through a time of change. Cloud Foundry, which was first developed inside of VMware, itself formed the basis of a number of SaaS-like offerings from the likes of Pivotal and SUSE.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216879" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://konghq.com/">Kong</a>, previously known as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/mashape/">Mashape</a>, is somewhat of a posterchild of open source commercialization. A lot of the core services of its API and microservices management tools are available under <a href="https://github.com/Kong/">an open source license today</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/28/mashape-open-sources-its-kong-api-management-platform/">Back in 2015</a>, the company first open-sourced the Kong API management service, and it has kept this focus on open source going. The company recently launched new open source projects like its Kuma control plane (which it then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/kong-donates-its-kuma-control-plane-to-the-cloud-native-computing-foundation/">donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>), for example. Meanwhile, the company now has raised over $171 million in funding and was most recently valued at $1.4 billion. Its customers range from the likes of Deutsche Telekom to Papa John&#8217;s and Siemens. Italy-born Marietti founded the company back in 2009 and the team actually showed a first prototype at what was then the TechCrunch50 conference.</p>
<p>Redpoint&#8217;s Jason Warner made a name for himself during his time at Heroku and than as GitHub&#8217;s CEO, but even before he decamped to the VC world this summer, he was already a very active angel investor whose name kept popping up in the press releases about some of the most interesting startups in recent years. Over the course of the last year or so, he invested in companies like <a href="https://magic.link/">Magic</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/census-raises-16m/">Census</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/jam-raises-3-5-million-to-figma-tize-product-collaboration/">Jam</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/sym-raises-9m-series-a-for-its-security-workflow-platform/">Sym</a>, for example. Some of these build a lot of open source themselves, some only consume it, but either way, Warner will be able to give us the VC perspective on the state of the open source industry and what makes him want to invest (or not) in open source centric startups.</p>
<p>In addition to our discussion on open source, the conference will also include Google’s Javier Soltero, as well as investors Kobie Fuller and Casey Aylward, among others. We hope you’ll join us. It’s going to be a thought-provoking lineup.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Organizations that have made the leap into using big data to drive their business are increasingly looking for better, more efficient ways to share data with others without compromising privacy and data protection laws, and that is ushering in a rush of technologists building a number of new approaches to fill that need. In the latest development, a startup called TripleBlind &#8212; which has devised a way to encrypt data so that it can be shared without ever being decrypted or even leaving the data owner&#8217;s firewall, and keeping the whole process compliant with data protection regulations &#8212; is announcing new funding on the heels of strong demand for its technology.</p>
<p>The Kansas City, Missouri startup has closed a round of $24 million, a Series A that it will be using to continue developing its technology and to extend into a wider range of enterprise verticals. The round is being co-led by General Catalyst and the Mayo Clinic, with AVG Basecamp Fund, Accenture Ventures, Clocktower Technology Ventures, Dolby Family Ventures, Flyover Capital, KCRise Fund, NextGen Venture Partners and Wavemaker Three-Sixty Health also participating. The round was oversubscribed but the company is not disclosing its valuation. It&#8217;s raised more than $32 million to date.</p>
<p>TripleBlind&#8217;s platform, which officially launched in November 2020, is compliant today with data privacy and data residency regulations in some 100 countries, HIPAA, GDPR and California’s CCPA among them. The company estimates there are some 43 zetabytes of data stored by enterprises today globally that is not being used as it could be because of the limitations imposed both by these and other data protection rules, as well as general hesitancy over sharing IP and other issues around sharing data. It works with data in a variety of formats, including PII, PHI, genomic data, images and confidential financial records.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219197" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As an indicator of where TripleBlind is finding initial traction for its product, Mayo &#8212; one of the world&#8217;s leading institutions for medical research &#8212; is one of TripleBlind&#8217;s strategic investors. Mayo is using its technology both around data encryption and to help build algorithms based on data sets without needing to share raw data.</p>
<p>This addresses a longstanding problem typically faced when two institutions (or even one institution working with multiple data sets) collaborate: normally, they have to transfer data and/or algorithms based on that data, in order to train systems or to conduct research.</p>
<p>With TripleBlind, the idea is that they no longer have to. (The &#8220;triple&#8221; in its name is a reference to TripleBlind or a receiving data user variously being &#8220;blind to data, blind to processing, and blind to the result.&#8221;)</p>
<p>“Bringing together AI algorithms and data in ways that preserve privacy and intellectual property is one of the keys to delivering the next generation of digital medicine,” says John Halamka, M.D., president of Mayo Clinic Platform. “These novel privacy-protected solutions promise to usher a new era of collaboration.” Halamka and Shail Jain, global managing director, Data &amp; AI from Accenture, are both joining as board observers with this round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mayo Clinic also invested an undisclosed amount in an extension to <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/04/27/2217775/0/en/TripleBlind-Receives-Investment-from-Mayo-Clinic-Expanding-Current-Collaboration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TripleBlind&#8217;s $8.2 million seed round</a>. Mayo Clinic is not its only strategic backer: Accenture and Okta are two others; other customers include Snowflake.</p>
<p>Riddhiman Das, TripleBlind’s co-founder and CEO, said in an interview that healthcare and medical research continue to be big areas for TripleBlind, and that it is seeing growing interest also from financial services, media and utilities.</p>
<p>Innovations in big data analytics are opening up new frontiers in how organizations can pool wider bodies of knowledge to help them make breakthroughs and develop new algorithms in areas that have often been presented as figurative black holes, whether that is in medical research, or training an autonomous system, or tracking network activity for trends or malfunctions, or around better information about customer sentiment, or something else altogether.</p>
<p>The catch is that we&#8217;re in an age where privacy and data protection matter more than ever, not just from a regulatory point of view, but from our own tastes as consumers, and, in the case of businesses, as a matter of intellectual property protection, so using data liberally comes with a lot of caveats, if not outright restrictions.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re seeing an interesting proliferation of technologies being honed to address this paradox, including applications of homomorphic encryption, synthetic datasets, federated learning and putting data &#8220;on the blockchain,&#8221; among others</p>
<p>TripleBlind&#8217;s approach has been to create a system that it believes addresses the various issues exposed by other approaches: for example, homomorphic encryption is resource-intensive and hard to scale; tokenization/masking/hashing and differential privacy reduces accuracy; synthetic data is not actual real data; federated learning leaves open the potential for data reconstruction; and blockchain is not set up for data sharing.</p>
<p>(On the other hand, and to the credit of a lot of the wider community of technologists working in this area, those working on specific solutions are, in fact, moving to blended approaches, borrowing pieces from different techniques, as a next-generation approach, TripleBlind included.)</p>
<p>At TripleBlind, Das said he started to think about trying out a new approach to sharing data without compromising data protection or privacy when he was previously working at Alibaba&#8217;s Ant. The financial services giant had, in 2017, acquired <a href="https://fortune.com/2016/09/13/alibaba-buys-eye-scan-firm-eyeverify/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;">eye-scanning biometrics startup </span></a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">EyeVerify for $100 million &#8212; where Das was the product architect &#8212; but the acquisition was not developing as Ant had hoped: it ran into controversy over privacy issues, or what Das described as &#8220;data access issues.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">More specifically, &#8220;We struggled with accessing data to improve our models and the precision of the service,&#8221; he said. So he moved over from there into corporate development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">(In fact, Alibaba never did manage to square that circle, and now it is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ant-group-divestiture-eyeverify-idUSKBN29W02V" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly looking to divest the company</a>, which has now been rebranded as the more vague-sounding Zoloz.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In his new role, Das said he started to see a bigger picture emerge about how enterprises, Ant specifically and others more generally, tackle data and privacy issues. It covered more than just biometrics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We also had problems in accessing data for anti-money laundering, know your customer algorithms, and more,&#8221; he said. Regulations around data residency and privacy &#8220;really hindered our ability to use data.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">He spent years evaluating different solutions and eventually came upon the idea of building something a little different to approach the same problem: &#8220;The predominant school of thought on data privacy is that it&#8217;s about computational privacy&#8221; &#8212; that is, encryption &#8212; &#8220;but there are restrictions around contractual limitations.&#8221; TripleBlind still applies encryption to data and algorithms, but its patented approach to encryption and the architecture of how data is used mean that the data never leaves its owner when it&#8217;s being used in computations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">That is the critical point for investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“TripleBlind is an incredible platform for empowering companies to collaborate on data while preserving privacy, data rights and intellectual property. Particularly important today in the healthcare industry, as the lack of data mobility results in fragmented and non-optimal care,” said Quentin Clark, managing director, General Catalyst. “At General Catalyst we believe that TripleBlind&#8217;s platform for enabling teams to work together with the most private and sensitive data is a necessary part of how companies will be able have agility while respecting the privacy of their customers, and the intellectual property of their partners. We are thrilled to work with the TripleBlind team as they work to achieve their mission.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>GitLab, for example, went public last week. The devops giant raised its price range, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/3-things-gitlabs-wild-ipo-pricing-says-about-public-markets/">priced above that interval</a>, and then shot higher once shares began to trade. It&#8217;s a great time to go public for tech companies with growth stories.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</strong></em></p>
<hr />
<p>Expensify is one such company, though things have been turbulent this past year and a half. The Portland, Oregon-based expense management company had a tough COVID-19 cycle. As we&#8217;ll see, COVID impacted the company&#8217;s growth rate as well as its retention metrics. But things have since turned around, fortunately.</p>
<p>For more on the Expensify story, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1/">our own Anna Heim wrote the definitive series on the company</a>.</p>
<p>This morning, let&#8217;s get into the guts of this profitable, growing technology company that hasn&#8217;t raised material primary capital since <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/expensify-com-series-c--9d36bead">its 2015-era Series C</a>. The company was valued at around $143 million, <a href="http://pitchbook.com">per PitchBook data</a>, in the $17.5 million fundraise.</p>
<p>That valuation is a bit out of date, so we&#8217;ll have to come up with some new estimates.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re digging into the Expensify S-1 filing, looking at its 2019, 2020, and H1 2021 results through the lens of COVID&#8217;s impact on the company&#8217;s operating results and its rebound. We also want to understand <em>how</em> the company is profitable, and how its SMB focus has turned out to be more of a boon than a burr.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s have some fun!</p>
<h2>How Expensify makes money</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about Expensify&#8217;s business model first.</p>
<p>The company mostly sells to SMBs, or smaller companies. Venture investors have historically viewed SMB-focused businesses as less valuable than those selling to larger customers, as the latter tend to have lower churn and better upsell metrics. That may be true, but Expensify&#8217;s results indicate that you can actually do quite well selling software to SMBs, provided you have the right go-to-market motion.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Builder.io provides a drag-and-drop visual editor and headless content management system so that marketers can update websites without developer support.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Any e-commerce business has to constantly change its digital storefront to ensure accurate inventory is represented. But to launch a new product or test a homepage placement often requires the need to tap busy developers for guidance, slowing down the process.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.builder.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Builder.io</a> believes customers should be able to create the kinds of commerce experiences they want, like a drag-and-drop system, that they could plug into their tech stack without that developer support.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced $14 million new funding from Greylock, with participation from Imaginary Ventures and a group of angel investors, including Everlane founder and CEO Michael Preysman, Hopin CTO Anthony Kennada and Datadog COO Adam Blitzer.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218806" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Company co-founders Steve Sewell and Brent Locks saw this problem play out when they worked together building web applications at the fashion e-commerce company ShopStyle. CEO Sewell said the company was one of the first to go “headless,” meaning to separate the front-end applications from the back-end so they can be independently updated without affecting the other.</p>
<p>However, while updating the ShopStyle pages, they ran into a flood of non-developer requests for assistance updating and testing pages and it became overwhelming.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We did not really think about content management at all,” Sewell told TechCrunch. “We weren&#8217;t prepared for that. We had this nice API infrastructure, but didn&#8217;t have a way to manage these things.”</p>
<p>Typically to get something like a new button on a webpage, that request might go to an engineer and be done in a month, if even prioritized at all.</p>
<p>To get around the timing, the marketing team would often create their own pages using other software and then integrate it into the company’s site, which slows down the website, he added.</p>
<p>“Code is a bottleneck for merchants, and the reality becomes that they don’t build anything new or test anything because it takes too long and is too expensive,” Sewell added.</p>
<p>Instead, Builder.io provides the proper web flow with a drag-and-drop visual editor and headless content management system so that marketers, product managers or designers can use existing components, or create their own, to build out the content, run the A/B tests and measure the conversions they need.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Commercetools raises $140M at a $1.9B valuation as &#8216;headless&#8217; commerce continues to boom&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/commercetools-raises-140m-at-a-1-9b-valuation-as-headless-commerce-continues-to-boom/embed/#?secret=YM2gWXsUe7" data-secret="YM2gWXsUe7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Since launching the commerce tool in 2019, the company is seeing six times year-over-year customer growth and now works with over 400 customers, including Everlane, Alo Yoga, Afterpay and Vistaprint. It also brought in Angular founder Misko Hevery as its chief technology officer.</p>
<p>That growth led to the company going after new funding to hire additional staff in support and sales. It launched a native integration with Shopify in 2020, and with the funding announcement, also is unveiling universal connectors so that commerce companies can integrate with any headless commerce platform or API without code changes, as well as for developers to build their own connectors to data sources.</p>
<p>“We want to get to the point where every person can make something easily and know how to create anything they can imagine,” Sewell said.</p>
<p>Mike Duboe, a partner at Greylock and a Builder board member, says he also saw this problem firsthand while working at Stitch Fix, where he was the first in-house growth hire.</p>
<p>One of the problems he was looking at was reducing dependencies on developers and allowing more headless operations. For every new page that someone wanted to spin up, it would go to the end of the cue. Merchants don’t often have engineers, or just a few, and any byproducts added to the site slows the speed down, Duboe added.</p>
<p>“Steve and Brent were living this stuff before it became the lexicon,” he said. “They are also interesting complements: Steve has the caliber of a technical leader, and recruiting the founder of Angular to be CTO has resulted in the company being a talent magnet. We invested before that happened, but he has passion and cares about performance. Brent is a leader on the product and business side, and they both have deep empathy.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zoox, the autonomous vehicle startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/amazon-to-acquire-autonomous-driving-startup-zoox/">acquired last year by Amazon</a>, is expanding to Seattle. The company plans to open in 2022 an engineering office and operations facility, which will act as a base for its autonomous vehicle testing,</p>
<p>Zoox, which today employs more than 1,300 people, tests its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, Las Vegas and Foster City, California, near its headquarters. The company started <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/self-driving-vehicle-startup-zoox-has-expanded-to-las-vegas/">testing its autonomous vehicles</a> on public roads in Las Vegas in 2019.</p>
<p>The operations facility and engineering office will be staffed by mostly new employees, according to co-founder and CTO Jesse Levinson. The exact number of employees in Seattle was not disclosed, but Levinson said it is part of the company&#8217;s goal to create 450 new jobs in 2021.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219250" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While Zoox is setting up operations in the city where Amazon is based, Levinson told TechCrunch the two companies still operate separately. The Zoox office and operations hub will not be housed on the Amazon campus, for instance. Zoox will take advantage of its proximity to Amazon to work with the company on various collaborations in the future, Levinson said, describing that as an &#8220;extra bonus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Levison said Zoox has been eyeing Seattle as a test site for years. The company even completed a small pilot in the city in late 2019. The frequency of rain in the area is one of the primary reasons Zoox picked Seattle, Levinson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For better or for worse, it doesn&#8217;t rain very much in San Francisco and rains even less than Las Vegas,&#8221; he said &#8220;We want an ODD (operational design domain) that has a significant amount of rain and a frequent amount of rain for our testing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zoox has developed some advanced weather proofing, including what Levinson described as &#8220;active rain mitigation&#8221; for its sensors. &#8220;We&#8217;re very excited about that and we want to test it and validate it in the rain; Seattle is a great place for that,&#8221; Levinson said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zoox is also interested in Seattle because of its tunnels and differentiated road network topology, policy toward AVs and because the company views Seattle as an ideal city to launch a commercial robotaxi service.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve obviously announced already that San Francisco and Las Vegas are two target commercialization cities that we&#8217;ve been working on and that&#8217;s still the case,&#8221; Levinson said. &#8220;But as far as future expansion goes, Seattle is way up there on our list of good places to launch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zoox will be testing its so-called &#8220;Level 3&#8221; fleet of vehicles in Seattle. These are Toyota Highlander SUVs equipped with an autonomous vehicle system. The sensor architecture on its L3 testing fleet matches that of its purpose-built electric autonomous robotaxi, a vehicle with no steering wheel and a moonroof that is capable of transporting four people at speeds of up to 75 miles per hour. The idea is that testing and validation of its L3 vehicles directly relates to its purpose-built &#8220;L5&#8221; vehicle, Levinson said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toyota Motor is joining other major automakers in putting its money behind electrification, saying Monday it would invest $3.4 billion in battery development and production in the United States through the end of the decade.</p>
<p>The investment, which comes through the Japanese automaker’s North American arm, includes plans for a new $1.3 billion electric vehicle battery plant under a new company and with its metals unit Toyota Tsusho. The plant is anticipated to enter production in 2025 and expand through 2031, by which time it will employ around 1,750 people. The location has not been announced.</p>
<p>The new plans are part of Toyota’s larger aim to invest $13.5 billion globally to keep up with other automakers who have already pledged to earmark massive sums to boost battery development and electrify their respective portfolios. Major auto OEMs like General Motors have announced similar, though much larger, investments. GM plans to spend<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/gm-increases-ev-and-av-investments-to-35b-through-2025/"> $35 billion through 2025</a> to bring 30 new EVs to the global market and build additional assembly capacity for electric models.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219379" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The factory will initially produce batteries for hybrid vehicles, Toyota said. The automaker did not disclose the expected production capacity of the new facility.</p>
<p>Toyota’s plans for a new battery manufacturing facility echo other recent announcements from companies like Ford, which along with its battery partner SK Innovation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/ford-sk-to-spend-11-4b-to-build-two-us-manufacturing-campuses-dedicated-to-evs-and-batteries/">will spend $11.4 billion</a> on two U.S. manufacturing sites dedicated to EV batteries. Stellantis, the automaker formed after a merger between Fiat Chrysler and Groupe PSA, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/stellantis-lg-energy-to-build-u-s-battery-factory-in-new-joint-venture/">also said Monday</a> it would produce battery cells and modules in North America in a preliminary deal with LG Energy Solutions.</p>
<p>However, Toyota’s news strikes a slightly different note, as it clearly indicates that the industrial giant is planning on producing batteries entirely in-house.</p>
<p>Relative to other automakers, Toyota has been slow to roll out electric vehicles. The company does not currently sell any battery electric vehicles (BEV) in the U.S., though it does sell several plug-in hybrids and hybrid vehicles. It announced plans earlier this year to introduce the first BEV to North American markets &#8212; the bZ4X crossover &#8212; next year. It aims to boost its EV lineup to 15 models globally by 2025.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
