										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SME-focused business travel booking platform, <a href="https://www.travelperk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TravelPerk</a>, has topped up the $160 million in equity and debt it raised last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/travelperk-raises-160m-in-equity-and-debt-after-a-year-of-derailed-business-trips/">in a Series D last April </a>with an additional $115M &#8212; closing out the round at $275M.</p>
<p>TravelPerk said its business is now being valued at $1.3BN &#8212; meaning it&#8217;s achieved coveted &#8216;unicorn&#8217; status.</p>
<p>In total, it has raised $409M since being founded back in 2015.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256643" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company declined to disclose a valuation when it took in the earlier slice of equity and debt last year so the Barcelona-based startup is sounding more confident going into 2022 vs Spring 2021.</p>
<p>That said, it&#8217;s not clear how much of the $115M tranche is equity vs debt &#8212; a spokeswoman for the startup declined to provide a break down or a clear answer when we asked, saying only: &#8220;This round is a mix of equity and debt funding.&#8221;</p>
<p>The final tranche of the D round was led by US VC firm General Catalyst, a new investor in the business, along with existing backer Kinnevik.</p>
<p>Another investor in this slice of the Series D, Gillian Tans, ex-chairwoman and CEO of Booking.com &#8212; who is investing in a  personal capacity &#8212; is joining the board of directors alongside Joel Cutler, an early investor in Stripe, Airbnb, and Kayak.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Tans said: “I have been working in the travel industry for many years, and TravelPerk is the one company that never ceases to surprise me. It has solidified its leadership position over the last two years in challenging times for the travel industry, emerging stronger than ever. They are innovative and have been able to anticipate and address their customers’ changing needs through major acquisitions, new market entries, and product designs. I’m honored to be joining as an investor and the Board of Directors at TravelPerk and to help the company reach a global leadership position.”</p>
<p>General Catalyst MD Joel Cutler added in another supporting statement: “Hybrid and remote working is undoubtedly here to stay but a Zoom call will never be able to replicate the benefits of in-person, face-to-face interaction. We have no doubt that business travel will continue to grow and thrive in the years ahead, with TravelPerk as the clear leader in the space, and we’re thrilled to be participating in this funding round.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly been a tough couple of years for the travel sector generally &#8212; and for work trips in particular &#8212; given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which has led to scores of conference cancelations and accelerated tools and tech around virtual meetings, which offer a low friction, low cost alternative to business travel for physical meetings.</p>
<p>In person industry events did start to pick up again last year &#8212; with major tech conferences such as the GSMA&#8217;s Mobile World Congress, Web Summit and CES (earlier this year) taking place in some capacity &#8212; but it&#8217;s typically been with vastly reduced attendance vs pre-pandemic years.</p>
<p>Streaming continues to be a popular choice for workers and employers to avoid the risk and hassle associated with pandemic era business travel.</p>
<p>Despite obvious demand-side challenges for business travel, TravelPerk has continued to present a bullish front throughout this period &#8212; operating a no layoffs policy and splashing out on a number of acquisitions aimed at tooling up for COVID-19-triggered changes to how people are travelling for work.</p>
<p>It has also managed to tap investors to continue backing its platform as it reconfigures its feature mix to support changing business travel needs.</p>
<p>TravelPerk said the Series D will be used to double down on product development &#8212; with a focus on building tools for an era of hybrid working. Albeit, it&#8217;s focus is on trying to expand the portion of physically co-located working that&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>A recent feature, added to TravelPerk&#8217;s platform in November, is an events organizing tool aimed at nudging customers to plan and book in-person get togethers, such as for an offsite, a party or a meeting of new starters. &#8220;TravelPerk Events enables remote and hybrid teams to connect in real life,&#8221; runs its marketing spiel for the tool.</p>
<p>“As time goes by, it is clear that there won’t be a replacement for the human touch. We are seeing data on our platform and we are feeling it ourselves,&#8221; argues CEO Avi Meir in a statement. “While some technologies are focused on virtual interactions, TravelPerk is building the technology that will help us get together in real life.”</p>
<p>The startup is also ploughing money into developing what it bills as &#8220;sustainable&#8221; travel solutions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.travelperk.com/blog/travelperk-acquires-susterra-to-usher-in-the-era-of-sustainable-business-travel/">Last fall</a> TravelPerk acquired a UK-based corporate responsibility consultancy, called Susterra, to beef up its ability to offer tools for customers to calculate a travel-related carbon footprint.</p>
<p>It was already offering carbon offsetting to try to grease bookings in spite of the existential challenge posed by climate change &#8212; which will require massive, swift global reductions in carbon emissions if humanity is to avoid environmental catastrophe, thereby presenting an obvious challenge to travel industry growth.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, TravelPerk is doing the opposite of talking down its growth prospects.</p>
<p>It said expanding in the US is another focus for the Series D &#8212; a market that became its largest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/business-trip-platform-travelperk-buys-yc-backed-rival-nextravel/">a year ago</a> when it acquired US-based rival NexTravel.</p>
<p>It also plans to use the funding to double down on growth in its other large market: Europe.</p>
<p>Since 2019 (so pre-pandemic), TravelPerk said its business has grown 4x in terms of annualised revenue. It also said it has doubled its customer acquisition rate &#8212; albeit a considerable chunk of recent onboarding is likely to have come from acquisitions over this period.</p>
<p>As well as buying US-based NexTravel at the start of last year, it also picked up the UK&#8217;s Click Travel <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/travelperk-buys-uk-based-click-travel-in-latest-pandemic-purchase/">last summer</a>, at the time the largest business travel platform in the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Africa’s mobile-money sector remains the most active of any region in the world according to GSM Association (GSMA), an umbrella body representing the interests of players in the telecommunications industry. The <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GSMA_State-of-the-Industry-Report-on-Mobile-Money-2021_Full-report.pdf">report</a> shows that registered mobile money accounts in Africa stood at slightly over half a billion in 2020, a 12-percentage point growth from the previous year. The value of transactions hit $495 billion, up 23-percentage points.</p>
<p>East Africa accounts for the bulk of Africa’s mobile money transactions followed by West Africa. The GSMA report shows that the value of transactions in West Africa had the highest growth after increasing by 46 percentage points to $178billion (the second highest value after East Africa’s).</p>
<p>Fundamentally, mobile money enables users to send and receive money, as well as to pay utility bills — but in advanced situations like it is across Africa, the wallet turns subscribers’ phone numbers into a sort of proxy for bank accounts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256645" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As it grows, mobile money has come to be a launchpad for digital lenders, who use customers’ mobile money transaction history to determine the amount of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/fintechs-in-africa-continue-to-overshadow-all-other-startups-in-funding-gained/">instant credit to extend to borrowers</a> &#8212; monies that are then directly deposited into customers’ mobile money wallets.</p>
<p><strong>MTN Uganda&#8217;s mobile overdraft credit</strong></p>
<p>Innovative products grounded on mobile money include the newly-launched <a href="https://www.mtn.co.ug/mtn-momo/faqs/">MoMoAdvance</a>, an overdraft loan by MTN Uganda, the country’s biggest telco, and a subsidiary of the MTN Group &#8212; whose other affiliated companies have operations in southern, west and central regions of Africa.</p>
<p>MoMoAdvance was launched following a pilot program that started late 2020, and it allows MTN’s customers to overdraw on its MoMo (mobile money) wallet. Users will be charged an access fee of 2.75% of the amount borrowed, and a daily interest of 0.5% on the outstanding balance for a maximum of 45 days.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“MTN MoMoAdvance will offer the MTN MoMo customers the convenience of transacting beyond their MoMo wallet balance and pay back later… we believe that it will give them the convenience to transact seamlessly beyond their wallet balances during times of need then pay back later,” <a href="https://www.mtn.co.ug/mtn-momo-uganda-launches-momoadvance-an-overdraft-facility-that-enables-customers-transact-beyond-their-momo-wallet-balances/">said</a> MTN Mobile Financial Services, general manager, Stephen Mutana.</p>
<p>MoMoAdvance borrows heavily from a similar overdraft product, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/mobile-overdraft-facility-fuliza-outshines-silicon-valley-backed-lending-apps-in-kenya/">Fuliza, by Kenya’s biggest telco, Safaricom</a>, which was launched in January 2019, and allows subscribers to complete transactions even when they have insufficient funds in their M-Pesa mobile wallets.</p>
<p>The overdraft services are based on a borrowing limit that is defined by a customer&#8217;s transaction history, while the overdrawn amount and accrued interest are deducted from the customers’ wallets anytime they are topped up. Fuliza has grown in popularity over the last three years among M-Pesa users, with Safaricom now giving out about $12 million worth of overdraft loans every day.</p>
<p>Fuliza is offered in partnership with KCB and NCBA, both of which are Kenyan banks with a regional presence. MTN Uganda also partnered with NCBA for its MoMoAdvance credit, and it is now likely that the bank will establish such partnerships in other East African countries Rwanda and Tanzania, where it already has operations.</p>
<p>The mobile-money overdraft products are providing a competitive edge to telcos as lending apps continue to enter African markets. The apps have stepped up competition for telco-owned mobile lending services like MoKash by MTN Uganda and M-Shwari by Safaricom – which allow customers to borrow short-term loans and pay back within 30 days.</p>
<p>Such innovative and easily accessible digital lending services have made credit accessible to a majority of people in Africa, who were previously cut out by formal financial institutions for lack of a banking history. However, most of the emerging digital lenders charge predatory interests, often attributed to the high-risk environment that they work in. This is as the regulatory environment gradually adapts to formalize the sector, eventually leading to better pricing for users while shielding the service providers from losses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The sign of a true entrepreneur is someone who can look around and go &#8220;wait a minute, there <em>must be a better way.</em>&#8221; That approach worked well for <a href="https://livingoutlines.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outlines</a>&#8216; founders, who are tackling the unsexy but pretty serious recycling issue of shower curtain liners. The company just closed a $1 million pre-seed lead by <a href="https://social-impact-capital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social Impact Capital</a> to make sure that the giant water-splash-stopping sheets of plastic that are present in most of the 128 million households in the U.S. get sustainably recycled, rather than putting them in landfills.</p>
<p>&#8220;I moved to New York from London about six years ago. Like all New Yorkers I moved into like an old apartment that required me to have like a shower liner &#8212; one of those plastic shower curtains. Coming from Europe, like I was very used to a door or a plexiglass screen on the shower, or a separate shower unit. I was caught in this constant dilemma; I would pick up my shower liner, three or four months would go by it would get slimy and gross,&#8221; Outlines co-founder Luke Barkley Young explains. &#8220;I was in this really awkward position where I&#8217;d want to get a new one, but I had this plastic-guilt of throwing it away. I was used to being able to recycle everything, and I just hated this constant pain point.&#8221;</p>
<p>Long story short, Young and his co-founder Megan Murphy set out to solve the problem in a rather elegant way. The pair developed a shower curtain system where the top of the curtain, the weights and the shower curtain hooks are made from sturdy, long-lasting materials, and the shower liner itself is made from easy-to-recycle plastic. The company developed a business model where it can take the shower liner in return and recycle it responsibly, as it ships out replacement shower liners on a regular rotation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256256" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company started as a project called &#8220;Drip,&#8221; where the duo found 2,500 early adopter customers who, in addition to being early paying customers, gave a lot of feedback about their needs as consumers. After a while, the company decided that there was almost certainly a sustainable market there, and spun up the Outlines company to explore that direction further.</p>
<p>Of course, a single-product company rarely makes a great investment opportunity, so I pressed the founding team on what might happen next in their product portfolio.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256528" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Clever.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256528" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2256528" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Clever.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="475" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Clever.jpg 4240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Clever.jpg?resize=150,70 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Clever.jpg?resize=300,139 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Clever.jpg?resize=768,356 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Clever.jpg?resize=680,315 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Clever.jpg?resize=1536,713 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Clever.jpg?resize=2048,950 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Clever.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2256528" class="wp-caption-text">Outlines&#8217; shower curtain liner is full of clever details, including ensuring that all parts of the liner itself are recyclable, moving the weights and the metal clips to the parts of the curtain that are not designed to be refreshed. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Outlines</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t decided fully on what our second product will be. What we are interested in is bringing to market links to a much larger audience. We have a couple of ideas. Things like loofahs, potty scrubbers, dish scrubbers, these things that just by the sheer nature of what they do, are possible products for us. Nobody wants to clean their dishes with the same dish scrubber forever,&#8221; explained Young. &#8220;So we are working to really understand our customer base, to determine what we should release next. We definitely hope to do that in the first half of 2022.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the one hand, the cynic in me is wondering &#8220;wait, we are giving VC funding to shower curtains, now?&#8221; but on the other hand, if 10% of households in the U.S. replace their shower curtain liners once every other year, that&#8217;s still 6 million sheets of plastic that need to be dealt with every year, somehow. Ensuring that it&#8217;s recycled responsibly doesn&#8217;t seem so bad. Still, I found myself wondering if a washable shower liner wouldn&#8217;t make more sense than shipping recyclable sheets of plastic around.</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all, shipping in general &#8212; especially in the United States &#8212; is becoming less carbon-intensive. So if you look at all the major couriers, they are adding more electric vehicles to their fleet. So carbon cost of shipping things back and forth is reducing, which is far superior to constantly shipping new stuff from the Far East where typically these plastic products are made. Also, when you do recycle in the U.S., there&#8217;s a lot more legislation and regulation around how recycling can happen versus overseas. The other point on this is when we throw items away they go to landfills. As they decompose, they actually release methane, which is a far more heavy greenhouse gas than CO<sub>2</sub> from shipping back and forward,&#8221; Young argues. He further explains that washable solutions aren&#8217;t really an option: &#8220;Reusable, washable plastics would be a dream, but there are two problems with that. First of all, a lot of plastic-based materials that are waterproof, like polyester, when you put them in your washing machine, the friction of that actually really releases millions of microplastics. Municipal water systems just cannot get them out of the water supply. And then if you were to use a natural fiber, they&#8217;re covered in what&#8217;s called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durable_water_repellent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Durable Water Repellent (DWR)</a>. Over time, because of the heat of a shower, it actually corrodes off. When that happens, your shower liner doesn&#8217;t work. So for this use case, plastic is by far the best material to use.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company today announced it raised its $1 million round, and I wondered what&#8217;s possible now that wasn&#8217;t possible before they closed the round.</p>
<p>&#8220;We just closed the round of $1 million before our launch, which was very exciting. We&#8217;ve done a ton of development up until this point, both in the product and the design of the product, the website and the entire online experience. But we&#8217;re really excited about investing in our digital tools. The first part is a part of responsible replenishment, it&#8217;s all about serving you a plan that is highly personalized to your needs. Obviously what we&#8217;re trying to do with that isn&#8217;t ensure that we&#8217;re not sending you more than you need, but you&#8217;re also receiving enough so that you&#8217;re not standing next to mold every single morning,&#8221; explains Murphy. &#8220;We are investing in that piece to make sure that we are as smart as possible, and that we&#8217;re creating something that&#8217;s genuinely valuable to you as a customer. We are also really excited about further product development. As Luke said, we are already beginning work on the second product, but this is a big category with lots of space for innovation. So we are investing in future product development, to make sure that we&#8217;re rolling out new products at a relatively quick pace.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa’s appetite for cloud computing software continues to increase as connectivity and bandwidth opportunities push boundaries. Per reports, the continent’s cloud computing industry coupled with the Middle East </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to grow to $31.4 billion in 2026 from $14.2 billion last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://seamlesshr.com/">SeamlessHR</a>, a Nigeria-based company that wants to help African businesses “leverage the continent’s greatest asset: abundant human capital” with its cloud-based human resources (HR) and payroll software, has raised $10 million in Series A funding for its next phase of growth and regional expansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pan-African venture capital firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/tlcom-capital-closes-71m-africa-fund-with-plans-to-back-12-startups/">TLcom Capital</a> led the round. New investor Capria Ventures and existing investors Lateral Frontier Ventures, Enza Capital and Ingressive Capital participated.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256522" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s eponymous product is a cloud-based, end-to-end HR software that helps businesses manage and streamline their entire human resource processes and workflow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its product suite includes an HR management system, performance and competency management, HR analytics, leave management, payroll management and recruitment management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/dr-emmanuel-okeleji-722077b">Emmanuel Okeleji</a> and CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dejjy">Deji Lana</a> didn’t build SeamlessHR from the get-go</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was four years after several iterations of Insidify, an aggregator site for job seekers and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a review site for companies that they started SeamlessHR in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The natural client for our job sites was the HR,” CEO Okeleji told TechCrunch on a call. “So we thought, ‘how can we help HR to become more productive and successful so that they can run a better, more profitable company and hire more people in the process?’”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founder also said one of the reasons for the pivot from Insidify to SeamlessHR was because the former wasn’t profitable and lacked the flexibility to scale across Africa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With SeamlessHR, both goals could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be accomplished and a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> year after launching SeamlessHR’s MVP, revenues picked up and was 10 times more than Insidify’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company signed a couple of smaller companies to build its reputation. But over time, it began to focus on bigger clients and signed up a bank as its first main enterprise customer. The company said that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its enterprise-grade solution caters to various companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They range from businesses with 100 employees or fewer to large enterprises with more than 10,000 employees; and from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> multinationals and banks such as PwC, AXA and Sterling Bank to startups and investment firms like Flutterwave and TGI Group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 100,000 employees from these organizations use SeamlessHR monthly. “We have the largest aggregation of medium-to-very large companies in Africa,” Okeleji remarked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four years in, SeamlessHR is now rich with human resources and payroll data after handling salaries for several hundreds of companies. Sitting on top of such data provides leverage to build out more vertical products; for this reason, SeamlessHR will venture into launching embedded finance products for employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how it will work: Say a company is using SeamlessHR for its 5,000 employees; any one of them can tap into the platform’s earned wage access where they can get their salaries up until the point they’ve worked. It’s a typical salary structure in markets such as the U.S. but rarely used in markets like Nigeria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Africa, the innovation that allows people to access credit from their jobs doesn’t happen</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And an HR payroll software is well-positioned to lead that innovation because we use finance, technology and HR to help people convert their employment into collateral to access safe credit,” stated the CEO, who believes the company’s cash advances will appeal more to employees than “predatory” loans offered by some lending companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa’s payroll and HR management market has witnessed the emergence of newer companies such as YC-backed <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/08/14/workpay-raises-seed-funding-kepple-africa-yc/">Workpay</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/nigerias-digital-payroll-platform-bento-expands-to-kenya-rwanda-and-ghana-to-enter-six-other-african-markets-in-2022/">Bento</a>. They help businesses with salary disbursement, taxes and pension, carving out a niche for themselves in a market that appears to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be dominated by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SeamlessHR</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building an HR solution in Africa requires more workaround than in developed markets, where most small businesses can afford to pay for software. The opportunity in Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lies with large corporates, not SMEs. They have higher purchasing power and a greater need for HR solutions; they make up the bulk of SeamlessHR’s customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SeamlessHR has also eaten into the market share of legacy and “on-premise” systems like SAP and Oracle, commonly used by large companies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">locally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Companies now know they can do without hiring employees who need certifications to manage software and concentrate on setting and onboarding cloud-based software solutions capable of serving their</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> needs, albeit cheaper. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Localization of software also plays a part in SeamlessHR replacing these legacy systems in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TLcom Capital partner Andreata Muforo said of the investment, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strong execution shown by Emmanuel and his team is a vital ingredient required to build</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a successful business and as they expand their products to include embedded finance and launch their</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">solutions to new markets, we’re proud to partner alongside them and strengthen their push to unlock more value within Africa’s B2B space.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says its new funding will further strengthen its position as “Africa’s leading cloud HR and payroll platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” Okeleji, who had a brief stint as an investment banker and practised as a doctor, said on the call that SeamlessHR would take its business south of the continent with South Africa as operating hub, thus hiring more staff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company currently has a presence in Nigeria and Kenya; it’ll also use the funds to expand further in the East African country and surrounding markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product-wise, SeamlessHR plans to build out its embedded finance offerings and provide </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> functionalities, especially around artificial intelligence, data analytics and machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okeleji mentioned that SeamlessHR would move beyond human resources and payroll at some point into other departments that make organizations tick. He also hinted at the possibility of SeamlessHR scaling beyond Africa into other global markets, referencing the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/freshworks-aims-for-nearly-9-billion-valuation-in-us-ipo/">recent strides made by India’s Freshworks</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are building software solutions to optimize HR now, but in the future, we’ll go to other areas beyond HR. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are positioned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to build a global SaaS company because SaaS products can travel the world faster than, say, fintech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re beating global players in our local market and while we are not distracting ourselves now, we know we can play this game globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumer spending on mobile apps reached $170 billion in 2021, according to App Annie&#8217;s newly released &#8220;<a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/state-of-mobile-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of Mobile 2022&#8243; report</a>, out today, which offers a comprehensive look at the app economy across iOS, Google Play and third-party Android app stores in China. That figure is up 19% year-over-year, which is down just one percentage point from the growth rate the firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">reported in its prior annual report</a>. Growth in app downloads, however, dipped a bit more. Though today&#8217;s consumers are installing more apps than ever &#8212; 230 billion were downloaded in 2021, setting another record &#8212; the growth rate itself is slowing.</p>
<p>In January 2021, App Annie reported year-over-year download growth of 7% during 2021, which has now dropped to just 5% in 2021.</p>
<p>Download growth today is being driven largely by emerging markets like India, as well as Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia and Egypt.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256377" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>What&#8217;s also clear is that consumers are spending more time in apps &#8212; even topping the time they spend watching TV in some cases.</p>
<p>The report noted the average American watches 3.1 hours of TV per day, for example, but over the course of the past year, they spent 4.1 hours on their mobile device. And they&#8217;re not even the world&#8217;s heaviest mobile users. In markets like Brazil, Indonesia and South Korea, users surpassed 5 hours per day in mobile apps in 2021.</p>
<p>Across the top 10 markets analyzed in the study, the average time spent in apps topped 4 hours, 48 minutes in 2021 &#8212; up 30% from 2019. This included the averages from Brazil, Indonesia, South Korea, Mexico, India, Japan, Turkey, Singapore, Canada, the U.S., Russia, the U.K., Australia, Argentina, France, Germany and China combined.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img class="wp-image-2256436 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-4.13.35-PM.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Much of this time was spent in social, photo and video apps, which accounted for 7 out of every 10 minutes spent on mobile in the past year. These categories, plus entertainment apps, also appeal to Gen Z users, particularly in the U.S.</p>
<p>Here in the U.S., Gen Z&#8217;s most-used apps included Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat and Netflix. Millennials meanwhile preferred Facebook, Messenger, Amazon and WhatsApp. Gen X, which has now been lumped into the Baby Boomer demographic (ack!), used The Weather Channel, Amazon Alexa, NewsBreak and Ring.</p>

<p>This increased time spent in apps has had a direct impact on consumer spending. In the U.S., the COVID-19 pandemic&#8217;s lingering effects have forced users to shop, work, learn, game and entertain themselves from home over the past year. This led to &#8220;phenomenal&#8221; growth in consumer spending, App Annie said, as the market added $43 billion in 2021, or $10.4 billion more than 2020, equating to 30% year-over-year growth &#8212; higher than the global average.</p>
<p>At the high end of consumer spending, there were 233 apps and games that pulled in more than $100 million in 2021, and 13 titles that generated over $1 billion. This is up 20% from 2020, when there were then 193 apps and games topping the $100 million mark, and only 8 titles making over $1 billion annually.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256449" style="width: 1652px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256449" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2256449 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-4.18.06-PM.jpg" alt="" width="1642" height="1518" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-4.18.06-PM.jpg 1642w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-4.18.06-PM.jpg?resize=150,139 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-4.18.06-PM.jpg?resize=300,277 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-4.18.06-PM.jpg?resize=768,710 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-4.18.06-PM.jpg?resize=680,629 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-4.18.06-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1420 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-4.18.06-PM.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1642px) 100vw, 1642px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2256449" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie</p></div></p>
<p>Outside the consumer spending that included paid apps, subscriptions and in-app purchases, the broader mobile app market topped $295 billion in 2021, up 23% year-over-year, despite fears from marketers over Apple&#8217;s privacy changes and IDFA crackdown. In 2022, the market is expected to grow to $350 billion, aided by big events including the Beijing Olympics and the U.S. mid-terms.</p>

<p>New mobile app releases also grew in 2021, as publishers launched 2 million new apps and games, bringing the total number of apps and games ever released across the App Store and Google Play to 21+ million. Of course, older apps and games have since been removed over the years either by the publishers themselves or the app stores during cleanups. Currently, there are 5.4 million &#8220;live&#8221; apps and games available on the app stores, 1.8 million of which are on iOS and 3.6 million on Google Play.</p>
<p>Google Play also accounted for 77% of all the new releases last year, while games made up 15% of all releases across both stores, the report noted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Refyne has raised a new financing round, just seven months after securing its previous funding, as the Bengaluru-based startup scales its platform that helps workers access their earned salaries in real time.</p>
<p>Tiger Global led Refyne’s $82 million Series B funding, the two said Wednesday. Existing backers QED Investors, partners of DST Global, RTP Global, Jigsaw VC and XYZ Capital also participated in the new round, which takes the one-and-a-half-year-old startup’s all-time raise to $106 million.</p>
<p>Refyne did not disclose how it was valued in the new round, but its co-founder and chief executive Chitresh Sharma told TechCrunch in an interview that the valuation has surged 6.5 times since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/refyne-raises-20-1-million-to-help-workers-in-india-get-faster-access-to-wages/">the Series A in June</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256548" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Refyne is building what is known in the industry as an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/earned-wage-access/">earned wage access platform</a>, where a link is established between reward and work. The startup works with employers to enable their workers to access their earned salaries in real time. An employee with the partnered firm can log into Refyne and see how much they have earned in a week and withdraw a fraction of it anytime they wish, for instance.</p>
<p>It’s not rare for people to run out of cash between their paychecks. In that moment, they either take a loan from friends and family, or go to a bank or, in an alarmingly high number of cases, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/google-cracks-down-on-personal-loan-apps-in-india-following-abuse-and-outcry/">approach loan sharks</a>. Refyne is serving clients who hire both white-collar and blue-collar workers, so for many of them, a bank loan is unlikely an option.</p>
<p>The idea &#8212; which has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/wagely-an-indonesian-earned-wage-access-and-financial-services-platform-raises-5-6m/">put to test in several markets</a> &#8212; appears to be showing signs of a market fit in India, the world&#8217;s second-most populous nation. More than 150 firms &#8212; including Practo, TeamLease, Tenon, Shadowfax, Rebel Foods, Acko, BlackBuck, Arti Group and Cafe Coffee Day &#8212; are working with Refyne today to enable the service for their over 700,000 employees, Sharma said.</p>
<p>Its clients today operate in a wide range of categories, a factor that Sharma said requires Refyne to employ different strategies to best serve each. “For manufacturing sector, we have an on-ground team that goes for orientation and induction. Seventy percent of our effort goes before deploying. For companies that are geographically distributed, given the COVID times, we also do a lot of Zoom orientation.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2256559" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256559" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2256559 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/refyne-tiger-global-chitresh-sharma-apoorv-kumar.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/refyne-tiger-global-chitresh-sharma-apoorv-kumar.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/refyne-tiger-global-chitresh-sharma-apoorv-kumar.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/refyne-tiger-global-chitresh-sharma-apoorv-kumar.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/refyne-tiger-global-chitresh-sharma-apoorv-kumar.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/refyne-tiger-global-chitresh-sharma-apoorv-kumar.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/refyne-tiger-global-chitresh-sharma-apoorv-kumar.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2256559" class="wp-caption-text">Chitresh Sharma (left) and Apoorv Kumar co-founded Refyne. <strong>Image Credits: </strong>Refyne</p></div></p>
<p>In a statement, Alex Cook, a partner at Tiger Global, said: “We believe Refyne will be the preferred partner for large employers that want to offer Earned Wage Access. We are excited to support Chitresh, Apoorv and the Refyne team, as they work to improve financial wellness for the Indian workforce.”</p>
<p>The platform, which supports 12 languages and is compatible with any human resource management system and enterprise resource planning service, has had a “significant impact on retention for the clients, and in helping employers hire faster,” Sharma said, adding that the startup was the first and the largest player in the space. That has added responsibility on Refyne to make the market aware of EWA and quash some misconceptions, he said.</p>
<p>“Some people confuse us with other forms of credit products such as payday lenders. So most of our effort will be in ensuring that the category is well-known while we continue to expand our growth numbers,” he said.</p>
<p>Sharma said the startup is working continually to improve its service and building data sets to understand how people behave to help better evaluate and project their creditworthiness. “Current credit scoring looks at people’s past behavior to determine their future.”</p>
<p>The startup aims to serve 3 million workers by the end of the year and is also hiring in several roles.</p>
<p>“The support and confidence that global investors such as Tiger Global have shown us is a testament to our mission,” he said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I can't get that hyped about blockchain gaming — I want to have fun, not monetize my experience.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If there&#8217;s one thing that venture capitalists have taught me, it&#8217;s that aligned incentives can kick ass.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a phrase you&#8217;ll hear often if you spend time with professional private market investors. But if I summon my collegiate years, the phrase is really just the economic principle that individuals respond to incentives, restated in a slightly more targeted fashion.</p>
<p>In the land of venture capital, the idea works out as follows: Individuals respond to incentives, so you want to ensure that everyone at a company, for example, has <em>aligned </em>incentives.</p>
<p>This is why startups often offer a dusting of equity to employees, giving them a tiny slice of ownership in the overall project. This <em>aligns</em> employee incentives toward aggregate corporate success, something that employers want because they are in the game of paying people as little as they can while still hitting human capital quality benchmarks and not having too much employee churn.</p>
<p>There are less crassly capitalistic reads of why venture capitalists allow startups to sell equity to employees at below-market rates through options. I don&#8217;t buy them. Investors like return, and they optimize for it, thanks to their own incentive structure.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ataFpxlSbr"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/blockchain-gaming-survey-7-investors-discuss-regulation-opportunities-and-nft-hype/">Blockchain gaming survey: 7 investors discuss regulation, opportunities and NFT hype</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Blockchain gaming survey: 7 investors discuss regulation, opportunities and NFT hype&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/blockchain-gaming-survey-7-investors-discuss-regulation-opportunities-and-nft-hype/embed/#?secret=ataFpxlSbr" data-secret="ataFpxlSbr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>VCs have a good gig. They take money from existing capital pools, invest it in work that others are doing, and then get a cut of deal profits while also ripping a few hundred bips per year of their total investing vehicle. Here again, we see aligned incentives, with venture capitalists profiting when <em>their</em> backers profit. Teamwork.</p>
<p>I drag you through all of that to explain that the concept of aligned incentives is marrow-deep in the startup and venture capital worlds, something that can, at times, blind folks to other ways of doing business.</p>
<p>Games, for example. Crypto games in particular.</p>
<p>You see, the crypto community and its myriad backers are pretty hot on crypto games. Here, it seems, is a place where incentives can be aligned in a new, exciting manner, translating gaming into related economic activity. All the fun of games, but with aligned economic incentives! What could go wrong?</p>
<h2>Play to earn?</h2>
<p>Through the lens of aligned incentives, the concept of play-to-earn games on a blockchain excites venture capitalists. Users will play the game, generating both fun and economic activity. The user gets some of the value, and the company the rest. Everyone is happy, and the game can go on making money forever, right?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[There’s still a haze of uncertainty surrounding blockchain games, so we reached out to several active investors in to get a clearer picture of where opportunities exist today and what they see on the horizon.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The video-game industry has always been on the bleeding edge, but blockchain gaming is still widely viewed as emerging technology.</p>
<p>In October 2021, Valve banned all blockchain-related games from its Steam platform. Meanwhile, within Axie Infinity, an NFT-based online game, new players are paying hundreds of dollars to acquire mythical pets and love potions.</p>
<p>There’s still a haze of uncertainty surrounding blockchain games, so we reached out to several active investors in the space to get a clearer picture of where opportunities exist today and what they see on the horizon. We asked them to share the advice they&#8217;re giving their portfolio companies, along with their thoughts on how future regulation might impact the industry.</p>
<p>Interestingly, at least one investor noted that growth wasn&#8217;t a key consideration: &#8220;We tell our companies to really think about the missing pieces, particularly in gaming infrastructure,&#8221; said Banafsheh Fathieh, head of investments, Americas at Prosus Ventures. &#8220;What are the pain points we can alleviate for users and builders? Growth is less of a focus now, utility is incredibly important at this stage.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>What was your initial reaction on hearing about Steam’s ban on blockchain games?</strong></p>
<p>It was not an entirely unexpected move from Steam. Incumbents tend to be more wary of adapting new business models and gaming is no different. As a fledgling space, NFTs are beridden with projects of varying quality and we believe Steam wants to do some quality assurance and wait until the situation stabilizes before allowing blockchain games en masse. Interestingly enough, at the time of writing (Nov 14) MIR4, a crypto-enabled MMORPG on Steam, is running at 88,000 concurrent users. Seems that there’s still a gray area in terms of how these games are classified.</p>
<p><strong>What advice have you been giving your portfolio companies to grow? What sort of guidance and assistance do blockchain gaming companies seek from you?</strong></p>
<p>We typically act as a sparring partner for founders in strategy-related matters. With blockchain gaming companies we have mostly assisted the teams in navigating the technology stack, i.e., what blockchains and/or scaling solutions to consider, as well as token economic design. In our view it’s key to embrace a crypto native approach of building and experimenting with the product while also involving your community in the process.</p>
<p><strong>How do you view the regulatory environment for blockchain gaming? Is the uncertainty making you reconsider your strategy?</strong></p>
<p>No. It’s not the first time innovation has outpaced regulation and we see it as a natural reaction to new consumer behavior and ways of building companies. Similarly, Uber fought an uphill battle with regulators before eventually democratizing the taxi medallion system and providing an outsized improvement for end users of taxi services. This doesn’t mean that companies and projects should build products that are against the law but rather engage in healthy discussion with regulators as the adoption of their products increases.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[Harry’s goal since birth was to target incumbents in the global shave market, which is forecasted to reach $22.5 billion by 2030.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Yay, no errors, warnings, or alerts! --></p>
<p>A year after the FTC blocked <a href="https://www.harrys.com/en/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harry’s</a> from getting acquired by Edgewell Personal Care, the direct-to-consumer razor startup raised $155 million in Series E financing to give it a $1.7 billion valuation. Now, months later, Harry’s filed paperwork indicating that it has raised another nine-figure cash tranche.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1556308/000155630822000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC filings</a> show that Harry’s has raised $139.9 million in a new financing event. The same filing listed the co-founders alongside Zola’s co-founder Shan-Lyn Ma, Addition Capital founder Lee Fixel, Campbell Soup Co. CEO Mark Clouse, politician Helena Foulkes, Zoom chief diversity officer Damien Hooper-Campbell, as well as Harry’s chief financial officer Jeff Lipkin and chief counsel Jack Sarno.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256504" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Harry’s, through a spokesperson, said, “we are not commenting at this moment.”</p>
<p>The new funding gives the company just over $791 million in total known funding since the company was founded in 2013, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/harrys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Crunchbase data.</a></p>
<h2>From acquisition target to brand incubator</h2>
<p>Harry’s has been quite active over the past year. It recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/harrys-acquisition-d2c-deodorant-lume/">acquired</a> Lumē, <a href="https://lumedeodorant.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a direct-to-consumer brand</a> created to help control all-over body odor, in an undisclosed deal. Early in 2021, it launched its Headquarters hair care line. In a previous interview with TechCrunch, Tehmina Haider, Harry’s chief growth officer, spoke to the company’s focus on acquiring businesses with “demonstrated product fit and consumer love.”</p>
<p>“The idea about M&amp;A for Harry’s is we want to be a multi-category CPG company and build a family of CPG brands,” she said. “We want to create more and better things for consumers, and we are looking for brands aligned with that mission, are positioned in a way we can be helpful and are brands serving unmet needs.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Whether or not this is a plan to help it eventually enter the public markets is unclear, but it does help that the late-stage DTC company has some precedent to look to.</p>
<p>Casper, which recently left the public markets after its rocky debut, taught investors and the public about the limits of DTC companies, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/warby-parker-makes-it-clear-that-direct-listings-are-unicorn-friendly/">Warby Parker’s direct listing gave the same cohort some hope. </a></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/caspers-return-to-private-life-isnt-a-canary-for-dtc-companies-going-public/">As our own Alex Wilhelm puts it</a>, DTC companies that want to go public either need to “grow quickly enough that losses feel secondary, leading to share-price appreciation and the ability to self-fund growth as needed” or find a way to trim losses if growth slows. In other words, it may not appear as SaaS growth, but it could appear as value growth.</p>
<p>Regardless of if it goes down the public market path or not, Harry’s goal since birth was to target incumbents in the global shave market, which is forecasted to reach <a href="https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/razor-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$22.5 billion by 2030.</a></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em><br />

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for January 11, 2022! Today we have new venture funds, spyware news, Brex raising (again), and more. We’re back to 100% of last year’s startup and technology news pace, so we do hope you are rested up. It’s going to be a hectic, busy year. – <a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-admin/twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2><strong>The TechCrunch Top 3</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/poland-nso-pegasus-election/">Cybersecurity matters to democracy</a>: Spyware built by the infamous NSO Group was “used to spy on three critics of the Polish government,” according to Citizen Lab, TechCrunch reports. The result of the allegations is that there are now questions regarding Poland’s 2019 parliamentary elections. This is not the last time we’ll see this sort of story around the world.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/turos-s-1-filing-shows-that-unicorns-can-slingshot-out-of-the-pandemic/">Turo’s business roars back in 2021</a>: Car-rental unicorn Turo has filed to go public, so TechCrunch dug into the numbers. The gist is that after a pretty flat 2020, Turo’s business posted strong growth and improved revenue quality during the first three quarters of 2021. We should get more updated numbers in time. (For you IPO fans out there, recall that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/justworks-files-to-take-its-smb-focused-hr-themed-saas-business-public/">HR software firm Justworks will debut later this week</a>.)</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/brex-confirms-12-3b-valuation-hires-meta-exec-to-serve-as-its-chief-product-officer/">Brex confirms $300M raise</a>: The race to control the corporate spend market was a key theme last year, and 2022 is starting on a similar note, with well-known market competitor Brex confirming that it raised nine figures in a Series D-2 round that values the former startup at $12.3 billion. We expect Ramp, Brex’s rival, to announce more capital by the time you read this brief, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-raises-300m-at-a-3-9b-valuation-makes-its-first-acquisition/">given how last year went</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Startups/VC</strong></h2>
<p>Kicking off our startup coverage today, a few notes before we get into the individual bulletins. First, the SPAC boom has left the public market littered with formerly private companies that combined with blank-check entities and then lost half their value. SPACs failed to get enough private companies public last year to cut the number of unicorns, and the lackluster post-combination results <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/the-spac-boom-was-a-failure-yeah/">add up to a general failure</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256445" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>And Kleiner Perkins has joined a16z and Norwerst in announcing more than 10 figures worth of new capital. The venture capital firm, now in its 50th year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/kleiner-perkins-starts-off-50th-year-with-1-8b-in-two-new-funds/">just closed $1.8 billion across two funds</a>. Founders, that sound you just heard was the starting gun.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/locket-an-app-for-sharing-photos-to-friends-homescreens-hits-the-top-of-the-app-store/">Locket shoots to the top of app stores</a>: Today Sarah Perez added me on a new social service, leading to us trading selfies and dog pics back and forth. The app? Locket, which is tearing up the mobile application charts. Read on for what it does and why it’s popular.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/orbit-fabs-on-orbit-fuel-shuttle-will-top-up-astroscales-servicing-satellites/">In-orbit refueling</a>: This story is the coolest. Darrell Etherington, our in-house space expert, writes that “Orbit Fab has teamed with Astroscale to provide on-orbit refueling services to the latter company’s geostationary servicing spacecraft.” This is a solution to a problem that most folks don’t think about. But if we want low-flying satellites to stay, well, afloat, they will at times need more fuel. And it looks like the tech to do so is getting close to maturity.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/back-market-reaches-5-7b-valuation-for-its-refurbished-device-marketplace/">Back Market puts more points on the board for France</a>: French startups had a pretty good 2021, and Back Market is helping the country’s upstart tech scene start this year on solid footing. The company “operates a marketplace of refurbished electronics devices” and just closed a $510 million Series E that values it at $5.7 billion. Last year it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/back-market-raises-another-335-million-for-its-refurbished-device-marketplace/">raised $335 million</a>, for reference.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/fertilis-ivf-cell-culture-funding/">IVF tech is hot</a>: If you haven’t had a chance to visit the shores of infertility, you might not be aware of just how complicated the in-vitro fertilization (IVF) process is. It’s complex. The good news for would-be parents is that startups like Fertilis, an Australian company, are raising capital to make the ordeal a bit more likely to result in a live birth.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/novo-the-smb-neobank-nabs-90m-at-a-700m-valuation/">Novo proves that there is still capital in the market for neobanks</a>: Sure, Chime has yet to go public, much to our chagrin, but a lack of exits in the neobanking space is not slowing investors down. Novo, a neobank aimed at SMBs, just closed $90 million at a $700 million valuation.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/fast-charge-ev-battery-maker-storedot-pulls-in-80m-led-led-by-vietnams-vinfast/">StoreDot raises capital for super-fast battery charging</a>: EVs are great, but they are still a bit slow to recharge. While gas-powered cars are not great for the air we breathe, they are incredibly good at onboarding fuel. StoreDot is busy closing a round that could be worth up to $80 million for like, <em>very</em> fast battery topping-up.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/gostudent-raises-340m-series-d-funding-round-as-it-pushes-into-international-markets/">Online tutoring is big business (outside of China)</a>: Sure, the Chinese government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/">drop-kicked its domestic edtech market</a>, but that doesn’t mean that tutoring is kaput as a business type around the world. Evidence of that? GoStudent just closed a $340 million Series D less than a year after it closed a $244 million Series C.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re low on time, but there was so much more: This <a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-admin/ises-6-2m-pre-series-a/">African e-commerce company</a> just closed a Series A, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/mostly-ai-raises-25-million-to-further-commercialize-synthetic-data-in-europe-and-the-u-s/">Mostly AI landed $25 million</a>, and Qonto – also in the business banking space like Novo! – <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/business-banking-startup-qonto-raises-552-million-at-5-billion-valuation/">raised more than half a billion</a>. It’s <em>busy</em> out there.</p>
<p>And just to squeeze in one more thing, <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller">Ron Miller</a> has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/tupu-io-wants-to-help-women-thrive-in-tech-jobs-through-mentorship/">great story up on a group that is helping women in tech thrive through mentorship</a>.</p>

<p>Startups grow fast, and when you’re building one, it can be easy to lose track of what’s working — and what’s not.</p>
<p>One way to track how well your business is doing is to look at the big-picture numbers, but Karen Peacock, CEO of Intercom, has a warning: Averages can be dangerously misleading.</p>
<p>“If Jeff Bezos walks into a bar with 100 people, suddenly, on average, the net worth of each individual in that bar is over a billion dollars. Is that useful? Would that lead you to take the right actions? No — averages hide true insights.”</p>
<p>Peacock explains how founders can assess where their business’ strengths lie and where they need to work harder, including how to gauge revenue health and use customer segmentation to find “leaks in the bucket.”</p>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/apple-to-allow-third-party-app-payment-options-in-south-korea/">Apple to allow third-party payment options in South Korea</a>: A change in the wind?

For Apple, focused on preserving a large slice of the iOS economy for itself, it’s bad news.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">First, there was the dense fog. Then there was the snow. But inclement weather couldn&#8217;t put a damper on the AMG iterations of Mercedes&#8217; flagship EV or its latest generation SL.</p>
<p>Performance, luxury, comfort, and technology all hit the mark even when the AMG team gets their hands on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/all-the-tech-crammed-into-the-2022-mercedes-benz-eqs/">Mercedes EQS</a> and the latest SL Roadster.</p>
<p>At its core, the 2022 Mercedes AMG SL Roadster still has a glimmer of the soul that enveloped the original 300 SL Roadster introduced in the late 1950s. Where that vehicle was the top-down transportation of choice of Hollywood&#8217;s golden era elite, it&#8217;s easy to imagine Clooney, Mirren, and Run the Jewel&#8217;s Killer Mike rolling into an event behind the wheel of this newest convertible.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256366" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2256467" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0727_027.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256467" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2256467 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0727_027.jpg" alt="The new Mercedes-AMG SL Roadster" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0727_027.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0727_027.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0727_027.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0727_027.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0727_027.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0727_027.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0727_027.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2256467" class="wp-caption-text">Mercedes-AMG SL 63 4Matic+ <strong>Image credit</strong>: Mercedes-Benz</p></div></p>
<p>And while the Bondish AMG SL Roadster has roots in last century, the AMG EQS is Ironman. It&#8217;s all about all today&#8217;s tech being used to accomplish a goal &#8212; while like the Roadster &#8212; doing so in style.</p>
<p>Both the AMG SL Roadster and AMG EQS are new vehicles and while they share much of the same technology at their core, there is a stark difference.</p>
<p>The menacing roar of the SL is replaced in the EQS by a composed set of sounds. The EQS has instant EV torque, the SL&#8217;s impressive displacement and turbos are no match for the EVs launch potential.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mercedes will build handcrafted engines for its AMG lineup until the bitter end. There is no handcrafted electric motor in the AMG EQS. The signature of a technician will not show up on a battery pack. Meanwhile, the amount of filth spewed into the air by the EQS is merely a fraction of what the V8 roadster will put into our atmosphere over its lifetime.</p>
<h2>2022 Mercedes AMG EQS</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2256468" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0730_046.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256468" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2256468 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0730_046.jpg" alt="The new Mercedes-AMG EQS" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0730_046.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0730_046.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0730_046.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0730_046.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0730_046.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0730_046.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0730_046.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2256468" class="wp-caption-text">Mercedes-AMG EQS 53 4MATIC+ at a charging station. <strong>Image credit</strong>: Mercedes</p></div></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a concern with a vehicle that&#8217;s built to be luxury-first that it could be slightly ruined by receiving the performance treatment. If a sedan&#8217;s main purpose is to pamper the driver and passengers, stiffening up the ride and remapping the accelerator so that every little tap results in a neck snap, it&#8217;s really no longer accomplishing its goal.</p>
<p>EQS fans that also want to go faster, relax. That hasn&#8217;t happened here. The AMG EQS — the first electric AMG to land in the United States — deftly combines what&#8217;s great about the electric luxury sedan with some tuning by the AMG team.</p>
<p>With a power increase of up to 751 horsepower and 752-pound feet of torque (a jump of ​​133 horsepower and 69-pound feet of torque over the EQS580), the luxury electric sedan feels decidedly quicker than its non-AMG counterpart. An internal being slammed into your spine 3.4 seconds from zero to 60 quicker.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just the two electric motors that got an upgrade. Tweaks to the cooling system, wiring, and battery management system of the 107.8-kWh capacity pack on the AMG variant also allow the vehicle in Sport and Sport Plus mode to stay at peak performance longer. During my drive from Palm Springs to Los Angeles, I never felt a loss of power after multiple acceleration tests.</p>
<p>That increase also comes with new acceleration-coupled sounds in the vehicle called the AMG sound experience. I&#8217;m a fan of these EV noises. While artificial, they do recreate the audible experience of sudden bursts of speed.</p>
<p>The power increase is accompanied by AMG ride control air suspension with active dampeners. Throw in the 4Matic+ all-wheel-drive system and rear-wheel steering of up to nine degrees and attacking hairpin turns at speed a controlled and impressive experience considering the size and heft of the vehicle. There is some body roll, but it&#8217;s far less than what I&#8217;ve experienced on the regular EQS.</p>
<p>In addition to all those performance hardware and software tweaks and the new Sport Plus, there&#8217;s another new mode that luck would have it, I was able to test. As we climbed higher into the mountains during the drive, and the road transformed from black to gray, to snow-covered white, I was able to use that AMG Slippery mode. Which worked wonderfully in the ice and snow and any loss of traction was short-lived and more likely the result of the AMG EQS rolling on Michelin Pilot Sport EV summer tires.</p>

<p>When choosing the wheels for this drive program Mercedes was clearly expecting dry roads and if not sunny weather, at least dry weather. Mother Nature had other plans. With winter or even all-season rubber, the AMG EQS would have made even those nervous about driving on frozen water more at ease.</p>
<p>Inside, other than a few AMG flourishes here and there, it&#8217;s the same EQS with the latest MBUX infotainment system and its enormous 56-inch Hyperscreen that includes a 12.3 instrument cluster, 17.7 -inch touchscreen display, and 12.3-inch passenger display. All standard in the AMG trim level. The display also includes the Zero Layer interface, which presents a map with widgets of features that appear as needed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256474" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0730_041.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256474" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2256474 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0730_041.jpg" alt="The new Mercedes-AMG " width="2000" height="1039" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0730_041.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0730_041.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0730_041.jpg?resize=300,156 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0730_041.jpg?resize=768,399 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0730_041.jpg?resize=680,353 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0730_041.jpg?resize=1536,798 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0730_041.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2256474" class="wp-caption-text">Interior of Mercedes-AMG EQS 53 4MATIC+ shows the expansive infotainment system. Image credit: Mercedes</p></div></p>
<p>The crown jewel of MBUX — the voice assistant — continues to evolve. &#8220;Hey Mercedes&#8221; along with the Zero Layer interface are essentially the standard by what other automakers should strive to accomplish in the vehicle. A robust voice-powered navigation feature coupled with a more focused screen.</p>
<p>On more than a few occasions, I realized that instead of looking for a feature, I&#8217;d ask the vehicle to do what I wanted. Other items, like media controls that in previous generation Mercedes required multiple taps to skip to the next song, were presented readily in the Zero Layer interface hovering over the navigation.</p>
<p>Like with the SL Roadster, the combination of voice assistant and Zero Layer make for an improved infotainment experience although, I&#8217;m still puzzled why Mercedes made the screen so wide it&#8217;s actually blocked by the steering wheel. Sure they moved all the widgets over, but it&#8217;s still an odd decision beyond the ability to say, &#8220;hey, look how big we made that display.&#8221;</p>
<h2>2022 Mercedes AMG SL</h2>

<p>While the balance of luxury versus performance errs on the side of speed and handling thanks to up to 577 horsepower and 590 pound-feet of torque on the AMG SL 63 variant, even at slow speeds (thanks to the previously mentions fog), the AMG SL delivers a rich top-down experience.</p>
<p>Mercedes will sell two versions of the vehicle, the AMG SL 55 Roadster with 469 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque and the more powerful 63 variant mentioned above. Both are outfitted with the automaker&#8217;s all-wheel-drive 4Matic+ system powered by handcrafted 4.0-liter V8 Biturbo engines.</p>
<p>The result of all that displacement coupled with turbos is impressive and well-mannered power that reacts instantly either from a standstill or while passing slower vehicles. The AMG SL 63 might be the more powerful vehicle, but the AMG SL 55 is likely the better call since there are very few instances where all that extra horsepower and torque are even usable.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256479" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0108_EQS_SL-5.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256479" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2256479 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0108_EQS_SL-5.jpg" alt="Mercedes AMG SL" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0108_EQS_SL-5.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0108_EQS_SL-5.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0108_EQS_SL-5.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0108_EQS_SL-5.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0108_EQS_SL-5.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0108_EQS_SL-5.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0108_EQS_SL-5.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2256479" class="wp-caption-text">Interior shot of Mercedes-AMG SL<strong> Image Credits:</strong> Roberto Baldwin</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also the least powerful SL Roadster you&#8217;ll be able to buy of this generation. Mercedes has no plans to release a non-performance version of the roadster. Instead, as with all other Mercedes, it&#8217;s decided to make sure that this vehicle, when not blasting through canyons, is as smooth and luxurious as any other Mercedes. During my tests, I can say that they&#8217;re about 85% there.</p>
<p>On everyday suburban and urban roads, the AMG SL Roadster offers up a nearly glassy ride, but its performance underpinnings are a gentle reminder that this is not an S-Class. You&#8217;re going to feel some of the bumps, holes and ruts in the road. The bright side to that is impressive handling that even on rain-slicked roads, kept the wheels firmly planted to the asphalt with just the slightest bit of oversteer that only appeared when you really pushed the vehicle. Steering is tight and responsive without feeling twitchy and the inclusion of the rear-wheel steering creates the impression of a smaller vehicle both on backroads and while tooling around town.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256477" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0727_0050.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256477" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2256477 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0727_0050.jpg" alt="Mercedes-AMG SL 63 4Matic+ touchscreen" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0727_0050.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0727_0050.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0727_0050.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0727_0050.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0727_0050.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0727_0050.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/21C0727_0050.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2256477" class="wp-caption-text">Mercedes-AMG SL 63 4Matic+ 11.9-inch touchscreen display can be tilted back and forth. <strong>Image credit</strong>: Mercedes</p></div></p>
<p>Inside, Mercedes has also outfitted the SL with the latest version of its MBUX infotainment system complete with the Zero Layer option. As an extra bonus, because of potential sun glare, the 11.9-inch touchscreen display can be tilted back and forth from 12 to 32 degrees. The reflections of the sun are also why the 12.3-inch instrument cluster has an integrated visor. Sadly neither was needed during my overcast and foggy drive.</p>
<p>With the SL Roadster, Mercedes has built a proper convertible sports car that&#8217;s filled with its latest technology. Neither sides of the vehicle, performance, and tech, contradict the other. It&#8217;s a symbiotic relationship. Essentially, it&#8217;s the James Bond of cars. A nod to the past with a wild side that&#8217;s already ready with the latest gizmo to complete the mission while dressed in a tuxedo.</p>
<p>After driving the AMG EQS and SL vehicles back to back over two days, it&#8217;s interesting to see the beginning of the transition of AMG vehicles. The performance arm of Mercedes, like the automaker itself, is poised to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/mercedes-benz-to-build-eight-battery-factories-in-push-to-become-electric-only-automaker-by-2030/">go fully electric by 2030</a>.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s most striking is thinking about the future, I&#8217;ve driven the first generation SL 300 Roadster. At the time of its launch, it was like something from outer space. At some point in the near future, the automaker might introduce another AMG SL and if Mercedes continues to refine its EV technologies at the pace it&#8217;s doing so right now, it&#8217;ll likely be just as groundbreaking and electric.</p>
<p>Also, it&#8217;ll have no problem driving in snow even with the top down.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Doordash co-founder and CEO Tony Xu has joined Meta&#8217;s board of directors, the Facebook parent company <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2022/01/tony-xu-joins-meta-board-of-directors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on Tuesday. Xu has served as CEO of Doordash since 2013 and was appointed the company&#8217;s board chair in November 2020. Meta says Xu&#8217;s appointment is effective immediately. Xu&#8217;s appointment brings the total number of people on Meta&#8217;s board of directors to 10.</p>
<p>“Millions of local merchants use Meta’s tools to grow and run their businesses every month. I look forward to working with the board as the company enters the next stage of its journey,” said Xu in a press release about the announcement.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s annoucement comes as Meta has been heavily focused on commerce over the past few years, as the company has introduced numerous shopping features across its apps, which includes Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The company has been focused on implementing shopping and e-commerce features directly within its services to prevent users from leaving its apps.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256461" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In a statement, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined that Xu has experience in solving complex challenges in commerce and that the company will leverage Xu&#8217;s expertise as it creates the Metaverse. Commerce will play a major role in the metaverse, which indicates that Xu will likely advise the board on such matters.</p>
<p>“Tony has built a great service for millions of people to get food and more from hundreds of thousands of restaurants and small businesses,&#8221; Zuckerberg said in the statement. &#8220;I’ve always thought it’s important to have great tech leaders on our board, and Tony has direct experience both running a tech company and solving complex challenges in commerce. I look forward to learning from his perspective as we build towards the metaverse.”</p>
<p>Meta&#8217;s board of directors includes Zuckerberg; Peggy Alford, the executive vice president of global sales at PayPal; Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz; Drew Houston, the co-founder and CEO of Dropbox; Nancy Killefer, a retired senior partner at McKinsey &amp; Company; Robert Kimmitt, Meta’s lead independent director and senior international counsel at WilmerHale LLP; Sheryl K. Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Meta; Peter Thiel, managing partner at Founders Fund and Tracey T. Travis, the executive vice president and CFO of The Estée Lauder Companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You don&#8217;t need to be a scientist to understand the impacts of factory farming: if you&#8217;ve been near a North Carolina hog waste lagoon or driven past the enormous cattle feedlot in Coalinga, CA, the smell travels for miles.</p>
<p>In exchange for affordability and convenience, consumers, regulators and meat producers have learned to live with the many downsides of raising animals for food at scale: Greenhouse gases, water pollution, unsafe working conditions, and inhumane practices, just for starters.</p>
<p>But a United Nations report estimates that we&#8217;ll need to double global food production by 2050 to meet the needs of 10 billion people.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256297" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Rising demand for meat is driven in part by the rise of a global middle class. It turns out that the people who have the most buying power are also fans of cheeseburgers, and with consumption and population growth steadily increasing, one might even say meat is eating the world.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/is-cell-cultured-meat-ready-for-prime-time/">In a deeply researched report for TechCrunch+</a>, reporter Christine Hall examined the state of the cell-cultured meat industry and identified many of the startups innovating in the sector, along with the challenges they face when it comes to ramping up production and getting regulators and consumers on their side.</p>
<p>“It is still small-scale, and the most important thing we are doing that other companies should do is focus on the design, engineering and full-scale installations of vessels and the supporting systems to make a lot of it,&#8221; said Josh Tetrick, co-founder and CEO of Eat Just, which sells lab-grown chicken meat in Singapore.</p>
<p>Friederike Grosse-Holz, a director at impact investment firm Blue Horizon, said lab-grown meat is “a little like a moonshot,&#8221; but predicts that 11% of the seafood, meat, eggs and dairy consumed globally in 2035 will come from alternative sources.</p>
<p>“We are far from clear in knowing which technology will be the best,” she said. “So it is good there are so many players and a space for them.”</p>

<p>Investors are hungry for startups to throw their money at, but VC funding isn’t always the right option at all times or for every startup.</p>
<p>Alternative financing options such as revenue financing or expense financing are often overshadowed by the VC model, but they can be just as, and sometimes more, useful for SaaS startups, writes Miguel Fernandez, CEO and co-founder of Capchase.</p>
<p>In an in-depth post, Fernandez explains alternative financing for startups, and how to tell which option is right for you.</p>

<p>One of the most notable trends in tech that has emerged during the pandemic is the steady commoditization of capital.</p>
<p>As founders find themselves fielding ample investor interest, accelerators are changing how they invest, what they offer to their cohorts, and how they maximize value and attract top talent, reports Natasha Mascarenhas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“As capital gets further commoditized, early-stage investors are going back to the drawing board to see what is truly — and excuse my language here — a value-add service.”</p>

<p>Startups grow fast, and when you’re building one, it can be easy to lose track of what’s working — and what’s not.</p>
<p>One way to track how well your business is doing is to look at the big-picture numbers, but Karen Peacock, CEO of Intercom, has a warning: averages can be dangerously misleading.</p>
<p>“If Jeff Bezos walks into a bar with 100 people, suddenly, on average, the net worth of each individual in that bar is over a billion dollars. Is that useful? Would that lead you to take the right actions? No — averages hide true insights.”</p>
<p>Peacock explains how founders can assess where their business’ strengths lie, and where they need to work harder, including how to gauge revenue health and using customer segmentation to find “leaks in the bucket.”</p>

<p>Focusing on going to market, introducing new features and customizing your product to help land a major client are all proven tactics for driving growth.</p>
<p>But companies that go on building sprees without a clear product roadmap in hand usually end up with a ton of technical debt, writes Sowmyanarayan Raghunathan, VP of Engineering at Talentica Software.</p>
<p>To minimize tech debt, Raghunathan posits four rules for engineering teams:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t let specific implementations continue for over three months</li>
<li>Do an architecture review of the product every 18-24 months</li>
<li>Upgrade to new open source versions two months after launch</li>
<li>Understand the product and identify NFRs in advance</li>
</ul>

<p>In a follow-up to a 2014 post about the rise of Big Data, enterprise reporter Ron Miller looks back at the intervening seven years and found that infrastructure, technology and data analysis tools “have all improved dramatically, but it’s by no means a problem solved.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For weeks, Tumblr <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/tumblr-ios-tags-ban-apple/">hid search results</a> on iOS for a variety of tags to comply with the App Store&#8217;s guidelines. Today, Tumblr is trying to <a href="https://wip.tumblr.com/post/673094877671800832/an-update-on-the-tumblr-ios-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solve the issue</a> by rolling out a sensitive content toggle for its iOS app, which allows users to opt-in to seeing sensitive content. (The toggle opts you out of seeing sensitive content by default.)</p>
<p>When you search for a sensitive tag &#8212; think something like &#8220;marijuana&#8221; &#8212; the updated Tumblr iOS app will now hide search results. Instead, a pop-up will appear, prompting you to turn off the sensitive content filter if you want to see the results of your search. If you click &#8220;show me the settings&#8221; to see sensitive content, you&#8217;re redirected to the Tumblr website on your mobile browser, not an in-app menu. Once you change your settings, you have to restart the iOS app for the change to take effect. Finally, you&#8217;ll be able to see search results that include fan art of Baby Yoda hitting a blunt (yes, really).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256217" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256217" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2256217" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TUMBLRsensitivecontent.jpg?w=680" alt="Tumblr populates a warning message when searching sensitive content on ios" width="680" height="345" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TUMBLRsensitivecontent.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TUMBLRsensitivecontent.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TUMBLRsensitivecontent.jpg?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TUMBLRsensitivecontent.jpg?resize=768,390 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TUMBLRsensitivecontent.jpg?resize=680,345 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TUMBLRsensitivecontent.jpg?resize=1536,780 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TUMBLRsensitivecontent.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2256217" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tumblr</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256214" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to Tumblr, when the &#8220;Hide Sensitive Content&#8221; toggle is enabled, the app will hide post recommendations that have sensitive tags, blogs with explicit content and searches with sensitive tags. (Explicit content, by Tumblr&#8217;s definition, is not quite as explicit as <a href="https://tumblr.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/231885248-Adult-Content#blog-moderation">adult content,</a> which Tumblr defines as GIFs, images, videos or illustrations depicting sex or genitals. Adult content is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/03/tumblr-no-more-porn/">currently banned</a>. TechCrunch asked for clarity from Tumblr about the distinction between adult and explicit content but has not received a response yet.)</p>
<p>When the new toggle is disabled, users can see sensitive search results that don&#8217;t violate community guidelines or tap through an overlay to access blogs marked explicit &#8212; though the explicit content will still be hidden on iOS. Users with the toggle disabled will also receive recommendations of potentially sensitive content.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when the toggle is enabled, some seemingly benign tags may still trigger the warning pop-up. For example, we found in testing that the tag &#8220;submission&#8221; is banned unless you opt out of the sensitive content filter, due to the word&#8217;s sexual context. This is an issue because the tag is often used in another, non-sexual way on Tumblr&#8217;s platform &#8212; if you post something to your blog that another user submitted to you, it will automatically be tagged &#8220;submission.&#8221;</p>
<p>In previous years, Tumblr had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/tumblr-just-added-a-switch-in-the-ios-settings-that-lets-you-turn-back-on-the-porn/">offered a similar toggle switch</a> that could block the site&#8217;s adult material directly in iOS Settings, unless a user opted into seeing this content. However, that toggle had been focused on banning the pornographic content Tumblr hosted before its decision to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/03/tumblr-no-more-porn/">officially ban all porn from its platform</a> back in 2018.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;These latest updates provide more control to our community on the iOS app to build the experience that fits them best, and to explore the content that they find interesting,&#8221; Tumblr <a href="https://wip.tumblr.com/post/673094877671800832/an-update-on-the-tumblr-ios-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> in a company blog post. &#8220;While the experience for our community is a top priority, we must also comply with Apple’s App Store Guidelines and our own guidelines.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In the war for talent, equity compensation has become more important than ever, but it’s not the easiest concept to explain, especially in privately funded companies.</p>
<p>Equity isn’t a new concept. Public and private companies have been using stock options (or RSUs) to recruit, motivate and retain talent for decades. However, equity compensation has grown in importance when it comes to hiring, retaining and aligning incentives across all employees, not just senior executives.</p>
<p>This is happening for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A global shortage of skilled tech workers:</strong> Candidates with in-demand skills are now getting multiple offers and can practically name their price. That price, more often than not these days, includes some kind of equity component.</li>
<li><strong>Wage inflation:</strong> The labor shortage and market dynamics are causing significant wage inflation. Companies are looking for ways to increase total compensation while reserving cash. Equity is one way to do this.</li>
<li><strong>A growing focus on private valuations:</strong> The number of companies reaching unicorn status is increasing. According to CB Insights, <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 900 companies globally have achieved unicorn status</a>, and 2021 alone minted more than 450 unicorns, up from the previous high-water mark of 111 in 2019.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency around compensation:</strong> Compensation data is accessible. Historically, companies like Glassdoor have provided robust salary data for more mature organizations. Now, companies like AngelList provide both <a href="https://angel.co/salaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">salary and equity benchmarking for startups</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Expectations:</strong> More than half (53%) of millennials say <a href="https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/schwab_equity_compensation_survey2020_findings.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">equity compensation was the main reason</a> or one of the main reasons they took their job.</li>
</ul>
<p>Leaders need to get better at understanding and articulating not just why equity is important but also how it’s determined. So let’s start at the beginning.</p>
<p>An ownership mentality is good for both business and morale, which is why many founders choose to allocate some level of equity (even a small piece) beyond leadership roles. Leaders may have the vision, but they need a team to execute and concretize their ideas.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Think strategically, think ahead, and communicate — make sure you’re offering the right equity allocation, for the right strategic reasons, and to achieve the right goals.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Designing your equity program</h2>
<p>Once you’ve decided stock options are going to be a component of <a href="https://tercera.io/resources/total-rewards-for-the-remote-workforce/">your total rewards package</a>, it’s time to define your philosophy and design your equity program.</p>
<h3>Sizing the equity pool</h3>
<p>First, you’ll need to determine the size of your employee option pool. You will want to formulate your thoughts prior to discussions with investors, who may require the creation of a larger option pool than is necessary if your proposed pool is disconnected from your hiring plan.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.backmarket.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Back Market</a> has raised another mega round of funding. In May, the company raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/back-market-raises-another-335-million-for-its-refurbished-device-marketplace/">$335 million Series D round</a>. Today, the company is announcing a $510 million Series E round, which values the company at $5.7 billion.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Back Market, the company operates a marketplace of refurbished electronics devices — mostly smartphones. In other words, if you think smartphones are expensive, you can get a phone that is still in good condition without paying full price.</p>
<p>There are many reasons consumers might buy a phone on Back Market instead of buying a new phone from a carrier or smartphone manufacturer. In addition to saving money, many customers think new phones only feature incremental updates compared to previous generation models.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256352" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Many customers also want to avoid generating additional waste and choose a used device for that reason. Many old smartphones simply end up in a drawer after all. A new battery and sometimes a new display might be enough to turn an old device into an attractive refurbished phone.</p>
<p>Back Market doesn’t refurbish devices directly. Instead, third-party companies act as the sourcing partners for Back Market. By listing their inventory on Back Market’s marketplace, they can find customers more easily.</p>
<p>On the other end of the transaction, customers buy devices through Back Market, as there’s a 30-day money-back guarantee. Overall, 6 million customers have purchased a device on Back Market.</p>
<p>Sprints Capital is leading today’s funding round, with existing investors also participating, such as Eurazeo, Aglaé Ventures, General Atlantic and Generation Investment Management. The French tech ecosystem has been on a roll as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/payroll-startup-payfit-is-frances-latest-unicorn-as-it-raises-289-million/">PayFit</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/business-banking-startup-qonto-raises-552-million-at-5-billion-valuation/">Qonto</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/09/ankorstore-reaches-2-billion-valuation-two-years-after-launching-its-wholesale-marketplace/">Ankorstore</a> also announced that they had raised hundreds of millions of euros each over the last few days.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our goal is to make refurbished electronics the first choice for tech purchases. We expect to see a similar development in the electronics market as we have witnessed in the pre-owned car market in America, where consumer confidence in buying second-hand vehicles has resulted in sales that have increased twofold compared to new car sales,” co-founder and CEO Thibaud Hug de Larauze said in a statement. “The support and confidence of these funds, together with our growing customer base, marks an important step in Back Market’s journey, and more importantly, for the circular economy as a whole.”</p>
<p>One metric that is particularly important for Back Market is the average failure rate. Right now, the company estimates that it has a failure rate of about 4%, which means that one in every 25 phones doesn’t work as expected in one way or another. That’s why customer service is key when it comes to customer satisfaction. The company also estimates that new devices have a 3% failure rate.</p>
<p>The startup expects to double in size with a specific focus on the U.S. market — it currently has 650 employees. Back Market operates in 16 countries, including many European markets, the U.S. and Japan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Monica Sarbu, co-founder and CEO at <a href="http://Xata.io">Xata.io</a>, has more than 15 years of experience working at tech companies. She never had a mentor to help her navigate her way inside the organizations where she worked, but she saw how some women and other historically underrepresented people struggled to find their way. She began thinking about how she could help more people succeed inside tech companies, and after much thought, she formed a nonprofit mentoring company in 2020 called <a href="http://tupu.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tupu.io</a> as a side project.</p>
<p>She initially considered writing a book, but she concluded that there is really no one-size-fits-all advice and it would need to be tailored to the individual&#8217;s situation. &#8220;I had this idea to build a mentorship program that would give [people] a custom solution designed for their own needs because most of the time, people come to you for mentorship in general when they have a problem,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She sees these problems usually falling into one of two categories: They either have a specific issue with someone in the company or they feel stuck in their careers and have grown depressed or fallen victim to imposter syndrome. She felt a program like Tupu could help.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255844" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to career site <a href="https://www.zippia.com/software-engineer-jobs/demographics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zippia.com</a>, just 25% of engineering jobs go to women. That means they are on average outnumbered 3:1, and it&#8217;s often worse than that. That can sometimes lead to a hostile work environment, whether that&#8217;s intentional or not.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have so many things that we can do to advise technical content companies to be better and create a more healthy environment because, in the end, this is what kind of makes you feel like you don&#8217;t want to be part of a tech company anymore. It&#8217;s the culture of the company,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Throughout her career, she has spoken at conferences, first primarily focused on women, and then later more general events, trying to articulate what it was like to be a woman inside an organization with mostly men. Through her speaking engagements, she was able to raise awareness and even empathy even among the mostly male audiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;I began the talk by asking them to try to put [themselves] in the shoes of a woman for a second [inside a tech company dominated by men] and then I tried to build a picture around this about what it feels like,&#8221; Sarbu told me.</p>
<p>She received a lot of positive feedback from men who hadn&#8217;t understood what it&#8217;s like to be one of a few women on technical teams. At that point, she wanted to do something more, and<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> the idea for Tupu began to form in her head.</span></p>

<p>She said that most programs like this charge by the mentee, and this usually limits the number of people who could be involved to the most promising employees, who in her experience have the least need. Her idea was to do this for free, putting in her own money initially while asking for donations from companies to help support the program and match more mentors with folks who need them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our model going forward is to go to tech companies of all sizes and help them with supporting diversity in their organization by offering mentorship to their employees,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The companies are not forced to choose the most &#8216;promising&#8217; employees to sign up for a mentorship program (as is happening at the moment) and they are able to encourage everyone to sign up for Tupu.io, whether mentees and mentors.&#8221;</p>
<p>The program currently has 57 mentees for 128 mentors. The mentors are men and women who have experience working in tech companies. She said that the platform has been able to attract these users to this point with little or no publicity or advertising.</p>
<p>Sarbu, whose day job is running Xata.io, a startup building a serverless database for the Jamstack environment, wants to make the site self-sufficient through donations from participating companies while making the process of signing up and matching mentors with mentees more automated. The company is working on a more automated version of the site and expects it to be ready soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new social app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1600525061" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Locket</a>, popped to the top of the App Store charts in recent days thanks to its clever premise to put live photos from friends in a widget on your iOS homescreen. In other words, it turns Apple&#8217;s widget system &#8212; typically used to showcase information like news, weather, inspirational quotes or photos from your own iPhone&#8217;s gallery &#8212; into a private social networking platform.</p>
<p>The idea for the app was dreamed up by Matt Moss, a former Apple Worldwide Developer Conference student scholarship winner and recent UC Santa Barbara grad, who had been building a user research and testing platform called <a href="https://www.usehawkeye.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hawkeye Labs</a>.</p>
<p>Locket, he admits, was originally a personal side project &#8212; not his main focus.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256184" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;I built it as a present for my girlfriend for her birthday last summer,&#8221; Moss explains. &#8220;She was going back to school in the fall, so we were about to start a long-distance relationship,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The process of getting a little photo from her on my homescreen&#8230;seemed really appealing. Just a nice way to stay in touch.&#8221;</p>
<p>The developer build the app over a week or two and ended up using it with his girlfriend fairly extensively over the past six months, sending each other an average of five photos per day. As Locket also stores the photos sent and received in its history section, the app became a fun way to look back on their photos, as well.</p>
<p>Soon, the couple&#8217;s friends started taking notice and asked if they could use it with their own significant others, family or friends. So Moss decided to make Locket publicly available to users on the App Store.</p>
<p>The app launched on New Year&#8217;s Day, and has now seen more than 2 million users sign up as of this morning. On Sunday, Lokcet became the No. 1 app overall on the U.S. App Store, per <a href="https://apptopia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apptopia&#8217;s</a> app store data, and had become the No. 1 Social Networking app the day prior. Apptopia reports only seeing around 1 million global installs so far, with about 31% from the U.S. &#8212; but its data is only through yesterday.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Moss credits Locket&#8217;s rapid adoption to going viral on TikTok, where he published videos to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@locketcamera" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an accompanying company account</a> for Locket where he could show off the app in action. His video received some 100,000 views over just a couple of days. Other TikTok users then began making their own content featuring the app and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7047999931373652783" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the custom sound used</a> on the original Locket video.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>This helped blow up the app even more among TikTok&#8217;s young user base. In fact, one video made by a TikTok user in the U.K. topped 5 million views in a single day, Moss noted.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s common for app developers to leverage TikTok to drive installs at the time of launch, Moss denies that any sort of paid influencer marketing took place here, nor did he run paid advertisements on TikTok or elsewhere, he says.</p>
<p>Today, Locket remains in the No. 1 position on the iPhone&#8217;s Top Free Apps chart as a result of its TikTok exposure &#8212; and because its early adopters invited their friends to download the app and check it out, driving further installs.</p>
<p>To get started using the app, download Locket from the App Store and sign up by verifying your phone number.</p>
<p>Locket then requests access to your iPhone&#8217;s Contacts and Camera in order to function. Ideally, Locket would allow users to bypass full address book access to instead allow users to invite friends through standalone invitations, as that would be a more privacy-focused approach. Moss tells us he&#8217;s considering changing this aspect of the app&#8217;s behavior, which is meant to make the app easier to use. However, he says Locket doesn&#8217;t store your contact info nor send its invites automatically using its own phone number &#8212; it just pops up the iMessage window so you can customize the text sent to your friends.</p>
<p>However, if you choose to decline Apple&#8217;s pop-up, which requests permission to pull in your Contacts, you aren&#8217;t able to use the app at all, we found.</p>
<p>After inviting and adding friends to join you on Locket, you&#8217;ll then add the app&#8217;s widget to your iOS home screen. The widget will showcase your friends&#8217; photos as they add images throughout the day. You can also launch the app at any time to add photos of your own to be sent to your friends&#8217; widgets.</p>

<p>There isn&#8217;t much more to the app than that, really. There are no fancy camera filters or effects, nor can you upload images from your Camera Roll. The experience is designed to be a way to share photos in real time with a small group of up to five friends or loved ones.</p>
<p>Locket&#8217;s quick shot to the top of the App Store has Moss now thinking of his next steps. He plans to later introduce a subscription model and support for additional widgets and, at some point, an Android version. As to whether or not he&#8217;ll take on outside investment, however, remains to be seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re definitely thinking about stuff,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the creator believes there&#8217;s potential in Locket beyond its current photo widget experience &#8212; perhaps even growing out a set of features inside the app as users share more photos over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there is something pretty meaningful to be built in the close friends and family space,&#8221; Moss says. &#8220;I do think people &#8212; especially younger people &#8212; are a little bit more tired of apps that are kind of very ad-centric and very metric-centric.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You end up with these huge social circles on the app &#8212; where you have 1,000 friends on Instagram, or you have to send Snapchats back and forth with your 100 closest friends &#8212; which actually takes a lot of effort at the end of the day,&#8221; he continues. &#8220;So the idea of making something that&#8217;s more geared towards those five closest people, or those 10 closest people, and then providing a way to make your phone feel more personal and geared towards people instead of these apps &#8212; I think there&#8217;s a real appetite for that,&#8221; Moss adds.</p>
<p>Locket isn&#8217;t the first to offer a collaborative photo widget experience. Another app called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magnets-shared-widgets/id1520682943?ign-mpt=uo%3D4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magnets</a>, launched in 2020, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/10/07/magnets-app-lets-you-create-collaborative-photo-widgets-with-your-friends-on-ios-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had a similar idea</a> but also supported sending short text messages to friends through its widget. Other apps competing in this space include Ekko, Widgetgram, Lettie, Tile Widget, Fave and others. However, none have yet to achieve any sort of critical mass.</p>
<p>Locket is currently <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1600525061">a free download on iOS</a> but has only achieved a 3.4-star rating, as some users didn&#8217;t seem to understand how to make the widget work, or were struggling with the onboarding process. The latter seemed to largely occur during the height of its viral surge when the app <a href="https://twitter.com/thefuturematt/status/1478527894087344128">was experiencing some issues,</a> but we&#8217;ve since tested Locket and found the problems to be resolved.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://twigcard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twig</a>, a London-based fintech targeting Gen Z and younger millennial consumers with an e-money account that gives them instant cash-outs on fashion and electronics they want to sell, has closed a $35 million Series A round of funding.</p>
<p>The investment is led by U.K.-based fintech specialist, Fasanara Capital, with additional backing from a number of undisclosed strategic investors which Twig says include current and former executives from LVMH, Valentino and Goldman Sachs, among others.</p>
<p>The startup was only founded in mid 2020 &#8212; launching its service in the U.K. last July &#8212; but it touts rapid domestic growth (100,000+ monthly downloads of its apps; reaching sixth position in the iOS App Store&#8217;s top finance apps); and is already gearing up for international expansion.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256099" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Series A is pegged for launching in the U.S. (slated for Q1 this year) and the EU (Q2; where it&#8217;s eyeing Italy, France and Germany for starters), as well as expanding the product&#8217;s capabilities and feature-set with a focus on the buzz around web3 and digital collectables.</p>
<p>For now, Twig accounts are only available in the U.K. Founder and CEO Geri Cupi tells TechCrunch it has around 250,000 users at this stage.</p>
<p>He adds that the typical user is a 22-year-old, recently graduated professional female &#8212; perhaps with a bunch of stuff in her wardrobe that she&#8217;s outgrown and would be happy to resell.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Vinted raises $303M for its 2nd-hand clothes marketplace, used by 45M and now valued at $4.5B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/vinted-raises-303m-for-its-2nd-hand-clothes-marketplace-used-by-45m-and-now-valued-at-4-5b/embed/#?secret=WLOOMW2XJa" data-secret="WLOOMW2XJa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Growth via user referrals looks likely to have helped fuel its early rise, given Twig charges users a £1 transfer fee for users to send money to a third-party account but there&#8217;s no fee if you transfer from one Twig account to another.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that despite having a marketing slogan which paints itself as &#8220;your bank of things&#8221;, Twig is not actually a bank; rather a Twig account is an &#8220;e-money account&#8221; &#8212; so there are key regulatory differences (such as Twig accounts not being covered by the U.K.&#8217;s deposit guarantee scheme).</p>
<p>Not being a full fat bank means the startup can scale faster into new markets, with lighter regulatory requirements on the service than if it needed to obtain a banking licence. For now it&#8217;s not in a hurry to turn into an actual bank, per Cupi.</p>
<p>In earlier decades, long before the internet- and open banking-fuelled fintech boom, legacy banks would pitch to get a new crop of school leavers signed up by offering freebies &#8212; like bags, stationery, music or other offers. Now fintech startups compete to offer the most appealing feature mix to net a target youth demographic.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s fair to say that getting money into accounts remains a key aim.</p>
<p>That said, Twig is applying for <a href="https://bcorporation.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B Corp certification</a> which emphasizes social purpose and environmental performance, as well as transparency and accountability &#8212; Cupi says it&#8217;s in the final stage of the application; it has pending status currently and he anticipates getting full status in Q1 &#8212; while its PR pushes claims of sustainability and circularity, given that it&#8217;s plugging users into selling (rather than binning) their branded goods.</p>
<p>Its website also talks up its use of carbon offsetting and other initiatives to shrink environmental impact.</p>
<p>Thing is, in order for humanity to avert climate catastrophe, major reductions in global CO2 emissions are required &#8212; so, essentially, less consumption overall. Which does call into question the credibility of claims of &#8220;sustainability&#8221; being made to stretch around a concept of resale that risks fuelling increased consumption via instant valuations and cash outs, as Twig offers.</p>
<p>Selling a currently owned thing to free up cash might encourage the consumer to splash out and buy more new things than they otherwise would if they had held onto the original item for longer. Or, to put it another way, circularity needs to work hand in hand with longevity if it&#8217;s to shrink consumption and actually reduce CO2 emissions. And it&#8217;s not clear that reducing friction involved in reselling will lead to consumers buying less overall. On the contrary; it may do the opposite.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s one potential wrinkle in Twig&#8217;s sustainability pitch.</p>
<p>However when we put this conundrum to Cupi he neatly irons it out &#8212; deploying a (somewhat circular) argument which states that Twig&#8217;s goal of increasing &#8220;liquidity&#8221; of secondhand things can work for sustainability and support reduced consumption by making more secondhand stuff available to buy &#8212; thereby reducing demand for new stuff to be made as more items (re)circulate through this (more vibrant) secondary economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Essentially our core business is we enable consumers to get paid for their old items and in the process we give a new life to their items &#8212; and this increases supply in the secondary market at least,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The demand in the secondary market has been growing and growing. The reason we can afford just to be on the supply side of the market is there is such a bigger need for extra supply right now in the market. And when consumers get hat extra cash it doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re going to use it to buy more things.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is from what we&#8217;ve seen from our users. Typically from the funds that are being transferred to Twig we see that roughly 42% of them get used for new experiences &#8212; that might be travelling, it might be&#8230; experience-led &#8212; so it doesn&#8217;t mean that if you increase liquidity you necessarily increase consumerization of things that have a negative impact on the environment. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been seeing so far.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cupi condenses Twig&#8217;s business to a very simple pitch: &#8220;We tokenize assets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The way Twig works is you can upload &#8212; let&#8217;s say a Gucci Marmont handbag &#8212; on the platform. And what Twig does is it tokenizes that asset and offers you a price for it,&#8221; he explains.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to make this available externally as well. In that scenario blockchain becomes useful&#8230; We want to increase the liquidity of this asset and make it very easy for consumers to trade the physical goods for virtual goods and use the virtual goods to buy physical goods or experiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we just want to make it much easier for them to trade, essentially.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cupi has a background in blockchain and the circular economy &#8212; which has included, back in 2018, <a href="https://medium.com/@socialdnateam/levis-albania-completes-the-acquisition-of-social-dna-ltd-53b76c6e3abd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling a denim upcycling business to Levi&#8217;s Albania</a>.</p>
<p>Physical items that resell well include fashion from brands like Nike, Gucci, Chanel, Hermes and other luxury makers, according to a Twig <a href="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/twig.publications/twig-white-paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white paper</a> &#8212; which talks about &#8220;redefining the future of ownership&#8221; and &#8220;empowering Gen Z to live a circular lifestyle&#8221;.</p>
<p>Apple electronics also hold their value well on the secondhand market, per Cupi &#8212; who notes that after Twig added electronics to the secondhand items it&#8217;ll buy, expanding out from buying fashion cast offs, its demographic shifted from over 90% female to around 70:30 female to male.</p>
<p>Twig takes care of the resale of pre-owned items for its users &#8212; providing them with an instant valuation and (potentially) instant cash to spend on whatever they like if it&#8217;s happy to buy the stuff they&#8217;re selling. (It has a pretty specific list of what it will and won&#8217;t buy.)</p>
<p>Shipping the goods to Twig is free for the user &#8212; so by using its service they essentially skip the hassle and risk associated with manually selling their stuff on a second hand marketplace like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/vinted-raises-303m-for-its-2nd-hand-clothes-marketplace-used-by-45m-and-now-valued-at-4-5b/">Vinted</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/06/depop-a-social-app-targeting-millennial-and-gen-z-shoppers-bags-62m-passes-13m-users/">Depop</a>. (Albeit, they may get less than if they sold the items themselves.)</p>
<p>If an item fails a quality check once it arrives at Twig&#8217;s warehouse the user is charged a fee to return it to them (and presumably any instant payment they got for it is also reversed). While if Twig ends up being unable to sell an item it says it donates the goods to charity rather than binning them to avoid sending stuff to landfill because that&#8217;s bad for the environment.</p>
<p>Cupi says it&#8217;s in a growth-focused phase at present so is not seeking to make chunky margin on resales.</p>
<p>The value it&#8217;ll offer for an item varies, depending on various dynamic factors &#8212; its white paper notes that it uses a &#8220;market-based pricing algorithm&#8221; to analyze more than 100 million products on the secondary market to provide &#8220;representative resale values for brands, item categories and market segments&#8221;.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Etsy asks, &#8216;How do you do, fellow kids?&#8217; with $1.6B Depop purchase&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/etsy-asks-how-do-you-do-fellow-kids-with-1-6b-depop-purchase/embed/#?secret=4iHQtnM1TU" data-secret="4iHQtnM1TU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Core to its premise is that factoring in resale value changes the concept of total cost of ownership for the consumer &#8212; which may have the power to shift buying patterns (it could, for example, encourage consumers to opt for high-end fashion to get value longevity over environmentally ruinous and low resale value fast fashion, say).</p>
<p>Combining bank-like functionality &#8212; Twig accounts come with a Twig Visa debit card and include capabilities like the ability to make domestic and international money transfers &#8212; with a baked-in secondhand goods resale service is a pitch tailor-made for the target Gen Z and younger millennial demographic which has shown a keen and growing interest in both the thrift and sustainability of secondhand marketplaces.</p>
<p>Twig&#8217;s target demographic also explains its marketing being heavy on talk of environmental friendliness via circularity. (&#8220;Twig makes it easier and empowers you to adopt a more sustainable lifestyle,&#8221; is one claim on its retro-graphic-heavy website.)</p>
<p>Gen Z especially has been dubbed the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/10/the-environment-is-gen-zs-no-1-concern-but-beware-of-greenwashing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sustainability generation</a> &#8212; with these young consumers prioritizing &#8220;usage of goods over ownership&#8221;, as Twig&#8217;s white paper puts it.</p>
<p>So reimagining the function of a bank as an arbiter and exchange of resale value &#8212; enabling consumers to turn all sorts of stuff into, essentially, quasi-currency to pay for other things they want to have or do (a sort of high tech reinvention of barter if you like) &#8212; rather than as a literal store of financial value starts to look pretty interesting.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another sustainability wrinkle to tackle, though &#8212; given how thoroughly blockchain is baked into what Twig&#8217;s doing.</p>
<p>While its tech has been built on blockchain from the start you&#8217;d be hard pressed to notice from the user-facing descriptions on its website. But its plan for the Series A risks throwing its Gen Z-friendly eco-sounding marketing right out of whack &#8212; as its PR seeks to tap into the raging web3 hype, with the launch of what it describes as &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">a first-of-its-kind Web 3.0 green payment infrastructure&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This forthcoming functionality will enable users to &#8220;tokenize&#8221; real-world assets and &#8220;make them tradeable in seconds&#8221;, its release goes on, adding that: </span>&#8220;<span class="il">Twig</span> will enable digital and physical items to be monetized and traded in new ways. Such an approach will allow users to trade-in goods at the checkout page and buy crypto currencies as well as NFTs by trading-in their clothes or electronics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quite how encouraging the trading of crypto and NFTs can be spun as &#8220;green&#8221; is an interesting question to ponder.</p>
<p>After all the energy costs of crypto can look like an extinction level event, in and of themselves.</p>
<p>For example, a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study last year</a> by Cambridge University suggested that just one cryptocurrency &#8212; Bitcoin &#8212; consumed more energy annually than the entire country of Argentina.</p>
<p>Another piece of research,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/mar/10/bitcoin-rise-could-leave-carbon-footprint-size-london" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> from March last year</a>, suggested Bitcoin consumed as much energy as Norway &#8212; with predictions that its carbon footprint would soon be akin to the emissions generated by the entire metropolitan area of London.</p>
<p>In short, the infamous inefficiency of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies &#8212; certainly those that require proof of work to validate transactions &#8212; looks anything but sustainable.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s even more wasteful energy usage being attached to blockchains too: aka the rise of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) which involve &#8212; and further encourage &#8212; the use of energy-intensive transactions by layering the trading of digital collectables atop blockchains.</p>
<p>The current hype around NFTs (as fashion/status symbols) combined with the retail trading of these digital assets &#8212; and the suggestion that hyper quick money can be made by burning energy to shift collectable pixels &#8212; pours yet more fuel on this energy bonfire.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last year an analysis by a digital artist suggested</a> that an average NFT could have a carbon footprint equivalent to a month&#8217;s worth of electricity usage for a person living in the EU. So, again, it&#8217;s hard to conceive of a way to spin features that encourage users to get busy tokenizing and trading their stuff &#8212; and/or digital collectables &#8212; as, in any shape or form, &#8220;green&#8221;.</p>
<p>Once again, Cupi is not phased by this counter argument, though.</p>
<p>Firstly he says that the blockchain infrastructure Twig has been built on is more energy efficient than some other blockchains.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blockchain itself is not bad for the environment as a technology &#8212; there&#8217;s different applications of it,&#8221; he argues. &#8220;In our case the blockchain that we built on top of &#8212; it&#8217;s Hyperledger Sawtooth &#8212; the energy usage is very, very small compared to the other solutions out there.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we try to minimize the usage of energy intensive solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also specifies that Twig is calculating its internal energy usage to try to quantify its environmental impact and &#8212; at a minimum &#8212; it&#8217;s doing carbon offsetting to counteract this.</p>
<p>He says it is also supporting projects that are seeking to sequester/remove CO2 from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Although how viable/credible the specific projects are is a whole other matter.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Back Market raises $335M for its refurbished device marketplace, now valued at $3.2B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/back-market-raises-another-335-million-for-its-refurbished-device-marketplace/embed/#?secret=L47tizUtvY" data-secret="L47tizUtvY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While Twig may be seeking to minimize/offset its own energy usage/carbon footprint, the bigger potential environmental impact is likely to be from secondary (for want of a better word) usage &#8212; aka, any consumption, energy use and CO2 emissions that Twig&#8217;s users and suppliers generate as a result of what its platform enables them to do.</p>
<p>Calculating those linked but indirect impacts &#8212; sometimes called &#8220;Scope 3&#8221; emissions, in sustainability reporting terms &#8212; is much harder than doing an internal audit of a business&#8217; direct energy usage. Yet Scope 3 emissions also tend to comprise the biggest chunk of an organization&#8217;s carbon footprint. So you can&#8217;t just wish all those connected transactions, emissions and effects away.</p>
<p>Twig is clearly trying to tackle some of this &#8212; by doing carbon offsetting to cover the shipping of goods, for example. And its ambition to gain B Corp status looks laudable.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s a lot harder to predict what sort of energy costs its platform may ultimately end up generating &#8212; based on the consumer demands and trends it might feed and/or drain.</p>
<p>By encouraging users to buy crypto and get into trading NFTs it&#8217;s clear there will be associated energy costs. And there is a risk that such intensive energy costs could end up erasing potential environmental gains (if Twig is able to turn increased liquidity of secondhand goods into a net reduction in manufacturing of new items via reduced demand from consumers to buy new).</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s also possible that such a radical reimagining of what can be used to make a payment &#8212; all sorts of items/things/stuff; in theory a consumer may not need to ever spend actual money in a world of tokenized value &#8212; could lead to substantial shifts in consumption that can actually move the needle on circularity. And move our societies away from the vicious circle of throwaway consumption that&#8217;s characterized so many decades of capitalism.</p>
<p>Put another way, if the things we have can be relied upon to more predictably sustain their value for resale &#8212; thanks to the help of blockchain-based tokenization (which can support authentication to combat fakes) and more stable valuations (based on knowing the full ownership history via a distributed ledger infrastructure) &#8212; consumers may be nudged to take better care of the stuff they have in order to preserve its longevity for better resale, meaning the world&#8217;s industries won&#8217;t need to make half so many things in the first place &#8212; lifting crippling systemic pressure on planetary resources.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly a thought.</p>
<p>De-emphasizing money by making it much easier to make payments by exchanging all sorts of things might be exactly the kicker we need to rework how we think about value, ownership and wealth. And, indeed, planetary resources.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Cupi again: &#8220;Instead of using your own cash to buy NFTs you can use things that you have at home and don&#8217;t use anymore &#8212; for instance you might have an old iPhone that you don&#8217;t use anymore and you can trade that for an NFT or you can trade that for some cryptocurrency or you can use that to buy an experience &#8212; you can use that to buy a trip to New York or you can use that to pay for your next vocational course&#8230; So the whole purpose of Twig is to increase liquidity in the market and &#8212; essentially &#8212; to make it very easy for people to use assets that they don&#8217;t use anymore and give them a second life.</p>
<p>&#8220;That way our ethos is you can both do good to your wallet and to the Earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The vision for Twig is therefore to turn itself into a payments platform &#8212; but one that translates physical goods into payments on behalf of its users/customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the moment Twig is just a B2C platform &#8212; but it&#8217;s going to become a B2B2C platform. So it will be connected as a payment gateway of different providers,&#8221; he says, noting that it has inked agreements with &#8220;a couple of big merchants&#8221; to be plugged into its infrastructure (he&#8217;s not disclosing which retailers as yet).</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re trying to do &#8212; essentially &#8212; is to reinvent the definition of wealth,&#8221; Cupi adds, discussing how he sees the notion of money evolving. &#8220;So if everything that you own can be treated as money your perception of wealth also changes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The old definition of wealth is the value of your largest asset &#8212; the value of your house, the value of your car&#8230; But you don&#8217;t see as part of your wealth &#8212; typically &#8212; the value of your wardrobe, for instance. This is what we&#8217;re trying to change. And in that way if everything has instant liquidity you can treat your things as cash. It doesn&#8217;t make a difference whether it&#8217;s cash &#8212; or a Gucci Marmont handbag. If you want to buy something in pounds it&#8217;s then the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>So if Twig gets its way the future of payments might get a whole lot more visual and physical &#8212; maybe you&#8217;ll be buying a secondhand iPhone by dragging and dropping an NFT you minted into the ecommerce payment window.</p>
<p>Or posting off a pair of limited edition Nikes to score that sweet Spring city break you&#8217;ve been looking forward to.</p>
<p>Or, er, buying a chunk of prime real estate with some prize pieces of diamond-encrusted jewellery&#8230;</p>
<p>While younger consumers may already be comfortable with a world of fairly commoditized value tradable stuff, what about older consumers? Does Cupi reckon Boomers or Gen X can be convinced to start making payments by parting with things they&#8217;ve ploughed their cash into?</p>
<p>Are first edition signed books and prize vinyl pressings going to end up folded into the future payment mix?</p>
<p>&#8220;To be honest I don&#8217;t know the answer to that,&#8221; he says. &#8220;At the moment we&#8217;re seeing our product, Gen Z reacts very well to it. And also young millennials &#8212; so twentysomethings&#8230; that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re seeing &#8212; and in the U.K. It might be a different picture once we go to other markets as well.&#8221;</p>

In a study published in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abl9174" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>Science Advances</ins></em></a>, Chinese researchers claim the lander detected signs of water molecules or hydroxyl, a close chemical cousin of H2O. Chang’e-5 used a spectrometer to analyze the composition of regolith in close proximity to its landing site. It found that most of the soil had a water concentration of less than 120 parts per million, making the surface of Luna much drier than that of the Earth.</p>

<p>Chinese scientists believe most of the molecules came to the Moon through a process called solar wind implantation. Charged particles from the sun drove hydrogen atoms to the lunar surface where they later bonded with oxygen to form water and hydroxyl. The study builds on findings NASA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-moon-sunlight-water-sofia-artemis-162600047.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><ins>published in 2018</ins></a> when it found evidence of water on the sunlit surfaces of the Moon using an airborne infrared telescope. For decades, scientists had believed the Moon was completely dry due to its almost nonexistent atmosphere. With no atmosphere, the thought was there was nothing there to protect water molecules from the sun’s harsh radiation.</p>
