										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Move fast, break things, get hacked.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what happened at Roll, the social currency platform that allows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/why-terry-crews-is-launching-a-social-currency/">creators to mint and distribute</a> their own Ethereum-based cryptocurrency known as social tokens. Last week, Roll disclosed a hacker had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/5-7m-stolen-in-roll-crypto-heist-after-hot-wallet-hacked/">stolen $5.7 million</a> from its hot wallet, a little over a year after the company launched.</p>
<p>Roll set up a $500,000 fund to help creators recoup their losses, and the company promised to hire a third-party to audit its security infrastructure.</p>
<p>But the company has so far been unable to contract with security investigators to probe the breach, leaving the startup to look for clues itself. A week has passed since the breach, and the social currency startup says it still doesn&#8217;t know how the hacker broke in or stole its private keys.</p>
<p>In a call with TechCrunch this week, Roll executives confirmed its infrastructure never underwent a security audit, a process designed to help find and fix vulnerabilities, prior to its launch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We weren&#8217;t ready from a security standpoint,&#8221; said Roll CEO Bradley Miles.</p>
<p>&#8220;This incident was a big setback for us, we will revamp a lot of infrastructure around this that we have in place to prevent something like this from happening again,&#8221; said Roll&#8217;s chief technology officer Sid Kalla, who oversees cybersecurity because the company does not have dedicated staff.</p>
<p>The executives said while its smart contracts — the technology that underpins the blockchain — were audited by a third-party firm, the rest of the company&#8217;s infrastructure was never stress-tested.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Decrypted: A hacker attempted to poison Florida town&#8217;s water supply&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/decrypted-hackers-attempt-to-poison-florida-towns-water-supply/embed/#?secret=bJXbLi1epy" data-secret="bJXbLi1epy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;That was a shortcoming on our end, and we should have done this earlier,&#8221; said Kalla.</p>
<p>The emptying of Roll&#8217;s hot wallet comes as social currency climbs to new levels of popularity. Roll has netted high-profile creators <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/why-terry-crews-is-launching-a-social-currency/">like actor Terry Crews</a>, along with hundreds of other social currency on the platform, many plummeting in value after the hot wallet was hacked.</p>
<p>Some of the larger social currencies, like $WHALE, bounced back <a href="https://twitter.com/WhaleShark_Pro/status/1371017826408931329">fairly quickly</a> after the breach of Roll&#8217;s hot wallet. A month earlier, $WHALE &#8220;serendipitously withdrew&#8221; a large amount of its supply to its cold wallets, which aren&#8217;t connected to the internet, in anticipation of community distributions. The social currencies that had measures in place proved some resiliency against the hack.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>After the company realized its hot wallet was emptied, the company spent the first two days following the money trail. Miles said the company engaged with forensic blockchain company Chainalysis for help. The company said it was looking at his logs, but says they have not seen any anomalous logins. Roll uses Amazon&#8217;s cloud for its infrastructure, and only a handful of employees have access to the private keys, and their accounts are secured with app-based authentication codes, said Kalla.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re a young company, we&#8217;re growing extraordinarily quickly,&#8221; said Miles, who admitted that the company&#8217;s response &#8220;could have been better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no scenario in which you can lose that kind of money and not bring in incident response,&#8221; said Jake Williams, founder of cybersecurity firm Rendition Infosec. &#8220;The idea that you would try to do a DIY incident response, especially if it&#8217;s not your core capability, is just ridiculous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To rebuild trust, the company has to come clean on where the failures were at,&#8221; said Williams, a former NSA hacker turned incident responder.</p>
<p>Roll is rebuilding its infrastructure, but did not give a timeline for when the work would be completed. The company said it won&#8217;t allow users to make withdrawals until it&#8217;s confident that its infrastructure is secure. The company says it will engage a security company to audit the changes to its infrastructure. Roll also said it will reduce how many tokens it holds in its hot wallet.</p>
<p>Miles said the company&#8217;s relief fund for creators was raised to $750,000, which he said will go directly to affected communities. The company also plans to hire a dedicated chief information security officer when its next financing round closes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Africa, Y Combinator </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be a major backer of most of the continent&#8217;s well-known startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two of the most talked-about in the last two quarters &#8212; Flutterwave and Paystack &#8212; are YC-backed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their successes (Flutterwave&#8217;s billion-dollar valuation and Paystack&#8217;s rare exit to Stripe) have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">greatly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> increased YC&#8217;s appeal in the eyes of founders on the continent with local investors clamoring to get their portfolio into the accelerator</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike last year where Y Combinator held its Demo Day, both winter and summer in two days, it&#8217;s a single day for this Winter 2021 batch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the accelerator&#8217;s third online demo day, its second all-virtual class and remote pitch session following its decision to go </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> remote from the previous batch (Summer 2020)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A total of 319 companies pitched today from 41 countries drawing attention from more than 2,400 investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, only ten African startups pitched and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> other batches; most of them are fintechs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other startups offer e-commerce fulfillment, edtech and B2B food marketplace services. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five startups represent Nigeria; three are from Egypt, and one from the Ivory Coast and Kenya</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Here they are building.</span></p>
<h2><a href="http://dayra.co/">Dayra</a> (Egypt)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the gig workers in Egypt </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are unbanked,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and it&#8217;s difficult for digital platforms to pay them for their services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The traditional method would be to use cash or third-party institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by Omar Ekram,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dayra</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is trying to solve this via an API. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its platform, Egyptian businesses can offer financial services including loans to unbanked workers and customers in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.djamo.ci/">Djamo</a> (Ivory Coast)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there has been a huge profusion of financial services that have emerged in recent years in Africa, there&#8217;s still a huge underserved gap in Francophone Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In fact, less than 25% of the population </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is banked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Djamo acts as a challenger bank and offers banking solutions to break into this huge untapped market and help with financial inclusion in the region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Hassan Bourgi and Regis Bamba founded the Ivorian startup. </span></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.kidato.co/">Kidato</a> (Kenya)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In African public schools, the student-teacher ratio can be as high as 50:1. This doesn&#8217;t aid effective learning. Other options like private schools can be costly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kidato, an edtech startup founded by Sam Gichuru, have classes with student-teacher ratios at 5:1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also offer the same international curriculum as private schools in the country but collect much lower fees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://iflux.app/">Flux</a> (Nigeria)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes days and sometimes weeks to send money from the U.S. to Nigeria and most African countries. There&#8217;s also the problem with expensive fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flux, a Nigerian remittance startup, is using crypto to tackle this. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Via an application and from a wallet, people can convert fiat into crypto and send it to the wallets of people in other countries who convert back to fiat if they choose</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The startup was founded by Ben Eluan, Osezele Orukpe, and Israel Akintunde.</span></p>

<h2><a href="https://nowpay.cash/">NowPay</a> (Egypt)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial stress plays a major role as a top distraction for employees. NowPay, a startup founded by Sabry Abuelenien and Mostafa Ashour, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bridges that gap and provides several benefits for employers that choose to address this area of employee wellness proactively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company enables corporates to offer salary advances to employees. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also improves savings, spending, budgeting, and borrowing for employees by building products that tackle every vertical</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://mono.co/">Mono</a> (Nigeria)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the proliferation of financial services in Africa, it has become </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">extremely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> difficult for banks and fintechs to combine users&#8217; data from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> points and make sense of it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By streamlining various data in a single API, Mono helps companies and third-party developers retrieve vital information like account statements, real-time balance, historical transactions, income, expense, and account owner identification</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Abdul Hassan and Prakhar Singh founded the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<h2><a href="https://getprospa.com/">Prospa</a> (Nigeria)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. or the U.K, you can set up a business account in minutes but it can take hours and days in Nigeria. And most of this is still executed offline and on paper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prospa is a neobank for microbusinesses in Nigeria </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Frederik Obasi and Rodney Jackson-Cole. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It helps these businesses make international payments to more than 10 countries including China, Kenya, the U.K., and the U.S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.flextock.com/">Flextock</a> (Egypt)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When merchants launch their e-commerce businesses, they can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">easily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> manage the end-to-end operations in the early stages</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But as they begin to grow, managing their own operations can become difficult.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a burden for most businesses in Egypt and Flextock, a startup founded by Mohamed Mossaad and Enas Siam, solves it by providing an end to end fulfilment service</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They manage a business inventory, pick, pack and ship orders while providing real-time visibility and insights into their products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<h2><a href="https://sendbox.co/">Sendbox</a> (Nigeria)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some individuals and merchants, shipping can be a painstaking process. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To operate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">efficiently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they partner with one or more service providers or build their delivery operations themselves</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sendbox describes itself as a &#8220;fulfillment by Amazon for African merchants.&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company provides shipping, escrow payments, among other services, to social commerce merchants in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emotu Balogun and Olusegun Afolahan founded the company.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://vendease.com/">Vendease</a> (Nigeria)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For small and mid-sized restaurants in Nigeria and most of Africa, food procurement can be a complex process to manage</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">QuantumScape has issued a share offering to pay for an expanded pilot production line for its solid-state batteries just months after it became a publicly traded company via a reverse merger.</p>
<p>QuantumScape said in a <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-089693/">regulatory filing</a> that the net proceeds from its sale of 13 million shares — along with an additional 1.95 million shares if underwriters exercise that option — could be much as $859 million based upon an assumed public offering price of $59.34 per share. The offering is expected to be priced after the market closes Wednesday, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/quantumscape-seeks-to-raise-859-million-to-fund-pilot-expansion?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a>. The funds will be used to build a larger pre-pilot line called QS-0 and cover its part of a joint venture with Volkswagen Group for an expanded manufacturing facility known as QS-1.</p>
<p>Investors haven&#8217;t responded well in the hours following the initial offering, with prices falling more than 13% since launching the share offering. The market&#8217;s response is likely tied to the surprising timing of this share offering. Just six months ago, QuantumScape agreed to merge with a special purpose acquisition company (Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp.). At the time, QuantumScape said it was able to raise more than $700 million through the business combination, a figure that includes $500 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE. The raise was anchored by institutional investors, including Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company and Janus Transaction.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>QuantumScape worked quietly for years to develop solid-state batteries, a next-generation technology that could help unlock longer ranges and faster charging times in electric vehicles. The company attracted attention and capital early on from high-profile venture firms like Kleiner Perkins and Khosla Ventures. Volkswagen entered the picture in 2012. The automaker has invested a total of $300 million in QuantumScape, including $200 million last year. That additional backing was to accelerate that joint development work, Thomas Schmall, chairman of the board of management of Volkswagen Group components, said at the time.</p>
<p>The heart of the VW-QuantumScape relationship is its joint venture, which was announced in 2018, that aims to accelerate the development of solid-state battery technology and then produce them at commercial scale. The companies have publicly disclosed plans to set up a pilot plant for the industrial-level production of the solid-state batteries. QuantumScape announced in September, just four months after that extra $200 million in VW investment, that it had agreed to merge with Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp.</p>
<p>QuantumScape announced in 2021 plans to expand its manufacturing capacity by adding a 200,000 square foot pre-pilot line facility in California. This pre-pilot line, called QS-0, will now have more than double the announced capacity, if QuantumScape is successful in its plans. The QS-0 is intended in part to provide the large numbers of additional samples QuantumScape needs for its solid-state battery development and to test and tune the systems and processes it intends to use for mass production, the company said.</p>

<p>The pre-pilot line will also be used to produce enough prototype cells for Volkswagen and other automotive OEMs as well as prospective customers in other industries. QuantumScape said it expects to secure a long-term lease for QS-0 in the second half of this year and to be producing prototype cells in 2023.</p>
<p>QuantumScape has plans to also build a 21 GWh battery production line through its joint venture with Volkswagen.</p>
<p>&#8220;The proceeds of this offering are intended to provide sufficient funding to build the larger version of QS-0, to fund QS-0 operating expenses, to fund our share of the equity portion of the joint venture&#8217;s costs of building the QS-1 Expansion, net of debt intended to be incurred by the joint venture, and for working capital and general corporate purposes,&#8221; the company said in the filing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.K. challenger stockbroker <a href="https://freetrade.io">Freetrade</a> has raised a $69 million Series B round led by Left Lane Capital. The growth fund of L Catterton and existing investor Draper Esprit also participated. Freetrade operates a stock trading app and has managed to attract 600,000 users in the U.K. — they generated £1 billion in quarterly trade volume.</p>
<p>Freetrade has reached a post-money valuation of $366 million following today’s funding round. In December 2020, the company generated $1.4 million in revenue.</p>
<p>After signing up, Freetrade lets you buy and sell shares from the company’s mobile app. If you want to invest in companies with expensive shares, such as Alphabet (Google’s parent company), you can buy fractional shares. Instead of spending over $2,000 for a single share, you can buy one-tenth of a share for one-tenth of the price.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Freetrade lets you access U.S. and U.K. stocks as well as ETFs. Like Robinhood in the U.S., the company doesn’t charge any trading commission for basic orders —&nbsp;there’s a 0.45% foreign exchange fee on transactions in foreign currencies. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/technology/robinhood-risky-trading.html">Unlike Robinhood</a>, the company doesn’t want to push you toward day trading.</p>
<p>In addition to free general investment accounts, Freetrade offers <a href="https://freetrade.io/isa">individual savings accounts</a> (ISA). It’s a type of account specific to the U.K. that encourages long-term investments as tax on capital gains goes down over time. Freetrade charges £3 per month to open an ISA.</p>
<p>The company also offers <a href="https://freetrade.io/sipp">pension savings accounts</a> (SIPP). You get tax relief on contributions. If you live in the U.K., you’re probably familiar with SIPP. Those accounts cost £9.99 per month.</p>
<p>Finally, Freetrade has a premium plan for its most engaged users. You can pay £9.99 for Freetrade Plus. After that, you get 3% interest on cash up to £4,000, more stocks and more order types (limit and stop loss orders). You also get a free ISA and a discount on your SIPP.</p>
<p>As you can see, Freetrade is betting heavily on subscription revenue combined with a freemium approach. People who just want to buy a few shares probably stick with free accounts. But people who want to convert part of their savings into stocks and ETFs will likely end up subscribing to a tax-efficient account or a Freetrade Plus subscription.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to expand its product beyond its home country. You can expect some European expansion moves in the future.</p>
<p>For instance, Freetrade plans to launch in France with 5,000 stocks and ETFs from major European, U.K. and U.S. exchanges. Freetrade will support PEA, France’s equivalent of ISA, for €3 per month. And users will be able to subscribe to Freetrade Plus for €9.99 per month.</p>
<p>In other words, it’s going to be a very similar product in France and in the U.K. While there’s no dominant stock trading app in France, German startup Trade Republic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/stock-trading-app-trade-republic-expands-to-france/">recently launched</a> its app on the French market. It’s going to be interesting to see how these two startups grow outside of their home countries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Researchers say a botnet targeting Windows devices is rapidly growing in size, thanks to a new infection technique that allows the malware to spread from computer to computer.</p>
<p>The Purple Fox malware was <a href="https://blog.360totalsecurity.com/en/purple-fox-trojan-burst-out-globally-and-infected-more-than-30000-users/">first spotted in 2018</a> spreading through phishing emails and exploit kits, a way for threat groups to infect machines using existing security flaws.</p>
<p>But researchers Amit Serper and Ophir Harpaz at security firm Guardicore, which discovered and revealed the new infection effort in <a href="https://www.guardicore.com/labs/purple-fox-rootkit-now-propagates-as-a-worm/">a new blog post</a>, say the malware now targets internet-facing Windows computers with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/05/california-passes-law-that-bans-default-passwords-in-connected-devices/">weak passwords</a>, giving the malware a foothold to spread more rapidly.</p>
<p>The malware does this by trying to guess weak Windows user account passwords by targeting the server message block, or SMB — a component that lets Windows talk with other devices, like printers and file servers. Once the malware gains access to a vulnerable computer, it pulls a malicious payload from a network of close to 2,000 older and compromised Windows web servers and quietly installs a rootkit, keeping the malware persistently anchored to the computer while also making it much harder to be detected or removed.</p>
<p>Once infected, the malware then closes the ports in the firewall it used to infect the computer to begin with, likely to prevent reinfection or other threat groups hijacking the already-hacked computer, the researchers said.</p>
<p>The malware then generates a list of internet addresses and scans the internet for vulnerable devices with weak passwords to infect further, creating a growing network of ensnared devices.</p>
<p>Botnets are formed when hundreds or thousands of hacked devices are enlisted into a network run by criminal operators, which are often then used to launch denial-of-network attacks to pummel organizations with junk traffic with the aim of knocking them offline. But with control of these devices, criminal operators can also use botnets to spread malware and spam, or to deploy file-encrypting ransomware on the infected computers.</p>
<p>But this kind of wormable botnet presents a greater risk as it spreads largely on its own.</p>
<p>Serper, Guardicore&#8217;s vice president of security research for North America, said the wormable infection technique is &#8220;cheaper&#8221; to run than its earlier phishing and exploit kit effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that it&#8217;s an opportunistic attack that constantly scans the internet and looks for more vulnerable machines means that the attackers can sort of &#8216;set it and forget it&#8217;,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It appears to be working. Purple Fox infections have rocketed by 600% since May 2020, according to data from Guardicore&#8217;s own network of internet sensors. The actual number of infections is likely to be far higher, amounting to more than 90,000 infections in the past year.</p>
<p>Guardicore published indicators of compromise to <a href="https://github.com/guardicore/labs_campaigns/tree/master/Purple_Fox">help networks</a> identify if they have been infected. The researchers do not know what the botnet will be used for but warned that its growing size presents a risk to organizations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We assume that this is laying the groundwork for something in the future,&#8221; said Serper.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese automaker Geely Automobile Holdings is launching a new brand of premium electric vehicles as it aims to capture a share of the luxury EV market that has been dominated by Tesla and other homegrown companies.</p>
<p>The new brand of vehicles, called Zeekr, will be manufactured by parent company Zhejiang Geely Holding Group. The first Zeekr vehicles are expected to be delivered in the third quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>The launch of Zeekr, which was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-geely-electric-exclusive/exclusive-targeting-tesla-chinas-geely-to-launch-new-premium-ev-brand-sources-idUSKBN2BB054">first reported by Reuters</a> and confirmed today by Geely, has been couched as a bid to take on Tesla in China. Tesla has had success in the country, reporting in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm">a recent regulatory filing</a> that sales in China more than doubled last year, from $2.9 billion in 2019 to $6.6 billion in 2020. But Tesla is hardly the only competition in China, the world’s largest market for electric vehicles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zeekr will have to jostle with domestic start-ups Li Auto and NIO that also offer luxury car models. While Geely remained the highest-selling Chinese auto brand by units sold in 2020 – its fourth consecutive year in the top spot – net profits dropped 32% last year, according to financial results posted Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Zeekr marque will be manufactured by Geely Holding using its Sustainable Experience Architecture, an open-source EV technology that the company said offers driving ranges of up to 435 miles (700 km) as well as smart connectivity options. Geely has plans to deploy the architecture across its nine automotive brands (the company is a minority shareholder of Daimler AG and owner of Volvo Cars) – and sell to other manufacturers.</p>
<p>Eric Li, founder of Geely Holding, said in a statement that the company intends to make the architecture accessible to other car makers.</p>
<p>The SEA platform is just one piece of Geely’s plans to position itself as a leading source of electric vehicle manufacturing and technology. Last month, Geely and Volvo Cars announced they had axed plans to merge but will instead set up a standalone company that will develop next-gen hardware and software for electric vehicles across its brands and with other manufacturers. The two companies will also jointly source batteries and electric motors under the new collaboration.</p>
<p>Geely Holding is also setting the stage to take on a larger role in manufacturing for other car companies, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/foxconn-geely-team-up-to-build-electric-autonomous-and-shared-vehicles-for-automakers-startups/">plans for a joint venture</a> with Chinese company Foxconn Technology Group – Apple’s main supplier – aimed at contract manufacturing for automakers. Geely said it would partner with Chinese tech giant Baidu in a separate venture to build EVs, also with its SEA platform. Baidu has been developing intelligent driving technologies, including autonomous driving, which it said it would contribute to the new company.</p>
<p>Zeekr will be jointly owned by the subsidiary and its parent with a 51% and 49% share structure, with a joint investment of 2 billion yuan ($307 million).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Soft robotics have long been one of the more exciting categories among emerging technologies. Of course, as with most new tech, the field has some drawbacks over more traditional models. While they improve flexibility and complains over their more rigid counterparts, robots made of soft materials have often had an issue delivering electrical connectivity. In many cases, water and air-filled bladders are used to helped facilitate movement.</p>
<p><a href="https://engineering.cmu.edu/news-events/news/2021/03/11-touch-of-silver.html">New research</a> out of Carnegie Mellon University points to a method that could help increase conductivity in soft materials like hydrogels, without compromising the compliance at the core of the material’s appeal.</p>
<p>Recently <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/9/eabd3440">highlighted in a science journal</a>, the method essentially adds micrometer-sized silver flakes into the mix through a method similar to screen printing. When the material is partially dehydrated, the flakes begin forming connections that can be used to deliver a charge. The team describes the flakes as akin to, “a second layer of nervous tissue over your skin.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2129036" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/0311-em-touch-of-silver-01.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></p>
<p>“With its high electrical conductivity and high compliance or ‘squishiness,’ this new composite can have many applications in bioelectronics and beyond,” mechanical engineer professor Carmel Majidi said in a release tied to the news. “Examples include a sticker for the brain that has sensors for signal processing, a wearable energy generation device to power electronics, and stretchable displays.”</p>
<p>There are a ton of potential uses for soft robotics, but medical remains one of the most compelling. Treatment of motor disabilities and muscular disorders are among those highlighted by the team, including assistance for stroke patients and people suffering from Parkinson’s-related tremor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Well before the rumors, we knew this day was coming. After several generations of smartwatches and a handful of headphones, the smartwatch was the next logical step for OnePlus.</p>
<p>At today’s big launch event, the company made its first major wearable official, sporting the decidedly pared-down name, OnePlus Watch. As the title implies, the smartwatch is not a particularly flashy one. It has a minimalist design and, at $159, a price to match.</p>
<p>What’s perhaps most interesting here is the operating system. The Watch will be running the equally straightforwardly named OnePlus Watch OS. Google’s Wear OS was obviously the low-hanging fruit here. And then, after that, Tizen, which Samsung has used for several generations of Galaxy Watches.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead, the company opted to build its own operating system on top of RTOS (real-time operating system). CEO Pete Lau addressed the subject not long ago in a OnePlus forum, writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>We chose to go with a smart wear operating system developed based on RTOS because we believe it provides you a smooth and reliable experience while offering a great battery life, covering some of the biggest concerns we&#8217;ve been hearing from people looking to buy a smartwatch.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2128693" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128693" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2128693 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1046" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png 11747w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=147,150 147w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=294,300 294w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=768,785 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=666,680 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=1504,1536 1504w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=2005,2048 2005w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=64,64 64w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2128693" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> OnePlus</p></div></p>
<p>The battery aspect certainly rings true. That continues to be one of the largest hang-ups for smartwatches, particularly as companies continue to add features. According to the press materials, the 402 mAh battery gives the Watch anywhere between one to two weeks of life on a charge, which is a pretty impressive claim (we have yet to get our hands on a review unit to test this out). That would put it on par with many fitness bands.</p>
<p>There are a slew of sensors on board, measuring different health metrics, including heart rate and blood oxygen, accessible through OnePlus’s Health app. There’s 4GB of storage, half of which can be used for things like music. The Watch is rated IP68 waterproof.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard configuration, the company is also introducing a Cobalt model, which swaps the stainless steel body for a strong cobalt alloy, coupled with scratch-resistant sapphire glass.</p>
<p>The wearable will go on sale in North America on April 14.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cameras have long been the battleground on which the smartphone wars have been fought. Short of any left-field innovation like folding screens or strange form factors, that looks likely to continue to be the case for the foreseeable future. Year after year and generation after generation, companies tout imaging breakthroughs to set themselves apart.</p>
<p>It makes sense. Smartphones have improved to a point where flagship devices are, as a rule, pretty good. And while cameras have been a part of those improvements, there’s still a lot of room for improvement, both in terms of hardware and the software/AI that augments it. Recently, OnePlus announced that it would be recruiting a big name to help it in that fight.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AXf85mNO8o"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/07/oneplus-recruits-hasselblad-for-three-year-smartphone-imaging-deal/">OnePlus recruits Hasselblad for 3-year smartphone imaging deal</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;OnePlus recruits Hasselblad for 3-year smartphone imaging deal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/07/oneplus-recruits-hasselblad-for-three-year-smartphone-imaging-deal/embed/#?secret=AXf85mNO8o" data-secret="AXf85mNO8o" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Earlier this month, the Chinese smartphone maker unveiled a three-year deal with Hasselblad, one of the most iconic names in the photography space. Announced at an event today, the company’s new OnePlus 9 series will be the first handset to sport the early fruits of the $150 million deal.</p>
<p>The deal makes sense from a strategic standpoint. After all, OnePlus’s transformation from a high-end budget device to flagship competitor has put companies like Apple and Samsung in its sights. Both of those companies have established and long-standing imaging departments for their hardware, so in addition to a clear branding partnership, this does seem to be an earnest attempt to level the playing field.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2128614" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128614" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2128614" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9055-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9055-2.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9055-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9055-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9055-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9055-2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9055-2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9055-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2128614" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>It’s worth noting, up top, that the days of being the budget alternative are, to a degree, gone. The OnePlus 9 starts at $729 and the Pro starts at $969. As smartphone pricing goes, that’s toward the lower-end of premium devices, but after the introduction of the Nord, it seems safe to say that budget will no longer be a primary differentiator for OnePlus’s primary line.</p>
<p>Naturally, the OnePlus 9 Pro gets the most benefit from these early stages of the Hasselblad deal. The primary camera sports a 48-megapixel Sony sensor, coupled with improved focus speeds and increased color accuracy. The ultrawide camera has a 50-megapixel sensor (also Sony), with a lens designed to reduce distortion. Interestingly, the company says it’s also effective for shooting close macro shots with distances as close as 4cm.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Will Apple&#8217;s spectacular iPhone 12 sales figures boost the smartphone industry in 2021?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/will-apples-spectacular-iphone-12-sales-figures-boost-the-smartphone-industry-in-2021/embed/#?secret=xp9UMqdEbx" data-secret="xp9UMqdEbx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The third primary camera is an eight-megapixel telephoto capable of up to 30x digital zoom (though you’re going to lose a fair bit of information). There’s a fourth monochrome camera, as well, which primarily serves to help improve black and white shots. The standard OnePlus 9 has a similar setup, though you’ll drop that telephoto lens.</p>
<p>Here’s OnePlus on what Hasselblad is bringing to the table this time out:</p>
<blockquote><p>The new Hasselblad Pro Mode offers incredibly accurate and natural color for a solid foundation for post-editing. It has been revamped with a new user interface based on Hasselblad’s image processing software to give professional-level users a unique Hasselblad look and feel. It also allows for an unprecedented amount of control for expert photographers to fine-tune their photos, with the ability to adjust ISO, focus, exposure time, white balance and more. Users can also shoot in 12- bit RAW format for 64-times the color compared with 10-bit RAW traditionally found in other smartphones.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2128612" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128612" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2128612" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9032.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9032.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9032.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9032.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9032.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9032.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9032.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9032.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9032.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2128612" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Keep in mind, the partnership is still in its early stages, and much of the money is going toward R&amp;D, so we’ll probably be seeing more integration down the road.</p>
<p>The display is the same as the one found in the OnePlus 8T. That’s a 6.55-inch AMOLED with a 120Hz refresh rate. Brightness maxes out at 1,100 nits, and the screen sports HDR10+ certification. There’s a Snapdragon 888 inside, coupled with 8 or 12GB of RAM and 128 or 256GB of storage. Both models feature a solid 4,500 mAh battery that goes from empty to 100% charge in 29 minutes.</p>
<p>Pre-orders start March 26. The handsets will ship April 2.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There's a lot of news this morning, so let's discuss all the big dollars before YC demo day kicks off.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s demo day for the current Y Combinator class, so we&#8217;ll have a largely early-stage focus at TechCrunch today. But there&#8217;s also a host of late- and super-late-stage news this morning that matters.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get to all of it before we start to talk accelerators, overheated pre-seed valuations and the like.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>There are three things to discuss. First, the possible $10 billion exit of Discord to Microsoft. Discord is a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/discord/company_financials">well-financed unicorn</a> that has raised oodles of capital and reportedly sports rapidly expanding revenues. Our goal will be to vet whether the price tag in question makes any sense, or if it is too low.</p>
<p>Second: Real estate tech company Compass has set an IPO price range we need to explore. Is its resulting valuation strong? Does it line up with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/compass-files-for-ipo/">recent financial performance</a>?</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>And, third, Intermedia Cloud Communications has priced its IPO. We&#8217;re behind on this entire debut, so we&#8217;ll take a second to riff on what the company does and what it is worth.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a lot. But if we don&#8217;t get through it all now, we&#8217;ll fall behind and feel silly later. Let&#8217;s get to work!</p>
<h2>Discord and Microsoft</h2>
<p>Microsoft might be getting good at community, which is an odd thing to say about the enterprise software and cloud computing giant. The company&#8217;s Xbox gaming ecosystem has survived the test of time, Github is doing fine under Microsoft&#8217;s auspices, and Minecraft seems unharmed by Redmond&#8217;s stewardship.</p>
<p>That means gamers, developers and kids are all content to hang with Satya Nadella and company. Adding Discord to the mix might give Microsoft even more tooling to augment its existing communities, or perhaps tie them more closely together. But that&#8217;s all product news, which isn&#8217;t our remit. Let&#8217;s talk numbers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/23/technology/microsoft-discord-deal.html">The New York Times</a> reported that Discord has &#8220;held deal talks with Microsoft for a transaction that could top $10 billion.&#8221; That figure has been widely reported, so we&#8217;ll use it for our work.</p>
<p>With a possible valuation in hand, we need revenue numbers to figure out if the possible sale price makes any sense. Happily, we have somewhat fresh numbers: The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-social-network-without-ads-discord-defies-convention-11615199401">Wall Street Journal reported</a> earlier this month that Discord &#8220;generated $130 million in revenue [in 2020], up from nearly $45 million in 2019.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://onetrust.com/">OneTrust</a>, a late stage privacy platform startup, announced it was adding ethics and compliance to the mix this morning by acquiring Convercent, a company that was built to help build more ethical organizations. The companies did not share the purchase price.</p>
<p>OneTrust <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/onetrust-nabs-300m-series-c-on-5-1b-valuation-to-expand-privacy-platform/">just raised $300 million</a> on a fat $5.1 billion valuation at the end of last year, and it&#8217;s putting that money to work with this acquisition. Alan Dabbiere, co-chairman at OneTrust sees this acquisition as a way to add a missing component to his company&#8217;s growing platform of services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Integrating Convercent instantly brings a proven ethics and compliance technology, team, and customer base into the OneTrust, further aligning the Chief Ethics &amp; Compliance Officer strategy alongside privacy, data governance, third-party risk, GRC (governance, risk and compliance), and ESG (environmental, social and governance) to build trust as a competitive advantage,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Convercent brings 750 customers and 150 employees to the OneTrust team along with its ethics system, which includes a way for employees to report ethical violations to the company and a tool for managing disclosures.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Convercent wants to make it easier for companies to measure ethical behavior&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/14/converscent-wants-to-make-it-easier-for-companies-to-measure-ethical-behavior/embed/#?secret=r9iByA1WEr" data-secret="r9iByA1WEr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Convercent can also use data to help surface bad behavior before it&#8217;s been reported. As CEO Patrick Quinlan explained <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/14/converscent-wants-to-make-it-easier-for-companies-to-measure-ethical-behavior/">in a 2018 TechCrunch article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Sometimes you have this interactive code of conduct, where there’s a new vice president in a region and suddenly page views on the sexual harassment section of the Code of Conduct have increased 200% in the 90 days after he started. That’s easy, right? There’s a reason that’s happening, and our system will actually tell you what’s happening.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Quinlan wrote <a href="https://www.convercent.com/blog/next-stop-trust-onetrust">in a company blog post</a> announcing the deal that joining forces with OneTrust will give it the resources to expand its vision.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a part of OneTrust, we’ll be combining forces with the leader across privacy, security, data governance, third-party risk, GRC, ESG—and now—ethics and compliance. Our customers will now be able to build centralized programs across these workstreams to make trust a competitive differentiator,&#8221; Quinlan wrote.</p>
<p>Convercent was founded in 2012 and has raised over $100 million, according to Pitchbook data. OneTrust was founded in 2016. It has over 8000 customers and 150 employees and has raised $710 million, according to the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple this morning <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/03/apple-expands-free-professional-learning-to-help-teachers-champion-creativity/">announced</a> a handful of education-related updates to its suite of classroom apps as well as a new recognition for teachers, called the Apple Teacher Portfolio. Teachers who complete a total of nine lessons where they learn foundational skills on iPad and Mac to become an officially recognized Apple Teacher will be able to submit their portfolio of lesson examples to earn the Apple Teacher Portfolio recognition. They can then also share their portfolio with their colleagues or use it to showcase their work.</p>
<p>Teachers can work towards acquiring the badge through the Apple Teacher Learning Center, which is Apple&#8217;s self-paced learning platform for educators. This offering is designed to help teachers learn how to incorporate Apple technologies in the classroom, including by using iPad and Mac apps for creating art, videos, animations, recordings, page layouts, podcasts, data trackers, music, and more. Across the lessons, Apple provides templates as examples which teachers can customize or combine to make their own projects that use either an iPad or Mac and Apple software like Keynote, GarageBand, iMovie, and others.</p>

<p>In addition, Apple today rolled out updates across its Schoolwork and Classroom apps, as well as its &#8220;Everyone Can Create&#8221; curriculum, which has historically focused on taking advantage of Apple&#8217;s creative tools like iMovie, Clips and GarageBand.</p>
<p>In Schoolwork, teachers will gain the option to share Schoolwork projects with colleagues by exporting their assignments, which can then be imported back into Schoolwork or other platforms. Other improvements have been made to the sidebar navigation to make it quicker to access classes, assignments and student accounts.</p>
<p>Classroom, meanwhile, has been updated for remote learning &#8212; a feature that would have been more useful to have rolled out in 2020, amid the height of U.S. lockdowns during the pandemic. With the update, teachers will be able to invite remote students to Classroom sessions where they&#8217;ll be able to guide them to apps, view their screen (with the student&#8217;s permission) and track their engagement. The software has also been rebuilt using Mac Catalyst, making it work across iPad and Mac, including Macs powered by Apple&#8217;s M1 chips.</p>
<p>The Everyone Can Create&#8221; curriculum has had a number of smaller updates. Its Drawing guide has been updated to include motion graphics and animation in Keynote, while Photos now covers the creation of animated GIFs using Keynote, and the Camera and Photos apps. The Video guide will now explore creating short films using a green screen and other special effects, and Music adds new podcasting features using GarageBand, Apple says. Today, more than 5,000 K-12 institutions worldwide are using the curriculum.</p>

<p>Apple last year had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/21/apple-schoolwork-classroom-distance-learning/">updated</a> its Schoolwork and Classroom apps, with some updates to Schoolwork to support distance learning &#8212; like managing assignments over the cloud and support for calling students via FaceTime, for example. But even as the pandemic forced schools towards remote learning, Google jumped ahead of edtech rivals by aggressively giving away its software and courting teachers. Its low-cost Chromebooks were being given out across school districts, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chromebook-shipments-double-due-to-pandemic-193424657.html">doubling demand</a> in 2020. Google Classroom, meanwhile, doubled to more than 100 million active users by April 2020, Bloomberg Quint <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/google-widens-lead-in-education-market-as-students-rush-online">reported</a>. As of Feb. 2021, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/google-to-roll-out-slate-of-over-50-updates-for-classroom-meet-and-other-online-education-tools/">Google said</a> the service was being used by over 150 million students, teachers and admins, up from just 40 million last year.</p>
<p>Apple didn&#8217;t say today how many users it has for its own educational software programs, by comparison. However, by encouraging teachers to create a portfolio which they can then share, Apple is helping to push towards greater adoption of its tools by more directly involving educators in the process.</p>
<p>Apple Teacher Portfolio launched today and is available in the Apple Teacher Learning Center. The &#8220;Everyone Can Create guides&#8221; are a free download on Apple Books. And new versions of both Schoolwork and Classroom are available in beta now through AppleSeed for IT.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Augmented Reality pioneer <a href="https://www.blippar.com">Blippar</a> &#8211; which has had a tortuous history after early investors pulled out and the company had to scramble for new backers &#8211; has now closed a $5 million funding round, after 18 months of re-positioning as a B2B company in the AR space.</p>
<p>The pre-Series A round was co-led by Chroma Ventures and West Coast Capital. Canadian entrepreneur Anthony Lacavera also participated via his Globalive Capital investment firm. Chroma is the investment arm of Paddy Burns’ and Chris van der Kuyl’s gaming company 4J Studios, while West Coast is the private equity arm of Scottish entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter and family.</p>
<p>The new investors join existing shareholder Candy Ventures; the multi-stage investment firm founded by British property entrepreneur Nick Candy, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/blippar-finds-life-after-death-as-former-investor-buys-assets-to-relaunch-ar-startup/">who came to Blippar’s rescue</a>. This new entity acquired the company’s assets in a patent sale and managed to keep on sounder Ambarish Mitra, although he is now acting as the company’s “Chief Creative Officer”. At hits height, Blippar burned through $130 million in funding, claiming a $1.5 billion valuation, and tried to crack the consumer AR market. But Blippbuilder, its SaaS AR creation platform, is the asset that is now seeing it make a B2B comeback.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At its height Blippar employed 340 people, Now it’s 30 people. But it has all the IP and assets from its previous incarnation, and is now ‘making hay while the sun shines’.</p>
<p>AR technology is now being used in several areas such as live events (when they return!) retail, FMCG, automotive, healthcare and education.</p>
<p>Rumoured AR glasses from Apple and the inclusion of AR results in mobile search results may well help its adoption, as well as the continuing need for social distancing.</p>
<p>While the tech giants are developing AR tools, these are platform-dependent, whereas Blippar hopes to be the agnostic alternative.</p>
<p>Its two routes to market are, firstly, via its Blippbuilder SAAS platform, which enables agencies, brands and AR content creators to create communications and campaigns. It also does bespoke work with an in-house team “Studio B”.</p>
<p>Faisal Galaria, CEO of Blippar, commented: “We are very excited to have attracted investors of this caliber to Blippar… 2020 was a transformative year for Blippar with a 200% increase in revenue quarter on quarter, continued strengthening of the senior leadership team, and delivery of cutting-edge AR campaigns for major global brands including OnePlus, Kellogg’s and Dr Pepper. We have leveraged our 10 years of investment, provenance, and technology leadership in the AR space to come back leaner, more focussed and better than ever before.”</p>
<p>Burns and Van der Kuyl are best known for porting Minecraft to the Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo games consoles. The latter said in a statement: “The immersive nature of AR makes it one of the most important use cases for the gaming industry. Blippar’s AR technology is by far the most advanced and innovative that I’ve seen in years and there is huge potential for AR to power the ultimate gaming experience of the future. We look forward to being part of the Blippar journey.”</p>
<p>Hunter commented: “Blippar has demonstrated strong progress with the turnaround plan put in place by Faisal and the team, and the business is now well placed to maximize the opportunities presented by the growing AR ecosystem hence we are delighted to invest.”</p>
<p>In addition, Justin Cooke, Venture Partner at tech investor Northzone, has also been appointed to the Blippar Board this month. The UK Government also has a minority equity stake in Blippar via its Future Fund match funding scheme&lt; which was design to assist struggling tech companies through the pandemic.</p>
<p>Blippar re-enters a market which includes Niantic, Unreal, Unity, 8th Wall, Zappar and Magic Leap. But as AR matures, it may be back in the right place.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how brands are using the platform:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the third greatest television show of all time (sorry <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-lists/100-greatest-tv-shows-of-all-time-105998/veep-101740/"><em>Rolling Stone</em></a>), one of Texas&#8217; most famous fictional football players <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/2761467/friday-night-lights-flip-this-qb-flip-that-house/">once said</a>, &#8220;When all the scared rats are leaving a sinking market, that&#8217;s when a real entrepreneur steps in &#8212; a true visionary.&#8221;</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s the case, then the startup renewable energy retail reseller <a href="https://www.arcadia.com/">Arcadia</a> may be a true visionary. Even as <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/AG-Ken-Paxton-sues-Griddy-alleging-deceptive-15988077.php#:~:text=sighting%20in%20Gulf-,ERCOT%20shuts%20down%20Griddy%2C%20as%20Paxton%20sues,retailer%20over%20'deceptive%20business%20practices'&amp;text=March%201%2C%202021%20Updated%3A%20March,2%2C%202021%202%3A33%20p.m.&amp;text=The%20Electric%20Reliability%20Council%20of,effectively%20shutting%20down%20the%20company.">energy startups servicing customers throughout the great state of Texas are forced to throw in the towel</a>, the Washington-based, consumer-focused renewable energy power provider (based on renewable energy certificates purchased on the open market), is making an acquisition to enter the Texas market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company is buying <a href="http://realsimpleenergy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://realsimpleenergy.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616587927486000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFGnDWF-CX7Q_PKdWyrNUreHg1FoQ">Real Simple Energy</a>, which not only marks the company&#8217;s availability in all 50 states, but gives Real Simple Energy customers access to both wind and solar power generating projects. The company said it  will leverage Real Simple Energy&#8217;s platform and expertise to secure the best rates for members, monitor for better savings, and provide a smarter yet simpler energy experience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Recent events in the Texas market prove that customers shouldn’t be exposed to wholesale or variable rates, and want an energy advocate to protect them,” said Kiran Bhatraju, CEO and Founder of Arcadia. “Both Arcadia and Real Simple Energy recognize the challenges Texas homeowners and renters have historically faced in the energy buying process, and we remain committed to removing these confusing barriers.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Texans have consistently paid more for power than consumers that buy their energy from regulated market participants thanks to the state&#8217;s disastrously deregulated power markets. The combined companies are pitching fixed rate contracts to Texas consumers that won&#8217;t be vulnerable to bill spikes, but will offer average savings above the flat rates regulated utilities offer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The deregulated energy industry, especially in Texas, has underserved customers and as a result, most customers overpay for electricity and receive poor customer service. Using technology, we are helping customers realize the promise of deregulation and always get the best fixed rates available,&#8221; said Trent Crow, CEO of Real Simple Energy, in a statement. “As industry veterans, joining forces with Arcadia will allow us to get better deals for customers and enhance our customer experience.  We manage 100% of the energy experience and become a customer’s independent agent and advocate so they never have to worry about their electricity bill again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deal is Arcadia&#8217;s first acquisition and follows the company&#8217;s launch of a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/arcadia-expands-residential-community-solar-to-maine-301240000.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/arcadia-expands-residential-community-solar-to-maine-301240000.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616587927486000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEyodXKZ0kzODVLerFPoyuGUzCBaQ">community solar program</a> all the way across the country in the great state of Maine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://huckleberry.com/">Huckleberry</a>, an insurtech company that offers a variety of insurance to small businesses, has announced a partnership with Berkshire Hathaway GUARD. This represents the biggest partnership with a carrier for the startup to date.</p>
<p>The startup, cofounded by Bryan O&#8217;Connell, has made some major moves in the past year. The company launched in 2017 offering workers compensation and general liability insurance to small and medium-sized businesses through an online portal, cutting out a lot of the hassle for these businesses as they seek out the right policy.</p>
<p>In the last year, the SF-based company has nearly doubled its geographic footprint and added five new policies to the product suite, including cyber, automotive insurance, umbrella insurance and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Moreover, it&#8217;s moving to New York and opening up an office in Columbus, Ohio, called HQ2. O&#8217;Connell says that the move to New York is all about positioning the startup in the midst of NYC&#8217;s burgeoning pool of fintech talent.</p>
<p>With the new partnership and the company&#8217;s growth over the past year, it&#8217;s bringing on new team members, with plans to get to 100 people by the beginning of 2022. In particular, it&#8217;s brought on Bill Kaper as Chief Technology Officer. Kaper hails from Root Insurance, where he served as VP of Engineering and oversaw a team of 200+ engineers. Huckleberry also snagged Braden Davis, formerly of Jetty, as Chief Insurance Officer.</p>
<p>The company raised $18 million in Series A capital back in December of 2019, with investors that include Tribe Capital, with participation from Amaranthine, Crosslink Capital and Uncork Capital.</p>

<p>The momentum from the new hires and partnership with Berkshire Hathaway will allow Huckleberry to move into higher risk insurance categories.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.userinterviews.com/">User Interviews</a>, the Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator-backed company that has built a CRM for product research teams to get user feedback, has closed on a $10 million Series A round. The financing was led by Teamworthy Ventures, with participation from Las Olas, Accomplice, FJ Labs, ERA, Trestle Partners and ValueStream.</p>
<p>The company, cofounded by <a href="https://twitter.com/baself90">Basel Fakhoury</a>, was created out of failure, in some ways. Originally, the User Interviews team started with a project called Mobile Suites, an amenities logistics platform for hotels. It was a dud, and the team — Basel Fakhoury, Dennis Meng and Bob Saris — decided to do more user research before determining their next product.</p>
<p>In trying to collect that research, they stumbled upon a huge problem. It often takes companies weeks, if not months, to conduct a study around user research. The company decided to build out a platform that would procure subjects for research quickly and effectively, using an algorithm to pair qualified, engaged participants with the client.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The product became Recruit, and ran on an a la carte model. To complement Recruit, the team also launched Research Hub, which is a CRM and recruiting tool for research teams to manage their panels. To be clear, User Interviews doesn&#8217;t run the surveys or A/B tests themselves, but rather helps companies manage participants and. logistics for those studies.</p>
<p>Recently, User Interviews added a subscription layer to its product, allowing companies to purchase access to the software on an annual basis, rather than on a usage basis. Fakhoury says that this dual-model allows companies to try out the platform before they fully commit.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2128954" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128954" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2128954" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Workspace.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="484" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Workspace.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Workspace.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Workspace.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Workspace.png?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Workspace.png?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Workspace.png?resize=1536,1092 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Workspace.png?resize=2048,1456 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Workspace.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2128954" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> User Interviews</p></div></p>
<p>According to the startup, the company has experienced 140 percent annual growth, which has accelerated during the pandemic. Clients include Amazon, Microsoft, Colgate and Spotify.</p>
<p>User Interviews plans on using the new funding to hire more in the product department, as well as build out integrations with user testing software and their clients own data management systems.</p>
<p>Right now, the team is about 50 people, and is fully remote, with nearly half the workforce being female.</p>
<p>Fakhoury said the biggest challenge for the company is being able to do two things at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are simultaneously disrupting this legacy industry with Recruit, and we are creating a category with Research Hub,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those are somewhat different strategies and missions and making sure that we can do both of those in tandem is one big thing for us.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last fall, delivery startup <a href="https://gopuff.com">goPuff</a> made a big splash by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gopuff-funding/">raising $380 million in funding</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/gopuff-acquires-bevmo/">acquiring West Coast beverage retailer BevMo</a> shortly afterwards. Just a few months later, the Philadelphia-based company is announcing that it has raised another $1.15 billion in funding at an $8.9 billion valuation (compared to $3.9 billion in October).</p>
<p>Available in more than 650 U.S. cities, goPuff delivers a wide variety of products in under 30 minutes while charging a flat $1.95 delivery fee. Rafael Ilishayev and Yakir Gola, who serve as co-CEOs, founded the company in 2013 while they were students at Drexel University. When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gopuff-funding/">I first spoke to Gola last fall</a>, he told me that the pair thought, &#8220;There has to be a better way to get convenience products delivered.”</p>
<p>The company now says its vertically integrated approach is a key advantage. GoPuff buys products directly from manufacturers, then distributes those products through its 250-plus &#8220;micro-fulfillment centers&#8221; and a network of independent drivers. Ilishayev said this results in rapid deliveries, strong unit economics, and a model that passes delivery fees directly to drivers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important that we&#8217;re making our margin on product, not people,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>The company continues to expand its product lineup new Better For You (healthy snacks), Beauty and Baby categories, as well as<a href="https://gopuff.com/mystery_box"> Curated Mystery Boxes</a>. When I asked how new products fit into the larger goPuff brand and strategy, Ilishayev replied, &#8220;People, throughout our whole existence, have tried to put us into an industry: &#8216;Are you convenience? Are you pharmacy?&#8217; The reality is that we&#8217;re neither. We&#8217;re in this category of instant needs, and our production innovation solely stems from consumer demand &#8230; There&#8217;s no category we offer on goPuff that consumers weren&#8217;t crying out for.&#8221;</p>
<p>GoPuff says that the new funding will allow it to continue expanding throughout the United States, as well as internationally, and to introduce new products. The round comes from D1 Capital Partners, Fidelity Management and Research Company, Baillie Gifford, Eldridge, Reinvent Capital, Luxor Capital and SoftBank Vision Fund 1.</p>
<p>In a statement, D1 founder and Chief Investment Officer Daniel Sundheim said:</p>
<blockquote><p>goPuff is truly in a league of its own. We believe that the company&#8217;s vision and differentiated model drive industry-leading economics and sustainable growth. Since we initially invested in goPuff last fall, we have been consistently impressed by the team’s ability to successfully execute against its growth plans. The company&#8217;s potential is tremendous, and we look forward to the unique opportunities that lie ahead.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a few twists and turns and then ultimately cancelling its F8 developer conference last year over Covid-19 concerns, Facebook today announced a return of the event in a virtual-only format it is calling F8 Refresh. The company today said that it will be holding it as a <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2021/03/23/join-us-f8-refresh-june-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-day event on June 2</a>. You can sign up for F8 Refresh <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/f8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mark of the times to be right-sizing everything to the place we are in right now. So although F8 has grown in size and scope over the years &#8212; it typically attracts around 5,000 people and many more to its in-person event &#8212; it looks like the social network is taking 2021 to be a little more modest in its approach.</p>
<p>Mark is maybe the operative word here: there will be no Mark Zuckerberg keynote this year, Facebook has confirmed to me, although it&#8217;s undecided if he will be making any appearance. Instead of words from its founder and CEO, Facebook will have Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, VP of Platform Partnerships, delivering the opening presentation at the event, which will as usual provide some updates on new launches for the platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s another sign of the times that making plans so far in advance, and in person, just won&#8217;t cut it right now: there have been too many unexpected developments around the spread, then wane, then resurgence of the pandemic, and even one year later, in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-56486732" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple parts</a> of the world authorities are still trying to get activity <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/21/us/miami-beach-curfew-spring-break.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">under control</a> to keep the virus in <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-boris-johnson-warns-europes-third-wave-will-hit-uk-but-is-reassured-eu-doesnt-want-jabs-blockade-12253582" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check</a>.</p>
<p>In the past, Facebook has given much more lead time to people for F8, to let developers, partners and other attendees to clear their calendars and organize travel from further afield. Its 2020 two-day event, which had originally been scheduled for May 2020, was announced in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/facebook-announces-dates-for-its-2020-f8-developers-conference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 2019</a> for example. Of course, in the months following, as Covid-19 took its grip, F8 2020 became one of a wave of events to be cancelled, with Facebook first looking to replace it with a series of local events, but then cancelling everything altogether.</p>
<p>&#8220;F8 has always brought together an incredible community of people who are building, innovating, and looking for what’s next. And over the last year, our community of developers enabled growth for businesses of all sizes to adapt to a changed world and accelerate their digital transformation,&#8221; noted Papamiltiadis in a blog post. &#8220;In recognition of this, we want to bring F8 back to its roots: a place to celebrate, inspire and help developers grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The big question will be what topics Facebook will see fit to tackle in June. Some of the bigger themes hanging over it right now are how it plans to continue growing in developing markets, whether/what it will launch in response to newly rising apps like Clubhouse, how it might diversify its business model beyond advertising, whether we will ever see a launch of Novi and Diem, and how Facebook continues to tackle misuse on its platform.</p>
<p>For a company so huge and influential, there is indeed a lot to potentially cover. But at least for now the focus seems to be more modest as well. Rather than big launches and major announcements, it looks like Facebook will keep the F8 focus more on its ecosystem and the developers in it. Among the areas that Papamiltiadis highlighted will be addressed, he mentioned product tools for building in Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and Oculus; technical deep-dive sessions; demos, and panels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.tracehq.com/">Trace</a>, an early startup that wants to bring a taste of SaaS to the finance side of the house, announced an $8 million seed round today led by Greylock and Uncork Capital with participation from Nyca Partners, Redpoint Ventures and various individual angels.</p>
<p>Mike Gonzalez, co-founder and CEO at the company describes Trace as the first service designed specifically for finance teams to interact with the rest of the business and involves budgeting, accounting, procurement and other tasks. &#8220;What Trace is really building is an all-in-one platform where financial decisions are made, and people can work with finance to get work done,&#8221; he explained</p>
<p>Trace handles all the core interactions between finance and everyone they need to work with in the business, focusing on budget owners. &#8220;In our platform, budget owners are given visibility into their financial targets, so they know what they&#8217;re working towards,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea is to build a more coordinated workflow between all the stakeholders in the process including finance, the department head, legal, security operations and so forth. Instead of cobbling together a bunch of different tools, Trace is attempting to bring this process into a single service.</p>
<p>Gonzalez has a deep background in this area having spent several years building custom financial systems as a consultant, and later working at Zenefits to build an internal system to track this kind of financial information. He took that knowledge, and along with his co-founders built Trace.</p>
<p>The company launched in 2018 and debuted the service in 2020. Although the pandemic has been challenging on a personal and company-building level, it did expose how important having a grip on the financial side of the business was when every penny counts.</p>

<p>For now the startup is taking aim at companies with between 200 and 1500 employees with hopes of ramping up to larger companies over time. Trace currently works with Sage Intacct, Netsuite and QuickBooks ERP financial systems.</p>
<p>It has a dozen employees, mostly in R&amp;D with plans to add to that number as the business grows. As a Hispanic, who co-founded the company with his brother, he says that D&amp;I is a cornerstone of his company building plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re both Hispanics, and we grew up in rough neighborhoods without privilege. And so promoting an environment of equal opportunity and inclusion is something that I care deeply about,&#8221; he said. He says that they have already begun to invest to drive diversity and it&#8217;s a huge priority for the company moving forward.</p>
<p>The company has been distributed from the beginning, so the pandemic didn&#8217;t really change that, but as it grows, Gonzalez envisions having an office where people can come together for more collaborative work as needed.</p>
