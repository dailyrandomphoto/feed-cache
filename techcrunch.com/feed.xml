										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Globally, food and grocery delivery startups have been raising mega-rounds of late, especially those in Europe as the pandemic has given rise to more people ordering online more than ever. This growth has translated to an increase in volume across e-commerce platforms all over the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">relatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> been no action in Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raising investments, startups in MENA continue to garner interest, mainly in B2B e-commerce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Today, the latest of these is coming out of Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.maxab.io/">MaxAB</a>, a startup based out of Cairo that serves a network of traditional food and grocery retailers across Egypt, has raised $40 million in Series A financing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which claims to have launched in a new city every month this year, will be expanding its physical footprint across the Middle East and North Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, MaxAB plans on hiring more talent and scaling its recently launched business verticals, including new supply chains and embedded finance solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in November 2018 by <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/belal-el-megharbel-34718023">Belal El-Megharbel</a> and <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-ben-halim-46072511a">Mohamed Ben Halim</a>, MaxAB&#8217;s platform manages procurement and grocery delivery to shops in Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Store owners can use the platform to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> goods, request delivery or logistics to move the goods, and access a customer support team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the technology platform; we operate our own warehouses, we operate our own fleet. And the idea was quite simple.&#8221;  CEO El-Megharbel said to TechCrunch. According to him, small merchants in Egypt, representing a large chunk of the nation&#8217;s GDP, find it hard to procure their inventory. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, manufacturers also have to suffer </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">immensely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and incur so many costs to serve a market like Egypt, where over 400,000 small mom-and-pop shops sell 90% of groceries in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We saw that there is a massive role in optimizing this supply chain using technology so that we can have the right amount of products at the right place at the right time,&#8221; explained El-Megharbel, the chief executive who left Careem in 2018 to start MaxAB</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He calls MaxAB the Amazon for retail in the Middle East. There&#8217;s a slight comparison. In emerging markets, it can be challenging to find third-party e-commerce delivery companies to work with. Those available are either expensive or inefficient. This is why MaxAB has its own infrastructure. The company doesn&#8217;t build warehouses from scratch. Instead, it buys them </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">outrightly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and revamps them to fit its needs. After that, MaxAB uses internal technology tools to better manage inventory flow in, within, and out of the warehouse.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MaxAB raises $6M seed round to optimize Egypt’s B2B grocery markets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/maxab-raises-6m-seed-round-to-optimize-egypts-b2b-grocery-markets/embed/#?secret=7cwzVem0yx" data-secret="7cwzVem0yx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">El-Megharbel noted that up until last year, MaxAB </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was focused</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on offering a single type of supply chain in one city. That was before and after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/maxab-raises-6m-seed-round-to-optimize-egypts-b2b-grocery-markets/">completing its $6.2 million seed round</a> with 9,000 merchants on its app. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with this new round, MaxAB solidifies both infrastructure and technology into a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multi-supply</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> chain and multi-city business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new development is accompanying a period of growth the company experienced in the last two years where it now services more than 55,000 merchants and delivers over 2,000 unique products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> staff size, the company has grown more than 5x to 1,600 people and is looking to add to that number.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about the embedded finance solutions, the plan for MaxAB is to offer financial services to its merchants. First of all, given the company&#8217;s database of merchants, MaxAB can predict their financial status. Then orking with banking and non-banking partners, MaxAB will offer credit facilities and capital financing to these merchants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MaxAB&#8217;s Series A investment is one of the largest in this financing round across the MENA region. Impact investor <a href="https://www.rmbv.net/">RMBV</a> led the round </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with participation from the</span><a href="https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/Topics_Ext_Content/IFC_External_Corporate_Site/Venture+Capital"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">IFC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://flourishventures.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Flourish Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="http://crystalstreamcap.cn/en"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Crystal Stream</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="http://www.risecapital.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Rise Capital,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://endeavor.org/catalyst/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Endeavour Catalyst.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Exiting investors,</span><a href="https://becocapital.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Beco Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.4dxventures.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">4DX Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also took part. This round brings the company’s total investment to date to $46.2 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the unique structure of Egypt’s economy, with hundreds of thousands of shopkeepers and small businesses becoming the lifeline of our country at the time of crisis,” said managing partner at RMBV Ahmed Badreldin in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are delighted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be backing visionary entrepreneurs that have created a transformative business with impressive growth that is a catalyst for financial inclusion and job creation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We look forward to supporting MaxAB in its next phase of development as they continue delivering on growth and innovation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> increased technology adoption and enhanced the company&#8217;s unit economics. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a market leader, MaxAB has taken advantage to consolidate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its position and scale </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sustainably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amidst competition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is competitiveness in the Middle East. Most of them are marketplace models but do not manage their supply chain per se. And this is what makes our model more unique is that we own the end-to-end cycle. It&#8217;s painful, but </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that this is what this industry, the food and groceries B2B e-commerce space, needs,&#8221; the CEO said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After expanding across MENA, does the company see any opportunity southward into sub-Saharan Africa where it might face competition from the likes of Sokowatch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the near future,&#8221; answered El-Megharbel. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this market [the Middle East and North Africa] is almost $200 billion per year. So we have a long way to go there before we go to sub-Saharan Africa.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Furlenco, a Bangalore-based startup that operates an eponymous furniture and appliance rental service, said today it has raised $140 million in a financing round as it looks to scale its operations in the South Asian market and explore international market expansion.</p>
<p>The new $140 million financing round, a Series D, comprises $120 million debt raise and rest in equity, the seven-year-old Indian startup told TechCrunch. The new financing round was led by Zinnia Global Fund. CE-Ventures and Lightbox Ventures also participated in this round, which brings its to-date debt and equity raise to over $240 million, according to data insight platform Tracxn.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.furlenco.com">Furlenco</a>, which operates in more than a dozen Indian cities, allows customers to rent a range of furniture items. In recent quarters, it has expanded to other categories including fitness equipments, appliances, electronic products, as well as two-wheeler vehicles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2173494 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/furlenco-website.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="425" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/furlenco-website.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/furlenco-website.jpg?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/furlenco-website.jpg?resize=300,128 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/furlenco-website.jpg?resize=768,326 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/furlenco-website.jpg?resize=680,289 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/furlenco-website.jpg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>A queen size bed on the platform, for instance, starts at as low as $9 a month, while a laptop can be rented for as low as a monthly plan of $40. The startup has attracted customers in part because of its three-day delivery commitment, and deep cleaning of items at no additional cost. It also maintains a partnership with NoBroker, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/indias-nobroker-raises-an-additional-30m-from-general-atlantic/">a General Atlantic-backed Indian startup</a> that helps customers avoid brokers when finding new apartments.</p>
<p>The expansion into newer categories helped the startup recover and preserve 95% of its revenue in the financial year that ended in March this year, it said. Lightbox Ventures said Furlenco may explore expansion into Middle East and other international markets.</p>
<p>The startup, which competes with Rentomojo, said it will deploy the fresh capital to fuel its growth and also invest in design and also work to generate an annual revenue of $300 million in the next five years.</p>
<p>“Lifestyles have evolved and so have the needs of the urban Indian when it comes to how they do up their home. However, the furniture industry has some catching up to do in providing the right kind of solutions. We know there is immense strength and scope of innovation in the B2C commerce space and the sectors we operate in. We are tapping into that potential and will definitely disrupt the market with what we are planning,” said Ajith Mohan Karimpana, founder and chief executive of Furlenco, in a statement.</p>
<p>Rent platforms, like many others, saw a major dip last year when the coronavirus hit the country. But the market it&#8217;s going after remains a big opportunity. According to industry estimates, the rental furniture and appliance industry is currently worth over $4.5 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to partner with Furlenco, which is rapidly transforming Furniture subscription services for India&#8217;s lifestyle aspirants. As an industry leader with a strong management team, Furlenco is poised for continued strong growth,” said Ritesh Abbi, Zinnia Global Fund.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China has ordered app-store operators to remove the app of Didi from their stores, the latest as tension escalates between the nation’s largest ride-hailing giant and local regulators. The app has disappeared from several stores including Apple’s App Store in China, TechCrunch can confirm.</p>
<p>The nation’s cyberspace administration, which unveiled the order on Sunday, said Didi was illegally collecting users’ personal data.</p>
<p>The ride-hailing giant, which counts Apple, SoftBank, and Tencent and Uber among its investors and filed for an IPO late last month, has been ordered to make changes to comply with Chinese data protection rules.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The move comes after the Chinese internet watchdog <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/chinese-cybersecurity-probe-validates-didis-pre-ipo-warning-to-investors/">announced a probe into Didi over “national security” concerns</a> earlier this week. Didi raised at least $4 billion this week after the New York Stock Exchange debut in one of the largest U.S. IPOs.</p>
<p>In a statement, Didi said it had removed its app from various app stores and begun the “corrections.” It also said it had halted new user registrations on Saturday. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For existing users, the Didi app remains operational.</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s very rare for an app of this scale to be pulled from the app stores. For the 12 months ended March, Didi served 493 million annual active users and saw 41 million transactions on a daily basis, it revealed recently.</p>
<p>The app had 156 million monthly users in Q1, well above Uber’s 98 million in the period.China’s official data showed the country had 365 million ride-hailing users as of December, which suggests Didi commands a substantial market share.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h3><strong>Android App Bundles are now going to be required</strong></h3>
<p>This week Google <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/the-future-of-android-app-bundles-is.html">announced</a> it will require new apps to be published using the Android App Bundle as of August 2021. The company first launched the Android App Bundle standard, which replaces the APK, in May 2018 as part of its modern development push. Since then, the majority of the top 1,000 apps and games have switched over to AABs including those from companies like Adobe, Duolingo. Gameloft, Netflix, reBus, Rainy, and Twitter. Today, there are over 1 million apps using AAB in production.</p>
<p>AABs solve some problems with the aging APK standard, particularly around larger apps and games. With AABs, developers don&#8217;t have to create an APK that contains everything for every type of Android device. They offer a way to quickly and more efficiently download the assets needed for a particular device, and they do so in a way that focuses on getting the user or player to the app or game&#8217;s content as fast as possible.</p>
<p>But not everyone agrees the change is for the better. Those who utilize APK Hosting sites like APKMirror or APKPure to download and share apps worry that the shift to AAB is a way to force users to use the Play Store instead of alternatives. Meanwhile, Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney &#8212; who is taking on tech giants over their alleged app store monopolies with both lawsuits and lobbying &#8212; pointed out that the move away from the more open APK standard is about locking users into Google Play.</p>

<h3>Consumer Spending on apps hits record $64.9B in the first half of the year</h3>
<p>Consumer spending in mobile apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/consumer-spending-on-apps-hit-record-64-9b-in-first-half-of-2021-but-install-growth-slowed-to-1-7/">hit a record </a>$64.9 billion during the first half of 2021, according to preliminary data from app store intelligence firm Sensor Tower. This figure represents a 24.8% increase in spending seen across both the App Store and Google Play, compared with the year-ago period. But while industry experts believe the accelerated shift to mobile fueled by the pandemic is a trend that will continue, it’s worth noting that — despite the new record — the growth rate for consumer spending has slightly slowed, and the download growth slowed more dramatically.</p>
<p>From the first half of 2019 to the first half of 2020, consumer spending on mobile apps grew 28.4% from $40.5 billion to $52 billion, for comparison — slower than the 24.8% seen in the current period.</p>

<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Apple launched the public betas of iOS 15, iPadOS 15 and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/with-watchos-8-apple-wants-to-help-you-chill-the-hell-1847195000?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">watchOS 8</a></strong>. Although developers already had access to early builds, this week was the first time the public could get their hands on Apple&#8217;s latest software before its official launch this fall. One of the biggest changes in <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/">iOS 15</a> is the addition of &#8220;Focus&#8221; modes that give users more control over when and who can bother them with calls, texts and notifications during different contexts &#8212; like work, driving, sleeping, and more. Users will also gain access to SharePlay interactivity on FaceTime, iMessage improvements, the ability to FaceTime with Android friends via web links, spatial audio, Live Text (which unlocks info from your photos), app privacy reports, and upgrades to most of Apple&#8217;s core apps, and more.</p>

<h3>Platforms: Google</h3>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Google is implementing stronger security measures on Google Play developer accounts in an attempt to crack down on spam and other malicious apps. </strong>Previously, the company required only an email and phone number to create a Google Play developer account. Now it <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/play-dev-id-requirements-2-step.html">will require</a> an account type (personal or organization), a contact name and physical address, and it will require developers to verify their email and phone number. Google says the changes will allow it to better communicate with developers and will help to &#8220;make sure that every account is created by a real person with real contact details.&#8221; It&#8217;s also now mandating that users of Google Play Console sign in using Google’s 2-Step Verification.</p>
<p><strong>Samsung and Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/samsung-and-google-detail-wearable-platform-ahead-of-next-galaxy-watch-launc">previewed</a> their wearable platform ahead of the next Galaxy Watch launch.</strong> The two companies agreed to partner on wearables in order to better compete against Apple Watch. At Mobile World Congress, <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/mwc-2021-samsung-new-one-ui-watch-experience/">Samsung showed off</a> the first device to feature the One UI Watch user experience and the new unified platform built in partnership with Google.</p>
<h3>E-commerce</h3>
<p><strong>Instagram <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/amplifying-black-owned-businesses-on-instagram/">adds a new feature</a> that will allow businesses in the U.S. to designate themselves as being Black-owned businesses</strong> using badges that appear on their profiles and on their product shopping pages. It may also be highlighted in places like the Shop tab, to help more potential customers discover the business.</p>
<p><strong>Walmart <a href="https://adage.com/article/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news/walmart-ibotta-digital-deal-loyalty-program-rebates/2347221">partnered</a> with mobile couponing app Ibotta on a multi-year deal that will offer cash-back rewards to Walmart customers</strong> that will be applied directly to customers&#8217; Walmart accounts, where they can be used for future purchases. The offers will be made available on Walmart.com and inside the Walmart mobile app.</p>
<p><strong>Following Apple and Google&#8217;s lead, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/shopify-drops-its-app-store-commissions-to-0-on-developers-first-million-in-revenue">Shopify dropped App Store commissions</a></strong>. However, it&#8217;s dropping its cut to 0% for the first million, and then will only take a 15% commission on &#8220;marginal&#8221; revenue above that $1 million. The change could increase pressure on other app stores to make further adjustments to their models in the future.</p>
<h3>Augmented Reality</h3>
<p><strong>Rakuten <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/viber-lenses-powered-by-snap-debut/">Viber has partnered with Snap</a> to bring augmented reality Lenses from Snapchat to its own Viber calling and messaging app</strong>. The over 30 Lenses will be built using Snap&#8217;s creative tools, including Bitmoji, Camera Kit, and Creative Kit and will offer AR-enabled messaging and photos to Viber&#8217;s users. The deal is another example of how Snap is growing its licensing business for its AR and creative tools alongside the development of its own social app.</p>
<p><strong>Google&#8217;s Arts &amp; Culture app <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2021/07/bringing-artworks-to-life-with-ar.html">created</a> a new feature called Art Filter that allows everyone to learn about significant pieces of art from around the world and put themselves inside famous paintings</strong> using AR. Google talked this week about its work with MediaPipe to utilize their face mesh and 3D face transform tech to create custom effects for each of the artifacts chosen.</p>
<h3>Fintech</h3>
<p><strong>Venmo introduced a new feature that allows users to add a &#8220;good and services&#8221; tag to payments sent to personal accounts to differentiate them from personal transactions.</strong> The system is meant to protect buyers and sellers, Venmo says. Buyers on these transactions will be eligible for Venmo&#8217;s Purchase Protection Program, but <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/6/28/22554305/venmo-small-businesses-toggle-paypal-account-fees-transactions">sellers are unable with the new fees</a> associated with the change as Venmo will now deduct 1.9% of the transaction plus 10 cents from the money sent to the seller.</p>
<p><strong>Intuit-owned finance and budgeting app Mint <a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/articles/mint-app-now-lets-you-track-crypto-investments/">added the ability</a> to track cryptocurrency investments across a number of supported exchanges,</strong> including Binance, BlockFi, Coinbase/Coinbase Pro, Gemini, Kraken, PayPal, and Robinhood. As a result, the app shot to No. 12 overall on the U.S. App Store on Wednesday and became the No. 1 app in the Finance category, though it has since dropped in ranking.</p>
<h3>Social</h3>
<p><strong>TikTok is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiktok-expands-max-video-length-to-3-minutes-up-from-60-seconds">expanding its max video length</a> to 3 minutes, up from 60 seconds</strong>, after testing this feature publicly for many months with a select group of creators. The feature will allow for more long-form video content, potentially making TikTok even more of a threat to YouTube.</p>
<p><strong>Pinterest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/pinterest-updates-policy-to-prohibit-ads-promoting-weight-loss/">bans weight loss ads</a> on its platform, becoming the first major social platform to take this sort of action</strong>. The company says social media plays a role in promoting harmful beauty standards, and ads that glorify weight loss contribute to a rise in disordered eating behaviors rather than healthy habits.</p>
<p><strong>Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/instagram-is-developing-its-own-version-of-twitters-super-follow-with-exclusive-stories/">is developing its own version</a> of Twitter&#8217;s Super Follow with &#8220;Exclusive Stories.</strong>&#8221; Instagram confirmed that the screenshots of an &#8220;Exclusive Stories&#8221; feature recently circulated across social media are from an internal prototype that’s now in development, but not yet being publicly tested. The feature would allow creators to offer Stories that only members (likely paying subscribers) would be able to see. These would appear on their profile in different colors and would display a message that their Story was only for members when others tried to view them. They could also be saved as Highlights, and can&#8217;t be screenshot, according to the leaks.</p>

<p><strong>TikTok&#8217;s latest <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktoks-q-1-2021-community-guidelines-enforcement-report">transparency report</a> revealed the company removed 11,149,514 accounts in Q1 2021 for violating community guidelines or terms of service</strong>, which is fewer than 1% of total accounts. Of those removals, 7,263,952 were accounts belonging to children under 13.</p>
<p><strong>Trump and Parler reportedly discussed a deal that would move the bulk of Trump&#8217;s social media presence to the right-wing Twitter alternative</strong>, according to <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/michael-wolff-landslide-final-days-trump-presidency-excerpt.html">New York Magazine</a>. The deal would have seen Trump taking 40% of Parler&#8217;s revenues had it gone through. Parler was okay with the rev share, but wouldn&#8217;t ban Trump&#8217;s critics from the app, which scuttled the deal, the report said.</p>
<p><strong>Instagram <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555434/instagram-link-sticker-post-test-swipe-up">is testing a feature</a> that would allow anyone to be able to share a link directly in their Stories through a linking sticker,</strong> which would work the same way the swipe-up links currently do. The company said the test is looking to understand how many people would use links, if available.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter offered users a chance to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/twitter-is-making-nfts-now-apparently">receive one of seven free NFTs</a> this week,</strong> which were minted on Rarible in editions of 20, making for 140 NFTs (get it?) in total. The NFTs were offered to those who replied to a post from the company&#8217;s main Twitter account, and could signal Twitter&#8217;s plans to invest in making NFTs more a part of its platform in the future.</p>

<h3>Messaging</h3>
<p><strong>AT&amp;T joined T-Mobile in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556686/att-android-phones-rcs-google-messages">switching its customers </a>to use the Android Messages app as their default mobile messages app for both SMS and RCS services</strong>, making Verizon the only U.S. carrier that has not made a partnership deal with Google. RCS has a lot of advantages over SMS, including no character limits, the ability to send larger files, typing indicators, better group chat, Wi-Fi support and end-to-end encryption for one-on-one group chats. This makes it a more compelling alternative to Apple&#8217;s iMessage, but it requires carrier adoption.</p>
<p><strong>Audio chat comes to the workplace as Slack this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/slacks-new-video-and-voice-tools-are-nod-to-changing-face-of-work/">released a new audio tool called Slack Huddles</a> that allows users to have real-time conversations with colleagues in Slack&#8217;s app instead of typing</strong>. The company also offered more details about an upcoming feature that allows users to leave video messages and it showed off an upgraded employee directory. The video messages tool is being piloted while the directory is currently available to a limited number of Business + and Enterprise Grid customers.</p>
<p><strong>The U.K. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/uk-tells-messaging-apps-not-to-use-e2e-encryption-for-kids-accounts/">issued guidance</a> to messaging apps operating in the country to not use end-to-end encryption on children&#8217;s accounts, asking companies to consider the risks that e2e poses to younger users</strong>, as it makes it more difficult to identify illegal and harmful content that takes place on private channels. A government spokesperson stressed that there&#8217;s a way to implement strong encryption in a way that&#8217;s consistent with public safety. Privacy activists disagree with this stance.</p>

<p><strong>Telegram <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22551652/telegram-adds-group-video-calling-chat">rolled out group video calls</a> to its mobile and desktop apps after initially promising the feature was coming back in April 2020.</strong> The company says group video calls are limited to up to 30 people but it plans to increase that limit in the future.</p>
<p><strong>WhatsApp is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/27/whatsapp-ios-voice-message-feature/">testing a redesigned voice message feature</a> that will show short waveforms when the user is recording the message.</strong> After recording, the user can stop and listen to their message before sending it, too.</p>
<h3>Dating</h3>
<p><strong>Dating app Bumble is <a href="https://adage.com/article/marketing-news-strategy/dating-app-bumble-will-open-its-first-cafe-new-york-july/2347286">planning to open its first cafe in New York</a> later this month. The launch was originally planned for 2019, but was delayed due to the pandemic</strong>. The new venue, Bumble Brew, is being enabled by a partnership between the dating app maker and Italian restaurant <a href="https://www.pasqualejones.com/">Pasquale Jones</a>. Decked out in Bumble&#8217;s yellow, the new cafe will open next to the restaurant, to offer a place for daters to meet for either coffee, cocktails or a meal.</p>
<h3>Streaming &amp; Entertainment</h3>
<p><strong>Netflix users on Android devices will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22551099/netflix-partial-download-feature">now be able to start streaming</a> titles that have only partially downloaded</strong>, which could help in the scenario where you&#8217;ve forgotten to download your favorite shows before boarding a plane. Before, until the download completed, you couldn&#8217;t watch any portion of the video at all.</p>
<p><strong>Chinese TikTok rival Kuaishou and Tencent <a href="https://variety.com/2021/sports/news/kuaishou-tokyo-beijing-olympics-rights-1235007730/">acquired the short-form rights</a> to the upcoming Tokyo and 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics from state broadcaster CCTV</strong>. This makes the app the first short-form and livestreaming platform globally to become an official broadcaster of the Olympics.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon Music Unlimited is <a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/amazon-music-unlimited-subscribers-get-up-to-6-months-of-disney-for-free/">giving subscribers</a> up to six months of Disney+ for free</strong> (or three for existing subscribers). Disney&#8217;s isn&#8217;t the first to bundle a streaming deal with music. Hulu and Spotify had once done the same.</p>
<p><strong>Spotify <a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/news-and-insights/spotify-audience-network-global-launch/?">launched</a> its Spotify Audience Network ad marketplace to advertisers and Megaphone publishers in Australia, Canada and the U.K., following its U.S. launch in February</strong>.

<h3>Travel</h3>
<p><strong>App Annie spots signs of a pandemic recovery in <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/mobile-market-pandemic-recovery-signs/">its Q2 2021 report</a>, noting in particular a rebound in travel apps.</strong> The firm found that monthly hours spent in Travel and Navigations apps are on an upward trend in markets like the U.S. and the U.K., where the rollout of vaccinations has been strong. South Korea is seeing an even better recovery, as time spent in travel apps has surpassed pre-pandemic levels. Travel apps in Brazil, France and India, however, have not yet reached pre-pandemic levels.</p>

<h3>Security &amp; Privacy</h3>
<p>Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/stronger-security-for-your-twitter-account">users now have the option</a> to use security keys as their only form of two-factor authentication (2FA), which the company notes is the most effective way to keep your Twitter account secure. Twitter has offered the option to use security keys as one of its 2FA options since 2018. However, this initial support only worked for Twitter.com, not the mobile app, and required users to have another form of 2FA enabled, too.</p>

<p><strong>The new <a href="https://brickit.app/">Brickit</a> mobile app is a Lego fan&#8217;s dream and an impressive use of computer vision technology</strong>. The app is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/lego-should-snap-up-this-rapid-fire-brick-finding-ios-app/">able to quickly analyze a pile of Legos</a> to identify which bricks you have in your collection. It then serves up some projects where you have all, or at least most of, the bricks you need to build. The process is very fast, too &#8212; the app makes sense of hundreds of bricks in your pile within just seconds. Brickit doesn&#8217;t come from Lego directly, however, which limits some of its capabilities in terms of integrating with Lego&#8217;s larger library of instructions. But, in time, it will likely generate some data on the Lego collections users have at home which could make it an interesting acquisition target for Lego, in addition to the tech itself.</p>

Hinge Health co-founder Daniel Perez alleges that the board member did not notify him before they led a round in an early-stage startup in the same sector.</p>
<p>The situation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/bessemer-replaces-board-member-at-hinge-health-following-competitive-tensions/">gives a rare and nuanced peek</a> into the world of competitive tension between startups. While founders expect certain standards of conduct from investors, including that they notify them of investments in directly competitive startups, investors may be feeling more pressure to make faster decisions that clash with the founders they’ve already backed, while having different definitions of competition from their portfolios. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/in-a-post-nda-world-does-transparency-help-founders-identify-conflicts-of-interest/">In a post-NDA world</a>, the rules need to be rewritten around how to have these conversations.</p>
<p>I’m not quite sure if more due diligence is the solution to everyone’s woes — but I do think transparency and explicitness between founders and investors can’t hurt. It’s not just for founders. Investors, who owe returns to their LPs, don’t want to be in situations where they can’t invest in a booming sector because they have one other investment in the sector.</p>
<p>The situations are endless:</p>
<ul>
<li>What happens when a startup pivots into a different market than the one that it sold its investors on and is suddenly competitive with a portfolio company?</li>
<li>What if a portfolio company’s future roadmap includes a go-to-market strategy that clashes with a potential investment?</li>
<li>Can a Sequoia India partner back a company that is directly competing with a Sequoia India company?</li>
<li>Is it okay for there to be competing investments within the same firm as long as different partners are sitting on the board?</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on my DMs, Hinge Health isn’t alone in dealing with current investors backing competitors. It adds an asterisk to the barrage of funding rounds. Welcome to hot due diligence summer, I guess?</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll get into the Duolingo S-1, a creator economy rebrand and an exclusive interview with top startup marketers.

<p>Duolingo, a language-learning unicorn last valued at $2.4 billion, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/duolingo-s-1/?tpcc=ECTW2020">filed to go public this week.</a> Beyond the flurry of puns — <a href="https://twitter.com/mistahwoodhouse/status/1409902160515670017">thanks to this reader for today’s subhed</a> — the S-1 gave us a sneak peak into the financials of a rare edtech company ambitious enough to list on the stock market.</p>

The document also exposed a number of other fun factoids, such as the fact that only four people left the company in 2020 — and that Duolingo is indeed looking to scoop up some companies.</p>

<p>On Equity this week, Alex and I brought on techie comedian Alexis Gay <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/dear-economy-creators-arent-fragile-plants/?tpcc=ECTW2020">to talk about the creator economy. </a></p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>Gay went from helping creators via her role at Patreon to becoming a creative herself. We talked about pet peeves, why it’s important to be explicit when building tools for this economy, and if rolling funds are inevitable for anyone with a Twitter following. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/dear-economy-creators-arent-fragile-plants/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Check out the episode</a>, which I’d say is one of our funniest to date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the first time, researchers have mapped all the known targets, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/20/citizen-lab-iphone-nso-group/">journalists, activists, and human rights defenders</a>, whose phones were hacked by Pegasus, a spyware developed by NSO Group.</p>
<p>Forensic Architecture, an academic unit at Goldsmiths, University of London that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/forensic-architecture-redeploys-surveillance-state-tech-to-combat-state-sponsored-violence/">investigates human rights abuses</a>, scoured dozens of reports from human rights groups, carried out open-source research and interviewed dozens of the victims themselves to reveal over a thousand data points, including device infections, which show relations and patterns between digital surveillance carried out by NSO&#8217;s government customers, and the real-world intimidation, harassment and violence that the victims are also subject to.</p>
<p>By mapping out these data points <a href="https://www.digitalviolence.org/#/platform">on a bespoke platform</a>, the researchers can show how nation-states, which use Pegasus to spy on their victims, also often target other victims in their networks and are entangled with assaults, arrests, and disinformation campaigns against the targets but also their families, friends, and colleagues.</p>
<p>Although the thousand-plus data points only present a portion of the overall use of Pegasus by governments, the project aims to provide researchers and investigators the tools and data of NSO&#8217;s activities worldwide, which the spyware maker goes to great lengths to keep out of the public eye.</p>
<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
<blockquote><p>Pegasus &#8220;activates your camera, your microphone, all that which forms an integral part of your life.&#8221; <cite>Mexican journalist Carmen Aristegui</cite></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>Israel-based NSO Group develops Pegasus, a spyware that allows its government customers near-unfettered access to a victim&#8217;s device, including their personal data and their location. NSO has repeatedly declined to name its customers but reportedly has government contracts in at least 45 countries, said to include Rwanda, Israel, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and the United Arab Emirates — all of which have been accused of human rights abuses — as well as Western nations, like Spain.</p>
<p>Forensic Architecture&#8217;s researcher-in-charge Shourideh Molavi said the new findings reveal &#8220;the extent to which the digital domain we inhabit has become the new frontier of human rights violations, a site of state surveillance and intimidation that enables physical violations in real space.&#8221;</p>
<p>The platform presents visual timelines of how victims are targeted by both spyware and physical violence as part of government campaigns to target their most outspoken critics.</p>
<p>Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi video blogger and activist living in exile in Montreal, had his phone hacked in 2018 by the Pegasus malware. Shortly after Saudi emissaries tried to convince Abdulaziz to return  to the kingdom, his phone was hacked. Weeks later, two of his brothers in Saudi Arabia were arrested and his friends detained.</p>
<p>Abdulaziz, a confidant of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi whose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/us/politics/jamal-khashoggi-killing-cia-report.html">murder was approved</a> by Saudi&#8217;s <em>de facto </em>ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also had information about his Twitter account obtained by a &#8220;state-sponsored&#8221; actor, which later transpired to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/20/twitter-employee-saudi-state-sponsored-hacking-warning/">a Saudi spy employed by Twitter</a>. It was this stolen data, which included Abdulaziz&#8217;s phone number, that helped the Saudis penetrate his phone and read his messages with Khashoggi in real-time, Yahoo News <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/a-direct-trail-of-blood-drops-leads-from-a-twitter-hack-to-jamal-khashoggis-murder-090051087.html">reported</a> this week.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2173403" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2173403" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2173403 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/omar-abdulaziz.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="580" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/omar-abdulaziz.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/omar-abdulaziz.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/omar-abdulaziz.jpg?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/omar-abdulaziz.jpg?resize=768,435 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/omar-abdulaziz.jpg?resize=680,385 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/omar-abdulaziz.jpg?resize=1536,870 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/omar-abdulaziz.jpg?resize=2048,1161 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/omar-abdulaziz.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2173403" class="wp-caption-text">Omar Abdulaziz is one of dozens of known victims of digital surveillance by a nation state. Blue dots represent digital intrusions and red dots indicate physical events, such as harassment or violence. (Image: Forensic Architecture/supplied)</p></div></p>
<p>Mexican journalist Carmen Aristegui is another known victim, whose phone was hacked several times over 2015 and 2016 by a government customer of Pegasus, likely Mexico. The University of Toronto&#8217;s Citizen Lab found that her son, Emilio, a minor at the time, also <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2017/06/reckless-exploit-mexico-nso/">had his phone targeted</a> while he lived in the United States. The timeline of the digital intrusions against Aristegui, her son, and her colleagues show that the hacking efforts intensified following their exposure of corruption by Mexico&#8217;s then-president Enrique Peña Nieto.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a malware that activates your camera, your microphone, all that which forms an integral part of your life,&#8221; said Aristegui in an interview with journalist and filmmaker Laura Poitras, who contributed to the project. Speaking of her son whose phone was targeted, Aristegui said: &#8220;To know that a kid who is simply going about his life, and going to school tells us about the kinds of abuse that a state can exert without counterweight.&#8221; (NSO has repeatedly claimed it does not target phones in the United States, but offers a similar technology to Pegasus, dubbed Phantom, through U.S.-based subsidiary, Westbridge Technologies.)</p>
<p>&#8220;A phenomenal damage is caused to the journalistic responsibility when the state — or whoever — uses these systems of &#8216;digital violence&#8217;,&#8221; said Aristegui. &#8220;It ends up being a very damaging element for journalists, which affects the right of a society to keep itself informed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The platform also draws on recent findings from an Amnesty International investigation into NSO Group&#8217;s corporate structure, which shows how NSO&#8217;s spyware has proliferated to states and governments using a complex network of companies to hide its customers and activities. Forensic Architecture&#8217;s platform follows the trail of private investment since NSO&#8217;s founding in 2015, which &#8220;likely enabled&#8221; the sale of the spyware to governments that NSO would not ordinarily have access to because of Israeli export restrictions.</p>
<p>&#8220;NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware needs to be thought of and treated as a weapon developed, like other products of Israel’s military industrial complex, in the context of the ongoing Israeli occupation. It is disheartening to see it exported to enable human rights violations worldwide,&#8221; said Eyal Weizman, director of Forensic Architecture.</p>
<p>The platform launched shortly after NSO published its first so-called transparency report this week, which human rights defenders and security researchers panned as devoid of any meaningful detail. Amnesty International said the report reads &#8220;more like a sales brochure.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement, NSO Group said it cannot comment on research it has not seen, but claimed it &#8220;investigates all credible claims of misuse, and NSO takes appropriate action based on the results of its investigations.&#8221;</p>
<p>NSO Group maintained that its technology &#8220;cannot be used to conduct cybersurveillance within the United States, and no customer has ever been granted technology that would enable them to access phones with U.S. numbers,&#8221; and declined to name any of its government customers.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</em></a><em>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<p>Hey! It’s going to be a long weekend here in the United States, which means that this newsletter is in between myself and being done with work. So, we’re going to hit on even more topics than usual as I am a glutton for both punishment and writing. But I repeat myself.</p>
<p>Up first:<strong> Startups and culture.</strong></p>
<p>Something that I very much enjoyed this week was the Robinhood IPO filing. You can read our first look <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/robinhood-files-to-go-public-after-squeaking-to-profitability-in-2020/">here</a>, and a deeper dig into the numbers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/how-robinhoods-explosive-growth-rate-came-to-be/">here</a>. But today we’re going to riff on culture. Observe the following excerpts, the first from the company’s notes on its goals via <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1783879/000162828021013318/robinhoods-1.htm#ib5a32e8afc3b422193a2f2891a49e0c9_910">its S-1 filing</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over time, we strive to make Robinhood the most trusted, lowest cost, and most culturally relevant money app worldwide.</p></blockquote>
<p>Surprised that &#8220;culturally relevant<em>&#8220;</em> made it into the mix? Then check this out, from the prospectus’s overview section (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Cultural Impact. </strong>We pioneered commission-free stock trading with no account minimums, which the rest of the industry emulated, and <strong>we have continued to build relationships with our customers</strong> by introducing new products that further expand access to the financial system. <strong>We believe we have made investing culturally relevant and understandable</strong>, and that our platform is enabling our customers to become long-term investors and take greater control of their finances. <strong>Over half of 18-44 year olds in the United States know who Robinhood</strong> is according to an internal brand study that we conducted in March 2021. As a further sign of our relevance today, Robinhood reached the number-one spot on the Apple App Store multiple times in the first quarter of 2021 and was frequently ranked number one in the Finance category on the Apple App store during 2020 and the first quarter of 2021.</p></blockquote>
<p>The app store bragging is whatever. The focus on <em>culture</em> caught me up.</p>
<p>I’ve often enjoyed watching culture evolve more and more rapidly over time; TikTok further accelerated the trend. And amongst the youths of the world, I’d hazard, the line between brand and culture is blurring as brands work to move more and more into cultural territory. The Robinhood S-1 is forward-looking in a number of ways, but to see a company going public discuss culture in this manner feels like the future.</p>
<p>Up second: <strong>American manufacturing is not dead.</strong></p>
<p>That’s what The Exchange learned this week from a conversation with the CEO of Xometry. The company recently went public. You can read more of our notes on its numbers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/xometry-is-taking-its-excess-manufacturing-capacity-business-public/">here</a>, but like Robinhood the former startup raised lots of venture capital and this fits into our broader remit.</p>
<p>What doesn’t, really, is what we learned about manufacturing thanks to the chat. Per CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/randy_alt">Randy Altschuler</a>, his business of connecting companies in need of manufacturing with those able to build stuff is nearly an entirely U.S.-based business. That’s to say that, yes, there is still stuff made here in America.</p>
<p>What Xometry does is actually pretty cool &#8212; including offering financial services as part of its role as marketplace middleperson &#8212; but what got us the most hype was the idea that a digital service was going to help connect folks in need with folks with tools here in the United States. If Xometry’s vision of the future works out, it could help sustain, and dare we say grow, domestic manufacturing in this nation. Who would have thought that that was possible?</p>
<p>Xometry’s IPO was also a huge success, we should add. It priced above range, and then shot higher. That’s what you want as a company.</p>
<p>And third, <strong>some fun odds and ends:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More tech money in F1: </strong>Every race weekend in the Formula 1 calendar helps me notice yet another tech company putting money into racing’s most bonkers series. Zoom has a lot of branding out there, for example. And this week we <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/29/formula-1-strikes-100-million-cryptocurrency-sponsorship.html">got news</a> that Crypto.com has closed a five-year, $100-million deal with the racing league. That’s a lot of duckets. Notably Tezos already sponsors some teams, and you can spy both Amazon and Microsoft branding here and there in the series. Oh, and <a href="https://www.mclaren.com/racing/2021/mclaren-shadow-project/mclaren-racing-expands-splunk-partnership/">the Splunk-McLaren tie-up was just extended</a>. New life goal: Make lots of money, sponsor F1 team, get paddock access. What could possibly go wrong?</li>
<li><strong>Unqork</strong> has hired a CRO. Not a CFO, so we can’t make <em>too</em> many IPO noises concerning the no-code service that helps big companies build apps. But <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/unqork-chief-revenue-officer-philip-lacor-nocode-compete-legacy-software-2021-6">the news</a> still matters for you no-code fans.</li>
<li>Finally, Apptopia has <a href="https://blog.apptopia.com/top-downloaded-digital-banking-apps-us-h12021">download numbers</a> for neobanks. Can you guess which was number one?</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Until children reach a certain age, enrichment programs are somewhat limited to school, sports, and camps, while money-making opportunities are largely non-existent.</p>
<p>Now, a year-old, L.A.-based startup called <a href="https://mighty.business/">Mighty</a>, a kind of Shopify that invites younger kids to open a store online, aims to partly fill the void. In fact, Mighty &#8212; led by founders Ben Goldhirsh, who previously founded GOOD magazine, and Dana Mauriello, who spent nearly five years with Etsy and was most recently an advisor to Sidewalk Labs &#8212; hopes to woo families with the pitch that it operates at the center of fintech, ed tech, and entertainment.</p>
<p>As often happens, the concept derived from the founders&#8217; own experience. In this case, Goldhirsh, who has been living in Costa Rica, began worrying about his two daughters, who attend a small, six-person school. Because he feared they might fall behind their stateside peers, he began tutoring them when they arrived home, using Khan Academy among other software platforms. Yet the girls&#8217; reaction wasn&#8217;t exactly positive.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;They were like, &#8220;F*ck you, dad. We just finished school and now you&#8217;re going to make us do more school?'&#8221;</p>
<p>Unsure of what to do, he encouraged them to sell online the bracelets they&#8217;d been making, figuring it would teach them needed math skills, as well as teach them about startup capital, business plans (he made them write one), and marketing. It worked, he says, and as he told friends about this successful &#8220;project-based learning effort,&#8221; they began to ask if he could help <em>their</em> kids get up and running.</p>
<p>Fast forward and Goldhirsh and Mauriello &#8212; who ran a crowdfunding platform that Goldhirsh invested in before she joined Etsy &#8212; say they&#8217;re now steering a still-in-beta startup that has become home to 3,000 &#8220;CEOs&#8221; as Mighty calls them.</p>
<p>The interest isn&#8217;t surprising. Kids are spending more of their time online than at any point in history. Many of the real-world type businesses that might have once employed young kids are shrinking in size. Aside from babysitting or selling cookies on the corner, it&#8217;s also challenging to find a job before high school, given the Department of Labor’s <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/flsa">Fair Labor Standards Act</a>, which sets 14 years old as the minimum age for employment. (Even then, many employers worry that their young employees might be more work than is worth it.)</p>
<p>Investor think it&#8217;s a pretty solid idea, too. Mighty recently closed on $6.5 million in seed funding led by Animo Ventures, with participation from Maveron, Humbition, Sesame Workshop, Collaborative Fund and NaHCO3, a family office.</p>
<p>Still, building out a platform for kids is tricky. For starters, not a lot of 11-year-olds have the tenacity required to sustain their own business over time. While Goldhirsh likens the business to a &#8220;21st century lemonade stand,&#8221; running a business that doesn&#8217;t dissolve at the end of the afternoon is a very different proposition.</p>
<p>Goldhirsh acknowledges that no kid wants to hear they have to &#8220;grind&#8221; on their business or to follow a certain trajectory, and he says that Mighty is certainly seeing kids who show up for a weekend to make some money. Still, he insists, many others have an undeniably entrepreneurial spirit and says they tend to stick around.  In fact, says Goldhirsh, the company &#8212; aided by its new seed funding &#8212; has much to do in order to keep its hungriest young CEOs happy.</p>
<p>Many are frustrated, for example, that they currently can&#8217;t sell their own homemade items through Mighty. Instead, they are invited to sell items like customizable hats, totes, and stickers made by Mighty&#8217;s current manufacturing partner, <a href="https://www.printful.com/">Printful</a>, which then ships out the item to the end customer. (The Mighty user gets a percentage of the sale, as does Mighty.)</p>
<p>The budding tycoons on the platform can also sell items made by global artisans through a partnership that Mighty has struck with <a href="https://www.novica.com/">Novica</a>, an impact marketplace that also sells through National Geographic.</p>
<p>The idea was to introduce as little friction into the process as possible at the outset, but &#8220;our customers are pissed &#8212; they want more from us,&#8221; says Goldhirsh, explaining that Mighty fully intends to one day enable its smaller entrepreneurs to sell their own items, as well as offer services (think lawn care), which the platform also does not support currently.</p>
<p>As for how it makes money, in addition to collecting transaction-based revenue, Mighty plans to layer in subscription services eventually, even while it&#8217;s not prepared to discuss these publicly quite yet.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s intriguing, on the whole, though the startup could need to fend off established players like Shopify should it begin to gain traction. It&#8217;s also conceivable that parents &#8212; if not children&#8217;s advocates &#8212;  could push back on what Mighty is trying to do. Entrepreneurship can be alternately exhilarating and demoralizing after all; it&#8217;s a roller coaster some might not want kids to ride from such a young age.</p>
<p>Mauriello insists they haven&#8217;t had that kind of feedback to date. For one thing, she says, Mighty recently launched an online community where its young CEOs can encourage one another and trade sales tips, and she says they are actively engaging there.</p>
<p>She also argues that, like sports or learning a musical instrument, there are lessons to be learned by creating a store on Mighty. Storytelling and how to sell are among them, but as critically, she says, the company&#8217;s young customers are learning that &#8220;you can fail and pick yourself back up and try again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adds Goldhirsch, &#8220;There are definitely kids who are like, &#8216;Oh, this is harder than I thought it was going to be. I can&#8217;t just launch the site and watch money roll in.&#8217; But I think they like the fact that the success they are seeing they are earning, because we&#8217;re not doing it for them.&#8221;</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/department-of-justice-opens-investigation-into-ev-startup-lordstown-motors/"><strong>When SPACs attack:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The United States Department of Justice is investigating Lordstown Motors, the embattled EV company that went public via a SPAC. Detractors of the company have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/lordstown-motors-accused-of-faking-ev-truck-orders-by-short-seller-firm-hindenburg-research/">punched holes in the story it told before going public</a>, and the company’s SPAC deck has proven to be somewhat, well, disconnected from reality. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/dogs-of-lordstown/">company needs more money</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">it turns out</a>, despite having told investors that it would not. Whoops.</li>

American investors:</strong></a> Sticking to the theme of companies in trouble, Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi is in hot water with its own domestic regulators. The company has been told to halt new user registration, pending a cybersecurity review. Just <em>days</em> after it went public in the United States. Oof.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/jim-whitehurst-steps-down-as-president-at-ibm-just-14-months-after-taking-role/"><strong>IBM’s President steps down:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Jim Whitehurst, who made his way to IBM via its Red Hat deal, is out. His tenure as president at the firm lasted 14 months. Details were light on his exit, per <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller">Ron Miller</a> Yeesh.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Today’s startup news has a strong non-American bias. That’s because nearly everyone in the United States took most of today off, regardless of what their boss thought was going on. The rest of the world was still busy, however:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/indias-licious-raises-192-million-for-international-expansion/"><strong>Licious raises tasty $192M round:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The Bangalore-based meat and seafood e-commerce player has now raised through a <em>Series F</em>. A few years back we would have joked that the F in Series F stood for “failed to go public,” but that’s no longer the case. Why <em>not</em> raise a Series F when money is so cheap? The company is now worth more than $650 million, TechCrunch reports.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/swedish-gaming-giant-acquires-india-playsimple-for-360-million/"><strong>MTG buys PlaySimple for $360M:</strong></a> Why are investors betting so much money on the Indian startup ecosystem? Rising exit values, perhaps. TechCrunch noted that the sale of India’s PlaySimple to Swedish gaming giant was “one of the largest exits in the Indian startup ecosystem.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiger-global-leads-42m-series-b-in-nigerian-credit-led-neobank-fairmoney/"><strong>Tiger invests $40M into Nigerian neobank:</strong></a> It’s a big day for FairMoney, a Nigerian startup that has its genesis in offering consumers credit. It’s also yet another round for African fintech, a sector that has felt pretty active lately.</li>

<p>Did you hear about the CEO who made misleading claims about a funding round and got sued by the SEC? How about that pharmaceutical executive whose taunts to a former secretary of state led to a 4.4% decline in the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index?</p>
<p>In case it isn&#8217;t clear: Startup executives are held to a higher standard when it comes to what they post on social media.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reputation and goodwill take a long time to build and are difficult to maintain, but it only takes one tweet to destroy it all,&#8221; says Lisa W. Liu, a senior partner at The Mitzel Group, a San Francisco-based law practice that serves many startups.</p>
<p>To help her clients (and Extra Crunch readers) stay out of trouble, Liu has six basic questions for tech execs with itchy Twitter fingers.</p>
<p>And if the answer to any of them is “I don’t know,” don’t post.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Today’s Big Tech news is a mixed bag, but a fun one. And each story has a strong California hook. Let’s begin:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/gm-is-investing-in-a-california-lithium-extraction-project/"><strong>GM is investing in a California lithium extraction project:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Why? Batteries. Gotta have lithium to make batteries. No batteries, no electric cars. In this case the project is actually pretty neat, having a strong hook to Salton Sea Geothermal Field near Los Angeles in the southern part of the state. The geothermal field will provide power and materials. So perhaps electric cars’ pre-driving carbon footprint will be a bit more sustainable in the future.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/twitter-colorful-misinformation-labels/">Twitter tests more attention-grabbing misinformation labels:</a> </strong>Twitter, a <em>California-based company</em>, is making its misinformation labeling a bit more standout. It’s fun to watch social media companies make warnings sterner at the same time as Google is making advertisements better blend into its organic results.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/dutch-court-will-hear-another-facebook-privacy-lawsuit/">Dutch court will hear another Facebook privacy lawsuit:</a> </strong>A few Dutch nonprofits are suing Facebook over alleged “rampant collection of internet users’ data — arguing the company does not have a proper legal basis for the processing,” TechCrunch summarized. This case <em>seems</em> like it could have broad import, depending on how it shakes out. Given, you know, how much data collection goes on literally all the time, literally everywhere, online.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yesterday, China ordered ride-hailing company Didi to stop signing up new customers after regulators announced a cybersecurity review of the company&#8217;s operations.</p>
<p>As of this writing, Didi&#8217;s stock price is down 5.3%. In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/chinese-cybersecurity-probe-validates-didis-pre-ipo-warning-to-investors/">today&#8217;s edition of The Exchange</a>, Alex Wilhelm suggested that the move wasn&#8217;t a complete surprise, but it still &#8220;puts a bad taste in our mouths,&#8221; since the company went public days ago.</p>

<hr />
<p>When Didi filed to go public, it listed several potential pitfalls facing Chinese companies that go public in the U.S., including &#8220;numerous legal and regulatory risks&#8221; and &#8220;extensive government regulation and oversight in its F-1.&#8221;</p>
<p>What does this news signify for other Chinese companies that are hoping for stateside IPOs?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be off on Monday, July 5 in observance of Independence Day. Thanks very much for reading, and I hope you have an excellent weekend.</p>

<p>A report from Brighteye Ventures on Europe&#8217;s edtech scene shows that this year&#8217;s deal flow is on pace to meet or surpass 2020, when remote instruction exploded.</p>
<p>According to Brighteye&#8217;s head of Research, Rhys Spence, the average deal size is now $9.4 million, a threefold increase from last year. Still, &#8220;It’s interesting that we are not seeing enormous increases in deal count,&#8221; he noted.</p>

<p>Trading platform Robinhood has attracted enough users and activity to change the conversation around retail investing — economists will likely be discussing the 2021 GameStop saga for years to come.</p>
<p>After the company filed to go public yesterday, Alex Wilhelm sorted through Robinhood&#8217;s main income statement to better understand how it scaled year-ago revenue from $127.6 million to $522.2 million in Q1.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those are numbers that we frankly do not see often amongst companies going public,&#8221; says Alex. &#8220;300% growth is a pre-Series A metric, usually.&#8221;</p>
<p>So: where is all that revenue coming from?</p>

<p>Given the valuation gap between U.S. tech markets and those overseas, it&#8217;s easy to see why some foreign startups would head to our shores when it&#8217;s time to go public.</p>
<p>But Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm found that a record increase in European venture capital activity is picking up the pace of IPOs this year, and many of these companies are content to go public in their native markets.</p>
<p>To gain some insight into where European investors believe they have an advantage, Anna and Alex interviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Franck Sebag, partner, EY</li>
<li>David Miranda, partner, Osborne Clarke Spain</li>
<li>Yoram Wijngaarde, founder and CEO, Dealroom</li>

<p>In a recent private equity survey, 80% of respondents said their co-investments with people outside traditional VC firms outperformed their PE fund investments.</p>
<p>Alternative investors are highly motivated, and because they’re seeking higher returns than are generally available in public markets, they are less daunted by risk. In return, they benefit from less expensive fee structures and develop close ties with VCs, enlarging the talent pool as they build investment skills.</p>
<p>These relationships have direct benefits for VCs as well, such as more flexibility with diversification and consolidated decision-making power.</p>
<p>“With the right deal structure, deal selection and deal investigation, co-investors can significantly increase their returns,” says C5 Capital Managing Partner William Kilmer, who wrote an Extra Crunch post for VCs considering an alternative path.</p>

<p>Smart-building products include everything from connecting landlords with tenants to managing construction sites.</p>
<p>Given their widespread impact on the enterprise — and the novel nature of much of this new technology, selecting the right digital building platform (DBP) is a challenge for most organizations.</p>
<p>Brian Turner, LEED-AP BD&amp;C, has created a matrix intended to help decision-makers identify the fundamental functions and desired outcomes for stakeholders.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it comes to the built environment, creating those comfortable, healthy and enjoyable places requires new tools,&#8221; says Turner. &#8220;Selecting a solid DBP is one of the most important decisions to be made.&#8221;</p>

<p>One perennial problem inside startups: Because no one on the founding team has significant marketing experience, growth-related efforts are pro forma and generally unlikely to move the needle.</p>
<p>Everyone wants higher click-through rates, but creating ads that “stand out” is a risky strategy, especially when you don’t know what you’re doing. This guest post by Demand Curve offers seven strategies for boosting CTR that you can clone and deploy today inside your own startup.</p>
<p>Here’s one: If customers are talking about you online, reach out to ask if you can add a screenshot of their reviews to your advertising. Testimonials are a form of social proof that boost conversions, and they’re particularly effective when used in retargeting ads.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, we ran another post about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/demand-curve-email-marketing-tactics-that-convert-subscribers-into-customers/">optimizing email marketing for early-stage startups</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll have more expert growth advice coming soon, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>Locking down data centers and networks against intruders is just one aspect of an organization’s security responsibilities; cloud services, collaboration tools and APIs extend security perimeters even farther. What’s more, the systems created to prevent the misuse and mishandling of sensitive data often depend heavily on someone’s better angels.</p>
<p>According to Sid Trivedi, a partner at Foundation Capital, and seven-time CIO Mark Settle, IT managers need to replace existing DLP frameworks with a new one that centers on DMP — data misuse protection.</p>
<p>These solutions “will provide data assets with more sophisticated self-defense mechanisms instead of relying on the surveillance of traditional security perimeters,” and many startups are already competing in this space.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Far too often, we see medical mixups and even deaths caused by interoperability obstacles in our healthcare system. In these situations, patients in critical conditions cannot speak to their past medical history in an emergency. Upon their recovery but through no fault of their healthcare providers, they are left footing a massive medical bill or facing other severe financial repercussions. Lack of access to data not only causes these terrible outcomes &#8212; it’s also part of the reason why our healthcare costs are <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NationalHealthAccountsHistorical">nearly 18% of the GDP</a> and growing.</p>
<p>Among the many reasons why healthcare data isn’t more digitally accessible is a very simple one: fear that it will be misused. Patients are scared their data will be used against them. This could happen in a number of ways, the most obvious being the threat that insurance companies will use health data to deny people coverage or that employers will use the data to exclude people when making hiring decisions. That’s why the <a href="https://healthinformatics.uic.edu/blog/health-data-privacy/">rules and regulations</a> surrounding health data privacy are so stringent.</p>
<p>So, how can investors advance (and capitalize on) tech development around this issue and help eradicate this fear?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Investors, take note</h2>
<p>We know funding for companies in healthcare and digital health has not been a problem — but profitability has. Many of these companies are still struggling financially under a fee-for-service business as required by most insurance companies, Medicaid and Medicare. There are grave inefficiencies in the fee-for-service system: It creates the wrong alignment of interests; doesn’t favor the consumer; is complicated by CPT codes (the numerical codes used to identify medical services and procedures), high copayments and deductibles; and is riddled by waste and abuse.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If the investor community bets on companies that continue to embrace a model that many agree is broken, how can we expect outsized returns?					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>If the investor community bets on companies that continue to embrace a model that many agree is broken, how can we expect outsized returns? To truly lower costs and reduce inefficiencies, we have to abandon the existing structure and put the customer first.</p>
<p>The key here is to look at companies that are truly trying to solve not just one piece of this puzzle, but those that are attempting to create an end-to-end solution that connects the employer, member, hospital, specialists, pharmaceutical companies, primary care doctors and claims adjusters, powered by digital health data — all while making it more affordable for the consumer.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for those that are moving away from the fee-for-service structure and focused on employer-driven systems. Employers are properly aligned with patients, as bad health outcomes and financial stress both negatively impact productivity. Employers are also focused on KPIs in their business; they’re used to measuring and tracking results, making them great candidates for data-focused healthcare companies.</p>
<p>Most importantly, in a labor market where companies are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/08/economy/jobs-openings-april/index.html">clamoring to attract employees</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">, </span>employers will have to work with healthcare technology companies that put a premium on data security because their current and potential employees will demand it.</p>
<h2>Innovation over fear</h2>
<p>The whole future of healthcare is going to focus on the ability to securely share data. To empower providers and patients to take control of their healthcare journey, we need to build a system of trust that allows the efficient flow of personal healthcare information from stakeholder to stakeholder.</p>
<p>Today, with the way HIPAA works and the requirement to keep data private, that trust has to be in the hands of a provider. Imagine if your primary care physician was the quarterback of your entire healthcare journey. Simply by handling your preventative care, they have a more complete picture.</p>
<p>Even better, preventative care is a major focus when it comes to reducing healthcare costs. If you put the data in the hands of a trusted entity and ensure that each person has access to their full medical history, people are much more likely to grant access at times of need.</p>
<h2>The good news? There’s hope</h2>
<p>The future is very bright because of technology. The challenge is being able to figure out meaningful ways to utilize and integrate it. Right now, we have a system of incumbency that is disincentivized to embrace new technologies.</p>
<p>Telehealth is a perfect example of how the system can meaningfully change. It took a global pandemic to really be able to break through to a point where telehealth was fully embraced (and covered by insurance). Now, health insurers such as <a href="https://ehrintelligence.com/news/anthem-integrates-epic-ehr-for-care-coordination-interoperability">Anthem</a> are actively trying to improve care coordination and interoperability.</p>
<p>Three critical technologies not used in healthcare today could be instrumental in bringing about this change. Ideally, all three will align to usher in a new era of healthcare:</p>
<h3>Healthcare telemetry 2.0: Collection of health data on cellular devices</h3>
<p>Through our use of social apps and e-commerce platforms on our mobile devices, people have already accepted that our cell phones are constantly collecting data on us and willingly consent to this. Sometimes this function is quite helpful — just look at court cases where detailed location data have provided alibis to suspects.</p>
<p>Anybody with a cell phone is carrying a medical device that counts our steps, tracks our screen actions and is attuned to us as users. So why are we not leveraging this function for optimized care — or at the very least trying to get medical insights out of our device use data?</p>
<p>In the future, the number of times one checks their mobile calendar in a day could be an indicator of early-onset Alzheimer’s in people of a particular age group, as one example. Technologists must continue to push the boundaries of how the computing power in our pockets and purses is used to help us, especially with so much of the groundwork already laid.</p>
<h3>Privacy 2.0: Application of blockchain to protect medical information</h3>
<p>In just the past six months, we have seen bad actors capitalizing on digital risk to cripple entire industries through data breaches. The Colonial Pipeline hack effectively shuttered gas distribution to a massive portion of the U.S. in a matter of hours. With healthcare data, stewards of the system need to be even more careful. It will be tricky to regulate the privacy and protection of healthcare data, but blockchain technology has proven to be an effective measure in maintaining trust between consumers and data stewards.</p>
<h3>Portability 2.0: Ability to securely share information with approved parties</h3>
<p>For many people with life-threatening conditions, the simple act of wearing a medical bracelet can make a difference between life and death — but at this point, medical bracelets should be obsolete. Imagine the patient benefits that could come from a next-generation medical “bracelet” that carries a patient’s entire genome, tumor profiles, long-term heart rate trends and more, and can be uploaded instantly in an emergency situation.</p>
<p>Right now, the absence of health record portability creates redundancies that are both expensive and harmful to patients. Doctors spend time and resources rescanning patients, while patients suffer from repeated (and sometimes risky) diagnostics, like blood draws and radiation. Nobody has cracked the code on portability, but effective solutions must navigate tricky regulatory waters while solving for standardization across data sets.</p>
<p>We are already seeing these technologies used in other industries. Apple and Google have turned phones into remote monitoring devices that can easily collect all types of health telemetry data. Cryptocurrency represents billions of dollars in transactions with no breach of trust in various coin exchanges. Uber and Lyft have changed the way we hire, use and pay for transportation. Applying the core technologies used in each of these examples would provide a means for disrupting the current challenges in healthcare. It’s only a matter of time.</p>
<p>History has proven that with innovation, investment and technology, the world has become a dramatically better place. As long as rules and regulations stay out of the way, you can expect that technology will allow us to make enormous leaps forward in the next decade.</p>
<p>Making data secure and meaningful, along with personalized medicine, holds the promise to reduce long-term healthcare costs in the U.S. while improving healthcare outcomes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Get your spool-of-yarn emojis ready &#8212; threads might be coming to Facebook soon. Facebook has been spotted testing a new feature that gives public figures on Facebook the ability to create a new post that&#8217;s connected to a previous one on a related subject. This feature ties the posts together more visually so fans can more easily follow updates over time. When the new post appears on followers&#8217; News Feeds, it will be shown as being connected to the other posts in a thread.</p>
<p>Social media consultant Matt Navarra first <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1410595945687945220">spotted this</a> feature in action, and shared several screenshots of how it looks. Reached for comment, Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch it&#8217;s testing the feature with a small group of &#8220;public figures&#8221; on Facebook for the time being. A public figure is a specific type of Facebook Page category aimed at high-profile individuals or anyone else who wants to establish a more public presence on Facebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2173336" style="width: 434px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2173336" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2173336" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/E5Nxh9-VoAkVzAb.jpeg?w=424" alt="" width="424" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/E5Nxh9-VoAkVzAb.jpeg 598w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/E5Nxh9-VoAkVzAb.jpeg?resize=93,150 93w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/E5Nxh9-VoAkVzAb.jpeg?resize=187,300 187w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/E5Nxh9-VoAkVzAb.jpeg?resize=424,680 424w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/E5Nxh9-VoAkVzAb.jpeg?resize=31,50 31w" sizes="(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2173336" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Matt Navarra</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Facebook explained these threaded posts will have a &#8220;View Post Thread&#8221; button, which lets followers easily navigate to see all of the posts in the thread. When you tap on the button, you&#8217;ll be shown where you can see all the threaded posts connected together in one place.</p>
<p>Facebook was unable to confirm if or when the test would roll out more broadly to other public figures on its platform or if it would later expand to other Page categories, like Businesses, or to Facebook Groups.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Threads are useful on sites like Twitter, where the character limit makes it harder to have more nuanced conversations &#8212; that&#8217;s why we end up with those oh-so-beloved &#8220;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/style/notes-app-celebrity-statements.html">notes app apology</a>&#8221; posts on Twitter. (Now, Twitter promotes its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/twitters-acquisition-strategy-eat-the-public-conversation/">Revue</a> newsletter app when you write a thread). But on Facebook, your posts can be up to precisely 63,206 characters long (or, about 225 tweets).</p>
<p>Rather than inspiring longer posts, Facebook threads could be used for live commentary on an event like an award show. Or, users could post updates to their existing posts in a thread, rather than updating the original and making a clunky &#8220;edited to add&#8230;&#8221; announcement. Given that Facebook is testing this feature with public figures, perhaps its intended use is to make the sharing of news more streamlined.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that Facebook has dealt with some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/as-advertisers-revolt-facebook-commits-to-flagging-newsworthy-political-speech-that-violates-policy/">misinformation issues</a> in the past, so for journalists or government officials sharing information about developing news events, threads could provide useful context.</p>
<p>This testing comes after Facebook announced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/facebooks-newsletter-platform-bulletin-is-now-live/">Bulletin newsletter offshoot</a> earlier this week.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">A CEO’s fiduciary duties to their company and its shareholders do not end when they are off the clock — they must always act in good faith. However, navigating the boundaries between a company’s official communications and a personal voice can be difficult in today’s social-media-connected environment.</p>
<p>What a CEO posts on Twitter can raise not only serious reputational issues for themselves and their companies but posting the wrong things at the wrong time can also cause breach of fiduciary duties and may even run afoul of securities laws.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Reputation and goodwill take a long time to build and are difficult to maintain, but it only takes one tweet to destroy it all.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Fiduciary duties can be divided into three buckets: (1) duty of care — CEOs must act in good faith with the care of a reasonable person in a like position with a reasonable belief that their decisions are in furtherance of their company’s best interest; (2) duty of loyalty — CEOs must put the interest of shareholders and the company above their own self-interest; and (3) duty of good faith — CEOs must act with honesty and fairness to shareholders and the company.</p>
<p>There is no denying that Twitter can be leveraged as a powerful tool. Used appropriately, it can fortify the reputation of a company and its CEO, forge stronger consumer relationships and drive business profits. For example, Tim Cook’s habit of tweeting about his interactions with Apple customers demonstrates his customer-service values and effort to connect with consumers, which can potentially lead to a bigger and more loyal following.</p>
<p>Lately, more and more CEOs are communicating their stance on issues that are important to their consumer base to exhibit authenticity, relatability and demonstrate their personal and corporate values through social media. Following last year’s murder of George Floyd and rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, <a href="https://www.teneo.com/ceos-and-twitter-how-a-new-and-more-diverse-generation-of-ceos-are-leading-and-communicating-through-challenging-times/">nearly 60% of all S&amp;P 100 tech CEOs, unicorn CEOs, and Fortune 500 CEOs tweeted, &#8220;Black Lives Matter.&#8221;</a> This was the first time CEOs active on Twitter overwhelmingly voiced their position on racial and social justice issues.</p>
<p>Twitter can also be an opportunity to show transparency in policy. CEOs can use social media to announce new management initiatives, capability expansions and new investments in employees (diversity initiatives, new roles for women, organizational changes) that are positive in tone and speak about the future direction of the company. These can have a <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/298f9b44201.pdf">positive correlation with stock prices</a>.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that long ago that the world was fixated on Donald Trump’s Twitter posts and their <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923621000877">correlation with the stock market</a>. Words have permanence and their impact can be catastrophic. Given their elevated role as a leader and representative of the company and the fiduciary duties they owe, CEOs must watch what they say and when they say it. What it all boils down to is awareness, common sense and the law.</p>
<h2>Don’t break the law and stick to the facts</h2>
<p>For U.S. publicly traded companies, SEC Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD) says that “an issuer may not disclose material nonpublic information to certain groups, either intentionally or unintentionally, without disclosing the same information to the entire marketplace.” If companies use social media to announce key information, to comply, they must alert investors that social media will be used to disseminate such information.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether it is a public or private company, CEOs are corporate officers and owe fiduciary duties to their companies and their shareholders. Fiduciary duty requires CEOs to act in good faith, apply their best business judgment and to act in the best interest of the company. This is true whether they are in the boardroom or on Twitter.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yesterday, enterprise computing corporation Zebra Technologies announced its plan to acquire Fetch Robotics. The San Jose-based startup has been a mainstay in warehouse and fulfillment robotics for a number of years, offering a modular system designed to automate companies behind the scenes.</p>
<p>The full deal is valued at $305 million, with Zebra acquiring the remaining 95% of the company for $290 million. It comes as interest in the category is at an all-time high, following widespread labor shortages during the pandemic.</p>
<p>After the news broke, we sat down with Fetch co-founder and CEO Melonee Wise to discuss the deal and the future of warehouse robotics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Why was this acquisition the right move for Fetch?</strong></p>
<p>When you look at it, over the last seven years, we’ve been building a pretty compelling cloud robotics platform. About two years ago, Zebra invested in Fetch, and we started working together through our partnership. One of the first things we did was integrating their mobile computing devices, for an out-of-the-box experience on our cloud robotics platform. When our customers got robots, they could take the hand scanner they already had today, scan a barcode and call a robot to them.</p>
<p>As we were fundraising for our Series D, this opportunity came out of that. I think when you look at it, over the last couple of years, we’ve had a good relationship with them. With the pandemic, there’s been a huge draw for more and more automation technology. Before the pandemic, there were already labor shortages for warehouse and logistics, and the pandemic only exacerbated it. One of the other great things about us joining Zebra is they have a strong go-to-market engine, and they can amplify our sales capability. They’re already in all of the customers we want to be working with. It helps us reach a much broader, wider and deeper audience.</p>
<p><strong>I’d assumed Fetch was a good potential candidate for an acquisition, but I’d always imagined it would be something like a Walmart looking to compete with Amazon robotics. I suspect that you&#8217;ve been approached by companies over the years. Why does this kind of acquisition make more sense, ultimately?</strong></p>
<p>I think the acquisition made sense because it aligns with more of our long-term vision. When we built our platform, we built it to be unifying. Not just our robots. Over the years we’ve been slowly bringing in other partners on the platform. We have a partnership with SICK, we have partnerships with other MWS providers like VARGO. That isn’t going to change. We’re still going to be partner friendly and we’re still going to bring other devices into the ecosystem. When you look at the options and the opportunities, this was a good opportunity and was well aligned with the team we wanted to build.</p>
<p><strong>I know Zebra has developed their own robot and invested in other robotics companies. Are you the cornerstone of an ecosystem play? Is this Zebra building a a robotic retail and fulfillment ecosystem around Fetch?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that so far has been the discussion. It&#8217;s still evolving. I don&#8217;t have all the details for you, obviously. And of course, we still have 30 days or 35 days ‘till closing, so we&#8217;re still operating as independent businesses. In terms of vision of how we&#8217;re thinking about it, Zebra is very excited to kind of make Fetch the centerpiece of this whole new offering that they&#8217;re building out. It’s a high strategic priority for them.</p>
<p><strong>Will the Fetch brand remain? Will the company stay in San Jose? Are you staying on board?</strong></p>
<p>Fetch is not moving. We’re kind of becoming the centerpiece, so they want to keep the team together, in San Jose. My plan is to stay. We’re still working out the details [ … ] Fetch has a very strong brand, and so how do we get the best of both worlds.</p>
<p><strong>Is acquisition something that a company like Fetch works toward? Do you consider it to be kind of an inevitability?</strong></p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s complicated. When I started the company, I never really planned on anything. I just wanted to go build something. I mean that in the most sincere way. I wanted to go build something and not fail. And the question is, what does not failing look like? I think the facts are that in the last 20-something years, almost no robotics company has IPO&#8217;ed. Now we’re starting to see SPACS, but there hasn&#8217;t been a robotics company that’s IPO&#8217;ed through the traditional route.</p>
<p>I would say that if you were to ask me on any given day, what I thought the probability of IPO versus acquisition, I probably would have said acquisition, because there&#8217;s just not a history of robotics companies IPO&#8217;ing. That’s for lots of reasons. It’s a hardware intensive business. It takes a lot of technology and investment. Typically, they&#8217;re held privately. It’s hard for large corporate entities to have the P&amp;L to invest in this deep technology. I think that’s starting to change. And I think now that there’s SPACs, you’ll see a lot changing in that regard. But I would say you’re still going to see more acquisitions than you’re going to see IPOs for the next 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>Had you been approached about acquisition in the past?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. In the past we had been, but many times before it was just too early.</p>
<p><strong>What does it mean to be too early?</strong></p>
<p>It just didn’t feel like the right time for lots of reasons. Some of it has to do with what I want. Some of it has to do with what the team wants. And some of it has to do with what our investors want. There are a lot of people at the table. This is always a hard question. Previously when those things had come up, the market was so undefined and so new, we just wanted to see where it went. Now we’re starting to see more structure to the environment, and we’re starting to see an inflection point.</p>
<p><strong>Is additional international expansion part of the plan?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. We’re in several companies in Europe. We’re in APAC and expanding in that region. Right now, we aren’t placing any large bets in any of those countries. We’re waiting to see how the market develops, but we’re looking to expand.</p>

<h2>Used a headline with a more compelling value proposition</h2>
<p>The headline on the control version is <strong>“Health Insurance in China.”</strong> If I am an expat looking for health insurance in China, at least I know I am in the right place but I don’t immediately have a reason to choose you. I have to scroll and infer this from multiple elements.</p>

		<blockquote>
			For revenue-generating landing pages it is best to always follow the Bauhaus design aesthetic (from architecture). Form follows function, ornament is evil!					</blockquote>

	</p>
<p>The winning version instantly conveys a compelling value proposition: <strong>“Save Up to 32% on Your Health Insurance in China,”</strong> accompanied by “evidentials” to support this claim &#8212; the number of past customers and a relevant testimonial with a 4.5 star rating (by the way, it is better to use a default static testimonial rather than a moving carousel).</p>
<p>As the famed old-school direct response marketer John Caples taught us, “The reader’s attention is yours only for a single instant. They will not spend their valuable time trying to figure out what you mean.” What was true in Caples’ 1920s heyday is doubly so in the mobile age, when attention spans are shorter than a fruit fly’s!<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lordstown Motors continues to stumble. The beleaguered electric vehicle startup is now being investigated by the Department of Justice, in addition to an ongoing investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>The investigation, first broke by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-is-probing-lordstown-motors-11625239730">Wall Street Journal</a> on Friday, is still in its early stages, according to unnamed sources. It is being conducted by the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Lordstown Motors is committed to cooperating with any regulatory or governmental investigations and inquiries,&#8221; a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;We look forward to closing this chapter so that our new leadership – and entire dedicated team – can focus solely on producing the first and best full-size all-electric pickup truck, the Lordstown Endurance.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The probe is just the latest in a series of woes for the startup, which recently said it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">had to cut production volumes</a> for its debut electric pickup, Endurance, by half — from around 2,200 vehicles to 1,000. Just a few weeks after it made that announcement, there followed news of a corporate shakeup: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/lordstown-motors-ceo-and-cfo-resign-amidst-production-woes/">the resignation</a> of founding CEO Steve Burns and CFO Julio Rodriguez. Burns started the company as an offshoot of his previous startup, Workhorse Group.</p>
<p>Lordstown had a strong start, with investments from General Motors that helped it purchase a 6.2-million-square-foot factory from the leading automaker in late 2019. Lordstown made positive headlines last August, when it announced it would go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/lordstown-motors-becomes-latest-ev-automaker-to-use-a-spac-to-go-public/">The deal</a> injected the EV startup with around $675 million in gross proceeds and skyrocketed its market value to $1.6 billion. Less than a year later, Lordstown <a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/static-files/f0d0d2f4-d298-4576-9344-61f82e345e19">informed the SEC</a> that it does not have sufficient capital to manufacture Endurance.</p>
<p>Then, in March, the short-seller firm Hindenburg Research <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/lordstown-motors-accused-of-faking-ev-truck-orders-by-short-seller-firm-hindenburg-research/">released a report</a> disputing the company’s claims that it had booked 100,000 pre-orders for the electric pickup. It wrote that “extensive research reveals that the company’s orders appear largely fictitious and used as a prop to raise capital and confer legitimacy.” The SEC opened its investigation in the wake of these accusations.</p>
<p>The WSJ story is unclear on the scope of the inquiry and the company declined to provide details. TechCrunch will update the story if it learns more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For a brief moment, earlier this week, it seemed as though Pittsburgh might be the center of the tech universe. Just as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/duolingo-s-1/">Carnegie Mellon alum Duolingo was announcing its IPO</a>. Senators Bob Casey and Pat Toomey were in town, as Vice President Kamala Harris paid a visit to the City of Bridges to talk infrastructure.</p>
<p>The morning of TechCrunch’s City Spotlight, the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/robotics-roundup-18/"> Pittsburgh Robotics Network held its own event</a> to announce a new alliance with members of the local government and faculty from nearby universities.</p>
<p>“The alliance brings together leaders from top robotics companies, research institutions and universities in the Pittsburgh area, including Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Argo AI, Aurora, the University of Pittsburgh, Kaarta, RE2 Robotics, Neya Systems, Carnegie Robotics, HEBI Robotics, Near Earth Autonomy, BirdBrain Technologies, Omnicell and Advanced Construction Robotics,” a press release noted. “The Richard King Mellon Foundation commemorated this membership milestone with a grant of $125,000 to support the continued growth of the PRN.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/pittsburgh-city-spotlight/">Our own Spotlight event</a>, held later that afternoon, was designed to highlight the city’s continued evolution. To many, Pittsburgh is still very much the plucky but troubled city reeling from the deindustrialization of the 70s and 80s, as the factory and industry jobs that formed its foundation moved out of town and shipped overseas. The rust belt veneer is a hard one to leave behind, but the city’s biggest cheerleaders are working hard to transform the image of Pittsburgh into one of robotics, AI, autonomy and other cutting-edge technologies.</p>
<p>Carnegie Mellon has — and continues to be the cornerstone of that Pittsburgh. A world-class research school by any metric, CMU is the crown jewel of the area’s dozens of colleges and universities. While the University of Pittsburgh is a huge driver for the city’s medical and science communities, CMU is the reason it can count itself among the leaders in robots and self-driving cars.</p>
<p>Speaking at our event, Farnam Jahanian cited the school’s The Swartz Center as a major driver in its efforts to support the startup ambitions of students and faculty alike.</p>
<p>“The Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship at Carnegie Mellon is a system of programming activities that offers a unique path of entrepreneurship, education, engagement, collaboration and opportunities for students, faculty and staff that are interested in entrepreneurship, from the Innovation Scholars Program, to the corporate startup lab, to essentially garages that students and faculty can essentially sign up for to launch their companies from plus a host of other programmatic things, resources that you would need,” says Jahanian, who was appointed CMU’s president in 2018.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cmu.edu/swartz-center-for-entrepreneurship/">The Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship</a> was founded in 2015, courtesy of a $31 million donation from CMU alumnus and Accel Partners co-founder, James R. Swartz. The center built on previous efforts like 2012’s Carnegie Mellon Center and Project Olympus, founded in 2007. The Swartz Center and its recent precursors list among their success stories Duolingo, DataSquid and AbilLife.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/how-cmu-is-helping-build-its-own-startups-and-keeping-them-in-pittsburgh/">Dave Mawhinney recently told TechCrunch</a> that he took the role as the center’s executive director in an effort, “to make it on par with Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, Harvard and other great entrepreneurial universities.” CMU certainly isn’t outclassed by any of the above in terms of its position as a world-class research university, but Mawhinney concedes that the school and the city have traditionally grappled with entrepreneurial retention.</p>
<p>“You can always learn from what you have and build on it,” says Jahanian. “I would stress it is really about the entire ecosystem. It&#8217;s not about just what CMU does &#8212; that&#8217;s a critical part of it. It’s University of Pittsburgh, it&#8217;s other universities that are in our region that are also contributing significantly to our ecosystem.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How Carnegie Mellon is helping build its own startups and keeping them in Pittsburgh&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/how-cmu-is-helping-build-its-own-startups-and-keeping-them-in-pittsburgh/embed/#?secret=XVrh0JZ7YG" data-secret="XVrh0JZ7YG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Mawhinney says that CMU’s ability to incubate and foster tech startups hit an inflection point roughly a decade and a half ago, as Big Tech took an increasing interest in the research the school was doing around things fields like AI and automation.</p>
<p>“Really, the seminal event was when Google put an office in Pittsburgh in 2006. They have over 1,000 employees,” he says. “Every major tech company — Amazon, Facebook, Apple — have all embedded hundreds of engineers in our community, so we’re growing really, really rapidly. Artificial intelligence was invented at Carnegie Mellon — and that sort of set off the robot revolution [ … ] Now we’re the center of the automated vehicle community. Aurora is co-located here, Argo is here, Aptiv is here. We have a very vibrant community and we do want to continue to grow it.”</p>
<p>Building a successful company requires a lot more than engineers, of course (there’s a decent chance you wouldn’t be reading this if that weren’t the case). In the lead up to our event, I asked several interested parties what the biggest hurdle was in continuing to attract and grow the city’s startup ecosystem. The overwhelming answer was simple: venture capital.</p>
<p>“What we need is more capital — angel funds, venture funds so that entrepreneurs have a variety of funding sources to go to locally,” Yvonne Campos of Next Act Fund LLC told TechCrunch. “We definitely need more funding for women-led businesses — women raise about one-third less capital than men-led companies. Not because of the business idea or leader, but because we invest in companies where we have the most comfort — we invest in people that look like us. Nationally, only about 20%-25% of all angel investors are women. We need more women to become active as investors.”</p>

<p>The city’s mayor, Bill Peduto, who also appeared at our event, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/pittsburghs-mayor-on-the-citys-startup-community-and-the-difficulty-of-attracting-venture-capital/">echoed the sentiment</a>.</p>
<p>“I think the biggest hurdle remains access to venture capital, especially in this stage. I think we’ve been able to convince investors from the coast that the companies don’t need to leave Pittsburgh in order to be highly successful and see their investment pay off,” he told me in an interview. “However, I believe if we had more venture capital arriving here to help to take early-stage companies into that critical next stage of expansion, it would build off itself and it would excel growth in all of the industry cluster, significantly.”</p>
<p>During our conversation, however, Jahanian pushed back on the sentiment. “I respectfully disagree,” he told me. “Funding is important, but great ideas get funded. I’ve seen it my entire career. They get funded at levels that really show that these companies have a shot at being really successful.”</p>

<p>CMU’s president points to another problem, entirely. “You need a lot more than just cool technologies or new research ideas or new concepts or products just to launch a company,” Jahanian says. “You need a lot more around it. You need marketing, product management, you need to be able to develop a business plan. So those are a lot of the resources that we do provide.”</p>
<p>Kleiner Perkins CPO Bing Gordon reflected the sentiment, speaking to me over email. “[Pittsburgh needs] to import CFOs, product managers, ad sales,” he wrote. Another historical concern for the city is attracting that talent. CMU hasn’t had an issue on that front, because location is less of a key concern for students applying for research universities. When it comes to careers after college, settling down and starting a family, on the other hand, suddenly quality of life rockets up the list.</p>
<p>Jahanian says he has long championed green spaces and other communal gathering places in his conversations over the years with Peduto. He adds that the subject should continue to be top of mind for whoever the city’s new mayor is next year.</p>
<p>“One of the most important things about the startup and high-tech community in Pittsburgh is the quality of life for citizens across this town,” says Jahanian. “I can tell you as a university president, an overwhelming majority of the faculty that we recruit want to live in the city and enjoy it. That’s an important part of it. Obviously, there&#8217;s a lot more going on beyond the quality of life. The more that the city does to bridge the gap between those who are prospering and those who are potentially left behind in the economies that are created the high-tech economies is important. That&#8217;s a responsibility of the private sector and the public sector. I&#8217;m really optimistic that we&#8217;ll have a great partnership with our future mayor, as we&#8217;ve done in the past mayors to catalyze the economy and lift all boats.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Therapy is rapidly becoming a standard part of many people&#8217;s lives, but 2020 interrupted that trend by nixing in-person sessions and forcing therapists to migrate their entire practice online — and it turns out that&#8217;s not so easy. <a href="https://www.tryframe.com/">Frame</a> simplifies it with an all-in-one portal for clients and therapists, unifying the listings, tools and management software that run the countless small businesses making up the industry.</p>
<p>Kendall Bird and Sage Grazer are old friends who happened to be in the right place at the right time — a strange thing to say about anyone anywhere at the start of 2020, but it&#8217;s true. The startup&#8217;s pitch of bringing your practice entirely online and offering all-online sessions, bookkeeping, scheduling and everything turned out to be exactly what would soon be needed — though as they tell it, it has actually been needed for some time.</p>
<p>Grazer, a therapist herself, experienced firsthand the unexpected difficulties of getting up and running.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I started my practice in 2016, I was really passionate about the clinical work, but I was very overwhelmed by setting up a business, marketing, financial stuff,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So we wanted to help other therapists through that.&#8221;</p>
<p>She and Bird happened to reconnect around that time and the two saw an opportunity to improve things.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172962" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kendallsage.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172962" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2172962 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kendallsage.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="715" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kendallsage.jpg 2389w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kendallsage.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kendallsage.jpg?resize=300,209 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kendallsage.jpg?resize=768,536 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kendallsage.jpg?resize=680,474 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kendallsage.jpg?resize=1536,1072 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kendallsage.jpg?resize=2048,1429 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kendallsage.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2172962" class="wp-caption-text">Kendall Bird (left) and Sage Grazer. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Frame</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We think about therapists as being a one-on-one thing, but they&#8217;re really a small business,&#8221; said Bird, who formerly worked in marketing at Snapchat, Google and YouTube. &#8220;They&#8217;re underserved and undersupported as mental health professionals — they don&#8217;t have the back-office support that doctors do, and they&#8217;re not trained how to run businesses. It just made sense to build a scalable SaaS solution that lets these people work for themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>The therapy industry, like other medical institutions, has two sides: client-facing and practitioner-facing. While there are a handful of services online that combine these, many essentially recruit therapists as contractors. If you want to run your own practice, you&#8217;ll likely be using a combination of specialty scheduling, telehealth, billing and other tools made with medical privacy considerations in mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;The therapy tools and services landscape is incredibly fragmented — the average therapist is using 5-7 tools, and most of those are not built for therapy,&#8221; said Bird.</p>
<p>And then of course there&#8217;s Psychology Today: a periodical that straddles the roles of pop psych and industry rag, but whose chief reason for existing for many is its voluminous therapist listings, which dominate search and provide an overwhelming first stop for anyone looking to find one in their area. But for such a personal and consequential decision these brief listings don&#8217;t give wary potential clients the impression they&#8217;re making an informed choice.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted an experience that was more approachable, uses language that doesn&#8217;t feel overwhelming or pathologizing,&#8221; said Grazer. &#8220;There are people going to therapy feeling alone and confused, who don&#8217;t identify with a disorder or checking a check box.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frame eschews the oversimplified &#8220;scroll through therapists near your area code&#8221; with a short quiz — not a diagnosis or personality test but just a few basic questions — that winnows down your choices to a handful of local and appropriate therapists, with whom you can instantly set up free introductory video calls. If you find someone you like, the rest of the professional relationship takes place on Frame, though of course soon in-person sessions may return.</p>
<p>For those not quite ready to take the plunge, the company organizes livestreamed sessions between volunteers and therapists to show what a full hour of work might look like. (Whatever courage it may take to confront one&#8217;s issues in therapy, it surely takes even more to do so with an audience.)</p>
<p>On the therapist&#8217;s side, Frame is meant to be a one-stop shop. Marketing and telehealth sessions are on there, as noted above, but so are things like scheduling, notes, billing, notifications, and so on, all tailored specifically to the needs of the industry. And while the shift to online services has been a long time coming, the company just happened to drop in just as the need went into overdrive.</p>

<p>&#8220;We built it before COVID ever existed — launched in March 2020 and had telehealth as an option, thinking &#8216;oh, well maybe some people will do this.&#8217; The majority of therapists in America weren&#8217;t doing sessions online at the time&#8230; but after COVID they <em>all</em> are,&#8221; Bird said. &#8220;And they&#8217;re looking for these tools now because they&#8217;re seeing the rewards of running a lot of their business through telehealth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many therapists are finding that after resisting the transition for years, they are encountering all kinds of benefits, explained Grazer. Like other industries, the flexibility inherent to shifting in-person meetings to virtual ones has been freeing and in some cases profitable. The change is here to stay.</p>
<p>The site is in a closed beta limited to a part of California at present, since therapists are limited to operating in-state and there are other regulations to consider, not to mention all the usual struggles of putting together a sprawling professional service. But the $3 million funding round, led by Maven Ventures, will help fill out the product and move the company toward a larger audience. Sugar Capital, Struck Capital, Alpha Edison and January Ventures participated in the raise.</p>
<p>The money is &#8220;almost exclusively going to engineering.&#8221; The goal is to open up the beta, expand to the rest of California, then move out to other states once they have the infrastructure to do so and have responded to feedback from the initial rollout.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sage and I are really aligned in the belief that the best way to make therapy more accessible to America is to support therapists,&#8221; said Bird.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Privacy litigation that&#8217;s being brought against Facebook by two not-for-profits in the Netherlands can go ahead, an Amsterdam court has <a href="https://linkeddata.overheid.nl/front/portal/document-viewer?ext-id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2021:3307">ruled</a>. The case will be heard in October.</p>
<p>Since 2019, the Amsterdam-based <a href="https://dataprivacystichting.com">Data Privacy Foundation</a> (DPS) has been seeking to bring a case against Facebook over its rampant collection of internet users&#8217; data &#8212; arguing the company does not have a proper legal basis for the processing.</p>
<p>It has been joined in the action by the Dutch consumer protection not-for-profit, <a href="https://www.consumentenbond.nl">Consumentenbond</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The pair are seeking redress for Facebook users in the Netherlands for alleged violations of their privacy rights &#8212; both by suing for compensation for individuals; and calling for Facebook to end the privacy-hostile practices.</p>
<p>European Union law allows for collective redress across a number of areas, including data protection rights, enabling qualified entities to bring representative actions on behalf of rights holders. And the provision looks like an increasingly important tool for furthering privacy enforcement in the bloc, given how European data protection regulators&#8217; have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">continued to lack uniform vigor</a> in upholding rights set out in legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (which, despite coming into application in 2018, has yet to be seriously applied against platform giants like Facebook).</p>
<p>Returning to the Dutch litigation, Facebook denies any abuse and claims it respects user privacy and provides people with &#8220;meaningful control&#8221; over how their data gets exploited.</p>
<p>But it has fought the litigation by seeking to block it on procedural grounds &#8212; arguing for the suit to be tossed by claiming the DPS does not fit the criteria for bringing a privacy claim on behalf of others and that the Amsterdam court has no jurisdiction as its European business is subject to Irish, rather than Dutch, law.</p>
<p>However the Amsterdam District Court rejected its arguments, clearing the way for the litigation to proceed.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Contacted for comment on the ruling, a</span> Facebook spokesperson told us:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are currently reviewing the Court’s decision. The ruling was about the procedural part of the case, not a finding on the merits of the action, and we will continue to defend our position in court. We care about our users in the Netherlands and protecting their privacy is important to us. We build products to help people connect with people and content they care about while honoring their privacy choices. Users have meaningful control over the data that they share on Facebook and we provide transparency around how their data is used. We also offer people tools to access, download, and delete their information and we are committed to the principles of GDPR.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a statement today, the <a href="https://www.consumentenbond.nl/nieuws/2021/rechter-veegt-bezwaren-facebook-van-tafel">Consumentenbond</a>&#8216;s director, Sandra Molenaar, described the ruling as &#8220;a big boost for the more than 10 million victims&#8221; of Facebook&#8217;s practices in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook has tried to throw up all kinds of legal hurdles and to delay this case as much as possible but fortunately the company has not succeeded. Now we can really get to work and ensure that consumers get what they are entitled to,&#8221; she added in the written remarks (translated from Dutch with Google Translate).</p>
<p>In another supporting statement, Dick Bouma, chairman of DPS, added: &#8220;This is a nice and important first step for the court. The ruling shows that it pays to take a collective stand against tech giants that violate privacy rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two not-for-profits are urging Facebook users in the Netherlands to <a href="https://www.consumentenbond.nl/acties/facebook/aanmelden">sign up</a> to be part of the representative action (and potentially receive compensation) &#8212; saying more than 185,000 people have registered so far.</p>
<p>The suit argues that Facebook users are &#8220;paying&#8221; for the &#8220;free&#8221; service with their data &#8212; contending the tech giant does not have a valid legal basis to process people&#8217;s information because it has not provided users with comprehensive information about the data it is gathering from and on them, nor what it does with it.</p>
<p>So &#8212; in essence &#8212; the argument is that Facebook&#8217;s tracking and targeting is in breach of EU privacy law.</p>
<p>The legal challenge follows an earlier investigation (back in 2014) of Facebook&#8217;s business by the Dutch data protection authority that identified problems with its privacy policy and &#8212; in a 2017 report &#8212; found the company to be processing users&#8217; data without their knowledge or consent.</p>
<p>However, since 2018, Europe&#8217;s GDPR has been in application and a &#8220;one-stop-shop&#8221; mechanism baked into the regulation &#8212; to streamline the handling of cross-border cases &#8212; has meant complaints against Facebook have been funnelled through Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission. The Irish DPC has yet to issue a single decision against Facebook despite receiving scores of complaints. (And it&#8217;s notable that  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">&#8220;forced consent&#8221;</a> complaints were filed against Facebook the day GDPR begun being applied &#8212; yet still remain undecided by Ireland.)</p>
<p>The GDPR&#8217;s enforcement bottleneck makes collective redress actions, such as this one in the Netherlands a potentially important route for Europeans to get rights relief against powerful platforms that seek to shrink the risk of regulatory enforcement via forum shopping.</p>
<p>Although national rules &#8212; and courts&#8217; interpretations of them &#8212; can vary. So the chance of litigation succeeding is not uniform.</p>
<p>In this case, the Amsterdam court allowed the suit to proceed on the grounds that the Facebook data subjects in question reside in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>It also took the view that a local Facebook corporate entity in the Netherlands is an establishment of Facebook Ireland, among other reasons for rejecting Facebook&#8217;s arguments.</p>
<p>How Facebook will seek to press a case against the substance of the Dutch privacy litigation remains to be seen. It may well have other procedural strategies up its sleeve.</p>
<p>The tech giant has used similar stalling tactics against far longer-running <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/25/facebooks-least-favorite-austrian-can-now-press-privacy-suit-in-vienna/">privacy litigation in Austria</a>, for example.</p>
<p>In that case, brought by privacy campaigner Max Schrems and his not-for-profit noyb, Facebook has sought to claim that the GDPR&#8217;s consent requirements do not apply to its advertising business because it now includes &#8220;personalized advertising&#8221; in its T&amp;Cs &#8212; and therefore has a &#8220;duty&#8221; to provide privacy-hostile ads to users &#8212; seeking to bypass the GDPR by claiming it must process users&#8217; data because it&#8217;s &#8220;necessary for the performance of a contract,&#8221; as <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/facebooks-gdpr-bypass-reaches-austrian-supreme-court">noyb explains here</a>.</p>
<p>A court in Vienna accepted this &#8220;GDPR consent bypass&#8221; sleight of hand, dealing a blow to European privacy campaigners.</p>
<p>But an appeal reached the Austrian Supreme Court in March &#8212; and a referral could be made to Europe&#8217;s top court.</p>
<p>If that happens it would then be up to the CJEU to weigh in whether such a massive loophole in the EU&#8217;s flagship data protection framework should really be allowed to stand. But that process could still take over a year or longer.</p>
<p>In the short term, the result is yet more delay for Europeans trying to exercise their rights against platform giants and their in-house armies of lawyers.</p>
<p>In a more positive development for privacy rights, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/cjeu-ruling-could-open-big-tech-to-more-privacy-litigation-in-europe/">recent ruling</a> by the CJEU bolstered the case for data protection agencies across the EU to bring actions against tech giants if they see an urgent threat to users &#8212; and believe a lead supervisor is failing to act.</p>
<p>That ruling could help unblock some GDPR enforcement against the most powerful tech companies at the regulatory level, potentially reducing the blockages created by bottlenecks such as Ireland.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s EU to U.S. data flows are also now facing the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">possibility of a suspension order in a matter of months</a> &#8212; related to another piece of litigation brought by Schrems that hinges on the conflict between EU fundamental rights and U.S. surveillance law.</p>
<p>The CJEU weighed in on that last summer with a judgment that requires regulators like Ireland to act when user data is at risk. (Germany&#8217;s federal data protection commissioner, for instance, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/german-government-bodies-urged-to-remove-their-facebook-pages-before-next-year/">warned government bodies to shut their official Facebook pages</a> ahead of planned enforcement action at the start of next year.)</p>
<p>So while Facebook has been spectacularly successful at kicking Europe&#8217;s privacy rights claims down the road, for well over a decade, its strategy of legal delay tactics to shield a privacy-hostile business model could finally hit a geopolitical brick wall.</p>
<p>The tech giant has sought to lobby against this threat to its business by suggesting it might switch off its service in Europe if the regulator follows through on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling/">preliminary suspension order last year</a>.</p>
<p>But it has also publicly denied it would actually follow through and close service in Europe.</p>
<p>How might Facebook actually comply if ordered to cut off EU data flows? <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/max-schrems-on-the-eu-court-ruling-that-could-cut-facebook-in-two/">Schrems has argued</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> it may need to federate its service and store European users&#8217; data inside the EU in order to comply with the eponymous Schrems II CJEU ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Albeit, Facebook has certainly shown itself adept at exploiting the gaps between Europeans&#8217; on-paper rights, national case law and the various EU and member state institutions involved in oversight and enforcement as a tactic to defend its commercial priorities &#8212; playing different players and pushing agendas to further its business interests. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">So whether any single piece of EU privacy litigation will prove to be the silver bullet that forces a reboot of its privacy-hostile business model very much remains to be seen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">A perhaps more likely scenario is that each of these cases further erodes user trust in Facebook&#8217;s services &#8212; reducing people&#8217;s appetite to use its apps and expanding opportunities for rights-respecting competitors to poach custom by offering something better. </span></p>
