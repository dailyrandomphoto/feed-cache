										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Unity, the platform that develops 2D and 3D content for mobile phones, tablets, PCs, consoles, and augmented and virtual reality devices, launches a beta version of <a href="https://unity.com/solutions/gaming-services"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unity Gaming Services</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> – a new platform that provides everything game creators need such as backend, monetization, user acquisition, and player engagement. The updated version promises to make it easier for developers to launch cross-platform, multiplayer games &#8212; a <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/mobile-gaming/2021-gaming-spotlight/">growing</a> segment of the market that includes hit titles like Roblox, Genshin Impact, and Fortnite, among others.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The new platform is launching available globally with more than 100 developers on the platform, Ingrid Lestiyo, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Operate Solutions at Unit told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The new tools will include things developers need to build live games of any size, including the ability to sync their game logic with Unity&#8217;s backend services without needing to go through a platform release process. Among the tools provided are those that enable multiplayer gameplay, like those for connecting players, creating lobbies, matching online players, enabling in-game voice and chat, and more. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221709" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“This is simple. We are the fastest way to make cross-platform multiplayer games, and getting your multiplayer game live is clicks away through the Unity editor,” Lestiyo told TechCrunch. “We also make it easy for teams of any size to mix-and-match products to best suit their needs. Our products are also interoperable with one another, which makes for both a better developer and player experience.” </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Developers will also get an overview of their game&#8217;s performance and be able to see actionable insights in one place. And they&#8217;ll be able to monetize and grow their game with tools that help with in-app purchases, ads and user acquisition. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“No matter how complex their tools or content, they can now monitor their game’s performance in a single, connected interface,” Lestiyo said. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unity Game Services is open to all developers for free during its beta period and developers only pay as they scale. It&#8217;s available for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, and Windows. Console support is currently on an invite-only basis but will be made available soon, Lestiyo said. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ac_N59a7_Os?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lestiyo declined to comment on any potential partnership deals at this stage but said it encourages teams and studios of all sizes to try out the new Unity Gaming Services Platform. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Our mission to enable success for our developers, who today are managing an increasingly complex new reality that needs to meet growing player demand for cross-platform multiplayer games and at the same time requires tremendous cloud networking expertise and presents technical and operational challenges far beyond game design itself,” Lestiyo said. “With such growing player demand for cross-platform multiplayer games, Unity Gaming Service reduces the barrier to entry for developers to launch more multiplayer games that collectively will expand the size of the industry, and titles available for play.” </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unity has more than 3.4 billion monthly active users as of June 2021, Unity claimed. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[In a blinding flash of humility, TMTG allows that taking on public cloud and fintech infrastructure giants is more a "long-term" goal, not something it intends to get busy on right away.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Now out of office, news regarding former President Donald Trump has been rather lacking from TechCrunch&#8217;s pages. He&#8217;s back.</p>
<p>News broke yesterday that <a href="https://www.tmtgcorp.com/">Trump Media &amp; Technology Group</a>, a concern formed to take on a host of major technology and media companies, <a href="https://www.tmtgcorp.com/press-releases/announcement-10-20-2021/">plans to go public</a> via a merger with a SPAC. The blank-check company in question, Digital World Acquisition Corp., <a href="https://www.accesswire.com/viewarticle.aspx?id=663216">recently raised $287.5 million</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The merger of Trump Media &amp; Technology Group &#8212; TMTG from here on out &#8212; and Digital World will sport &#8220;an initial enterprise value of $875 Million,&#8221; with the potential for another $825 million in capital &#8220;depending on the performance of the stock price post-business combination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Per the release disclosing the transaction, &#8220;Trump Media &amp; Technology Group’s growth plans initially will be funded by DWAC’s cash in trust[.]&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220368 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Yeah, I&#8217;ll bet.</p>
<p>The former president has apparently decided that funding the company that bears his name would be too expensive, so he&#8217;s leveraging a SPAC to underwrite the effort.</p>
<p>Regardless of how we feel about <em>that</em>, we have to take this news item seriously. Because when the name of the company says &#8220;Media &amp; Technology,&#8221; it apparently means it. An <a href="https://tmtgcorp.com/static/tmtg-company-overview-f6cfb16513c78a61681aea3bbdae7a78.pdf">overview of the TMTG company</a> shows huge aspirations &#8212; if limited evidence of actual progress. A quarter-billion dollars will certainly help.</p>
<p>First, some notes on the money in the deal. And then an overview of what TMTG wants to build.</p>
<h2>Are we being punished?</h2>
<p>Yes. Clearly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founded by entrepreneur Parker Conrad in 2013, the HR company Zenefits was quickly anointed one of the fast-growing companies in Silicon Valley, with a valuation that soared to $4.5 billion within three years. Then it began to fall apart. The company was discovered to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/williamalden/zenefits-under-scrutiny-for-flouting-insurance-laws#.ca87pxy0l">face compliance issues</a>. Conrad was forced to resign. And Zenefits&#8217;s valuation was slashed in half, with more than 60% of the company&#8217;s employees laid off over numerous rounds of layoffs.</p>
<p>If Conrad wallowed in self-pity afterward, he didn&#8217;t do it long. Within months of leaving Zenefits in 2016, he formed <a href="https://www.rippling.com/">Rippling</a>, a company originally focused on the process of onboarding employees but that has since come to manage all aspects of employee data, from payroll and benefits, to the apps employees use, to a device management platform that enables Rippling&#8217;s customers to retrieve, wipe clean, and store employee computers when staffers part ways with a company.</p>
<p>In fact, there are now so many lines of revenue that Rippling just closed on $250 million in fresh funding led by Sequoia Capital Global Equities and Global Growth, with participation from earlier backers Greenoaks, Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Initialized, YC, and Threshold Ventures.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221525" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The round brings Rippling&#8217;s total funding to $450 million. It also values Rippling at $6.5 billion, making it more valuable than Zenefits ever was before it sold a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2021/03/18/zenefits-once-worth-45-billion-does-deal-with-private-equity-firm-that-gives-it-control/?sh=57a949123873">controlling interest</a> earlier this year to a private equity firm.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wvhGtF9eb0"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/rippling-launches-computer-inventory-management-as-more-workers-remain-remote/">Rippling launches computer inventory management as more workers remain remote</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rippling launches computer inventory management as more workers remain remote&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/rippling-launches-computer-inventory-management-as-more-workers-remain-remote/embed/#?secret=wvhGtF9eb0" data-secret="wvhGtF9eb0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Conrad thinks it could easily grow from here. Asked if Rippling has received interest from an acquirer like, say Microsoft, he says the &#8220;right analog&#8221; for Rippling <em>is</em> Microsoft. &#8220;Our view is that Rippling is not just going to double in the future, but maybe grow by some much, much larger multiple over time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Conrad largely credits Rippling&#8217;s &#8220;compound&#8221; model, wherein instead of focus narrowly on one smaller software sector, it has, from its outset, focused on growing numerous business lines simultaneously that share components which can be easily integrated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s an approach that Rippling can execute by pulling founders into the fold, says Conrad, who offers that of Rippling&#8217;s now roughly 800 employees, 47 are former founders and many are in general manager type roles where they enjoy both security and the autonomy that they cherish.</p>
<p>(They build new business lines in-house; Rippling isn&#8217;t an acquisitive outfit, Conrad makes clear.)</p>
<p>That compound approach also enables Rippling to sell a bundled system of its offerings to customers on a mostly per-seat basis.</p>
<p>Not last, the way that Rippling is structured means more diversified revenue, which is something that investors such as Sequoia like to see.</p>
<p>Certainly, more of those dollars are flowing in, according to Conrad. He says that Rippling has more than doubled its number of customers over the last year and that it now enjoys 2.7 times the annual recurring revenue it saw a year ago, even while he declines to be more specific about how much revenue that equals.</p>
<p>&#8220;I made that mistake the last time around [at Zenefits], and I predicted where our revenue was gonna go, and then we didn&#8217;t get there.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for how investors arrived at that $6.5 billion figure exactly, Conrad figuratively throws up his hands. &#8220;Man, you&#8217;re asking the wrong person. I see one deal every two years, which is the fundraising that we do as a company [whereas] I know that investors are seeing multiple deals a week.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I want to do,&#8221; adds Conrad, &#8220;is just go out and put our best foot forward in a fundraising process.I studiously never have an opinion about what the price of the company should be and [instead] let investors tell me what they think is a fair price.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>We have more from our talk with Conrad coming; stay tuned. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the digital world, many professional service firms are still working to get caught up &#8212; especially the smaller players.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, </span><a href="https://www.b12.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">B12</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that is focused on helping those smaller professional service organizations such as law and accounting firms or mortgage brokerages more easily accept online payments and build a digital presence in general, announced it has raised $15.7 million in funding led by Tola Capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breyer Capital, General Catalyst, Naval Ravikant and others also put money in the round, which brings B12&#8217;s total funding to $28.1 million.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221334" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">B12 co-founder and CEO Nitesh Banta is a former investor at General Catalyst &#8212; having worked at the firm from 2010 to 2015. He teamed up with MIT grad Adam Marcus in 2015 to found B12 with the mission of helping small professional service firms “own their digital identity and customer relationships” and give people a way to buy services online. It does things like help these firms with building a website, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">effective SEO, email marketing/automation, online scheduling and, of course, online payments and invoicing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banta said he was inspired to start the company because his own father was a small business owner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York-based B12 markets itself as an “all-in-one solution that helps professional services firms establish, run, and grow their business online.” It claims to get customers set up within 30 days and help them compete against larger online platforms such as LegalZoom, Better and Fiverr.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far more than</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 150,000 companies have signed up for B12 and the startup has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“thousands” of paying customers. Revenue has grown “over 50x” since the company’s 2016 funding. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From January to August 2021, monthly payment volume on B12 has increased “15.2x,” according to Banta.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a SaaS company, B12 makes money by selling its software via a subscription &#8212; starting at $29 a month and up to $599, depending on what a customer signs up for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, B12’s model has evolved as the pandemic accelerated digital everything, including payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For a long time, we&#8217;ve really focused on this web presence space and we&#8217;re super excited to share with the world this payments feature as being a really unique way for this segment to work with their customers online,” Banta told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Catalyst Managing Director Larry Bohn has been a believer in B12 since its early days. The firm first invested in the company in 2016, leading its $12.4 million funding round. He said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">his firm had a long history with the founding team of B12 (particularly Banta) and believed they “have proven to be effective operators.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also have a lot of experience in this industry, having led investments in Big Commerce and more, and believe that B12 is uniquely positioned to help professional service businesses with their digital transformation,” he wrote via email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his view, the company’s model is unique in that it helps professional service businesses grow online by using artificial intelligence “to power their go-to-market model of service,” which Bohn said gives companies “the latest technology, but with a radically easy approach to implementation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron Fleishman, partner at Tola Capital, agrees that B12 sets up and activates firms to give their clients &#8220;a seamless experience&#8221; &#8212; from signing contracts with eSignatures to paying online for services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">B12 plans to use the new financing to accelerate growth, do some hiring and continue building out its product suite. In conjunction with announcing its latest raise, the startup is also revealing today a new “Client Engagement” product designed to help professional services firms connect with clients, offer services and automate administrative tasks “so they can sell online from a centralized platform.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA has been encouraging private industry to replace the aging ISS with a commercial successor for quite a while now, and while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/axiom-space-raises-130-million-for-its-commercial-space-station-ambitions/">Axiom Space has already expressed its intent</a> to do so eventually, a new consortium made up of Nanoracks, Voyager Space and Lockheed Martin now say they&#8217;ll create the &#8220;first-ever free flying commercial space station&#8221; with planned operation to begin in 2027.</p>
<p>The new space station will be called &#8220;Starlab,&#8221; a name that recalls the third ever U.S. space station, Skylab. Starlab will host a crew of four astronauts, and will be much smaller than the ISS — offering about a third of that station&#8217;s total pressurized space for human occupancy. The smaller size means that the group building the station expect it to be able to be sent up to orbit in a single launch, rather than piecemeal in parts like the existing ISS and Chinese space station.</p>
<p>This team has ample experience in in-space operations, with Nanoracks (which is now majority owned by Voyager) having designed and built a number of elements used today in the ISS. Voyager will be providing strategic guidance and capital investment to the project, while Lockheed Martin will be the primary manufacturer of Starlab, as well as the integrator putting together the various technical pieces of the puzzle.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221697" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The primary component of the station will be an inflatable habitat module created by Lockheed, alongside a docking node for visiting cargo and crew ferry spacecraft, as well as a robotic arm like the one found on the space station for assisting with cargo and payload manipulation outside of the station.</p>
<p>Potential crew will include public and private researchers, manufacturers and scientists, as well as commercial customers like space tourists, the company has said. NASA&#8217;s intent with private stations is to become one client among many, in order to make continuous occupation of space more sustainable for the agency while making the most of public funds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://viaseparations.com/">Via Separations</a> is a startup from a couple of MIT material science engineers who figured out a way to reduce the amount of energy required in a manufacturing process, resulting in lower carbon creation, lower energy usage and lower costs. Today, the company announced a $38 million Series B.</p>
<p>The round was led by NGP ETP, a firm that focuses on investments that lower carbon emissions. In addition, 2040 Foundation participated, along with existing investors The Engine, Safar Partners, Prime Impact Fund, Embark Ventures and Massachusetts Clean Energy Center.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Shreya Dave says the company hopes that by reducing carbon in the manufacturing process, they can help consumers make more green buying choices because the things they buy will have resulted in less carbon creation during manufacturing.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221650" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Basically our vision is if we can decarbonize that supply chain infrastructure, then we don&#8217;t have to rely on consumers having to make a decision between the thing that they want and how to do good for the planet,&#8221; she told me.</p>
<p>The Via solution sits in a shipping container in the middle of the manufacturing process and acts as a filtration system for whatever is being produced. Dave uses a pasta pot analogy to describe how the filtering process works. &#8220;Instead of going into a pot where the water gets boiled off using heat, it goes through a strainer, where we [apply] pressure in order to force it through a filter like a pasta strainer,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>She said that has a couple of advantages. First of all, it reduces the amount of energy required because it&#8217;s using electricity instead of heat, which is using 90% less energy than a heat-based process. What&#8217;s more, because the process is using electricity, if you can get that from renewable energy, then you&#8217;re both electrifying and improving the energy efficiency of the process.</p>
<p>As an early startup building a complex solution, Via has decided to concentrate on the $5 billion pulp paper industry for now, but the technology could be more broadly applicable in other industries like petrochemicals, food and beverages, and pharmaceuticals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has been working on three pilot projects, but the goal is to eventually offer this solution as a service, which reduces overall capital costs for customers and puts the maintenance burden on the company instead of the customer. They are also building a software monitoring solution to keep an eye on their products as they get deployed to help customers maximize impact and catch any maintenance issues early.</p>
<p>Via spun out from MIT in 2017 and today has 23 employees with a goal of reaching 30 by the end of the year. As a diverse founding team, Dave says she and co-founder and CTO Brent Keller want to build a diverse group of employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;My philosophy is that there is a diverse candidate for every job opportunity that we&#8217;re hiring for, but there&#8217;s also a reality of resource constraints. And so we try to allocate our resources to get the widest perspective,&#8221; she said. That may mean hiring based on potential, rather than experience. She says they have also implemented rigorous anti-bias training in the hiring process.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The startup idea has its roots in research that Dave and Keller were doing as graduate students at MIT with their professor Jeffrey Grossman, who is chief scientist at the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;My co-founder and I were working on water filtration membranes and looking at how to take salt out of the water to make that process cheaper, better, faster. What we learned is that what we had invented didn&#8217;t have a lot of application in water, but had a lot of potential for chemical manufacturing for this raw material, for stuff that wasn&#8217;t water,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p>When they launched the company, they ended up shifting their focus to industrial manufacturing, which is much more impactful from a greenhouse gas perspective, a point that is particularly important to the founders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://newrelic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NewRelic</a>, the observability platform, has made an acquisition and is launching a new service on the back of it to bring a new dimension into bigger strategy to bring developers and operations closer together. It has acquired <a href="https://www.codestream.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CodeStream</a>, an application that works within integrated developer environments to let developers write related notes to each other alongside the code itself.</p>
<p>NewRelic has integrated it already with NewRelic One, its full-stack data analysis platform covering metrics, events and logs, and will be launching a new service within that called NewRelic CodeStream. It is also announcing a partnership with Microsoft to integrate the new product into its own IDEs and other chat and collaboration products such as VS Code, Visual Studio, Teams and GitHub.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal have not been disclosed except that it was &#8220;competitive&#8221; according to Peter Pezaris, the co-founder and CEO of CodeStream. CodeStream was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/08/codestream-wants-to-move-developer-chat-straight-to-the-source-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part of the Y Combinator Winter 2018 cohort</a>, it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/16/codestream-lets-you-collaborate-and-talk-directly-in-vs-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised around $3 million</a>, and was/is being used by tens of thousands of developers, including people at Microsoft, Hearst, Atlassian, Zenefits and a number of others.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221643" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>(It also already worked, as an independent startup, with Visual Studio and VS Code, along with JetBrains. It also supports <span class="bright-bold">pull requests</span><strong> </strong>from GitHub, BitBucket and GitLab, <span class="bright-bold">issue management</span> from Jira, Trello, Asana and 9 others, observability from New Relic One and Pixie, and provides <span class="bright-bold">code discussion</span> that ties it all together, integrated with Slack, MS Teams, email, and in-editor notifications. It seems that all of this will continue to be supported with the Microsoft integrations becoming deeper.)</p>
<p>The combined company will have 750 businesses as customers.</p>
<p>The deal underscores a few trends in the world of DevOps. First, there is some consolidation underfoot, and NewRelic, positioning itself as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/new-relic-launches-developer-platform-to-build-custom-apps-on-top-of-new-relic-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">platform</a>, is looking to bring more functionality into its toolset.</p>
<p>That would also have meant potentially a more challenging sell for CodeStream over time, too, since customers naturally might want to buy observability and communication tools together, as well as see their functionalities become closer over time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Working with <span class="il">New</span> <span class="il">Relic</span> was a no-brainer because of the strategic alignment we saw between our two companies,&#8221; Peter Pezaris, CEO and co-founder of CodeStream, told TechCrunch. &#8220;I am fortunate to have worked with the same team of founders for the past 26 years, having founded, built, and sold four companies in that time. In every case, we have been able to scale more quickly and unlock more value within the larger company, so this is a particularly exciting time for us.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Our team also felt an alignment with <span class="il">New</span> <span class="il">Relic</span>’s values and determined that we could actually accelerate our mission by joining forces with <span class="il">New</span> <span class="il">Relic</span> &#8212; aligning with the resources, team and customer base that <span class="il">New</span> <span class="il">Relic</span> has built-in. Our team at CodeStream was also very impressed with the <span class="il">New</span> <span class="il">Relic</span> One platform, and felt that our solution could make it even better for developers to not only extend code collaboration but also unlock the power of telemetry data and observability right in the IDE.&#8221;</p>
<p>CodeStream also fits into that consolidation mix by giving NewRelic an important entry point into the second trend that this deal touches on.</p>
<p>That second trend is that collaboration is the name of the game these days in enterprise software. That also very much goes for developers, who are working across disparate geographies and often spaces of time on projects, and need better ways of communicating their thinking and additional notes to each other now and in the future.</p>
<p>As Romain pointed out when covering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/16/codestream-lets-you-collaborate-and-talk-directly-in-vs-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CodeStream&#8217;s integration with VS Code</a>, a number of applications now feature &#8220;conversation&#8221; channels for those creating content to talk in more detail in the margins about what is going on, and Slack (or another equivalent) should not have to be the default component for that, and that especially counts if you can build something that specifically suits users&#8217; needs more specifically.</p>
<p>In the case of the new launch today, NewRelic says that those interested in trying out the service can sign up for NewRelic One for a free trial. The CodeStream product allows users not only to write notes to each other in the margins of the code, but to create a stream that will let those reading jump directly from a chat note to the line of code in question.</p>
<p>The third trend is the ongoing expansion of DevOps as a salient category in enterprise software. The move to bigger projects, more developers, new IT architectures and technologies and new security and other challenges has all led to a gradual elevation of developers as a critically important component of how organizations are run and how they grow.</p>
<p>That has in turn led to an ever-growing business for services built to cater to them. NewRelic, citing estimates from Redpoint, says that the observability market alone has a total addressable market of $35 billion and is seeing double-digit growth annually.</p>
<p>“Developer workflows are the backbone of all modern companies, and observability as an engineering practice presents a future where these essential developer workflows are fueled by data  – not mere opinion,” said <span class="il">New</span> <span class="il">Relic</span> CEO Bill Staples in a statement. “To accelerate this shared mission to make observability a data-driven daily practice for every engineer, we are bringing production telemetry and collaboration tools to where developers create and flow — the IDE. By launching <span class="il">New</span> <span class="il">Relic</span> CodeStream and joining forces with Microsoft, we are excited to deliver a truly developer-centric experience to millions of developers across our shared communities.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;DevOps is fundamentally about tightening the orchestration between developers and operations folks,&#8221; added Buddy Brewer, GM of New Relic, in a note to TechCrunch. &#8220;Which is why CodeStream stood out to us. As the leading company working to tackle code collaboration for developers, they’ve made it their mission to get technical teams understanding and communicating more efficiently about their code. With CodeStream, developers can discuss their code right in their development environment and save those discussions to build a referenceable, evolving knowledge base. Normally, developers would engage in a clunkier process of copy/pasting  specific lines of code into Slack, Teams, or whatever chat function they are using, and explaining the context and their question, which creates a ton of friction and time loss across teams.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is also the rationale behind why Microsoft is also teaming up with the company, although to me it does leave a question hanging, which is whether Microsoft will try to get more directly involved in this aspect of developer services itself over time. It would make sense, considering how many environments where it is going to be integrating this particular solution.</p>
<p>“Developers are essential to helping organizations in every industry accelerate the use of <span class="il">new</span> capabilities. Our goal at Microsoft is to provide a wide range of services to address the real-world needs of customers,” said Scott Guthrie, executive vice president, Cloud + AI, Microsoft, in a statement. “With partners like <span class="il">New</span> <span class="il">Relic</span>, it&#8217;s exciting to see comprehensive integration support with <span class="il">New</span> <span class="il">Relic</span> CodeStream, spanning multiple Microsoft platforms and products: VS Code, Visual Studio, .NET, GitHub, Microsoft Teams and Azure DevOps, to name a few. Tighter collaboration between development projects and improved connections between existing applications are just some of the benefits <span class="il">New</span> <span class="il">Relic</span> CodeStream will provide to the developer community.&#8221;</p>

According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-20/apple-will-force-unvaccinated-office-workers-to-get-tested-daily?sref=10lNAhZ9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the tech giant will start requiring all unvaccinated corporate employees to be tested for COVID-19 every time they have to work in the office instead of working from home. Back in September, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vaccination-status-report-185408210.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">reported</a> that Apple asked employees to share their vaccination status voluntarily. Those who refuse to share their vaccine status will also have to undergo daily testing, while vaccinated office workers will only have to do rapid testing once a week.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s retail store employees, however, won&#8217;t be subjected to daily tests despite having consumer-facing jobs. Unvaccinated staff members are required to be tested twice a week. Like Apple&#8217;s office workers, vaccinated staff will only have to undergo weekly rapid testing. It&#8217;s unclear if the tech giant will ever issue a COVID-19 vaccine mandate, but the Biden administration previously gave all federal contractors a December 8th deadline to require all their employees to be inoculated against the virus. As <em>Bloomberg</em> notes, Apple sells products to the US government.</p>
<p>For now, Apple has reportedly given employees an October 24th deadline to report and show proof of their vaccination status, so it could implement the new rules starting on November 1st. Unvaccinated employees will have to pick-up at-home rapid tests from Apple offices and stores, do the test themselves and then report their results through an internal app.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221665" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify has already invested <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/12/spotify-continues-its-podcast-shopping-spree/">around $1 billion</a> in podcasting between its acquisitions, exclusive deals, and other partnerships. Now, it wants people to do more than just listen &#8212; it wants them to watch, too. The company announced today it&#8217;s opening up access to a new tool for creators that will allow them to begin publishing their video podcasts to its service. The tool will be provided by the company&#8217;s podcast creation platform Anchor, and expands on <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/12/spotify-continues-its-podcast-shopping-spree/">the global launch of video podcasts last year</a> which encompassed only a select group of creators.</p>
<p>At the time, Spotify said its debut lineup of video podcasts included Spotify Originals and Exclusives, as well as some third-party podcasts. But there wasn&#8217;t a way for any creator to publish video to the service. Instead, they would have to turn to other video platforms, like YouTube.</p>
<p>Now, that&#8217;s changing. With Anchor, creators will be able to upload their videos through their account, similar to how they create and publish audio episodes today. Once published, fans can listen to the podcasts across platforms, including through the Spotify mobile app, desktop app, web player, and on most smart TVs and game consoles. Creators will also be able to monetize their videos as they do their audio podcasts through the use of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/spotifys-podcasts-subscriptions-service-is-now-open-to-all-u-s-creators/">subscriptions</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221335" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While creators can set their pricing and determine what a subscription includes, Spotify suggests subscriptions could provide access to exclusive video content or even unlock the video portion of the creator&#8217;s podcasts. The video podcasts can also incorporate the creator&#8217;s existing advertising partnerships and soon, they&#8217;ll support the newer <a href="https://anchor.fm/ads">Automated Ads</a>, too.</p>
<p>While Spotify is officially opening up access to Anchor creators, the feature is being rolled out gradually. That means interested creators will have to sign up for a <a href="http://anchor.fm/video">waitlist</a> for the time being.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Spotify&#8217;s video lineup will include video podcasts from its Originals and Exclusives, like The Ringer’s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0KsFDwCqXyZS1M8dh0tp76?si=VI_zn5L8QTmwQsi14jStFA&amp;nd=1">Higher Learning with Van Lethan and Rachel Lindsay</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4rOoJ6Egrf8K2IrywzwOMk?si=VO4mgUQhS0umteOlOUSQRg&amp;nd=1">The Joe Rogan Experience</a>; and it will include other video creators who will now publish on Spotify, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClFSU9_bUb4Rc6OYfTt5SPw">Philip DeFranco</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jasminechiswell?lang=en">Jasmine Chiswell</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5l8IBkxX6pgPPfEL6AI57O?si=btHwk1KRRgqQtOL6p_PG2w&amp;nd=1">The WAN Show</a>,<br />
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/1zsZEElOM8NBrgVvZ48gsO?si=9mfQm8WuTiqOr-N6yl7qyQ&amp;nd=1">Juicy Scoop with Heather McDonald</a>, and more to come.</p>
<p>Spotify has tried and failed to expand into video in years past. Its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/11/spotifys-first-original-videos-are-boring-behind-the-music-cartoons/">first efforts in original video</a> half a decade ago largely flopped, and the company shelved its video plans for some time. But more recently, the company signaled its potential interest in returning to video when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/spotify-is-buying-the-ringer-to-boost-its-sports-podcast-content/">acquired</a> sports network The Ringer, which <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/02/spotify-is-buying-the-ringer-expanding-its-podcast-footprint-and-dipping-its-audio-toes-into-plain-old-text/">came with</a> a YouTube-based video operation. It then went on to make more deals that could translate to video, like the one with <a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/addison-rae-podcast-spotify-exclusive-1234709818/">TikTok star, turned Netflix actress, Addison Rae.</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The expansion of video to more podcast creators directly follows news that YouTube is now also considering investing further in its own podcasting efforts. Bloomberg this month <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-05/youtube-looks-to-hire-its-first-executive-focused-on-podcasts">reported</a> the company is hiring its first executive focused on podcasts. This may have encouraged Spotify to promote its own video podcasting efforts, even though the actual access to start uploading is still blocked by a waitlist.</p>
<p>Currently, to find video content on Spotify, you&#8217;ll need to navigate to the episode page from the show you want to watch, then hit play to start the episode. From the play bar at the bottom of the screen, you can tap to view the video in full-screen mode. You can then choose to either listen or watch the program, depending on what you&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t yet an easy way to see all the podcasts that are video-enabled, however. Spotify also declined to share how many podcasts would be available as videos at launch, but said it expected to have rolled out access to &#8220;thousands&#8221; by year-end.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Three months after announcing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/yummy-raises-4m-aims-to-be-super-app-of-venezuela/">$4 million seed round</a>, Venezuelan delivery super app Yummy is back with an $18 million Series A round that will accelerate the company’s proposed expansion throughout Latin America.</p>
<p>Anthos Capital led the latest round, with additional participation from JAM Fund, whose founder Justin Mateen was an investor in the seed round.</p>
<p>Yummy was started by Vicente Zavarce in 2020 and has amassed over 200,000 registered users so far. He came to the United States for school and stayed to work in marketing roles at Postmates, Wayfair and Getaround before starting Yummy. The app, which includes both delivery and ridesharing, can be downloaded for free, and the company charges a delivery fee or merchant fee.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221113" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>“We can’t wait to be live in every city in Venezuela with both Yummy Delivery and Yummy Rides, and continue our expansion across LatAM,” Zavarce said via email. “We want to become a part of everyone’s daily life and put the local economy in the hands of our users, while creating a way to earn in U.S dollars for thousands of Yummers and drivers.”</p>
<p>The company launched this month in Peru and Chile. Yummy plans to have 50 active dark stores in each country by the end of 2022, touting that it will be able to deliver more than 2,000 products in less than 15 minutes.</p>
<p>It is already processing over 340,000 monthly transactions in Venezuela, with a consistent growth of over 35% for the past four months. Yummy already has a network of over 5,000 drivers across its delivery and ridesharing operation across 12 cities in Venezuela that make this possible.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://thefund.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Fund</a> is raising a new angel investment fund, dubbed <a href="https://thefund.vc/community/xx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Fund XX</a>, that is pulling together a community of women investors and entrepreneurs that will make pre-seed and seed stage investments.</p>
<p>Jenny Fielding, managing director of Techstars and one of the founders of The Fund, said the organization was started in 2018 by a group that pooled its network, capital and resources together to take a community-driven approach to angel investing. The Fund overall has invested in 140 companies.</p>
<p>This is The Fund’s first investment vehicle focused on female founders. It is only half closed, so Fielding was not able to say how much it would ultimately raise, but did say that previous funds raised between $2 million and $4 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221483" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2221486" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221486" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2221486" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-1.jpeg?w=680" alt="The Fund, The Fund XX" width="680" height="486" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-1.jpeg 700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-1.jpeg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-1.jpeg?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-1.jpeg?resize=680,486 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-1.jpeg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221486" class="wp-caption-text">The Fund XX investment committee, clockwise from left, Allison<br />Stoloff, Ragini Holloway, Gabriela Isturiz, and Sylvia Kuyel</p></div></p>
<p>On the investment committee for The Fund XX are Ragini Holloway, senior vice president of people at Affirm; Allison Stoloff, an operator with previous roles at Knotel, Oscar and Facebook; Gabriela Isturiz, Founder of eBillingHub and Bellefield Systems; and Sylvia Kuyel, vice president of revenue at JumpCloud.</p>
<p>Stoloff says the fund is specific about investing in companies that are not only women-led, but also where women are the CEO.</p>
<p>“They also have to be venture-backable and tech-enabled,” she added. “We believe women are building $1 billion businesses, and we have an advantage in finding them. We get to see deals before venture capitalists, and our secret sauce is our network of LPs that helps us get to know amazing founders.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While it has become easier for someone to become an angel investor, they noticed that women weren’t showing up on top 10 lists of the most active syndicates on investment platforms like AngelList even though women make up 22% of angel investors, Kuyel said. She believes this suggests that women don’t make as many investments, and when they do, it is in fewer dollars.</p>
<p>The Fund XX is sector agnostic, and the group has not yet made its first investment. Its focus is building a community that will remove these hurdles and unlock opportunities for both investors and startups, as well as attracting new women to the ecosystem.</p>
<p>“For at least 50% of LPs, this is their first time making an investment,” Stoloff said. “Even though women may not have done this before, they are two times more likely to invest in other women. This is going to have long-term positive effects and bring more women investors into the ecosystem.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ishveen Anand grew up in England playing sports all of her life, including during her time at Oxford. She wanted to do something sporty for a career and “fell in love” with sponsorship marketing.</p>
<p>However, what she found was that the process was inefficient — the sports world was slow-moving in terms of brands getting contracts with athletes. She thought with the rise of influencers, there should be something like an “Airbnb meets LinkedIn” for the industry, Anand told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Combining both of her passions, in 2016, she started <a href="https://www.opensponsorship.com/">OpenSponsorship</a>, a sports sponsorship company, with Ron Nesbitt, and today, announced a $4 million growth round.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221184" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>The round is led by Philadelphia 76ers owner David Blitzer, who is joined by Eric Stern and executives from WWE and Excel Sports Management. Other notable investors include Jeffrey Talpins, Alex Jung with Isos Capital, NHL player Alex Killorn, and Nike director Shaherose Charania.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used to continue building out the product and integrations. Anand plans for expansion into new verticals, sales and marketing.</p>
<p>OpenSponsorship has 15 employees and is on target to do $5 million in top line revenue and $1.5 million in net revenue this year, and has facilitated over 10,000 deals across 400 brands.</p>
<p>Brands create an account on OpenSponsorship by choosing a subscription plan. Then they can search through athletes, teams and events, including filtering down to those that fit a need, like social media, logo placement or appearances. Then the user will create a campaign and either choose an athlete or let OpenSponsorship do the work. From there, the brand can launch and measure the success of the campaign.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Sponsorship is a $60 billion industry, and we are redefining what sponsorship means,” Anand said. “It can be digital, repurposing content and photoshoots. We want to make sponsorship cool and accessible.”</p>
<p>Prior to this latest funding, the company raised a pre-seed round of $1.3 million from investors that included 500 Startups after being in their program in 2016. Since then the company touts the largest marketplace of athletes, over 11,000, and works with companies like Walmart, Foot Locker and Levi’s.</p>
<p>Anand finds that local advertising benefits from sports sponsorships because athletes often stay in their hometowns. And with influencer marketing skewing female, some of her clients find athletes help them reach male audiences.</p>
<p>The additional funding will enable the company to test new verticals, like music, which she finds has a similar supply and demand.</p>
<p>“People want to have flexibility, but traditional sponsorship didn’t always allow for that,” she added. “Instead, brands were locked into multiyear contracts with one athlete. We have come a long way, and if you have a $100,000 budget, you can now spread it over 10 athletes and have variety across the industry.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Moves, a Toronto-based gig economy fintech startup, wants to reward gig workers with stocks from the companies for which they drive. The first version of the Moves Collective, as the startup&#8217;s new service is called, launches on Thursday with Uber stocks available and then quickly offer Lyft, DoorDash and Grubhub shares, says CEO of Moves, Matt Spoke.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Moves&#8217;s thesis is this: If gig workers become shareholders, they might feel more economic alignment to the platforms they work for. Furthermore, if enough workers own stocks in these companies through the Moves Collective, they might be able to form a voting bloc in the future and actually influence company decisions. Moves says it already owns a &#8220;significant and growing stake&#8221; in these companies, all of which are common shares with voting rights.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over the past year, poor working conditions for gig economy workers have led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/doordash-workers-protest-outside-ceo-tony-xus-home-demanding-better-pay-tip-transparency-and-ppe/">worker protests</a> and attempts by states like California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York to reclassify gig workers as employees, worthy of all the basic rights that status affords, such as health care, vacation pay and paid sick leave. Companies like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Instacart have fought back against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/californias-gig-worker-prop-22-ruled-unconstitutional-by-superior-court/">the ongoing debacle in California over Prop 22</a> and have formed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/massachussetts-ag-greenlights-uber-lyft-backed-gig-worker-ballot-initiative/">a coalition in Massachusetts</a> to get a proposal on the November 2022 ballot that would classify gig workers as independent contractors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220706" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Gig workers contribute a huge amount of value to the gig economy, but they don&#8217;t get any of the economic returns as a result of the value they&#8217;re contributing, and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re trying to solve for is effectively making them feel like they have an economic stake in the success of the companies that they work for,&#8221; Matt Spoke, CEO of Moves, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Workers who are already a part of the Moves platform – which enables gig workers to track and manage their money from different companies, have access to a monthly spending account and instant business cash advances up to $1,000 – are eligible to sign up for the Collective and receive rewards in the form of stocks. Moves will give workers a series of &#8220;tasks&#8221; to complete, like refer three friends or participate in a user survey, in order to receive free stocks, or fractions of stocks, which then go into the user&#8217;s own brokerage account that Moves has opened for them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the long run, the Moves Collective, aptly named, is meant to bring gig workers together and leverage the power in numbers to create a voice that can be used in corporate governance decisions. Moves would propose proxy material submissions at annual general shareholder meetings of the major platforms in order to ensure the interests of gig workers are heard, says Spoke.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Moves&#8217;s primary business relies on interchange rates that it is accumulated every time a gig worker uses their Moves card to make a purchase, and it&#8217;s that revenue which funds the shares Moves gives back to the workers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We&#8217;re effectively trading off revenue to acquire new customers and hold on to them, if you want to think of it that way,&#8221; said Spoke. &#8220;So the revenues we earn off the use of your checking account are being put back into the product to finance these rewards that are effectively denominated in stocks.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">At the moment, the program is invite-only and shares are accumulated via a partnership with Bumped Financial, a stock rewards program. Spoke says Moves will also keep an eye out for Instacart&#8217;s IPO to purchase stock for its platform, and is even considering supporting Amazon stock for Flex delivery people or Target stock for Shipt workers. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">All of the app-based gig economy companies &#8220;suffer from the same problem,&#8221; says Spoke, &#8220;which is a massively high percentage of driver and <a href="https://www.td.org/insights/has-the-gig-economy-jumped-the-shark#:~:text=Turnover%20for%20traditional%20employees%20is,to%20do%20the%20same%20job.">worker churn rates</a>. Their workers just don&#8217;t stick around. They either leave to go to another gig app or they leave the gig economy altogether. So these companies are spending tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars replacing workers all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">(See: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uber-entices-drivers-back-post-pandemic-with-250-million-stimulus/">Uber spends $250 million</a> to incentivize drivers back to the app, which then results in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/how-uber-plans-to-rebound-from-massive-q2-losses-stemming-from-driver-incentives/">crushing Q2 losses</a>.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Before their IPOs Uber and Lyft considered issuing stock to drivers as a mechanism to increase retention and create worker loyalty, but there are different regulatory issues that got in the way of a sincere effort on the companies&#8217; parts. In the end, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/uber-and-lyft-are-reportedly-giving-drivers-cash-to-buy-shares-in-their-respective-ipos/">the two companies decided to reward some more active drivers with a one-time cash award</a> that gave them the option to buy stock. Uber, for example, set aside 5.4 million shares, which was 3% of total shares, of its common stock for drivers, but said it would offer those to the public if drivers didn&#8217;t scoop them up.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For reference, former Uber founder and CEO Travis Kalanick, who owned 8.6% of Uber at the time of public filing, made about <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/05/10/how-travis-kalanick-other-investors-fared-in-uber-ipo/">$5 billion on his stake</a>, and Alphabet, which owned 5.2% of the company, took home around $3.2 billion. U.S.-based drivers at the time had the option of using cash bonuses which could be used to purchase up to $10,000 worth of company stock.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Companies that rely on the gig economy do have a harder regulatory time giving out stock options to workers. SEC Rule 701 allows companies to issue stock to employees, consultants and advisors as compensation without having to submit detailed financial records, but gig companies don&#8217;t fit neatly into that current exemption. In 2018, the SEC<a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/concept/2018/33-10521.pdf"> called for comment</a> on possible ways to expand the rule to adjust to the changing nature of work relationships. <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-18-18/s71818-4510185-175992.pdf">Uber responded</a>, albeit past the deadline, but with a request that the SEC revise the rule in order to allow &#8220;partners to share in the growth of the company which could lead to enhanced earning and saving opportunities for the partner and for the generations ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As the laws currently stand, if Uber or Lyft were so inclined to incentivize drivers themselves with stocks, it would encroach dangerously on employer territory. However, the company&#8217;s past stance signals it might makes sense to one day outsource this kind of service.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Instacart have come together on topics like Prop 22, they&#8217;re lobbying together against new regulations, and so I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s inconceivable that they would see this as being generally positive for the industry,&#8221; said Spoke. &#8220;Eventually I think we&#8217;re going to end up wanting to find some way to share the economics with them. Fast forward a year or two years, I definitely see us talking to Uber about the tangible benefits that we are able to demonstrate and say, &#8216;A driver that was issued Uber stock is X% more likely to stick around longer, so you should be partially participating in funding this.'&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Moves says it currently has about 10,000 users on its platform across all 50 states. The company was founded in February 2020, right before ride-hailing took a massive pandemic-sized dip, and has been in the markets since April 2021. The plan is to begin fundraising again in the first half of next year, but Spoke said Moves doesn&#8217;t want to do that until it refines the unit economics in the narrative of the business and creates a use case for Moves Collective.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;It&#8217;s not that Uber doesn&#8217;t care about their drivers but that their drivers are not their primary stakeholder,&#8221; said Spoke. &#8220;Their primary stakeholder is their consumer. They do everything they can to innovate value for the consumer side of their markets, and often the workers are sort of an afterthought.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The NFT craze of the past year has triggered an avalanche of crypto capital flowing into art, trading card games, luxury avatars and digital objects but so far, institutional investment firms have largely been keeping a watchful eye on the blockchain-based goods while reserving their capital pools for equity bets on the platforms behind them.</p>
<p>Miami-based <a href="https://www.meta4.capital/">Meta4 Capital</a> wants to buck that trend and put LP dollars into the projects themselves, buying up pixelated toads, digital horses and moderately fatigued apes with investor capital. It&#8217;s a bold proposition that many traditional startup investors might scoff at, but the team has already secured a major endorsement &#8212; a lead investment from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). Meta4 is ultimately targeting a $100 million fund anchored by a16z.</p>
<p>Founders Brandon Buchanan and Nabyl Charania hope they can blaze the trail of funds backed by storied firms entering a market that has largely been known for its lack of predictability. Meta4 is more interested in buying up rare items of established &#8220;blue chip&#8221; NFT projects rather than focusing on quantity. Earlier this year, the team deployed a $1 million pilot fund, using the capital to buy up just 31 NFTs including a pair of <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptopunksbot">CryptoPunks</a>, a <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptoadzNFT">CrypToad</a>, and a handful of<a href="https://twitter.com/zed_run?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"> Zed run</a> horses. They say their investments have already appreciated 500-600% in total value amid a market resurgence in recent months.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221149" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Cult of CryptoPunks&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/the-cult-of-cryptopunks/embed/#?secret=z2d3R5Z1Bn" data-secret="z2d3R5Z1Bn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While NFTs first popped up on the radars of many investors after the $69 million purchase of a Beeple collage back in April, the space has seen a dramatic influx of capital since. In August, NFT platform OpenSea recorded a record $3.4 billion in transaction volume. One of the catalysts for that dramatic surge of investment was business influencer Gary Vaynerchuk buying a rare ape CryptoPunk for $3.76 million. The pace of high-priced deals has continued. This week, a rare <a href="https://twitter.com/BoredApeYC">Bored Ape</a> sold for $2.7 million (it specifically sold for 696.969 ETH).</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m telling investors that the tsunami has not even hit yet; we need this stuff and we need it now &#8212; we need an alien and we need an ape,&#8221; Buchanan told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>What the NFT space has in excitement, it lack in regulatory clarity and often adherence to known rules, as well. While regulatory bodies largely seem focused on major exchanges like Coinbase at the moment, Buchanan, who was previously a securities lawyer before getting involved with the crypto investment world, says that a number of popular NFT projects are drifting into murky territory. Many NFT projects are developing complex mechanisms for returning investor capital, with Buchanan specifically highlighting a handful of projects that reward NFT owners with proprietary tokens over time, something he says behaves an awful lot like a security.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">&#8220;There are reasons that there are some assets that we have not purchased yet,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>New projects are popping up every day, and the explosion of capital has created a number of fast-rising unicorn NFT startups, many of which have been minted by Meta4&#8217;s anchor a16z, including OpenSea, NBA Top Shot-maker Dapper Labs and Axie Infinity-maker Sky Mavis. This summer, a16z launched a $2.2 billion crypto-specific fund. With this fund, Meta4 says they will focus on the art and collectibles and shy away from making equity investments in NFT startups.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think [a16z] has that side of it covered,&#8221; Buchanan says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Running out of inventory not only means you are missing out on sales of popular items, but you may also have to wait awhile to get those items back in stock.</p>
<p>New York-based Toolio has built cloud-based merchandising and inventory planning software to enable retailers to optimize their merchandise planning and make better and faster decisions on what products to have and when to have them.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the company announced an $8 million round of Series A capital. Jump Capital led the round and was joined by Rho Capital’s Ignition Fund and existing investors like Founder Collective, Notation Capital and Max Ventures. The latest funding gives Toolio a total of $10.3 million raised since the company was founded in 2019.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221329" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Toolio was co-founded by ex-Walmart employees Eytan Daniyalzade and Berk Atikoglu, who previously built the fashion app Stylr and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/16/walmartlabs-grabs-its-first-silicon-alley-startup-with-acquisition-of-fashion-app-stylr/">sold it to Walmart in 2014</a> after growing to hundreds of thousands of users. While at Walmart, they recognized inefficiencies with supply chain and merchandising in which products were to be sold and in which stores.</p>

<p>“Even at a company of that scale, the process was spreadsheet driven,” CEO Daniyalzade told TechCrunch. “They wanted to make it data-driven and were investing in resources internally. We realized there was a gap and left Walmart in 2019 to democratize the next planning platform.”</p>
<p>The planning software integrates with the commerce tech stack and automates workflows to provide forecasting analytics that customers can use to respond to demand in real time so they decrease the amount of stockouts, improve margins and have faster inventory turns.</p>
<p>Toolio initially started on the enterprise side, but last year saw a need in the mid-market for cloud tools. As a result, the company grew 20% month over month in revenue and similarly in customer growth. It is already working with retailers like Chubbies, Mack Weldon and Rothy’s, and has managed over $1 billion in inventory for retailers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series A will enable the company to scale into other retailer vertices, expand the team and add new product modules like supply chain and materials resource planning.</p>
<p>Yelena Shkolnik, partner at Jump Capital, said she learned about Toolio from retail advisors who mentioned that the company was solving many of the pain points around inventory, including how to purchase the right items.</p>
<p>Just as the supply chain side was getting more analytical and sophisticated, the global pandemic disrupted everything and gave retailers an insight into just how connected to China they really were, Shkolnik said.</p>
<p>In trying to solve how to prioritize inventory creatively, Toolio stood out.</p>
<p>“They were in the space before with Stylr and understand the approach,” she added. “Inventory was the one piece of the retail stack that wasn’t elevated to the cloud, and Toolio has made it possible for everything now to be on the cloud.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Daniyalzade says much has happened in retail over the past 15 years, especially on the front end from companies like Shopify, but the back end has not yet caught up because it is not one of the more “sexier” aspects of retail and previous solutions fell flat.</p>
<p>With everyone establishing direct-to-commerce channels, even manufacturers, demand for planning has become “everyone’s problem and is a total addressable market that Toolio can tap into,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A large number of UK tech ‘unicorns’ have been in complex markets where policy and regulation really matters. But regulated markets (fintech, healthtech etc), or markets where regulation is still emerging (e.g. lab-grown meat)  are, well, HARD. Founders have to navigate policy-makers, regulators and even politicians.</p>
<p>To it’s interesting that today a new VC is launching specifically to back founders working in regulated markets.</p>
<p><a href="http://formventures.vc">Form Ventures</a> today announces the final close of a £30m Fund II at its target fund size to do just that.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221626" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Form will invest in startups at pre-seed and seed stage in sectors “directly shaped by policy and regulation”.</p>
<p>It’s secured the support of the British Business Bank as the cornerstone investor as part of its Enterprise Capital Funds programme.</p>
<p>The Form Ventures Fund II becomes the 36th fund in the Enterprise Capital Fund portfolio, taking the programme’s total investment capacity to £1.66bn. Fund 1 invested in areas such as childcare, mental health, carbon offsetting and cellular agriculture.</p>
<p>Patrick Newton, Partner, Form Ventures said: “Technology is now disrupting every corner of our lives, from our mental health to our childcare to the future of our planet. More than ever, policymakers want to have their say on how disruption happens &#8211; gone are the days when startups could just “move fast and break things”. Smart founders realize that if they take policymakers seriously, they can build faster, not slower, and gain a real competitive edge.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So if it&#8217;s so important to back founders in regulated markets, why hasn&#8217;t it been solved already?</p>
<p>Newton  told me that sounders can&#8217;t always get this support from European VCs as they “tend to be generalist in how they support founders &#8211; so while they invest in aspects of regulated markets, policy/ regulatory insight and network is well outside their core zone of competence.” He notes that in the US, “this problem has been solved.” VCs in this area include Tusk Ventures, Trust Ventures, investing in Uber, Bird, Lemonade, Ro etc.</p>
<p>Form will invest between £200k and £1m in pre seed and seed stage startups, usually as a co-investor rather than leading rounds, as was the modus operandi for its Fund I, previously investing in nine startups alongside the likes of Index Ventures and Founders Fund.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Small and medium-sized exporters in India struggle to communicate their designs with buyers. They can’t list those designs publicly on their website or sell through popular business-to-business platforms such as Alibaba and IndiaMart as doing so would risk giving away the proprietary property to rivals.</p>
<p>So they have traditionally showcased their work to potential buyers &#8212; who in this equation, depending on the category, could be anyone from Zara to Armani &#8212; in PDF and PowerPoint presentations.</p>
<p>The way their business works is that buyers offer feedback and provide specifications for exactly what they want. PDF and presentations, as you can imagine, are not the most efficient way to relay such conversations.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221599" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That’s the problem that attracted three entrepreneurs &#8212; two of whom worked at Zomato previously and one as an investor at Bessemer. Their startup, five-month-old SourceWiz, said on Thursday it has raised $3 million in a round led by Blume Ventures and Falcon Edge Capital’s Alpha Wave Incubation (AWI).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sourcewiz.co">SourceWiz</a> has built a platform to digitize the way exporters operate. Its platform helps them modernize their cataloguing, which leads to a direct improvement in revenue, said Divyaanshu Makkar, the startup’s co-founder and chief executive, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Cataloguing may sound like an easy problem, but it entails combining information such as images, prices, product ID from multiple databases and then combining them from scratch. “An exporter is able to use our platform to build their customized catalogue in 15 minutes. This task takes about 5 days if done in the traditional way,” he said.</p>
<p>India is one of the world’s largest exporters &#8212; and it’s a space that has become even more popular because of recent geopolitical dynamics, said Sajith Pai, Director at Blume Ventures, in a statement. The total exports of textiles, footwear and miscellaneous design-led products was about $40 billion in the financial year that ended in March.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“As exporters compete on the global stage, they are craving for tools that will digitize their workflows and help them trade faster and better. This is where SourceWiz comes in. We are excited by Sourcewiz’s potential to bring aboard $200b of transactions online. Most of all we are excited by the passion of the founding team &#8211; Divyaanshu, Vikas and Mayur &#8211; and their obsession to take on this massive challenge,” he added.</p>
<p>India’s market is also largely untapped. In recent years, several firms &#8212; including Amazon &#8212; have attempted to make inroads to help Indian businesses sell to customers globally.</p>
<p>Amazon said in August, for instance, that over 70,000 Indian businesses had cumulatively exported over $3 billion worth of items. But Amazon is attempting to cater to different segments of exporters.</p>
<p>Amazon focuses on the B2C market, whereas SourceWiz is a business-to-business play. This means that SourceWiz is serving exporters who largely produce and sell hand-made products that aren’t sold without customization. Additionally, SourceWiz is not a marketplace. (The startup makes money by charging a licensing fee for its service to exporters.)</p>
<p>The startup has already amassed dozens of exporters on its platform &#8212; despite the hands-on nature of this business, which as you can imagine, has been severely disrupted by the coronavirus. Makkar said the startup will eventually broaden its offerings by integrating logistics, payments, and financing services to its platform.</p>
<p>It also plans to expand its offerings to other Asian countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Vietnam in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Portuguese VC <a href="https://www.faber-ventures.com/">Faber</a> is launching a new fund, Faber Blue Pioneers I, to invest in early-stage startups &#8211; primarily from Portugal and Southern Europe &#8211; developing innovative “deep tech solutions” around ocean sustainability and climate action,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Marginalized communities, survivors of abuse, politicians, law enforcement &#8211; they all use encrypted communications to keep their information safe. But the encryption of the kinds of services you and I use every day &#8211; from messaging to confidential internal company communications &#8211; is increasingly under threat by governments globally. The reasons are sometimes understandable, such as the protection of children, but more often than not it’s about state snooping and control of populations, especially in authoritarian regimes. Democratic countries that give the green light to breaking encryption make it easier for dictatorships to argue in its favor.</p>
<p>That’s why a group of civil society organizations and technology companies is today launching a campaign in favor of strong encryption on what they are calling “<a href="https://ged.globalencryption.org/">Global Encryption Day</a>”.</p>
<p>Edward Snowden, the whistleblower behind the NSA surveillance revelations and Board Member of <a href="https://freedom.press/">Freedom of the Press Foundation</a> will launch the day at a special broadcast today at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm  BST / 3pm CET  which you’ll be able to watch live here:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221586" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KrYvzIfY8_w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>While governments worldwide often bleat about criminals exploiting encryption messaging to hide illegal activity, proposals to weaken or undermine strong encryption are far more likely to leave users more vulnerable to cyber-attacks and criminal activity, because once you create those back-doors, anyone can use them.</p>
<p>In a statement, Snowden said: “If you weaken encryption, people will die. This year alone, after the fall of the government of Afghanistan, we saw how crucial encryption is in keeping ordinary people safe. The Covid pandemic brought home how essential encrypted messaging apps on our smartphones are for communicating with loved ones if we’re ill and need help… It would have been impossible for me to whistleblow without encryption.”</p>
<p>He added: “Despite this, governments around the world are seeking to weaken encryption by calling on platforms to create ‘backdoors’ for law enforcement… Weakening encryption would be a colossal mistake that could put thousands of lives at risk.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jimmy Wales, founder of Wikipedia said: “Protecting strong encryption is essential for protecting the human rights of millions of people around the world. Everyone has the right to privacy and security&#8230; Weakening encryption puts us all at risk. When we started Wikipedia, it was prohibitively expensive to use secure encryption for every page on the site, but it was always a priority of ours and we introduced it as soon as we could. There is no excuse for not using encryption now &#8211; governments and technology platforms have a duty to protect the public.”</p>
<p>Global Encryption Day will also feature a series of other online events including <a href="https://www.lgbttech.org/post/lgbt-tech-internet-society-release-new-encryption-infographic">LGBT Tech</a> hosting an Instagram Live, and a leading civil society group in <a href="https://irisbh.com.br/en/eventos/webinar-the-importance-of-encryption-for-activists-and-civil-society/">Brazil hosting an all-women panel</a> discussing the importance of encryption.</p>
<p>The Global Encryption Coalition (GEC) was founded by the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, Global Partners Digital and the Internet Society.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two wheelers have long been a cornerstone of life in India — their smaller size and affordability making these traditionally gas and diesel-powered vehicles a go-to means of navigating the traffic-jammed streets of the country&#8217;s most populous cities.</p>
<p>Now, a new startup called River has come out of stealth with an electric two-wheeler scooter &#8212; and accompanying subscription services &#8212; designed to appeal to modern-day consumers looking for an affordable, yet stylish vehicle that can be used for work, play and every task in between.</p>
<p>River, founded in late 2020 by Aravind Mani and Vipin George with $2 million in backing from Maniv Mobility and TrucksVC, has grown to 42 people in its short life. Its small and growing team, who hail from companies like Ather, Arai, Bosch, Honda, Ultraviolette and Vespa, have developed a prototype vehicle that will be unveiled to consumers later this year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220972" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Both founders also have experience in two-wheeled transport. Mani, an engineer who once worked in the petrochemicals industry before switching to electrified transportation, was most recently vice president of business strategy at Ultraviolette before he left to form River. George worked at Honda R&amp;D in India for eight years, including as head designer, and most recently was design lead at Ultraviolette.</p>
<p>The pair wanted a two-wheeler robust enough to be used as a tool for work or any other task while amping up the performance and style to make it useful and fun for all of the other hours in the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;A parallel would be the truck culture in the United States; if you&#8217;re carpenter or shop owner you have a truck, which you use to carry stuff and it&#8217;s also your primary mode of commute,&#8221; Mani said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have anything similar on the two-wheeler space in India, and that&#8217;s what we want to create.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the same time, Mani noted the vehicle also had to have personality because &#8220;in India it is still a status purchase that you want to show off to your friends; it is a first symbol that you have arrived in life for many people owning a two wheeler.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>What they came up with is a &#8220;multi-utility&#8221; two-wheeled electric scooter codenamed the RX-1 that is available in several battery pack sizes that can travel between 100 km (62 miles) and 180 km (112 miles) on a single charge.</p>
<p>The vehicle can accelerate from zero to 40 kilometers per hour (25 mph) in 4 seconds and has a top speed of 80 kmph (50 mph). And because its main focus is as a multi-utility vehicle, it has a payload of 200 kilograms, enough for a rider to carry packages.</p>
<p>The price, which depends on the battery pack, ranges between 80,000 INR ($1,070) and 100,000 INR ($1,337).</p>
<p>River&#8217;s launch comes at a fruitful yet fiercely competitive moment in India.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s government, keen to accelerate the adoption of EVs in an effort to get away from polluting gas and diesel powered vehicles, have increased subsidies for electric two-wheelers made in the country. India&#8217;s Department of Heavy Industries <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/electric-2-wheeler-firms-see-subsidy-pushing-adoption/articleshow/83493217.cms?from=mdr">now offers incentives</a> that provides Rs 15,000 ($200) per kilowatt-hour. The cap on subsidies has also doubled to 40% of the price of the vehicle.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is also an effort by e-commerce and delivery companies, including Flipkart, Swiggy and Zomato to electrify fleets. Zomato to have EV-only fleets by the end of the decade. Startup Swiggy announced in August it would <a href="https://yourstory.com/2021/08/swiggy-aims-8-lakh-kms-per-day-through-electric-vehicles-2025/amp">cover 800,000 kilometers</a> (497,000 miles) every day via electric vehicles by 2025.  In February, Walmart-owned Flipkart said it would deploy more than 25,000 electric vehicles in its supply chain by 2030.</p>
<p>&#8220;About 60% to 70% of the country is self employed and two wheelers are a basic part of the Indian livelihood,&#8221; co-founder Aravind Mani said in an interview, adding that e-commerce has driven growth with an estimated 14 million fleet delivery riders in India today. &#8220;COVID has actually accelerated this trend, and on demand services are continuously increasing.&#8221;</p>
<p>These opportunities have fueled the launch of hundreds of EV startups. There are more than 470 EV companies registered in India, according to March 2021 research note from Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.</p>
<p>&#8220;The gold rush to capture this emerging opportunity has commenced,&#8221; the report from managing director and senior analyst Venugopal Garre said. &#8220;A few will get acquired, several will perish, some will remain low scale niche OEMs, but we think a few will scale up materially.&#8221;</p>
<p>River is going up against bigger and better funded competitors like Ola Electric, Bounce and Aether Energy as well as dozens of smaller outfits. But River&#8217;s co-founders contend their new vehicle and business model fills a gap in the market.</p>
<p>River plans to sell directly to consumers and offer a suite of subscription services and an array of accessories that lets owners customize their scooters and remove them there needs change throughout the day. Sales are expected to begin in the second half of 2022.</p>
<p>The company plans to offer charging, battery packs that will range in size, maintenance and connectivity packages offered through subscriptions. River is not going to take on the costly task of building out charging infrastructure. Instead, the company plans to operate a charging franchise system. Mani said the company is already working set of small businesses that might buy the vehicles and chargers and open up the chargers for public use.</p>
<p>River wants to sell its scooters directly to businesses like restaurants as well as to fleet operators and even larger ecommerce companies that can sell to consumers.</p>
<p>The startup will assemble the scooters at what Mani described as &#8220;small scale manufacturing facilities&#8221; that can turnout around 3,000 vehicles a month. If successful, River wants to create a number of these facilities throughout India. Mani said River has reached initial agreements with several suppliers, including for the co-development and assembly of its battery packs.</p>
