										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/ios-15-is-now-available-to-download/">release of iOS 15</a> should be a major event for mobile operating systems. And yet, this year, there’s no breakthrough feature or overarching theme that makes this release stand out. Apple has focused on quality-of-life updates as well as new features for its own apps.</p>
<p>The result is a solid update that is not going to be controversial. Some people are going to take advantage of the new Focus feature. They’ll spend a lot of time customizing their phone to make it as personal as possible. Other people are just going to miss or dismiss the new features.</p>
<p>This year’s update is also a bit different because you don’t have to update to iOS 15. If you’re fine with iOS 14, Apple won’t force you to make the jump to iOS 15. You’ll still receive security patches. Some people will simply dismiss iOS 15 altogether.</p>
<p>It seems like a small change but it actually says a lot about the current state of iOS. Apple considers iOS as a mature platform. Just like you don’t have to update your Mac to the latest version of macOS if you don’t want to, you can now update at your own pace.</p>
<p>iOS should also be considered as a mature platform for app developers. iOS 15 adoption will be slower than usual as people won’t necessarily update to iOS 15 right away. Apps should potentially work on older iOS versions for longer.</p>
<p>Of course, users will ‘update’ to a new version of iOS when they buy a new iPhone and replace their old iPhone. But Apple has And people who pre-ordered the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/this-is-the-iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> will get iOS 15.</p>

<h2>Focusing on you instead of your phone</h2>
<p>One of the biggest change in iOS 15 is the ability to change your Focus from Control Center. It’s a surprisingly powerful feature with a lot of options and tweaks. I would say it doesn’t feel like an Apple feature.</p>
<p>But it’s definitely one of the most interesting features of iOS 15. Chances are you spend a lot of time with your phone and your device requires a lot of attention from you. With this new feature, it reverses the balance and puts you back in charge.</p>
<p>‘Do Not Disturb’ users are already quite familiar with the idea that you can silence notifications when you don’t want them. If you want to keep using ‘moon mode’ with iOS 15, you don’t have to change anything.</p>
<p>But you can now create additional Focuses. By default, Apple suggests a few Focuses —&nbsp;Work, Sleep, Driving, Fitness, Gaming, Mindfulness, Personal and Reading. Each Focus is customizable to your needs and you can create new Focuses from scratch.</p>
<p>When you turn on a specific Focus, it basically blocks notifications by default. You can then add people and apps so that notifications from those people and apps still go through. App developers can also mark a notification as time sensitive so that it always goes through. I hope they won’t abuse that feature.</p>
<p>There are three more settings that you can activate. First, you can optionally share that your notifications are currently silenced in Messages and compatible third-party apps. Second, you can hide home screen pages altogether. Third, you can hide notifications from the lock screen and hide badges from the home screen.</p>
<p>Focus gets particularly interesting when you realize that you can couple specific Focuses with automation features. For instance, you can automatically turn on ‘Sleep’ at night or you can automatically turn on ‘Work’ when you arrive at work.</p>
<p>Power users will also have a lot of fun setting up a Focus and pairing it with a Shortcut. For instance, you could use Shortcuts to open the Clock app when you turn on Sleep mode. You get it, this new feature has a lot of depth and beta users have just started scratching the surface.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205240" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205240" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_focus_09202021.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1433" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2205240" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_focus_09202021.jpg 1306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_focus_09202021.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_focus_09202021.jpg?resize=214,300 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_focus_09202021.jpg?resize=768,1075 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_focus_09202021.jpg?resize=486,680 486w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_focus_09202021.jpg?resize=1097,1536 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_focus_09202021.jpg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205240" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<h2>Update all apps</h2>
<p>With iOS 15, Apple has improved nearly all the default apps. Some additions are definitely nice improvements. Others have been a bit more controversial.</p>
<p>Let’s start with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apple-walks-back-controversial-safari-changes-with-ios-15-beta-6-update/">the controversial one</a>, <strong>Safari</strong>’s design has been updated. But what you saw at WWDC in June doesn’t look at all like what’s shipping today. Essentially, Apple has listened to feedback and changed the user interface of its web browser during the summer.</p>
<p>By default, the address bar is now at the bottom of the screen, right above the row of buttons that let you open bookmarks, share the current page or go to the previous page. I think it works better. But if you really don’t want the address bar at the bottom, you can move it back to the top of the screen.</p>
<p>Other than that, Safari changes are all good improvements. For instance, the browser now supports traditional web extensions. It’s going to be interesting to see if popular Google Chrome extensions eventually come to Safari. Another nice new feature is the ability to create tab groups and find your tab groups from your other devices.</p>
<p><strong>FaceTime</strong> has become a versatile video-conferencing service. You can now create links, share them with friends and add them to calendar invites. For the first time, people who don’t own an Apple device will be able to join FaceTime calls from a web browser. There’s also a new Zoom view…&nbsp;I mean, grid view.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the big new FaceTime feature is not ready for prime time just yet. SharePlay, the feature that lets you sync audio and video playback with your friends, is going to be released later this Fall.</p>
<p>The <strong>Weather</strong> app has also been redesigned. It is now packed with a lot more information, such as precipitation maps, next-hour precipitation notifications and a new UV index. It has become a solid alternative to third-party weather apps. I still use <a href="https://bjango.com/ios/snowflake/">Snowflake</a> but differences are smaller and smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Messages</strong> is now better integrated with other Apple apps. Whenever someone sends you an article, a photo album, a podcast or a song, you’ll see those recommendations in Apple’s other apps — Apple News, Photos, Apple Podcasts, Apple Music, etc. Once again, this is a nice addition in my testings but it’s not going to change the way you use your phone.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Maps</strong> is getting better and better, especially if you live in San Francisco. If you haven’t used it in a few years, I encourage you to try it again. It’s now a solid alternative to Google Maps.</p>
<p>Some cities, such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and London, are receiving new detailed maps with 3D buildings, bus lanes, sidewalks and more. It feels like navigating a video game given how detailed it is. The app has also been redesigned with new place cards, a new driving user interface and settings in the app.</p>
<p><strong>Photos</strong> is also receiving a bunch of improvements. Every year, the company is refining Memories. I’m not sure a ton of people are using this feature, but it’s better than before. There are now more information if you swipe on a photo as well, such as the shutter speed and lens that were used.</p>
<p>But the biggest change to your photo library is that you can now search for text in your photo. iOS is scanning your photos to find text and save it for Spotlight searches.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can now point your camera at text and select text from there. It is incredibly convenient if you’re looking for the restaurant address on the menu and want to share it with a friend or if you’re traveling and you want to translate some text.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205244" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205244" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_weather_09202021.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1433" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2205244" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_weather_09202021.jpg 1306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_weather_09202021.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_weather_09202021.jpg?resize=214,300 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_weather_09202021.jpg?resize=768,1075 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_weather_09202021.jpg?resize=486,680 486w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_weather_09202021.jpg?resize=1097,1536 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_iOS15-avail_weather_09202021.jpg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205244" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
<p>There are a ton of small changes that make iOS 15 better than iOS 14. Let me list some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a compatible home key, hotel key, office key or ID card, you can now add all of those to the Wallet app.</li>
<li>You can share some health data with someone else. It can be useful if you’re living far away from your loved ones or if you want to update your healthcare team.</li>
<li>If you pay for iCloud, you’re now an iCloud+ users. In addition to storage, you get additional features. iCloud Private Relay, which is available as a beta feature, lets you browse the web with increased privacy. Hide My Email lets you create randomly generated email addresses to create new accounts around the web.</li>
<li>Similarly, if your family is using iCloud for their email addresses, you can now set up a personal domain name and set it up in iCloud.</li>
<li>iOS uses on-device speech recognition, which means that you can dictate text much faster.</li>
<li>But that’s not all, iOS processes some Siri requests on your device directly, which means that you can start a timer, set an alarm or change the music instantly. It has changed the way I use Siri.</li>
<li>You can add an account recovery contact in case you get locked out of your iCloud account. This is important to convince more people to use two-factor authentication.</li>
<li>Talking about two-factor authentication, Apple’s built-in password manager called ‘Passwords’ can now save 2FA details and auto-fill 2FA fields. It works pretty much like 2FA in 1Password.</li>
<li>You can set up a legacy person for your Apple ID. I encourage you to look at that feature carefully. I’ve talked with several persons who couldn’t get their loved one’s photos after they passed away because Apple couldn’t just hand out the photos.</li>
<li>Apple has added tags to Reminders and Notes. You can also @-mention people in Notes.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the list of changes in iOS 15 is quite long. But it’s up to you to decide whether you want to update to iOS 15. When Apple added cut, copy and paste with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_OS_3">iPhone OS 3</a>, it was an obvious decision. I personally like the new features and it was worth updating. And I hope this review can help you decide whether to update or not.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The decreasing cost of launch and a slew of other tech innovations have brought about a renaissance in geospatial intelligence, with multiple startups aiming to capture higher-quality and more frequent images of Earth than have ever before been available.</p>
<p>Most of these startups, however, are focused on using satellites to collect data. Not so for <a href="https://nearspacelabs.com/">Near Space Labs</a>, a four-year-old company that instead aims to gather geospatial intelligence from the stratosphere, using small autonomous wind-powered robots attached to weather balloons. The company has named its platform “Swifty,” and each one is capable of reaching altitudes between 60,000 and 85,000 feet and capturing 400-1,000 square kilometers of imagery per flight.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2017 by Rema Matevosyan, Ignasi Lluch and Albert Caubet. Matevosyan, who is an applied mathematician by training and previously worked as a programmer, did her masters in Moscow. There, she started doing research in systems engineering for aerospace systems and also flew weather balloons to test aerospace hardware. “It clicked that we can fly balloons commercially and deliver a much better experience to customers than from any other alternative,” she told TechCrunch in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Four years after launch, the company has closed a $13 million Series A round led by Crosslink Capital, with participation from Toyota Ventures and existing investors Leadout Capital and Wireframe Ventures. Near Space Labs also announced that Crosslink partner Phil Boyer has joined its board.</p>
<p>Near Space, which is headquartered in Brooklyn and Barcelona, Spain, is primarily focused on urbanized areas where change happens very rapidly. The robotic devices that attach to the balloons are manufactured at the company’s workshop in Brooklyn, which are then shipped to launch sites across the country. The company’s CTO and chief engineer are both based in Barcelona, so the hardware R&amp;D takes place over there, Matevosyan explained.</p>
<p>The company currently has eight Swifies in operation. It sells the data it collects and has developed an API through which customers can access the data via a subscription model. The company doesn’t need to have specific launch sites &#8212; Matevosyan said Swifties can launch from “anywhere at any time” &#8212; but the company does work in concert with the Federal Aviation Administration and air traffic control.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Near Space Labs expands high-altitude Earth imagery to Texas and ramps remote deployment&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/near-space-labs-expands-high-altitude-earth-imagery-to-texas-and-ramps-remote-deployment/embed/#?secret=OpZnjng9jI" data-secret="OpZnjng9jI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The main value proposition of the Swifty as opposed to the satellite, according to Matevosyan, is the resolution: From the stratosphere, the company can collect “resolutions that are 50 times better than what you would get from a satellite,” she said. “We are able to provide persistent and near real-time coverage of areas of interest that change very quickly, including large metro areas.” Plus, she said Near Space can iterate it’s technology quickly using Swifties’ “plug-and-play” model, whereas it’s not so easy to add a new sensor to a satellite fleet that’s already in orbit.</p>

<p>Near Space has booked more than 540 flights through 2022. While customers pay for the flights, the data generated from each trip is non-exclusive, so the data can be sold again and again. Looking ahead, the company will be using the funds to expand its geographical footprint and bring on a bunch of new hires. The goal, according to Matevosyan, is to democratize access to geospatial intelligence &#8212; not just for customers, but on the developer side, too. “We believe in diverse, equal and inclusive opportunities in aerospace and Earth imaging,” she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The effects of a warming planet, from frequent and extreme flooding to hurricanes and drought, has prompted activists and governments to take action. It’s also spurred a growing number of entrepreneurs to launch technology startups focused on the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>At the center of this activity are the venture capitalists deciding which startup — and tech — has the best chance to decarbonize the planet while providing returns. Unlike other categories, climate tech is particularly complex because it spans so many different industries. Investors might be meeting with a founder trying to develop a plant-based fabric on a Monday and one who claims to have developed cutting-edge carbon capture technology on Tuesday.</p>
<p>TechCrunch is excited to announce that Carmichael Roberts, who co‐leads the investment committee at Breakthrough Energy Ventures, and Sean O’Sullivan, managing general partner at SOSV, will join me on our virtual stage at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a>. The virtual conference kicks off September 21 and runs through September 23.</p>
<p>Roberts and O&#8217;Sullivan will dig into what climate tech means — and what it doesn&#8217;t — their investing approach, the hottest and most promising technology within this sector and the risk of not getting it right.</p>
<p>The pair have the expertise to weigh in. Roberts is also co-founder and managing partner of Material Impact, a fund that builds resilient technology companies developing products to solve real‐world problems using innovative materials. Before he became an investor, Roberts  co‐founded several ventures, in which he served as president and CEO or chairman. He also worked in business development at GelTex Pharmaceuticals, acquired by Genzyme for $1.3 billion, and in new product and business development at Dow Chemical (formerly Union Carbide Corporation).</p>
<p>Before Sullivan joined SOSV, one of the most active venture investors in the world, he founded MapInfo. The company grew to a $200 million revenue public company with more than 1,000 employees, and popularized street mapping on computers. He also founded NetCentric, is credited as the co-creator of the term &#8220;cloud computing&#8221; and co-founded Dial2Do.</p>
<p>The panel is just one of many investment-focused discussions we&#8217;ll be having at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">Disrupt 2021</a>. But as moderator, this is the one I look most forward to!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://fivetran.com">Fivetran</a>, the data connectivity startup, had a big day today. For starters it announced a $565 million investment on a $5.6 billion valuation, but it didn&#8217;t stop there. It also announced its second acquisition this year, snagging HVR, a data integration competitor that had raised more than $50 million, for $700 million in cash and stock.</p>
<p>The company last raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/fivetran-snares-100m-series-c-on-1-2b-valuation-for-data-connectivity-solution/">a $100 million Series C</a> on a $1.2 billion valuation, increasing the valuation by over 5x. As with that Series C, Andreessen Horowitz was back leading the round, with participation from other double dippers General Catalyst, CEAS Investments, Matrix Partners and other unnamed firms or individuals. New investors ICONIQ Capital, D1 Capital Partners and YC Continuity also came along for the ride. The company reports it has now raised $730 million.</p>
<p>The HVR acquisition represents a hefty investment for the startup, grabbing a company for a price that is almost equal to all the money it has raised to date, but it provides a way to expand its market quickly by buying a competitor. Earlier this year Fivetran acquired <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210624005275/en/Fivetran-Introduces-Breakthrough-for-Database-Replication">Teleport Data</a> as it continues to add functionality and customers via acquisition.</p>
<p>&#8220;The acquisition — a cash and stock deal valued at $700 million — strengthens Fivetran’s market position as one of the data integration leaders for all industries and all customer types,&#8221; the company said in a statement.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="LYbcybnWc7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/fivetran-snares-100m-series-c-on-1-2b-valuation-for-data-connectivity-solution/">Fivetran snares $100M Series C on $1.2B valuation for data connectivity solution</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fivetran snares $100M Series C on $1.2B valuation for data connectivity solution&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/fivetran-snares-100m-series-c-on-1-2b-valuation-for-data-connectivity-solution/embed/#?secret=LYbcybnWc7" data-secret="LYbcybnWc7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While that may smack of corporate marketing-speak, there is some truth to it, as pulling data from multiple sources, sometimes in siloed legacy systems, is a huge challenge for companies, and both Fivetran and HVR have developed tools to provide the pipes to connect various data sources and put it to work across a business.</p>
<p>Data is central to a number of modern enterprise practices, including customer experience management, which takes advantage of customer data to deliver customized experiences based on what you know about them, and data is the main fuel for machine learning models, which use it to understand and learn how a process works. Fivetran and HVR provide the nuts and bolts infrastructure to move the data around to where it&#8217;s needed, connecting to various applications like Salesforce, Box or Airtable, databases like Postgres SQL or data repositories like Snowflake or Databricks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Whether bigger is better remains to be seen, but Fivetran is betting that it will be in this case as it makes its way along the startup journey. The transaction has been approved by both companies&#8217; boards. The deal is still subject to standard regulatory approval, but Fivetran is expecting it to close in October.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Time to carbo-load, startup fans.

<p>Make the Disrupt Desk your first destination. That’s where you’ll find TechCrunch editors highlighting just some of the must-not-miss moments on Day One. Here’s a fine example. Get your first look at some of the companies competing in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/announcing-the-startup-battlefield-companies-pitching-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2021/">Startup Battlefield</a>. Companies like Dropbox, Vurb, Mint and many more got their start as Startup Battlefield competitors. Catch the next generation in this always-epic pitch throw-down.</p>

<h3>Disrupt Stage</h3>
<p><strong>Saving the World</strong></p>
<p><em>COVID-19 changed everything. It not only threatened our individual health and well-being, but it also shook industries and economies across the globe. And the same could be said about the COVID-19 vaccines. Hear from BioNTech co-founder and CEO Ugur Sahin on the process of rapidly developing the world’s most sought-after vaccine, alongside Pfizer, and the long-term potential of mRNA-based therapies. Ursheet Parikh of Mayfield Fund will join Sahin to discuss what’s next for startups in this rapidly evolving industry.</em></p>
<h3>Extra Crunch Stage</h3>
<p><strong>How to Ditch Traditional Fundraising</strong></p>
<p><em>In 2021, venture capital has never been more plentiful, but some founders still can’t break into networks or have found that traditional fundraising isn’t the best route for their business. Fortunately, alternative fundraising techniques are gathering steam as founders find paths to raise cash that diverge from the startup success stories of the past. Join the discussion with Pipe’s Harry Hurst, Accel’s Arun Mathew and Clearco’s Michele Romanow.</em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h3>Breakout Session</h3>
<p><strong>Demo Derby — How startups are disrupting the status quo with innovative data analytics, AI and modern app development</strong></p>
<p><em>Startups need to move quickly and focus limited resources on areas where they can differentiate. In this fast-paced session, learn from startups and Google experts how you can leverage Google technologies to serve customers better and get to market more quickly. In a series of short demos, see how innovative startups and Google experts have used Google compute, storage, networking and AI technologies to “disrupt” the status quo.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier today, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/toast-raises-ipo-price-range-providing-a-monday-bump-to-fintech-valuations/">examined</a> the new IPO price range for Toast. The U.S. software-and-fintech company moved its valuation materially higher in anticipation of pricing tomorrow after the bell and trading on Wednesday. It was not alone in doing so.</p>
<p>Freshworks is also targeting a higher IPO price range, it disclosed today in a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001544522/000162828021018866/freshworkss-1a3.htm">fresh SEC filing</a>. The customer-service-focused software firm now expects to charge between $32 and $34 per share in its debut, up from the $28 to $32 per-share range <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/freshworks-aims-for-nearly-9-billion-valuation-in-us-ipo/">that it initially disclosed</a>.</p>
<p>Doing some back-of-the-envelope math, Freshworks&#8217; IPO valuation could just pass the $10 billion mark, calculated on a fully diluted basis. Its simple IPO valuations, while rising, are lower than that figure.</p>
<p>Mathing that out, Freshworks expects to have 284,283,200 shares outstanding when public, inclusive of its underwriters&#8217; option, but not inclusive of vested shares present in RSUs or options. At its new IPO price range, Freshworks would be worth between $9.1 billion and $9.7 billion.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[Toast will have to post pretty damn strong growth numbers for it to keep its multiple up. But the market appears willing to take that risk.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. technology unicorn Toast filed a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001650164/000119312521276664/d166297ds1a.htm">new S-1 document</a> this morning detailing a higher IPO price range for its shares. The more expensive range indicates that Toast may be worth more in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/toast-looks-toward-18b-valuation-in-upcoming-ipo/">its debut than it initially expected</a>, a bullish sign for technology companies more broadly.</p>
<p>Toast&#8217;s rising valuation may provide a boon to two different subsectors of technology: software and fintech. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/5-takeaways-from-toasts-s-1-filing/">restaurant-focused Toast</a> sells software on a recurring basis (SaaS) to restaurants while also providing financial technology solutions. And while it is best known as a software company that dabbles in hardware, Boston-based Toast generates the bulk of its aggregate top line from financial services.</p>
<p>Software revenues are valuable thanks to their high margins and recurring structure. Toast&#8217;s financial-services revenues, by contrast, are largely transaction-based and sport lower gross margins. The company&#8217;s IPO price, then, could help the private markets more fairly price startups offering their own blend of software-and-fintech incomes.</p>
<p>The so-called &#8220;vertical SaaS&#8221; model, in which startups build software tailored to one particular industry or another, has become a somewhat two-part business effort; many startups today are pursuing both the sale of software along with fintech revenues. Toast&#8217;s IPO, then, could operate as a bellwether of sorts for a host of startups.</p>
<p>To see Toast raise its range, therefore, got our eyebrows up. Let&#8217;s talk money.</p>
<h2>Toast&#8217;s new IPO range</h2>
<p>From a previous range of $30 to $33, Toast now expects to price its IPO between $34 and $36.</p>
<p>Toast now expects its IPO price to clear its previous upper-end guidance at the low end of its new range. That&#8217;s bullish &#8212; and indicative of a thus-far receptive market for the company&#8217;s equity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coinbase efforts to play hardball with the Securities and Exchange Commission didn&#8217;t last too long. The cryptocurrency exchange had garnered the ire of the regulatory commission over its plans to launch a crypto lending product, with the SEC sending the company a Wells notice which indicated that the agency would sue Coinbase if they launched their crypto lending product called Lend.</p>
<p>Less than a couple weeks after publishing a defiant blog post titled &#8220;<span class="ax"><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/the-sec-has-told-us-it-wants-to-sue-us-over-lend-we-have-no-idea-why-a3a1b6507009">The SEC has told us it wants to sue us over Lend. We don’t know why.</a>&#8221; the company quietly announced over the weekend that it will not be launching the Lend product after all.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0TChIPNjPb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/sec-wants-to-regulate-coinbases-crypto-yield-product-coinbase-disagrees/">SEC wants to regulate Coinbase’s crypto yield product, Coinbase disagrees</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SEC wants to regulate Coinbase’s crypto yield product, Coinbase disagrees&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/sec-wants-to-regulate-coinbases-crypto-yield-product-coinbase-disagrees/embed/#?secret=0TChIPNjPb" data-secret="0TChIPNjPb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>On Friday, the company quietly added an update to its <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/sign-up-to-earn-4-apy-on-usd-coin-with-coinbase-cdad79e5f5eb">launch post for Lend</a>, detailing in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="eea5" class="ez bw eb bm b fa fb fc fd fe ff fg fh fi fj fk fl fm fn fo fp fq">As we continue our work to seek regulatory clarity for the crypto industry as a whole, we’ve made the difficult decision not to launch the USDC APY program announced below. We have also discontinued the waitlist for this program as we turn our work to what comes next.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="ez bw eb bm b fa fb fc fd fe ff fg fh fi fj fk fl fm fn fo fp fq">Lend was far from an anomaly in the crypto exchange world; investors can find similar functionality in platforms like Gemini, which allow users to lend their crypto holdings back to the exchange for the promise of earning interest rates that are much, much higher than traditional savings accounts offer. Coinbase planned to launch the Lend product with the functionality for users to stake the stablecoin USDC and earn (<em>as a starting rate</em>) 4% APY.</p>
<p>The SEC, which has long complained about the limited resources at its disposal, has pursued a limited set of cases against crypto products but doesn&#8217;t seem to have been quite comfortable with the fact that users were essentially forfeiting custody of their coins to Coinbase and its partners. They also indicated to Coinbase that the Lend product did indeed involve a security. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Coinbase, which has made the fact that it coordinates closely with the regulatory bodies part of its brand, had been trying to take things slowly while sticking to their belief that the product wasn&#8217;t security-related.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">2/ Millions of crypto holders have been earning yield on their assets over the last few years. It makes sense, if you want to lend out your funds, you can earn a return. Everyone seems happy.</p>
<p>&mdash; Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1435439333176070153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;The SEC told us they consider Lend to involve a security, but wouldn’t say why or how they’d reached that conclusion. Rather than get discouraged, we chose to continue taking things slowly. In June, we announced our Lend program publicly and opened a waitlist but did not set a public launch date. But once again, we got no explanation from the SEC. Instead, they opened a formal investigation,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#8221; a recent Coinbase company blog post read.</span></p>
<p>The big question is what this means for the other crypto exchanges and whether this act signals the start of a more aggressive streak for SEC chief Gary Gensler&#8217;s commission in the crypto world, especially in regards to DeFi mechanics.</p>
<p>Coinbase stock was dropping in intraday trading Monday, alongside a significant pullback in the price of bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has just released the final version of <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15/">iOS 15</a>, the next major version of the operating system for the iPhone. It is a free download and it works with the iPhone 6s or later, both generations of iPhone SE and the most recent iPod touch model (iPad users will also be able to update to <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-15/">iPadOS 15</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/watchos/watchos-8/">watchOS 8</a> today).</p>
<p>The biggest change of iOS 15 is a new Focus mode. In addition to “Do not disturb,” you can configure various modes — you can choose apps and people you want notifications from and change your focus depending on what you’re doing. For instance, you can create a Work mode, a Sleep mode, a Workout mode, etc.</p>
<p>There are many new features across the board, such as a new Weather app, updated maps in Apple Maps, an improved version of FaceTime, and more. Safari also has a brand-new look.</p>
<p>The new version of iOS also scans your photos for text. Called Live Text, this feature lets you highlight, copy and paste text in photos. It could be a nice accessibility feature as well; iOS is going to leverage that info for Spotlight. You can search for text in your photos directly in Spotlight and it’ll pull out relevant photos. These features are handled on-device directly.</p>
<p>Paid iCloud users have been upgraded to iCloud+. In addition to more storage, iCloud+ subscribers get a handful of new features. iCloud Private Relay, which is available as a beta feature, lets you browse the web with increased privacy. Hide My Email lets you create randomly generated email addresses to create new accounts around the web. ICloud email users can also switch to a personal domain name.</p>
<p>The update is currently rolling out and is available both over-the-air in the Settings app, and by plugging your device to your computer for a wired update. But first, back up your device. Make sure your iCloud backup is up to date by opening the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad and tapping on your account information at the top and then on your device name. Additionally, you can also plug your iOS device to your computer to do a manual backup in Finder or iTunes for Windows (or do both, really).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Don’t forget to encrypt your backup in iTunes. It is much safer if somebody hacks your computer. And encrypted backups include saved passwords and health data. This way, you don’t have to reconnect to all your online accounts.</p>
<p>Once this is done, you should go to the Settings app, then &#8220;General&#8221; and then &#8220;Software Update.&#8221; You should see &#8220;Update Requested…&#8221; It will then automatically start downloading once the download is available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The crypto space has matured so much in so little time, but even amid a blockbuster year, it&#8217;s still facing down the existential risk of aggressive regulation from U.S. agencies.</p>
<p>All the while, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz has been tirelessly building out a major crypto arm dedicated to ensuring that the firm will be an institutional powerhouse in the world of cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance and broader &#8220;Web3&#8221; technologies for years to come. Its early network of investments power much of the crypto world&#8217;s earliest success stories, but the firm has bigger ambitions yet. The firm&#8217;s efforts here are co-led by General Partner Katie Haun &#8212; who was once a federal prosecutor tackling fraud and cyber crime alongside top government agencies.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to have Haun join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">TechCrunch Disrupt this year (September 21-23)</a>, where we&#8217;ll be asking her about all things crypto regulation and what the firm hopes to accomplish with its new, massive $2.2 billion crypto fund. Beyond the firm&#8217;s aggressive fund sizes and rapid deal-making in the crypto space, the firm&#8217;s partners &#8212; including Haun &#8212; have been among the most vocal about the potentially transformative nature of the blockchain and cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>This has gotten more attention in 2021 when currencies have surged, fallen and surged again, minting more and more crypto millionaires while sucking in retail investors clamoring to get a piece of the hot space. It&#8217;s also been a year where the crypto space&#8217;s diversity has emerged with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) gaining attention, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) catching global attention and decentralized finance (DeFi) threatening to upend financial institutions.</p>
<p>Haun serves on the boards of Coinbase and OpenSea. Coinbase went public this year and delivered one of the firm&#8217;s biggest payouts ever, while OpenSea is the dominant platform in the ever-shifting and ever-surging world of NFTs. Both companies are facing controversies on their quest toward crypto greatness. This month, Coinbase detailed that the SEC plans to sue it over the company&#8217;s upcoming lending feature. Meanwhile, OpenSea is grappling with the resignation of a highly visible executive who was discovered to be abusing company information to trade NFTs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a controversial space with plenty of money to be had, and Andreesen Horowitz has made a lot of it.</p>
<p>We look forward to chatting with Haun, alongside a whole host of amazing speakers at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true&amp;promo=rrpost">Disrupt</a>, including Canva CEO Melanie Perkins, actor-entrepreneur <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/ryan-reynolds-is-coming-to-disrupt/">Ryan Reynolds</a> and U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The show is coming up fast. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">Get your ticket now</a> for less than $100 before the price increases tonight &#8212; and we’ll see you soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Six-year-old Bangalore-based fintech Razorpay, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/18/razorpay-160-million-raise-valuation-hits-3-billion/">valued at $3 billion in a financing round in April</a> this year, has courted one more high-profile investor: Salesforce Ventures.</p>
<p>Razorpay said on Monday it has received a &#8220;strategic investment&#8221; from the venture arm of the American enterprise giant. The investment will help the startup &#8220;further strengthen its presence in the business banking space,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>The two firms didn&#8217;t disclose the size of the investment, but the Sequoia Capital India-backed startup said the deal will &#8220;make an impactful contribution to the industry and drive adoption and financial growth for underserved small businesses in the next twelve months.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://razorpay.com">Razorpay</a> accepts, processes and disburses money online for small businesses and enterprises — essentially everything Stripe does in the U.S. and several other developed markets. But the Indian startup’s offering goes much further than that: in recent years, Razorpay has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/22/razorpay-credit-card-current-account-neo-bank/">launched a neobanking platform</a> to issue corporate credit cards, and it also offers businesses working capital.</p>
<p>With the global giant Stripe still nowhere in the Indian picture, Razorpay has grown to become the clear market leader and has started to expand to the Southeast Asian market.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Razorpay, we want to make further strides on the idea of investing in India’s digital future and building an intelligent payment and banking infrastructure for the new-world. We are delighted to associate with Salesforce Ventures and Salesforce more broadly in India,&#8221; said Harshil Mathur, co-founder and chief executive of the fintech startup.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am certain that this investment, along with support from our existing investors, will help build an ecosystem for a hassle-free, easy-to-integrate payments and banking experience. We also hope to expand, build new products and deliver this experience to businesses in South East Asian countries too.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Monday&#8217;s deal is Salesforce Ventures&#8217; second investment in the Indian startup ecosystem. The firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/18/salesforce-leads-15-million-investment-round-in-indian-hr-tech-platform-darwinbox/">led a $15 million Series C</a> financing round in Hyderabad-headquartered Darwinbox earlier this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The journey towards a &#8216;less-cash&#8217; economy has been accelerated with the pandemic. The rapid growth in digital payments over the last year has opened doors for technology innovation and Razorpay has been emerging as the company of choice for a lot of e-commerce businesses,&#8221; said Arundhati Bhattacharya, chairperson and chief executive of Salesforce India, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to support Razorpay in their journey to revolutionize digital finance not only in India, but globally as well,&#8221; added Bhattacharya, who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/salesforce-hires-former-banker-arundhati-bhattacharya-as-chairperson-and-ceo-of-india-business/">joined the firm last year</a>.</p>
<p>The Indian startup, which became a unicorn a year ago, said it has witnessed a 40-45% month-on-month growth in recent months. The startup is currently in the market to raise a new financing round and is negotiating a considerably larger valuation bump over the current value, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Scores of corporate giants, including Google, Facebook and Microsoft, have started to chase strategic investments in the world&#8217;s second-largest internet market. Microsoft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/microsoft-confirms-investment-in-indias-oyo-in-a-multi-year-strategic-deal-to-co-develop-travel-and-hospitality-products/">inked a strategic deal</a> with Indian budget hotel chain Oyo, they confirmed this month.</p>
<p>India has produced a record 27 unicorns this year so far, up from 11 last year, as many high-profile global investors, including Tiger Global, Falcon Edge Capital, Temasek, SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Coatue Management, increase the pace of their investments in the South Asian market. And the list continues to grow: a16z is in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/andreessen-horowitz-a16z-first-india-investment/">advanced stages to back Indian crypto startup CoinSwitch Kuber</a>, TechCrunch reported last week.</p>

The web version of the app can detect when someone is underexposed due to bad lighting. Meet will then increase the brightness so it&#8217;s easier to see your cohorts and perhaps make your feed clearer if you have a terrible webcam.</p>
<p>The low-light mode hit the Google Meet iOS and Android mobile apps <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2020/04/video-conference-anywhere-with-low.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><ins>last year</ins></a>. It uses AI to examine light levels and tweak the brightness. There&#8217;s no admin control for the feature, though users will be able to <a href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9302964?ref_topic=7294099" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><ins>switch it off</ins></a> — Google says having it enabled might slow down your device.</p>
<p>The feature is coming to all <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google%20workspace" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><ins>Workspace</ins></a> and G Suite basic and business users. Google is rolling it out to Rapid Release domains starting today and Scheduled Release domains on October 4th. The rollout will take up to 15 days in both cases, so by mid-October, bad webcam feeds could be a thing of the past on Meet calls.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">September arrived in the blink of an eye, and October 27 — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=groupdiscountpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=groupdiscountpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a> to be precise — is hot on its heels. Now’s the time to gather your team and strategize how you’ll cover the day-long event to make as many connections and discover as many opportunities as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Take advantage of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=groupdiscountpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=groupdiscountpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the early-bird group discount</a>. When you buy passes for four or more people, you pay just $45 each — that’s $30 off each pass. Sweet!</p>
<p>Don’t dilly-dally or shillyshally. The early-bird price <strong>expires on October 1 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>.</p>
<p>Your pass may be discounted, but you’ll get the full TC Sessions experience — all the speakers, demos, networking and breakout sessions. Plus, video-on-demand means you can catch up later on anything you miss, when it fits your schedule.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/announcing-the-agenda-for-techcrunch-sessions-saas/">the event agenda</a> or read more about just some of the many <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/check-out-whos-coming-to-tc-sessions-saas-2021/">people and companies</a> coming to TC Sessions: SaaS. <strong>Note:</strong> We’re adding new speakers and presentations to the event agenda every week, and you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#333d7903-8740-45ee-a389-8e0332035e57">sign up here for updates</a>.</p>
<p>As a team, you can cover more ground. Tune in to a main-stage panel discussion while one colleague dives into a breakout session and another sets up a 1:1 product demo or taps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/expand-your-saas-empire-network-with-crunchmatch-at-tc-sessions-saas-2021/">CrunchMatch</a> to connect with potential investors. You might go faster alone, but you’ll go further together.</p>
<p>You can bet the industry’s top experts will be in the virtual house covering both the benefits and challenges of SaaS: the Next Generation. Here are just two examples:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>SaaS Security, Today and Tomorrow:</strong> Enterprises face a constant stream of threats, from nation states to cybercriminals and corporate insiders. After a year where billions worked from home and the cloud reigned supreme, startups and corporations alike can’t afford to stay off the security pulse. Edna Conway, vice president, chief security &amp; risk officer, Azure, Microsoft, and Olivia Rose, CISO, VP of IT &amp; security, Amplitude, discuss what SaaS startups need to know about security now, and in the future.</li>
<li><strong>How Startups are Turning Data into Software Gold:</strong> The era of big data is behind us. Today’s leading SaaS startups are working with data instead of merely fighting to help customers collect information. Jenn Knight (AgentSync), Barr Moses (Monte Carlo) and Dan Wright (DataRobot), leaders of three data-focused startups, will discuss how today’s SaaS companies leverage data to build new companies, attack new problems and, of course, scale like mad.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[Bzaar, a business-to-business cross-border marketplace, is connecting retailers with over 50 export-ready manufacturers in India.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Small businesses in the U.S. now have a new way to source home and lifestyle goods from new manufacturers. <a href="https://www.bzaar.com/">Bzaar</a>, a business-to-business cross-border marketplace, is connecting retailers with over 50 export-ready manufacturers in India.</p>
<p>The U.S.-based company announced Monday that it raised $4 million in seed funding, led by Canaan Partners, and including angel investors Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal, PhonePe founders Sameer Nigam and Rahul Chari, Addition founder Lee Fixel and Helion Ventures co-founder Ashish Gupta.</p>
<p>Nishant Verman and Prasanth Nair co-founded Bzaar in 2020 and consider their company to be like a “fair without borders,” Verman put it. Prior to founding Bzaar, Verman was at Bangalore-based Flipkart until it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/09/walmart-confirms-16b-flipkart-investment-giving-it-77-in-indias-e-commerce-leader/">acquired by Walmart in 2018</a>. He then was at Canaan Partners in the U.S.</p>
<p>“We think the next 10 years of global trade will be different from the last 100 years,” he added. “That’s why we think this business needs to exist.”</p>
<p>Traditionally, small U.S. buyers did not have feet on the ground in manufacturing hubs, like China, to manage shipments of goods in the same way that large retailers did. Then Alibaba came along in the late 1990s and began acting as a gatekeeper for cross-border purchases, Verman said. <a href="https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/china-mongolia-taiwan/peoples-republic-china#:~:text=U.S.%20goods%20imports%20from%20China,U.S.%20goods%20imports%20in%202019.">U.S. goods imports from China</a> totaled $451.7 billion in 2019, while <a href="https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/south-central-asia/india">U.S. goods imports from India</a> in 2019 were $87.4 billion.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2204687" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2204687" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2204687" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image1.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image1.jpeg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image1.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image1.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image1.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image1.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image1.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image1.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2204687" class="wp-caption-text">Bzaar screenshot. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bzaar</p></div></p>
<p>Small buyers could buy home and lifestyle goods, but it was typically through the same sellers, and there was not often a unique selection, nor were goods available handmade or using organic materials, he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Bzaar, small buyers can purchase over 10,000 wholesale goods on its marketplace from other countries like India and Southeast Asia. The company guarantees products arrive within two weeks and manage all of the packaging logistics and buyer protection.</p>
<p>Verman and Nair launched the marketplace in April and had thousands users in three continents purchasing from the platform within six months. Meanwhile, products on Bzaar are up to 50% cheaper than domestic U.S. platforms, while SKU selection is growing doubling every month, Verman said.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to invest in marketing to get in front of buyers and invest on its technology to advance its cataloging feature so that goods pass through customs seamlessly. Wanting to provide new features for its small business customers, Verman also intends to create a credit feature to enable buyers to pay in installments or up to 90 days later.</p>
<p>“We feel this is a once-in-a-lifetime shift in how global trade works,” he added. “You need the right team in place to do this because the problem is quite complex to take products from a small town in Vietnam to Nashville. With our infrastructure in place, the good news is there are already shops and buyers, and we are stitching them together to give buyers a seamless experience.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Applications networking company F5 has announced it’s acquiring Threat Stack, a Boston-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cloud-security/">cloud security</a> and compliance startup, for $68 million.</p>
<p>The deal, which comes months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/f5-snags-volterra-multi-cloud-management-startup-for-500m/">F5 bought multi-cloud management startup Volterra for $500 million</a>, sees the 25-year-old company looking to bolster its cloud security portfolio as applications become a growing focus for cybercriminals. Businesses lose more than $100 billion a year to attacks targeting digital experiences, F5 says, and these experiences are increasingly powered by applications distributed across multiple environments and interconnected through APIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/threat-stack">Threat Stack</a>, which was founded in November 2012 and has since amassed more than $70 million across six funding rounds, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/19/threat-stack-secures-45-million-investment-with-spotlight-shining-brightly-on-security/">$45 million Series C round led by F-Prime Capital Partners and Eight Roads Ventures</a>, specializes in cloud security for applications and provides customers with real-time threat detection for cloud infrastructure and workloads. Unlike many cloud security tools that kick in after an intrusion, Threat Stack takes a more proactive approach, alerting organizations to all known vulnerabilities and providing a report on the holes that need to be plugged.</p>
<p>The startup’s intrusion detection platform, the Threat Stack Cloud Security Platform, works across cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud and containerized environments, and is perhaps best known for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/slack/">Slack</a> integration that alerts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/devops/">DevOps</a> teams to security concerns in real time. Threat Stack has a number of big-name customers, according to its website, including Glassdoor, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ping-identity/">Ping Identity</a> and Proofpoint.</p>
<p>F5 says that integrating its application and API protection solutions with Threat Stack’s cloud security capabilities and expertise will enhance visibility across application infrastructure and workloads, making it easier for customers to adopt consistent security in any cloud.</p>
<p>“Applications are the backbone of today’s modern businesses, and protecting them is mission-critical for our customers,” said Haiyan Song, EVP of Security at F5. “Threat Stack brings technology and talent that will strengthen F5’s security capabilities and further our adaptive applications vision with broader cloud observability and actionable security insights for customers.”</p>
<p>The acquisition, which is expected to close in F5&#8217;s first-quarter fiscal year 2022, is subject to closing conditions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The GitLab debut is set to make a lot of funds material coin.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Picking up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/inside-gitlabs-ipo-filing/">where we left off Friday</a>, let&#8217;s spend some more time in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001653482/000162828021018818/gitlab-sx1.htm#i359e99a49d03416a83f04e786aaaf108_61">the GitLab IPO filing</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be an IPO week, mind; Toast and Freshworks are set to price Tuesday after the close of trading and begin to float on Wednesday. Expect final notes on the value of each and reports on how they trade when they do. The Exchange will also try to get on calls with the CEOs. But because it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">Disrupt</a> week, things are going to be a little chaotic.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But that&#8217;s tomorrow. This morning, we&#8217;re digging back into developer toolkit GitLab and its impending IPO. Let&#8217;s start with a dive into the venture capital players that are going to make out in its public offering. And for the sake of having fun on a Monday, we&#8217;ll look back at the GitHub-Microsoft deal. The former CTO of GitHub dropped some interesting data on the company&#8217;s historical results that we can use to back into what the deal would be worth today if it happened.</p>

And we&#8217;ll close with an examination of GitLab&#8217;s quarterly data to see if a more narrow view of the company&#8217;s operating results tells us anything useful. Let&#8217;s have some fun!</p>
<h2>GitLab&#8217;s rich list</h2>
<p>As a private company, GitLab raised huge sums of capital &#8212; more than $400 million, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gitlab-com/company_financials">per Crunchbase data</a>. The capital came in increasingly large chunks from the company&#8217;s seed rounds back in 2015 through its late 2019 Series E.</p>
<p>Khosla Ventures led the company&#8217;s early rounds before GV, Goldman Sachs and ICONIQ Capital took the baton.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, those names are the ones we can spy on in the company&#8217;s major shareholder list. From the GitLab S-1 filing, what follows are share counts and percentage ownership stakes for the company&#8217;s investors that own more than 5% of its stock:</p>
<ul>
<li>August Capital: 14,931,200 Class B shares, or 11.1% of that equity class.</li>
<li>GV: 8,888,776 Class B shares, or 6.6% of that equity class.</li>
<li>ICONIQ: 15,472,204 Class B shares, or 11.6% of that equity class.</li>
<li>ICONIQ: 1,150,784 Class A shares, or 100% of that equity class (to be diluted in IPO).</li>
<li>Khosla: 19,028,320 Class B shares, or 14.1% of that equity class.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given that GitLab was valued at $6 billion earlier this year in a secondary transaction, the percentages above convert to huge sums. August Capital, for example, at that price point, is set to reap north of $600 million. That&#8217;s bigger than the entire fund from which it snagged ownership, the firm&#8217;s $450 million Fund VII.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just like that, they came back.</p>
<p>The Inspiration4 crew made a triumphant splashdown on Saturday evening off the east coast of Florida, marking the close of the first completely private, all-civilian space mission. SpaceX’s Go Searcher recovery ship hauled in the Crew Dragon capsule, dubbed Resilience, a little less than an hour after splashdown. The crew was then ferried via helicopter to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, where they received standard medical checks.</p>
<p>The successful completion of the mission is a major triumph for Elon Musk and SpaceX (and, more peripherally, NASA, which funded the development of the tech), which conducted the entirety of the mission. It’s also perhaps our clearest signal that a new dawn of space travel is officially here.</p>
<p>Benji Reed, SpaceX’s senior director for human-spaceflight programs, told reporters that the company is seeing an increased number of inquiries from potential customers for private missions. The company could fly “three, four, five, six times a year at least,” he said.</p>
<p>Of course, mission commander Jared Isaacman is not the first billionaire to go to space. This summer, both Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos conducted their own orbital joy-rides in vehicles developed by their respective companies, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/virgin-galactic-and-richard-branson-celebrate-launch-of-first-passengers-into-space/">Virgin Galactic</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/blue-origins-new-shepard-carries-jeff-bezos-and-three-crew-members-to-space-and-back/">Blue Origin</a>. But those trips were significantly shorter &#8212; Bezos and his three crewmates went to space and back in less than 15 minutes, essentially traveling in a long parabolic arc.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Inspiration4 crew spent three days orbiting Earth at an altitude that went as high as 590 kilometers &#8212; that’s higher than the International Space Station, meaning they were the most &#8220;outer&#8221; of all the people in space. Over the course of their mission, they traveled around the Earth an average of 15 times per day.</p>
<p>While in orbit, the crew conducted a handful of science experiments, mostly capturing data on themselves with the aim of furthering our understanding of the effects of spaceflight on the human body. The crew also spent some time in the large glass domed window, which SpaceX calls the “cupola,” snapping pictures of space.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Other than Isaacman, who made his fortune from his payment processing company Shift4 payments, the crew included physician assistant and childhood cancer survivor Hayley Arceneaux; geoscientist Sian Proctor; and Lockheed Martin engineer Chris Sembroski. Among the other firsts for the crew, Arceneaux is the youngest American to go to space and the first person with a prosthesis to go to space; Proctor is the first Black woman to pilot a space mission.</p>

<p>The historic mission was paid for entirely by Isaacman, though both he and SpaceX are staying mum on how much it cost in total. Instead, the mission was being framed as a $200 million fundraiser for St. Jude Research Hospital, to which Isaacman donated $100 million and Musk donated $50 million. The fundraiser received an additional $60.2 million in public donations.</p>
<p>This is the second time the Resilience spacecraft has safely carried humans to and from space. The first mission, Crew-1, carried four astronauts (three from NASA, one from the Japanese space agency) to the ISS and returned them to Earth in May. SpaceX will be conducting another handful of crewed missions over the next six months, including another mission to the ISS on behalf of NASA and the European Space Agency, as well as the private <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/axiom-space-and-nasa-detail-first-fully-private-human-launch-to-the-space-station-set-for-january-2022/">AX-1 mission</a> on behalf of Axiom Space.</p>
<p>“Thanks so much SpaceX, that was a heck of a ride for us,” Isaacman said moments after the capsule landed. “We’re just getting started.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>The future of transportation beat was flooded with news this week as per ushe. There are two stories that I want to highlight here. First up, is that the first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/rivians-first-production-r1t-electric-pickup-truck-rolls-off-the-line/"><strong>Rivian</strong> R1T electric pickup truck</a> in &#8220;Rivian blue&#8221; rolled off the assembly line at the company&#8217;s factory in Normal, Illinois. The R1T and the upcoming R1S SUV are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/rivian-vehicles-are-now-ready-for-sale-in-all-50-states-following-key-certifications/">also now certified</a> to be sold in all 50 states (at least online).</p>
<p>This marks a milestone more than a decade in the making for the automaker and its founder and CEO, RJ Scaringe, who started the company in 2009 as Mainstream Motors before adopting the Rivian name two years later. Rivian has undergone explosive growth in terms of people, backers and partners in the past few years. If the company has a successful IPO, which it confidentially filed for recently, it could grow even faster.</p>
<p>Next up, is <strong>Tesla</strong> and its &#8220;Full Self-Driving&#8221; beta software, which is about to become accessible to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/tesla-will-open-controversial-fsd-beta-software-to-owners-with-a-good-driving-record/">a lot more owners</a>.</p>
<p>The FSD Beta v10.0.1 software update, which has already been pushed out to a group of select owners, will become more widely available starting September 24. Tesla CEO Elon Musk issued a caveat that personal driving metrics captured over a seven-day period via telemetry data will determine whether owners who have paid for its FSD software can access the latest beta version that promises more automated driving functions.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/nt2qkb/ive_been_doing_some_more_reverse_engineering/">Reddit post</a> from several months ago provides hints on what data will be used. The poster, who has reversed engineered the Tesla app, found that the company was getting ready to implement insurance directly into the app. There will be a new safety rating page that will track an owner&#8217;s vehicle and is linked to their insurance. It&#8217;s possible that this is what Musk was referring to when he tweeted &#8220;beta button will request permission to assess driving behavior using Tesla insurance calculator. If driving behavior is good for 7 days, beta access will be granted.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to the Redditor, the app will track the number of times the ABS is activated, average number of hours driven daily, number of times Autopilot is disabled because alert is ignored, forward collision warnings, amount of time spent at an unsafe following distance and intensity of acceleration and braking.</p>
<p>This release on September 24, which will mean potentially thousands of Tesla owners trying out beta software on public roads, is going to test the will of regulators. Jennifer Homendy, the new head of the National Transportation Safety Board, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-push-to-expand-teslas-driver-assistance-to-cities-rankles-a-top-safety-authority-11632043803?mod=hp_lead_pos3">told the WSJ</a> that Tesla shouldn&#8217;t roll out this latest software update until it can address &#8220;basic safety issues.&#8221; NTSB is not a regulator; it investigates crashes and issues safety recommendations. So while her voice matters and is listened to, the NTSB cannot prevent Tesla from pushing this software update, or any other one, to owners.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwv5uKBhD6ARIsAGv9a-xR8h0mWH_jvVGR99vn6hgaBSMn1drRlYxeykQ7bQ4_jUhf2sZMseQaAkLxEALw_wcB"><strong>TechCrunch Disrupt is here</strong></a>! The event kicks off Tuesday and I hope to see you all there. There&#8217;s even a photo booth (virtual) and I want you to share your photos if you use it.</p>

<p>Lane detection, pedestrian detection, advanced braking systems. These sound like driver assistance features you might find in a new SUV, sedan or truck. These days, this tech is creeping into electric scooters.</p>
<p>The pressure on operators to build scooters that are robust, safe and combat issues like sidewalk clutter has prompted companies to develop and equip their vehicles with advanced driver assistance features. Operators like <strong>Voi</strong>, <strong>Spin</strong>, <strong>Superpedestrian</strong>, <strong>Zipp</strong> and<strong> Bird</strong> have all started to integrate tech that can detect when someone is riding on the sidewalk or parking a scooter where it shouldn&#8217;t be. Whether through camera-based computer vision or through really accurate geopositioning software, these scooters not only know exactly where a rider is, but they can also put the brakes on or slow them down if they&#8217;re breaking the rules.</p>
<p>The question is, is it necessary? My view is that this wouldn&#8217;t be necessary if cities stopped offloading the cost of safety onto operators and instead invested in protected bike lanes.</p>
<p>Check out my ExtraCrunch story that looks deeper into the tech, which I&#8217;ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/advanced-rider-assistance-systems-tech-spawned-by-the-politics-of-micromobility/">dubbed scooter ADAS</a>.</p>
<h3>Bird launches its shared e-bike in San Diego</h3>
<p>Bird has an exclusive micromobility contract with San Diego State University. Bird&#8217;s bike share operation, which was officially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/bird-launches-shared-e-bikes-and-opens-its-app-to-local-shared-operators/">launched in June</a>, will be available to the 34,000 students on campus.</p>
<h3>Brooklyn Bridge gets a dedicated bike lane</h3>
<p>Bikers these days don&#8217;t know how good they&#8217;ve got it. I remember when I had to ring my bike bell like a mad woman trying to get pedestrians to part for me as I attempted to ride over the busy <strong>Brooklyn Bridge</strong>. Now, the iconic bridge has its own dedicated two-way bike lane. This is huge news. HUGE. I only wish I were back home to see it. And the best part is that the lane was taken from cars and given back to the people!</p>
<h3>Compact, foldable and made in Japan</h3>
<p>A company called <strong>Shaero</strong> just <a href="https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/news/tokyo-has-a-new-electric-moped-sharing-service-with-stations-around-the-city-091321">launched in Tokyo</a> with a docked shared tiny moped that can be folded and stored inside lockers between trips. Forget scooter ADAS &#8212; more of this please!</p>
<h3>Tax break for e-bikes</h3>
<p>The <strong>U.S. House Ways and Means Committee</strong> proposed creating a <a href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/sites/democrats.waysandmeans.house.gov/files/documents/Section%20by%20Section%20Subtitle%20F%2C%20G%2C%20H%2C%20%26%20J.pdf">15 percent tax credit</a> for e-bike purchases if you earn less than $75,000 per year. This is down from a 30 percent rebate with no income limits in the last version of the bill, which would have been way better, but I guess baby steps?</p>
<h3>The latest e-bikes</h3>
<p>This week a lot of new e-bikes launched. Here&#8217;s a bit of a roundup:</p>
<p>The <strong>Crown Cruiser</strong> is a retro-futuristic looking e-bike with inbuilt smart technologies like anti-theft tech and a gyro and accelerometer sensor that detects impact. The lightweight frame is made out of carbon fiber, it&#8217;s got long-range swappable 36V or 48V batteries with a range of 100 miles or more and its DC hub motor is so powerful the bike can hit top speeds of 31 mph. The Cruiser is currently<a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/crowncruiser-carbon-fiber-e-bike#/"> fundraising on Indiegogo</a>, and has received a £139,000 Sustainable Innovation grant from the UK government.</p>
<p><strong>Daymak</strong> has announced the release of their Terra e-bike, part of the company&#8217;s Avvenire series. The bike comes in the Terra Deluxe (targeted MSRP of $3,495) and Terra Ultimate (targeted MSRP of $7,999). With two 15W solar panels that trickle life into the battery and multi-level pedal assist, it can get up to 60miles of range and a max speed of 20 mph. The Terra comes with built-in Bluetooth speakers and a drink holder. It also has launched with RidePoints and Daymak Drive X capabilities, which according to Daymak mean that riders can collect redeemable points via the company&#8217;s EV reward program for just riding around, and that the bike is blockchain-enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Harley-Davidson</strong> is going to offer limited sales through its ebike spinoff<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> <a href="https://www.serial1.com/">Serial 1</a>, of vintage-inspired electric bike model known as the limited edition </span>S1 Series ebike.</p>
<p><strong>Zaiser Motors</strong> announced that it reached its <a href="https://wefunder.com/zaiser.motors">Wefunder campaign goals</a> and has released the specs for its platform redesign, which includes the addition of a second sportier electric motorcycle, the Arrow. Its first &#8220;Electrocycle&#8221; is called the Silhouette and and has 300 miles of range with a 120 mph top speed. Both designs look like something you might make Yoshi drive on Mario Kart, complete with a shiny and bubbly red chassis. The Arrow is designed for city riders, is priced at $8,500 and has an expected range of 160 miles with a 100 mph top speed.</p>
<p>Active lifestyle brand <strong>Retrospec</strong> has released the <a href="https://retrospec.com/products/valen-rev-electric-bike">Valen Rev</a>, a moto-style electric bike that makes me want to cruise alongside a boardwalk on a California beach. Honestly, it&#8217;s a really cute-looking bike, with a retro vibe to it, a tan leather saddle and a choice between fog blue, olive green or black &#8212; all matte. It&#8217;s got a 48V motor, 6 levels of pedal assist and a 50-mile range, all for the reasonable price of $1,799.99.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>It seemed as if the number of mobility-related SPAC deals had slowed. That brief pause was broken by Gogoro, the 10-year-old Taiwanese company best known for its electric scooters and swappable battery infrastructure.</p>
<p>The company has agreed to merge with Poema Global, a SPAC affiliated with Princeville Capital, in a deal that sets its enterprise valuation at $2.35 billion. If approved by shareholders. the company will trade on the Nasdaq exchange under the symbol GGR.</p>
<p>Gogoro stands to make $550 million in proceeds, assuming as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/gogoro-will-go-public-on-nasdaq-after-2-35b-spac-deal/">TechCrunch Catherine Shu reports</a>, there are no redemptions. (A growing trend I really need to address in this newsletter). Those funds include an oversubscribed private investment in public equity of more than $250 million and $345 million held in trust by Poema Global. Investors in the PIPE include strategic partners like Hon Hai (Foxconn) Technology Group and GoTo, the Indonesian tech giant created through the merger of Gojek and Tokopedia, and new and existing investors like Generation Investment Management, Taiwan&#8217;s National Development Fund, Temasek and Dr. Samuel Yin of Ruentex Group, Gogoro&#8217;s founding investor.</p>
<p>So why now? Founder and CEO Horace Luke provided a curious answer that I know will cause a few of my institutional investor friends to raise an eyebrow or two. Luke first explained that with fresh partnerships in place — Yadea and DCJ in China to build a battery-swapping network and Hero MotoCorp in India to launch scooters — it was time to take the company to the next level.</p>
<p>And he added that Gogoro decided to go the SPAC route because &#8220;you can talk a lot deeper about what the business opportunity is, what the structure is, what the partnerships are, so you can properly value a company rather than a quick roadshow. Given our business plans, it gives us a great opportunity to focus on the expansion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Huh. Anyone ever heard of a &#8220;quick roadshow?&#8221; Comments from some founders who have taken the traditional IPO path would suggest the contrary.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>BridgeLinx</strong>, the Lahore-based startup that operates a digital freight marketplace, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/digital-freight-marketplace-bridgelinx-raises-10-million-in-pakistans-largest-seed-funding/">raised $10 million</a> in what is the largest seed financing round in Pakistan.

<p>Hello everyone! Welcome back to policy corner. Remember the safety probe the <strong>National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration</strong> opened into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/">Tesla Autopilot</a> in August? In case your memory needs refreshing: NHTSA opened a preliminary investigation into 12 (originally eleven) incidents of Tesla cars crashing into parked emergency vehicles. The regulator <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/tesla-ordered-to-share-autopilot-data-with-the-us-traffic-safety-agency/">ordered Tesla</a> to hand over detailed data on the ADAS by October 22 or risk facing a fine of up to $115 million.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, NHTSA sent letters to 12 automakers &#8212; including <strong>Ford</strong>, <strong>VW</strong>, and <strong>General Motors</strong> &#8212; requesting data on their Level 2 ADAS to aid it in its investigation. The <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/525253207/NHTSA-Ford-letter#from_embed&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673497/tesla-nhtsa-autopilot-investigation-data-ford-gm-vw-toyota&amp;xcust=___vg__p_22437538__t_w__r_theverge.com/cars__d_D">letter to Ford</a> says the information request is &#8220;to gather information in support of [the agency&#8217;s] comparative analysis amongst production vehicles equipped with the ability to control both steering and braking/accelerating simultaneously under some circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among the data NHTSA is interested in obtaining: the number of vehicles equipped with ADAS the automaker has manufactured; how the company approaches the enforcement of driver attentiveness; other details about the system, like the conditions that would require driver take-over; as well as any consumer complaints, lawsuits, or crash reports related to the system.</p>
<p>Why is this news in policy corner? Well, similar to how each <strong>Supreme Court</strong> adjudication creates the law, the results of NHTSA&#8217;s investigations could also set a precedent for how ADAS is regulated writ large. The agency leveraging its broad authority to gather information could result in new standards or rules for how automakers develop and deploy ADAS in millions of cars now and into the future.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that NHTSA really is empowered with a huge amount of authority &#8212; they could issue a recall of every Tesla on the road, if they so deemed that its Autopilot was sufficiently unsafe.</p>
<p>Speaking of Tesla and GM &#8230; it looks likely that the per-manufacturer cap disqualifying the two automakers&#8217; vehicles from the so-called &#8220;30D&#8221; $7,500 tax credit may be removed soon. They&#8217;re disqualified because each automaker has sold more than 200,000 EVs. Anyway, there are two separate proposals being debated in Congress, one in the House and one in the Senate, as part of a larger effort to overhaul and potentially dramatically expand the 30D credit (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/toyota-honda-urge-congress-to-reject-expanded-tax-incentive-that-would-benefit-ford-gm-stellantis/">I wrote about it here</a>). While the proposals have a few significant differences, removing the manufacturer cap isn&#8217;t one of them. What that means is a Tesla Model 3 or a new Cadillac EV would once again qualify.</p>
<p><strong>One more note &#8230;</strong> Evidently, the <strong>New Jersey Board of Public Utilities</strong> <a href="https://www.njspotlight.com/2021/09/nj-ev-electric-car-incentive-so-popular-paused-so-enough-cash-for-those-already-applied/">halted the approval</a> of new applications for its grant program for purchasing an electric vehicle &#8212; because the $30 million earmarked to cover the program is already nearly out of money! Under the Charge Up New Jersey program, people can apply for grants of up to $5,000 for an EV. But demand is so high that that money is already nearly gone.</p>

<p><strong>Let&#8217;s dig into the news of the week &#8230;</strong></p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Walmart</strong> has tapped <strong>Argo AI</strong> and <strong>Ford</strong> to launch an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/walmart-to-launch-autonomous-delivery-service-with-ford-and-argo-ai/">autonomous vehicle delivery service</a> in Austin, Miami and Washington, D.C. The service will allow customers to place online orders for groceries and other items using Walmart&#8217;s ordering platform. Argo&#8217;s cloud-based infrastructure will be integrated with Walmart&#8217;s online platform, routing the orders and scheduling package deliveries to customers&#8217; homes. Initially, the commercial service will be limited to specific geographic areas in each city and will expand over time. The companies will begin testing later this year.</p>
<h3>Batteries</h3>
<p><strong>Redwood Materials</strong>, the company started by former Tesla co-founder and CTO JB Straubel that aims to create a circular supply chain for batteries, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/jb-straubels-redwood-materials-is-expanding-into-the-battery-materials-business/">expanding beyond recycling</a>. Redwood announced plans to simplify the supply chain by producing critical battery materials and is currently scouting a location for a new million-square-foot factory, at a cost of over $1 billion.</p>
<p>That factory will be dedicated to the production of cathodes and anode foils, the two essential building blocks of a lithium-ion battery structure &#8212; up to a projected volume of 100 gigawatt-hour per year&#8217;s worth of materials, enough for one million electric vehicles, by 2025.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Ford Motor</strong> announced plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/ford-boosts-spending-to-increase-production-capacity-of-its-f-150-lightning-electric-truck/">invest another $250 million</a> and add 450 jobs to increase production capacity of its upcoming F-150 Lightning to 80,000 all-electric trucks annually. The announcement comes after receiving more than 150,000 pre-orders for the all-electric pickup truck. The additional funds and jobs will be spread out across its new Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan, Van Dyke Electric Powertrain Center and Rawsonville Components Plant.</p>
<p><strong>Lucid Group</strong>, the all-electric automaker slated to go public this year, said one variant of its upcoming luxury Air sedan has an EPA range of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/lucid-air-snags-the-longest-range-ev-title-surpassing-tesla/">more than 520 miles</a>. The official rating of the Lucid Air Dream Edition Range variant pushes Lucid past Tesla, a company that has long dominated in this category. This announcement not only gives Lucid bragging rights, it reveals a bit about the company&#8217;s strategy to offer a variety of versions of the Air sedan with prices ranging between $169,000 and $77,400.</p>
<p>The <strong>National Transportation Safety Board</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/NTSB_Newsroom/status/1438960100027338753?s=20">announced via Twitter</a> it will investigate a Tesla vehicle crash that killed two people in Coral Gables, Florida. It is not clear if the company&#8217;s advanced driver assistance system Autopilot was engaged at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Polestar</strong> has shared a few more details of its future electric SUV, including that it will have only two rows of seats, offer single-motor and dual-motor versions and have a powertrain that goes beyond EV versions of the Volvo XC90, <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a37575612/polestar-3-suv-details/">Car and Driver reported</a>.</p>
<h3>People news</h3>
<p><strong>Clive Sinclair</strong>, the British entrepreneur and inventor behind the ZX personal computer, pocket calculator and numerous other consumer electronics, died at age 81. Sinclair was also interested in electric vehicles. He invented the infamous Sinclair C5 electric trike, which would spectacularly fail in 1982 only to gain a cult following many years later. Sinclair would invent other electric vehicles, including the electric bike called Sinclair Zike in 1992.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facetune developer <a href="https://www.lightricks.com/">Lightricks</a>, which operates more than a dozen subscription-based photo- and video-editing apps across iOS and Android, now has $130 million in new funding to further grow its business. The company&#8217;s newly announced Series D round includes $100 million in primary and $30 million in secondary funding, and now values the company at $1.8 billion. To date, Lightricks has raised $335 million.</p>
<p>The new round was co-led by New York-based VC firm Insight Partners and Hanaco Venture Capital and includes new investors Migdal Insurance, Altshuler Shaham and Shavit Capital. Existing investors Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Claltech, Harel Insurance and Finance, and Greycroft, also participated.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s last round of funding was its pre-pandemic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/31/the-maker-of-popular-selfie-app-facetune-just-landed-135-million-at-a-unicorn-valuation/">raise of $135 million</a>, which minted the company as a unicorn.</p>
<p>Based in Jerusalem, Lightricks has been best known for its photo-editing app Facetune, which puts Photoshop-like retouching tools into the hands of consumers. The app quickly gained traction as online influencers tweaked their Instagram photos to look more polished, perfected and blemish-free. This growth wasn&#8217;t without controversy, however, as some argued how image-editing apps like Facetune <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/09/facetune-photoshopping-app-instagram-body-image-debate">took airbrushing too far,</a> contributing to body image issues that now, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">Facebook&#8217;s internal research indicates</a>, could have a negative effect on teenagers&#8217; mental health.</p>
<p>But Facetune was only the beginning for what&#8217;s since become a mobile editing empire for Lightricks, at a time when everyone is trying to look their best online and create compelling content. Over the years, the company has rolled out the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/28/facetune-2-puts-a-powerful-photo-editor-in-your-pocket/">more powerful Facetune 2</a>, along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/06/facetune-makers-newest-app-enlight-photofox-is-a-powerful-image-editor/">other creativity</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/facetune-makers-latest-app-quickshot-helps-you-take-better-photos/">mobile photo apps</a> that weren&#8217;t focused on selfies. It also expanded its product lineup beyond the creator crowd to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/facetune-maker-lightricks-expands-with-a-trio-of-apps-for-small-businesses/">bring a suite of tools</a> to online marketers and small businesses. And last year, Lightricks more directly responded to the growth in online video as a form of self-expression with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/facetune-maker-lightricks-brings-its-popular-selfie-retouching-features-to-video/">new selfie retouching tool called Facetune Video</a> &#8212; essentially Facetune for the TikTok era.</p>

<p>The company benefitted from COVID-19 lockdowns, as well, as more people participated online and creators, as a group, became more well-established as a way for brands to reach consumers. During peak lockdowns, the company saw a 90% increase in usage across its apps in the U.S. Meanwhile, downloads for its popular Videoleap video editing apps jumped 70% since the start of the pandemic, as TikTok adoption also grew.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Across its suite of apps, the company now touts 29 million monthly active users, where over 5 million are paid subscribers. Its users average around 78 million monthly exports, indicating Lightricks&#8217; sizable impact on the creator economy. In 2021, Lightricks is on track for over $200 million in revenue and plans to grow that figure by 40% in the year ahead.</p>
<p>To do so, the company&#8217;s strategy will change. Instead of just developing its own apps, it&#8217;s now on the hunt for potential acquisitions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our plan is to grow into a one-stop shop creator platform, supporting creators throughout their journey, from content creation to monetization,&#8221; says Zeev Farbman, CEO and co-founder of Lightricks. &#8220;To do so, we are broadening our acquisition activity, while developing other services in-house — our overall M&amp;A objective is advancing our shift into the creator&#8217;s platform. To begin, we are planning between three to five acquisitions, each with a budget of tens of millions of dollars. However, we are also on the lookout for larger ticket size deals if there is enough conviction on both sides,&#8221; he notes.</p>

<p>The company will also enhance its own technology to develop tools and services that will help all creators with content production and monetization, and it will grow its team.</p>
<p>Currently, Lightricks has 460 employees and plans to add 60 more by the end of 2021. The longer-term goal is to grow the team to 1,000 employees by the end of 2023, across roles that include developers, designers and marketing. While most of this growth to date has taken place in Jerusalem, over the next two years, the company plans to grow its teams locally in Haifa, as well as internationally in London and Shenzhen. It may add other locations through M&amp;As, as well.</p>
<p>The U.K. office is now the largest outside of Lightricks&#8217; headquarters, with 23 people. This number is expected to climb to 35 by year-end and be closer to 50 or 60 by the end of 2022, with growth focused on the production of the company&#8217;s new photography app plus customer experience and marketing teams, which were previously only in Israel.</p>

<p>In the U.S., Lightricks is focused on content.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our U.S.-based activity will focus mostly on our content efforts that will provide a vast array of original, acquired and co-produced content to inspire, educate and entertain creators across the entirety of their careers,&#8221; notes Farbman. &#8220;This includes written, video, audio, short and long-form, fun and informative content,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Investors say they see the potential for Lightricks to continue to grow as the creator economy booms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The creator economy has changed the way we, as a society, experience social networks,&#8221; said Pasha Romanovski, co-founding partner of Hanaco Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;Audiences constantly consume information through the different content channels daily. Lightricks’ platform enables creators to have a broader, more professional, and higher-quality set of tools to optimize content. At a time when we are seeing content creators monetize content on social media at new levels, it is clear that Lightricks&#8217; platform has the ability to create a one-stop shop that will be meaningful to its users,&#8221; he added.</p>
