										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup that began its journey in India 15 years ago, helping businesses reach and engage with users through texts said on Thursday it has attained the unicorn status and is also profitable.</p>
<p>San Francisco-headquartered Gupshup has raised $100 million in its Series F financing round from Tiger Global Management, which valued the 15-year-old startup at $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>The startup operates a conversational messaging platform, which is used by over 100,000 businesses and developers today to build their own messaging and conversational experiences to serve their users and customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.gupshup.io">Gupshup</a>, which has raised $150 million to date and concluded its Series E round in 2011, says each month its clients send over 6 billion messages.</p>
<p>“The growth in business use of messaging and conversational experiences, transforming virtually every customer touchpoint, is an exciting secular trend,&#8221; said John Curtius, a partner at Tiger Global Management, in a statement. “Gupshup is uniquely positioned to win in this market with a differentiated product, a clear and sustainable moat, and an experienced team with a proven track record. In addition to its market leadership, Gupshup’s unique combination of scale, growth and profitability attracted us.”</p>
<p>Tens of millions of users in India, including yours truly, remember Gupshup for a different reason, however. For the first six years of its existence, Gupshup was best known for enabling users in India to send group messages to friends. (These <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/the-rise-and-fall-of-missed-calls-in-india/">cheap texts and other clever techniques</a> enabled tens of millions of Indians to stay in touch with one another on phone a decade ago.)</p>
<p>That model eventually became unfeasible to continue, Beerud Sheth, co-founder and chief executive of Gupshup, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>“For that service to work, Gupshup was subsidizing the messages. We were paying the cost to the mobile operators. The idea was that once we scale up, we will put advertisements in those messages. Long story short, we thought as the volume of messages increases, operators will lower their prices, but they didn’t. And also the regulator said we can’t put ads in the messages,” he recalled.</p>
<p>That’s when Gupshup decided to pivot. “We were neither able to subsidize the messages, nor monetize our user base. But we had all of this advanced technology for high-performance messaging. So we switched from consumer model to enterprise model. So we started to serve banks, e-commerce firms, and airlines that need to send high-level messages and can afford to pay for it,” said Sheth, who also co-founder freelance workplace Elance in 1998.</p>
<p>Over the years, Gupshup has expanded to <a href="https://www.gupshup.io/developer/gip-messaging-service">newer messaging channels</a>, including <a href="http://store.gupshup.io">conversational bots</a> and it also helps businesses set up and run <a href="https://www.gupshup.io/developer/whatsapp-api">their WhatsApp channels</a> to engage with customers.</p>
<p>Sheth said scores of major firms worldwide in banking, e-commerce, travel and hospitality and other sectors are among the clients of Gupshup. These firms are using Gupshup to send their customers with transaction information, and authentication codes among other use cases. &#8220;These are not advertising or promotional messages. These are core service information,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The startup, which had an annual run rate of $150 million, will use the fresh capital to broaden its product offering and court clients in more markets. Sheth said a similar use case with businesses he saw in India a decade ago is playing out in many emerging markets, opening avenue of growth for the business messaging platform.</p>
<p>“Gupshup’s mission is to build the tools that help businesses better engage customers through mobile messaging and conversational experiences. As we work towards our mission, we are delighted with this investment from Tiger Global, given its incredible track record of making big, bold, successful bets on innovative, category-defining companies worldwide,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SaaS to support mid-sized companies&#8217; financial planning with real-time data and native collaboration isn&#8217;t the sexiest startup pitch under the sun but it&#8217;s one that&#8217;s swiftly netted <a href="https://www.abacum.io">Abacum</a> a bunch of notable backers &#8212; including Creandum, which is leading a $7M seed round that&#8217;s being announced today.</p>
<p>The rosters of existing investors also participating in the round are Y Combinator (Abacum was part of its latest batch), PROFounders, and K-Fund, along with angel investors such as Justin Kan (Atrium and Twitch co-founder and CEO); Maximilian Tayenthal (N26 co-founder and co-CEO &amp; CFO); Thomas Lehrman (GLG co-founder and ex-CEO), Avi Meir (TravelPerk co-founder and CEO); plus Jenny Bloom (Zapier CFO and Mailchimp ex-CFO) and Mike Asher (CFO at Neo4j).</p>
<p>Abacum was founded last year in the middle of the COVID-19 global lockdown, after what it says was around a year of &#8220;deep research&#8221; to feed its product development. They launched their SaaS in June 2020. And while they&#8217;re not disclosing customer numbers at this early stage their first clients include a range of scale-up companies in the US and in Europe, including the likes of Typeform, Cabify, Ebury, Garten, Jeff and Talkable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup&#8217;s Spanish co-founders &#8212; Julio Martinez, a fintech entrepreneur with an investment banking background, and Jorge Lluch, a European Space Agency engineer turned CFO/COO &#8212; spotted an opportunity to build dedicated software for mid-market finance teams to provide real-time access to data via native collaborative that plugs into key software platforms used by other business units, having felt the pain of a lack of access to real-time data and barriers to collaboration in their own professional experience with the finance function.</p>
<p>The idea with Abacum is to replace the need for finance teams to manually update their models. The SaaS automatically does the updates, fed with real-time data through direct integrations with software used by teams dealing with functions like HR, CRM, ERP (and so on) &#8212; empowering the finance function to collaborate more easily across the business and bolster its strategic decision-making capabilities.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s sales pitch to the target mid-sized companies is multi-layered. Abacum says its SaaS both saves finance teams time and enables faster-decision making.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prior to using Abacum, finance analysts in our clients were easily spending 50% to 70% of their time in manual tasks like downloading files from different systems, copy&amp;pasting them in massive spreadsheets (that crash frequently), formatting the data by manually adding and removing rows, columns and formats, connecting the data in a model prone to manual error (e.g. vlookups &amp; sumifs),&#8221; Martinez tells TechCrunch. &#8220;With Abacum, this entire manual part is automatically done and the finance professionals can spend their time analyzing and adding real value to the business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We enable faster decisions that were not possible prior to Abacum. For instance, some of our clients were updating their cohort analysis on a quarterly basis only because the associated manual tasks were too painful. With us, they&#8217;re able to update the analysis weekly and take better decisions as a result.&#8221;</p>
<p>The SaaS also supports decisions in another way &#8212; by applying machine learning to business data to generate estimates on future performance, providing an AI-based reference point based on historical data that finance teams can use to inform their assumptions.</p>
<p>And it aids cross-business collaboration &#8212; allowing users to share and gather information &#8220;easily through workflows and permissions&#8221;. &#8220;We see that this results in faster and richer decisions as more stakeholders are brought into the process,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Martinez says Abacum chose to focus on mid-market finance teams because they face &#8220;more challenges and inefficiencies&#8221; vs the smaller (and larger) ends of the market. &#8220;In that segment, the finance function is underinvested &#8212; they face the acute complexities of scaling companies that become very pressing but at the same time they are still considered a support function, a back-office,&#8221; he argues.</p>
<p>&#8220;Abacum makes finance a strategic function &#8212; we deliver native collaboration to finance teams so that they become the trusted business partner they want to be. We also see that the pandemic has accelerated the need for finance teams to collaborate effectively and work remotely,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>He also describes the mid market segment as &#8220;fairly unpenetrated&#8221; &#8212; claiming many companies do not yet having a solution in place.</p>
<p>While competitors he points to when asked about other players in the space are long in the tooth in digital terms: Adaptive Insights (2003); Host Analytics (2001); and Anaplan (2008).</p>
<p>Commenting on the seed round in a statement, <span data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">Peter Specht, principal at Creandum, added</span>: &#8220;The financial planning processes in many companies are ripe for disruption and demand more automation. Abacum&#8217;s slick solution empowers finance teams to be more collaborative, efficient and better informed with access to real-time data. We were impressed by their user-friendly product, the initial hiring of top talent, and crucially the strong founders and their extensive operational experience &#8212; including as CFOs and entrepreneurs who have experienced the problem first-hand. We are delighted to be part of Abacum&#8217;s journey to empower global SMEs to bring their financial operations to new levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abacum&#8217;s seed financing will be ploughed into product development and growth, per Martinez, who says it&#8217;s focused on wooing finance teams in the US and Europe for now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://butter.us/">Butter</a>, a startup registered in Denmark but operating fully remote, is building an &#8220;all-in-one&#8221; platform for planning and running virtual workshops.</p>
<p>Offering video software and other features dedicated to workshopping, the idea is to pull people away from using more generic tools, such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams, which, arguably, aren&#8217;t well suited to workshops. It&#8217;s also an idea that will be welcomed by many remote workers trapped in a groundhog day full of back-to-back Zooms &#8212; and one that has already attracted venture capital.</p>
<p>Backing Butter&#8217;s seed round of $2.75 million, which is being disclosed today, is Project A. Others investing in the burgeoning startup are Des Traynor, co-founder and chief strategy officer of Intercom (amongst other angels). It adds to $440,000 previously raised through a mix of equity funding from Morph Capital, venture debt from The Danish Growth Fund and grants from Innovation Fund Denmark.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Butter co-founder and CEO Jakob Knutzen tells me that workshop facilitators, such as strategy consultants, HR trainers and design sprinters, typically have two problems: technical overload and a lack of energy in the workshops.</p>
<p>The former includes having to juggle too many tools needed to plan, run and disseminate a workshop, coupled with unintuitive interfaces and an inability to set up elements of a workshop in advance. The lack of &#8220;energy&#8221; when delivering workshops virtually is likely a harder nut to define and then crack, but anyone who has taken part in an online workshop has likely experienced it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We solve these in two ways,&#8221; says Knutzen, &#8220;[with an] all-in-one tool that helps facilitators prepare, run and debrief the workshop in one place, [and] a delightful design that supports facilitators in delivering a more human experience&#8230; 90% of our users comment on this; Zoom fatigue is real&#8221;.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134583" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134583" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2134583" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="408" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png?resize=1536,922 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png?resize=2048,1229 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2134583" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Butter</p></div></p>
<p>You get started in Butter by creating and setting up a &#8220;room,&#8221; including optionally creating an agenda, polls and timers, as well as various customisation, such as a welcome page, image and (yes) music. Next, you invite workshop participants via an automatically generated link that can easily be shared.</p>
<p>On the day, participants join directly in their browser and the workshop leader runs the workshop using the agenda they created as the main guiding point. Butter also supports various third-party integrations, such as for white boarding, note taking, etc. After the session, facilitators can access a &#8220;recap&#8221; in the room overview with a chat transcript, recording and poll results, etc.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Acapela, from the founder of Dubsmash, hopes ‘asynchronous meetings&#8217; can end Zoom fatigue&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/acapela/embed/#?secret=LULz3XnHVc" data-secret="LULz3XnHVc" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Adds the Butter CEO: &#8220;Down the line, we&#8217;ll make this even more &#8216;full workshop flow&#8217; &#8212; [including] more of the planning part, having a full pre-workshop space for participants, building out the post-workshop experience, etc. But for now, we&#8217;ve doubled down on making the &#8216;during&#8217; part flow smoothly&#8221;.</p>
<p>To that end, Butter is yet to monetise, but will adopt a SaaS model. Meanwhile, Knutzen cites competitors as established but generalist platforms, such as Zoom and Teams; legacy specialist platforms, such as Adobe Connect and Webex for Training; and other startups trying to solve the same problem (e.g. Toasty.ai, circl.es and VideoFacilitator).</p>
<p>&#8220;We differentiate ourselves by being laser focused on workshops,&#8221; he says.</p>

While the fund tends to back Portuguese startups it also hold back 40% of its capital for international deals.</p>
<p>The fund says it has already invested in seven companies: Rows (spreadsheet for app creators), Vawlt (secure and resilient multi-cloud platform), Promptly (SaaS platform for health outcomes analytics), Modatta (decentralized marketplace for consented personal data), Biocol Labs (DTC post-chemical pharmacy), Decipad (low-code notebook) and Detech.ai (AI-powered application and infrastructure monitoring platform).</p>
<p>The fund is also launching what it dubs the “Shilling Platform” &#8211; a pool of learnings and resources for startups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement, Pedro Santos Vieira, managing partner at Shilling said: &#8220;We call it experience-based acceleration. Additionally, we run on a profit-sharing model. Each portfolio founder will receive a share of our returns. This twofold approach fully aligns incentives between Shilling, LPs, and portfolio founders.”</p>
<p>Founded by Hugo Gonçalves Pereira, António Casanova, Diogo da Silveira, João Coelho Borges, Juan Alvarez and Pedro Rutkowski in 2011, Shilling was later joined by tech founders Ricardo Jacinto (Elecctro), Miguel Santo Amaro (Uniplaces), Pedro Ramalho Carlos (IP) and Pedro Santos Vieira (GoodGuide) in the last five years. Since 2011, it has invested in a number of breakout hits from the country, including Unbabel; Bizay; Uniplaces; and Best Tables, acquired by TripADvisor.</p>
<p>Hugo Gonçalves Pereira, founder of Shilling, added: “We are a Portugal-based, globally ambitious, VC fund, with a founder-friendly approach to early-stage investing&#8230; and when we say founder-friendly we truly mean it: in our pre-seed program, ventures go from first call, to money in the bank, in less than 30 days.”</p>
<p>As we noted earlier this year in our ExtraCrunch survey of Lisbon, Portugal, the city is gearing up to join other significant tech hubs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://truelayer.com/">TrueLayer</a>, the London startup that offers a developer-friendly platform for companies, including other fintechs, to utilise open banking, is disclosing $70 million in new funding.</p>
<p>The Series D round is led by new investor Addition. Existing investors, including Anthemis Group, Connect Ventures, Mouro Capital, Northzone and Temasek, also participated. New investors include Visionaries Club, Zack Kanter (CEO Stedi), Daniel Graf (ex-Uber, Google, Twitter) and David Avgi (ex-CEO SafeCharge, CEO UniPaaS).</p>
<p>TrueLayer says the Series D brings the total investment to date to $142 million. The injection of capital will be used to continue scaling its open banking network, which brings together payments, financial data and identity to enable companies to build new products that improve &#8220;how we spend, save, and transact online&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This will include further development of premium open banking-based services that go beyond simply accessing open banking APIs and will enable more innovation across financial services, including embedded finance and payments more generally.</p>
<p>To do this, and to support what it says is growing demand, TrueLayer is expanding its engineering, product and commercial teams. In the past 12 months, the fintech has expanded its services across 12 European markets.</p>
<p>Over the years, TrueLayer CEO and co-founder Francesco Simoneschi and I have often pontificated on what open banking&#8217;s killer use case or use cases may turn out to be. We may finally have our answer: payments.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because one aspect of open banking is payment initiation, which lets an authorised third party initiate the transfer of money out of your bank account on your behalf as an alternative to card payments, which were never built with online payments in mind.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VSJVCUMHTf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/truelayer-the-open-banking-api-provider-discloses-investment-and-partnership-with-visa/">TrueLayer, the open banking API provider, discloses investment and partnership with Visa</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TrueLayer, the open banking API provider, discloses investment and partnership with Visa&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/truelayer-the-open-banking-api-provider-discloses-investment-and-partnership-with-visa/embed/#?secret=VSJVCUMHTf" data-secret="VSJVCUMHTf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“We believe open banking payments will become the default way to pay online, replacing other payment methods in the next five years,” says Simoneschi. “Open banking is digitally native and mobile-first, moving money at a fraction of the cost, securely and conveniently, while also delivering a vastly better consumer experience”.</p>
<p>The past year has also exposed some of the problems with existing payments methods, as people have turned to digital channels to manage every aspect of their lives. “The problem is cards,” says the TrueLayer CEO, “which weren’t designed for online and have been retrofitted into current online payment flows. Newer digital approaches such as Google Pay or Apple Pay paper over those cracks but don’t change the fundamentals”.</p>
<p>Simoneschi says the company has seen the use of its payments API grow rapidly as more consumers embrace instant bank payments. Volumes grew by 600x over the last year, driven by more and more companies adopting open banking payments, including the likes of Revolut, Trading 212, Freetrade and Nutmeg.</p>
<p>“We typically see that 1 in 3 customers choose the open banking payment option after trying it once,” he notes, revealing that for some clients, closer to 70% of their customers are using open banking as the primary payment method.</p>
<p>“There are a number of reasons why it makes sense for customers. For one, they don’t need to remember card details. Instead, they authenticate with their face or fingerprint on their mobile device, instantly and securely. Plus, they’ll never need to update stored details if their card is lost, stolen or expires”.</p>
<p>Open banking payments as a checkout option benefits merchants too, argues Simoneschi. “These payments typically convert 20% better than cards (and up to 40% with our flows) and have success rates higher than 95%, equating to millions or hundreds of millions in recovered revenue at the end of the year,” adds the TrueLayer co-founder.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Byju’s plans to expand to international markets in the second half of next month as the Indian edtech giant, valued at over $13 billion, looks to accelerate its growth, TechCrunch has learned and confirmed.</p>
<p>The Bangalore-based startup, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/byjus-acquires-indian-tutor-aakash-for-nearly-1-billion/">acquired 33-year-old tutor Aakash for nearly $1 billion</a> earlier this week, plans to launch in the U.S., UK, Brazil, Indonesia and Mexico next month and explore other geographies later this year, it told employees in an email.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s international business, to be called Byju&#8217;s Future School, is being led by Karan Bajaj, the founder of coding platform WhiteHat Jr, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/indias-byjus-acquires-whitehat-jr-for-300-million/">Byju&#8217;s acquired for $300 million last year</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We believe that through technology, we can inspire kids all over the world to fall in love with learning. Our global expansion comes at a critical time as families are actively looking for supplemental learning that encourages their children to be creative and learn by doing,” said Byju Raveendran, founder and chief executive of Byju&#8217;s, in a statement. “This launch furthers our vision of creating active learners across the world.”</p>
<p>WhiteHat Jr&#8217;s platform is playing a crucial role in Byju&#8217;s international play. The coding platform, which offers one-to-one session between teachers and students, is enabling Byju&#8217;s to offer its courses in both synchronous and asynchronous formats.</p>
<p>The startup began experimenting in some international markets late last year, and in recent months has hired several high-profile executives to manage each geographies. All of these executives report to Bajaj, people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Byju&#8217;s Future School helps cross the bridge from passive to active learning by offering an interactive learning platform that blends real-time instruction with lessons that generate creative outcomes for kids aged between 6-18 years,&#8221; the email reads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Powered by 11,000 qualified women teachers based in India engaging with students from English-speaking countries, Byju&#8217;s Future School is further targeting to penetrate deeper into non-English speaking markets such as Mexico and Brazil. The coding curriculum will also be available in Spanish and Portuguese, besides onboarding qualified women teachers who engage with students in these two countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Byju&#8217;s Future School plans to offer a range of subjects including music, english, fine arts and science, the startup told employees, and coding and math will be available at the launch.</p>
<p><em>The story was updated with confirmation from Byju&#8217;s.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.nabla.com">Nabla</a>, a French startup launching a new app today focused on women’s health. On Nabla, you’ll find several services that should all contribute to helping you stay on top of your health. In short, Nabla lets you chat with practitioners, offers community content, helps you centralize all your medical data and will soon offer telemedicine appointments.</p>
<p>Nabla’s key feature right now is the ability to start a conversation with health professionals. You can send a message to a general practitioner, a gynecologist, a midwife, a nurse, a nutritionist, or a physiotherapist.</p>
<p>While text discussions are not going to replace in-person appointments altogether, they can definitely be helpful. By increasing the number of interactions with health professionals, chances are you’ll be healthier and you may even end up booking more in-person appointments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other French startups have been providing text conversations with practitioners. For instance, health insurance company <a href="https://alan.com">Alan</a> lets you message a general practitioner — but you have to be insured by Alan. <a href="https://bilo.ba">Biloba</a> also lets you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/biloba-lets-you-chat-with-a-doctor-if-you-have-questions-about-your-children/">chat with a doctor</a> —&nbsp;but the company has been focusing on pediatrics.</p>
<p>Nabla has a different positioning and offers this feature for free — there’s a limit as you can only send a handful of questions per month though. If it’s a common question, you may find the answer from the community. Nabla’s doctors will curate community content as well.</p>
<p>Using a free product to talk about your health feels suspicious. But that’s because the startup is well-funded and plans to launch premium features.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135338" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135338" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Nabla.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="688" class="size-full wp-image-2135338" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Nabla.jpg 2871w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Nabla.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Nabla.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Nabla.jpg?resize=768,516 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Nabla.jpg?resize=680,457 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Nabla.jpg?resize=1536,1031 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Nabla.jpg?resize=2048,1375 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Nabla.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135338" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nabla</p></div></p>
<p>The startup has raised $20.2 million (€17 million) and is already working with a team of doctors who are ready to answer questions from the company’s first users — or patients. Investors in the company include Xavier Niel, Artemis, Rachel Delacour, Julie Pellet, Marc Simoncini and Firstminute Capital.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why Nabla could raise so much money before releasing its app is that the three co-founders have a track record in the tech ecosystem.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Alexandre Lebrun previously founded VirtuOz, which was acquired by Nuance, and <a href="https://wit.ai">Wit.ai</a>, which was acquired by Facebook. More recently, he’s worked for Facebook’s AI research team (FAIR).</p>
<p>Co-founder and COO Delphine Groll has been heading business development and communications for two major media groups <a href="https://corporate.aufeminin.com/en">Aufeminin</a> and <a href="https://www.mylittleparis.com">My Little Paris</a>. And Nabla’s co-founder and CTO Martin Raison has worked with Alexandre Lebrun at both Wit.ai and Facebook.</p>
<p>In addition to text conversations, Nabla shows all your past interactions in a personal log. You can connect that log with other apps and services, such as Apple’s Health app, Clue and Withings. This way, you can see all your data from the same app.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed, the startup truly believes that machine learning can help when it comes to preventive and holistic care. By default, nothing is shared with Nabla for machine learning purposes. But users can opt in and share data to improve processes, personalization and more.</p>
<p>Eventually, Nabla wants to optimize the interactions with doctors as much as possible. The startup says it doesn’t want to replace doctors altogether —&nbsp;it wants to enhance medical interactions so that doctors can focus on the human and empathetic part.</p>
<p>Nabla plans to launch a telemedicine service so that you can interact with doctors in real time as well as a premium offering with more features. That’s an ambitious roadmap, and it’s going to be interesting to track Nabla over the long run to see if they stick to their original vision and find a loyal user base.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hundreds of thousands of used cars are sold in India each month. But buying one through the offline and traditional channel could prove to be a painstakingly long and high-risk process.</p>
<p>A Gurgaon-based startup that is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/indias-spinny-raises-43-7m-to-expand-its-online-platform-for-selling-used-cars/">attempting to improve this experience</a> said on Thursday it has raised a new financing round.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spinny.com/">Spinny</a> has raised $65 million in its Series C financing round, the five-year-old Indian startup said. The new round was led by Silicon Valley-headquartered venture firm General Catalyst, while Feroz Dewan’s Arena Holdings, Think Investments, and existing investors Fundamentum Partnership &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/03/india-the-fundamentum-partnership/">backed by tech veterans Nandan Nilekani and Sanjeev Aggarwal</a> &#8212; and Elevation Capital participated in it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The round, which brings Spinny’s to-date raise to over $120 million, valued the startup at about $350 million, up from about $150 million a year ago, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The startup declined to comment on the valuation.</p>
<p>Spinny operates a platform to facilitate sale and purchase of used cars. One of the biggest challenges people face in buying a used car is the trust factor, and Niraj Singh, co-founder and chief executive of Spinny, says the startup’s thorough and transparent inspection of the car, buying it from the owner, and then selling it to customers is addressing those concerns.</p>
<p>The startup says it is removing the traditional middlemen from the equation, thereby making it more affordable and reliable for customers to buy a used car. If a customer is not satisfied with the car that they have purchased from Spinny, they get their full-refund, he said.</p>
<p>Spinny began its journey as a marketplace for used cars, but Singh said the startup has expanded its offerings to become a full-stack platform.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135671" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135671" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2135671 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spinny.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="468" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spinny.jpg 1496w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spinny.jpg?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spinny.jpg?resize=300,137 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spinny.jpg?resize=768,351 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spinny.jpg?resize=680,311 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spinny.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135671" class="wp-caption-text">Used car marketed is estimated to grow at 22% CAGR to 7.2mn cars sold per year. (BoFA research)</p></div></p>
<p>Days after one of my previous conversations with Singh, New Delhi announced a months-long lockdown in the nation as it moved to contain the spread of the pandemic. Singh said the pandemic did hurt Spinny&#8217;s business for a few months, but the startup has long recovered its pre-pandemic growth figures.</p>
<p>The pandemic made many cautious about taking an Uber or Ola ride, and explore buying their own cars, which accelerated the growth, said Singh. It also significantly reduced the CAC (customer acquisition cost) for Spinny, he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe Spinny is uniquely positioned to tap this opportunity&#8211;given their compelling leadership and their real market momentum. As long time investors, we&#8217;ve been impressed by how Spinny is reinventing every part of the buying process &#8211; injecting trust and safety into every aspect of the customer experience,” said Adam Valkin, General Partner at General Catalyst, in a statement.</p>
<p>Spinny, which was operational in five Indian cities last year, plans to expand to 15 cities by the end of 2021, and also deploy part of the fresh fund to broaden its full-stack platform, said Singh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spinny has become India&#8217;s most trusted used car brand and is on its way to becoming India&#8217;s largest as well. It&#8217;s heartening to hear customers describe the experience of buying a used car from Spinny being better than that of buying a new car. This has been made possible because of Niraj and the entire Spinny team&#8217;s customer obsession and relentless execution. We are privileged to be their early partners and super excited to double down in this round,&#8221; said Mukul Arora, Partner at Elevation Capital, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Food delivery startups, and specifically those focused on grocery delivery, continue to reap super-sized rounds of funding in Europe, buoyed by a year of pandemic living that has led many consumers to shift to shopping online. Today, the latest of these is coming out of Norway.</p>
<p><a href="https://kolonial.no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kolonial</a>, a startup based out of Oslo that offers same-day or next-day delivery of food, meal kits and home essentials &#8212; its aim is to provide &#8220;a weekly shop&#8221; for prices that compete against those of traditional supermarkets &#8212; has raised €223 million ($265 million) in an equity round of funding.</p>
<p>Along with that, the company &#8212; profitable as of this year &#8212; is rebranding to <a href="https://oda.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oda</a> and plans to use the money (and new name) to expand to more markets, starting first with Finland and then Germany in 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CEO and co-founder Karl Munthe-Kaas confirmed to TechCrunch in an interview that the funding values Oda at €750 million ($900 million) post-money.</p>
<p>The market for online grocery ordering and delivery is gearing up to be a very crowded one, with hundreds of millions of dollars being poured by investors into the fuel tanks of a range of startups &#8212; each originating out of different geographies, each with a slightly different approach. Oda believes it has the right mix to end up at the front of the pack.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have found ourselves in a unique position,&#8221; Munthe-Kaas said in the interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;We have built a service targeting the mass market with instant deliveries and low prices, because if you want to capture the full basket for the family, you can’t be a premium service. We&#8217;ve done that, and we&#8217;re profitable.&#8221;</p>
<p>And now, it will have the backing of two e-commerce heavyweights for its next steps.</p>
<p>SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 2 and Prosus (the tech holdings of South Africa&#8217;s Naspers), are co-leading the round, with past backers Kinnevik and a strategic investor, Norwegian &#8220;<a href="https://www.ieseinsight.com/doc.aspx?id=1125" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soft discount</a>&#8221; chain REMA, also participating.</p>
<p>The funding is a big leap for Oda (the name is not officially going to come into effect until the end of this month, although the company is already describing itself with the new brand, so we&#8217;ll follow that lead).</p>
<p><a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/154887-22/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a> notes that before this round, Oda had only raised about $96 million, and its last valuation was estimated to be just $178 million in 2017.</p>
<h2>50 supermarkets in one place</h2>
<p>The company has certainly come a long way. Founded in 2013 by ten friends, in Kolonial originally seemed to have a more modest vision when it first started out: Kolonial in Norwegian doesn&#8217;t mean &#8220;colonial&#8221; (a connotation Munthe-Kaas nevertheless said the startup wanted to avoid, one big reason for the change), but &#8220;cornershop.&#8221;</p>
<p>These days, Oda is focused more on competing against large supermarkets &#8212; its average order size is $120 &#8212; yet with a significantly more efficient cost base behind the scenes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also been helped by the current climate.</p>
<p>Online grocery shopping has been growing and maturing for a while now, but the last year has been a veritable hothouse in that process: Covid-19, shelter in place orders and a general desire for people to keep their distance all compelled many more consumers to try out online grocery shopping for the first time, and many have stuck with it.</p>
<p>“We have seen a significant inflection point with grocery over the last year with the market transitioning online, accelerated by Covid,&#8221; said Larry Illg, CEO of Prosus Food, in a statement. &#8220;Oda’s leadership and impressive growth in Norway paired with its ground-breaking technology and ambition to scale across Europe and beyond makes them an ideal partner to tackle the grocery opportunity over the coming years.”</p>
<p>Oda has over last eight years grown to become the sector leader in a category it arguably helped define in its home country. It was profitable in 2020 on revenues of €200 million, and it currently controls some 70% of Norway&#8217;s online grocery ordering and delivery market based on its own particular approach to the model.</p>
<p>That model involves Oda building and controlling its own supply chains from producers to consumers (no partnerships with third party physical retailers where Oda powers their services), producing several of the products itself (such as baked goods) to order, and using centralized fulfillment centers to manage orders for large geographies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Centralized warehouses means 50 supermarkets in one location,&#8221; Munthe-Kaas said, adding that this also makes the business significantly greener, too.</p>
<p>Those fulfillment centers, meanwhile, are operated at &#8220;extreme efficiency&#8221;, in his words.</p>
<p>Oda&#8217;s grocery item picking averages out at 212 units per hour &#8212; that is, the amount of items &#8220;picked&#8221; for orders in a week divided by the number of labor hours in a week. The next closest UPH number in the industry, Munthe-Kaas said, was Ocado in the UK at 170 UPH, and the norm, he added, was more like 100 UPH, with physical store picking (where customers select items from shelves themselves) averaging out at 70 UPH.</p>
<p>All of this translates to much more cost-effective operations, including more efficient ordering and stock rotation, which helps Oda make better margins on its sales overall.</p>
<p>Munthe-Kaas declined to go into the details of how Oda manages to get such high UPH numbers &#8212; that&#8217;s competitive knowledge, he said &#8212; noting only that a lot of automation and data analytics goes into the process.</p>
<p>That will nevertheless be music to the ears of SoftBank, which has had a complicated run in e-commerce in the last several years, backing a number of interesting juggernauts that have nonetheless found themselves unable to improve on challenging unit economics.</p>
<p>“Oda’s leading position in Norway is a testament to the merits of its bespoke and data-driven approach in offering a personalised, holistic and reliable online grocery experience,” said Munish Varma, managing partner for SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. “We believe that Oda’s customer-centric focus, market-leading automation technology and fulfillment efficiency are a winning combination, and position Oda for success in scaling internationally for the benefit of customers and suppliers alike.”</p>
<p>The big challenge for Oda going forward will be whether it can transplant its business model as it has been developed for Norway into further markets.</p>
<p>Oda will not only be looking for customer traction for its own business, but it will be doing so potentially against heavy competition from others also looking to expand outside their borders.</p>
<p>There are other online supermarket plays like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/czech-on-demand-grocery-delivery-startup-rohlik-bags-230m-to-expand-across-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rohlik</a> out of the Czech Republic (which in March bagged $230 million in funding); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/everli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everli</a> out of Italy (formerly called Supermercato24, it also raised $100 million); <a href="https://ecommercenews.eu/picnic-doubles-revenue-eyes-expansion-to-france/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Picnic</a> out of the Netherlands (which has yet to announce any recent funding but it feels like it&#8217;s only a matter of time given it too has <a href="https://ecommercenews.eu/picnic-doubles-revenue-eyes-expansion-to-france/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly laid out international ambitions</a>); and Ocado in the UK (which also has <a href="http://techmeme.com/200612/p23#a200612p23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised huge amounts of money</a> to pursue its own international ambitions).</p>
<p>And there is also the wave of companies that are building more fleet-of-foot approaches around smaller inventories and much faster turnaround times, the idea being that this can cater both to individuals and a different way of shopping &#8212; smaller and more often &#8212; even if you are a family.</p>
<p>Among these so-called &#8220;q-commerce&#8221; (quick commerce) players, covering just some of the most recent funding rounds, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glovo</a> just last week raised $528 million; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/gorillacorn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gorillas</a> in Berlin raised $290 million; Turkey’s <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/getir-becomes-a-unicorn-with-2-6bn-valuation-301256950.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getir</a> — also rapidly expanding across Europe — picked up $300 million on a $2.6 billion valuation as Sequoia took its first bite into the European food market; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/zapp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly Zapp</a> in London has also closed $100 million in funding.</p>
<p>Deliveroo, which went public last week, is also now delivering groceries (in partnership with Sainsbury&#8217;s) alongside its restaurant delivery service.</p>
<p>These, ironically, are more cornershop replacements than Oda itself (formerly called Kolonia, or &#8220;cornershop&#8221; in Norwegian), and Munthe-Kaas said he sees them as &#8220;complementary&#8221; to what Oda does.</p>
<p>Indeed, Munthe-Kaas remains very committed to the basic rulebook that Oda has lived by for years.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need to beat the physical stores on quality, selection and price and get it home delivered,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a margin business and the only way to optimize is to be completely relentless.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he also understands that this might ultimately need to be modified depending on the market.</p>
<p>For example, while the company has not worked with other retailers in Norway &#8212; even the investment by REMA is not for distribution but for better economies of scale in procuring products that REMA and Oda will sell independently from each other &#8212; this might be a route that Oda chooses to take in other markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re in discussions with several other retailers, wholesalers and producers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It’s important to get sourcing terms and have upstream logistics, but there are many ways of achieving that. We are super open to making partnerships on that front, but we still think the way to win is to run the value chain.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ShareChat said on Thursday it has raised a new financing round that values it at over $2 billion, joining <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/investment-app-for-millennials-groww-raises-83-million-at-over-1-billion-valuation/">four other local startups</a> in attaining the unicorn status this week.</p>
<p>The Indian social network said it has raised $502 million in a new financing round &#8212; Series E &#8212; led by Tiger Global that valued ShareChat at $2.1 billion, up from about $650 million last year. Snap and existing investors Twitter and Lightspeed Venture Partners also participated in the round, said ShareChat, which has raised about $765 million to date.</p>
<p>The six-year-old startup began engaging with investors for new funds about 10 months ago, and explored a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/twitter-explored-buying-indian-startup-sharechat-and-positioning-moj-as-a-global-tiktok-rival/">full buy out deal with Twitter</a>, which didn&#8217;t materialize, TechCrunch reported earlier.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>ShareChat, which claims to have over 160 million users, offers its social network app in 15 Indian languages and has a large following in small Indian cities and towns, or what venture capitalist Sajith Pai of Blume Ventures refer as “India 2.” Very few players in the Indian startup ecosystem have a reach to this segment of this population, which thanks to users from even smaller towns and villages — called “India 3” — getting online has expanded in recent years.</p>
<p>Last year, the Bangalore-based startup launched Moj &#8212; a short-form video app that it says has already amassed over 80 million monthly active users &#8212; to fill the void left after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">New Delhi banned TikTok</a>, which counted India as its biggest international market prior to being blocked. Snap <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/google-and-snap-in-talks-to-invest-in-india-social-network-sharechat/">inked a deal with ShareChat</a> to integrate its Camera Kit into the Indian short-video app earlier this year. (Thursday&#8217;s deal is Snap&#8217;s first investment in an Indian startup.)</p>
<p>Moj competes with a handful of players including Times Internet&#8217;s MX TakaTak, which currently leads the market with over 100 million monthly active users, and Glance&#8217;s Roposo and DailyHunt&#8217;s Josh &#8212; both of which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">received funding from Google late last year</a>. The search giant was also in talks to invest in ShareChat late last year, TechCrunch reported earlier.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we saw a large vacuum emerge on June 29 with a lot of short-video apps exiting the market — we knew this opportunity was for us. There were millions of short-video creators already trained for creating that content supply. The real game was therefore going to be on building the most relevant feed for the user and we were the only Indian company that had built a world-class feed recommendation system for short-form content,&#8221; wrote Ankush Sachdeva, co-founder and chief executive of ShareChat in a blog post. &#8220;We built the app in 30 hours. Scaled it to 120mn MAUs in 9 months.&#8221;</p>
<p>ShareChat, which began its life on Facebook and WhatsApp groups, has started to experiment with monetization in recent years. On its app, for instance, ShareChat allows commerce platforms to interact with customers via its audio chat rooms. It also quietly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/twitter-backed-sharechat-eyes-fantasy-sports-in-india/">launched a fantasy sports app called Jeet</a> early last year, as reported first by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are at a significant inflection point in our company’s journey — as the internet penetration further deepens in India we are well-positioned to expand our ecosystem of products to 1 Billion+ MAUs cumulatively. We have seen how large the short-video market is in China — with around 80% of the entire Internet population using one of the short-video products(Douyin, Kuaishou etc) daily,&#8221; wrote Sachdeva.</p>
<p>ShareChat is the ninth Indian startup to become a unicorn this year &#8212; and fifth this week. Social commerce Meesho <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/04/indian-social-commerce-meesho-raises-300m-at-2-1b-valuation-softbank/">turned a unicorn on Monday</a>, fintech firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/indias-cred-valued-at-2-2-billion-in-new-215-million-fundraise/">CRED on Tuesday</a> and e-pharmacy firm PharmEasy and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/investment-app-for-millennials-groww-raises-83-million-at-over-1-billion-valuation/">Groww on Thursday</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">About a year after Beyond Meat <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/beyond-meat-china-alibaba/">debuted in China</a> on Starbucks&#8217;s menu, the Californian plant-based protein company opened a production facility near Shanghai to tap the country&#8217;s supply chain resources and potentially reduce the carbon footprint of its products.</p>
<p>Situated in Jiaxing, a city 85 km from Shanghai, the plant is Beyond Meat&#8217;s first end-to-end manufacturing facility outside the U.S., the Nasdaq-listed company said in an announcement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Over the past year, competition became steep in China&#8217;s alternative protein space with the foray of foreign players like Beyond Meat and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/eat-just-china-dicos/">Eat Just</a>, as well as a slew of capital injections for domestic startups including Hey Maet and Starfield.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Beyond Meat doesn&#8217;t flinch at the rivalry. When asked by TechCrunch to comment on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/beyond-meat-china-alibaba/">story</a> about China&#8217;s alternative protein scene, a representative of the company said &#8220;there are none that Beyond Meat considers their competitors.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zCXuw19QKL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/plant-based-meat-startups-china/">Chinese startups rush to bring alternative protein to people&#8217;s plates</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Chinese startups rush to bring alternative protein to people&#8217;s plates&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/plant-based-meat-startups-china/embed/#?secret=zCXuw19QKL" data-secret="zCXuw19QKL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>China not only has an enormous, unsaturated market for meat replacements; it&#8217;s also a major supplier of plant-based protein. Chinese meat substitute startups enjoy a cost advantage from the outset and don&#8217;t lack interest from investors who race to back consumer products that are more reflective of the tastes of the rising middle class.</p>
<p>Having some kind of manufacturing capacity in China is thus almost a prerequisite for any serious foreign player. Tesla has done it before to build Gigafactory in Shanghai to deliver cheaper electric vehicles. Localized production also helps companies advance their sustainability goals as it shortens the supply chain.</p>
<p>In Beyond Meat&#8217;s own words, the Jiaxing facility is &#8220;expected to significantly increase the speed and scale in which the company can produce and distribute its products within the region while also improving Beyond Meat’s cost structure and sustainability of operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The American food-tech giant works hard on localization, selling in China both its flagship burger patties and an imitation minced pork product made specifically for the world&#8217;s largest consumer of pork. The soy- and rice-based minced pork could be used in a wide range of Chinese cuisines and is the result of a collaboration between the firm&#8217;s Shanghai and Los Angeles teams.</p>
<p>Besides production, the Jiaxing plant will also take on R&amp;D responsibilities to invent new products for the region. Beyond Meat will also be unveiling its first owned manufacturing facility in Europe this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are committed to investing in China as a region for long-term growth,&#8221; said Ethan Brown, CEO and founder of Beyond Meat. &#8220;We believe this new manufacturing facility will be instrumental in advancing our pricing and sustainability metrics as we seek to provide Chinese consumers with delicious plant-based proteins that are good for both people and planet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond Meat products can now be found in Starbucks, KFC, Alibaba&#8217;s Hema supermarket and other retail channels across major Chinese cities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2019, Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/17/spotify-is-test-driving-a-car-hardware-thing-called-car-thing/">began testing</a> a hardware device for automobile owners it lovingly dubbed &#8220;<a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-05-17/5-things-to-know-about-spotifys-latest-test/">Car Thing</a>,&#8221; which allowed Spotify Premium users to play music and podcasts <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-17-spotify-car-thing-voice-assistant-device.html">using voice commands</a> that began with &#8220;Hey, Spotify.&#8221; Last year, Spotify <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1235350117802283011">began developing</a> a similar voice integration into its mobile app. Now, access to the &#8220;Hey Spotify&#8221; voice feature is rolling out more broadly.</p>
<p>Spotify chose not to officially announce the new addition, despite numerous reports indicating the voice option was showing up for many people in their Spotify app, leading to some user confusion about availability.</p>
<p>One early report by <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/handsfree_hey_spotify_wake_word_rolls_out-news-48521.php">GSM Arena,</a> for example, indicated Android users had been sent a push notification that alerted them to the feature. The notification advised users to <em>&#8220;Just enable your mic and say &#8216;Hey Spotify, Play my Favorite Songs.&#8221;</em> When tapped, the notification launched Spotify&#8217;s new voice interface where users are pushed to first give the app permission to use the microphone in order to be able to verbally request the music they want to hear.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2135493" style="width: 307px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135493" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2135493" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-5.40.39-PM.jpg?w=297" alt="" width="297" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-5.40.39-PM.jpg 652w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-5.40.39-PM.jpg?resize=66,150 66w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-5.40.39-PM.jpg?resize=131,300 131w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-5.40.39-PM.jpg?resize=297,680 297w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-5.40.39-PM.jpg?resize=22,50 22w" sizes="(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135493" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/handsfree_hey_spotify_wake_word_rolls_out-news-48521.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GSM Arena <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Several outlets soon reported the feature had launched to Android users, which is only partially true.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the feature is making <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/07/hey-spotify-starts-roll-out-iphone/">its way to iOS devices</a>, as well. When we launched the Spotify app here on an iPhone running iOS 14.5, for instance, we found the same feature had indeed gone live. You just tap on the microphone button by the search box to get to the voice experience. We asked around and found that other iPhone users on various versions of the iOS operating system also had the feature, including free users, Premium subscribers and Premium Family Plan subscribers.</p>
<p>The screen that appears suggests in big, bold text that you could be saying <em>&#8220;Hey Spotify, play&#8230;&#8221;</em> followed by a random artist&#8217;s name. It also presents a big green button at the bottom to turn on &#8220;Hey Spotify.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once enabled, you can ask for artists, albums, songs and playlists by name, as well as control playback with commands like stop, pause, skip this song, go back and others. Spotify confirms the command with a robotic-sounding male voice by default. (You can swap to a female voice in Settings, if you prefer.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135491" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135491" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2135491" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135491" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify screenshot iOS</p></div></p>
<p>This screen also alerts users that when the app hears the &#8220;Hey Spotify&#8221; voice command, it sends the user&#8217;s voice data and other information to Spotify. There&#8217;s <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/legal/voice-controls/plain/">a link to Spotify policy regarding its use of voice data</a>, which further explains that Spotify will collect recordings and transcripts of what you say along with information about the content it returned to you. The company says it may continue to use this data to improve the feature, develop new voice features and target users with relevant advertising. It may also share your information with service providers, like cloud storage providers.</p>
<p>The policy looks to be the same as the one that was used along with Spotify&#8217;s voice-enabled ads,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/02/spotify-launches-voice-enabled-ads-on-mobile-devices-in-a-limited-u-s-test/"> launched last year</a>, so it doesn&#8217;t seem to have been updated to fully reflect the changes enabled with the launch of &#8220;Hey Spotify.&#8221; However, it does indicate that, like other voice assistants, Spotify doesn&#8217;t just continuously record &#8212; it waits until users say the wake words.</p>
<p>Given the &#8220;Hey Spotify&#8221; voice command&#8217;s origins with &#8220;Car Thing,&#8221; there&#8217;s been speculation that the mobile rollout is a signal that the company is poised to launch its own hardware to the wider public in the near future. There&#8217;s already some indication that may be true &#8212; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/02/spotify-ios-app-car-thing-images/">MacRumors recently reported</a> finding references and photos to Car Thing and its various mounts inside the Spotify app&#8217;s code. This follows <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231876/spotify-car-thing-fcc-design-screen-pictures-photos">Car Thing&#8217;s reveal in FCC filings</a> back in January of this year, which had also stoked rumors that the device was soon to launch.</p>
<p>Spotify was reached for comment this morning, but has yet been unable to provide any answers about the feature&#8217;s launch despite a day&#8217;s wait. Instead, we were told that they &#8220;unfortunately do not have any additional news to share at this time.&#8221; That further suggests some larger projects could be tied to this otherwise more minor feature&#8217;s launch.</p>

<p>Though today&#8217;s consumers are wary of tech companies&#8217; data collection methods &#8212; and particularly their use of voice data after all <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/amazon-adds-alexa-delete-what-i-said-today-command/">three</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/google-ordered-to-halt-human-review-of-voice-ai-recordings-over-privacy-risks/">tech</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/26/siri-recordings-regularly-sent-to-apple-contractors-for-analysis-claims-whistleblower/">giants</a> confessed to poor practices on this front &#8212; there&#8217;s still a use case for voice commands, particularly from an accessibility standpoint and, for drivers, from a safety standpoint.</p>
<p>And although you can direct your voice assistant on your phone (or via CarPlay or Android Auto, if available) to play content from Spotify, some may find it useful to be able to speak to Spotify directly &#8212; especially since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apple-clarifies-you-cant-actually-set-a-default-music-service-in-ios-14-5/">Apple doesn&#8217;t allow Spotify to be set as a default music service.</a> You can only<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apple-clarifies-you-cant-actually-set-a-default-music-service-in-ios-14-5/"> train Siri to launch Spotify as your preferred service.</a></p>
<p>If, however, you have second thoughts about using the &#8220;Hey Spotify&#8221; feature after enabling it, you can turn it off under &#8220;Voice Interactions&#8221; in the app&#8217;s settings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter held talks with Clubhouse around a potential acquisition of the live drop-in audio networking platform, with a deal value somewhere around $4 billion, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-07/twitter-is-said-to-have-discussed-4-billion-clubhouse-takeover?sref=gni836kR">report from Bloomberg</a>. TechCrunch has also confirmed the discussions took place from a source familiar with the conversations.</p>
<p>While the talks occurred over the past several months, they&#8217;re no longer taking place, though the reason they ended isn&#8217;t known according to the report. It&#8217;s also worth noting that just a few days ago, Bloomberg reported that Clubhouse was seeking to raise a new round of funding at a valuation of around $4 billion, but the report detailing the potential acquisition talks indicate that the discussions with Twitter collapsed first, leading to a change in strategy to pursue securing additional capital in exchange for equity investment.</p>
<p>Twitter has its own product very similar to Clubhouse — Spaces, a drop-in audio chatroom feature that it has been rolling out gradually to its user base over the past few months. Clubhouse, meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/clubhouse-payments/">just launched the first of its monetization efforts, Clubhouse Payments,</a> which lets users send direct payments to other creators on the platform, provided that person has enabled receipt of said payments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Interestingly, the monetization effort from Clubhouse actually doesn&#8217;t provide them with any money; instead, it&#8217;s monetization for recipient users who get 100% of the funds directed their way, minus a small cut for processing that goes directly to Stripe, the payment provider Clubhouse is using to enable the virtual tips.</p>
<p>While we aren&#8217;t privy to the specifics of these talks between Twitter and Clubhouse, it does seem like an awfully high price tag for the social network to pay for the audio app, especially given its own progress with Spaces. Clubhouse&#8217;s early traction has been undeniable, but there are a lot of questions still remaining about its longevity, and it&#8217;s also being cloned left and right by other platforms, begging the age-old startup question of whether it&#8217;s a feature or a product on its own.</p>
<p>Whatever went down, the timing of this revelation seems likely to prime the pump for Clubhouse&#8217;s conversation with potential investors at its target valuation for the round it&#8217;s looking to raise. Regardless, it&#8217;s exciting to have this kind of activity, buzz and attention paid to a consumer software play after many years of what one could argue has been a relatively lackluster period for the category.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the classification of ride-hail drivers as &#8220;essential workers&#8221; during the early days of the pandemic, last April </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2020-05-07/uber-reports-first-ever-decline-in-rides-booked-business-drops-by-80-video"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber’s business dropped by 80%.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Drivers decided they’d rather not risk contracting or spreading COVID-19 for the measly revenue provided by the few rides per day they were getting, so when the federal CARES Act extended the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance to gig workers, many Uber drivers decided to hang up their keys. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/?sref=a2d7LMhq"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more than a quarter of the U.S. population already vaccinated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Uber is now in a sticky situation wherein there are more riders requesting trips than there are drivers available. The ride-hailing giant not only wants drivers to know that there’s business to be had once again, but they also want to sweeten the deal with incentives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, the company <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/getting-drivers-back-on-the-road/">announced the launch of a $250 million driver stimulus</a> to welcome drivers back into the fold and recruit new ones as the pandemic begins to ease in the U.S. Both returning drivers and new drivers will be receiving bonuses over the coming months, according to an Uber spokesperson.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In 2020, many drivers stopped driving because they couldn’t count on getting enough trips to make it worth their time,” reads the blog post announcing the stimulus. “In 2021, there are more riders requesting trips than there are drivers available to give them — making it a great time to be a driver.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to high rider demand and low supply of drivers, the current median hourly rate for cities like Philadelphia, Austin, Chicago, Miami and Phoenix is $26.66, which is 25% to 75% higher than they were in March of last year. Uber wants drivers to take advantage of the higher earnings now because “this is likely a temporary situation.” Meaning as the country recovers and more gig workers get back behind the wheel, earnings will likely decrease from their current levels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stimulus money will go on top of those hourly rates, a spokesperson told TechCrunch. The incentive structure will be based on individual activity, as well as location. For example, in Austin, current drivers are guaranteed $1,100 if they complete 115 trips. In Phoenix, they can earn an extra $1,775 for 200 trips. </span></p>
<div>&#8220;We will have more guarantees coming in both those cities as well as all the other markets we are targeting in the U.S. &#8211; the dollar and trip amounts may just change slightly depending on local factors,&#8221; said the spokesperson.</div>
<p>The money will also go toward guaranteed minimum pay and on-boarding for new Uber drivers, and t<span style="font-weight: 400;">he full $250 million pool is coming directly from Uber’s pockets. The company’s shares declined as much as 3.6% during trading on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber is also aiming to help streamline the process of getting drivers vaccinated </span><a href="https://www.insidernj.com/press-release/uber-walgreens-partner-get-covid-19-vaccines-new-jersey-drivers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">with an in-app booking portal as part of its partnership with Walgreens</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><em>This story has been updated to clarify that the example incentives for Austin and Phoenix refer to financial guarantees offered to current drivers in the past few weeks.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pinterest today hosted an event focused on its creator community, where the company announced a series of updates including the launch of a $500,000 Creator Fund, a new content policy called the Creator Code, as well as new moderation tools, among other things. With the changes, the company says its goal is to ensure the platform continues to be an &#8220;inclusive, positive and inspiring place.&#8221; The new content guidelines put that into more specific terms as it requires Pinterest creators to fact-check content, practice inclusion, be kind and ensure any call to action they make via the site doesn&#8217;t cause harm.</p>
<p>Creators will be required to agree and sign the code during the publishing process for Story Pins, where they tap a button that says &#8220;I agree&#8221; to statements that include &#8220;Be kind,&#8221; &#8220;Check my facts,&#8221; &#8220;Be aware of triggers,&#8221; &#8220;Practice inclusion&#8221; and &#8220;Do no harm.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135375" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135375" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2135375" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135375" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The code will be enforced the same way Pinterest today applies its rules for its other content policies: a combination of machine learning and human review, Pinterest tells us. However, the site&#8217;s algorithm will be designed to reward positive content and block harmful content, <a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/bringing-authoritative-vaccine-results-to-pinterest-search">like anti-vaccination sentiments,</a> for example. This could have a larger impact on what sort of content is shared on Pinterest, rather than a pop-up agreement with simple statements.</p>
<p>The Creator Code itself is not yet live, but will roll out to creators to sign and adopt in the weeks ahead, Pinterest says.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135371" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135371" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2135371" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png 4293w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png?resize=1536,1022 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png?resize=2048,1362 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135371" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p>
<p>Pinterest today also introduced several new creator tools focused on the similar goal of making Pinterest a more positive, safe experience for all.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s launching comment moderation tools that will allow creators to remove and filter comments on their content, as well as tools that will allow them to feature up to three comments in the comment feed to highlight positive feedback. New spam prevention tools will help to clear out some of the unwanted comments, too, by leveraging machine learning technology to detect and remove bad comments.</p>
<p>Also new are &#8220;positivity reminders,&#8221; which will pop up asking Pinterest users to reconsider before posting potentially offensive comments. The notification will push users to go back and edit their comment, but doesn&#8217;t prevent them from posting.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135373" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135373" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2135373" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png 4293w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png?resize=1536,1022 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png?resize=2048,1362 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135373" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p>
<p>Related to these efforts, Pinterest announced the launch of its first-ever Creator Fund at today&#8217;s event. The fund is specifically focused on elevating creators from underrepresented communities in the United States and will offer a combination of creative strategy consulting and compensating them with budget for content creation and ad credits. At least 50% of the fund&#8217;s recipients will be from underrepresented groups, Pinterest says.</p>
<p>The company tells us it&#8217;s initially committed to giving creators $500,000 in cash and media throughout 2021.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the first participants of the program, we worked with eight emerging creators across fashion, photography, food and travel, and will be identifying 10 more creators in the next few months for the next cohort,&#8221; noted Creator Inclusion Lead Alexandra Nikolajev.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re on a journey to build a globally inclusive platform where Pinners and Creators around the world can discover ideas that feel personalized, relevant and reflective of who they are,&#8221; Nikolajev said.</p>
<p>Pinterest has been working to rebuild its image in the wake of last year&#8217;s allegations of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/pinterest-employees-are-walking-out-today-in-light-of-discrimination-allegations/">a host of internal issues,</a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/former-pinterest-employees-allege-unfair-pay-racism-and-retaliation.html">including unfair pay, racism, retaliation</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/03/pinterest-race-bias-black-employees/">and sexism</a>, which conflicted with its outside image of being one of the &#8220;nicer&#8221; places to work in tech. Despite this fallout &#8212; which included a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/former-coo-sues-pinterest-accusing-it-of-gender-discrimination-retaliation-and-wrongful-termination/">lawsuit</a>, employee <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/pinterest-employees-are-walking-out-today-in-light-of-discrimination-allegations/">walkout</a>, <a href="https://www.coworker.org/petitions/put-an-end-to-all-forms-of-discrimination-and-retaliation-at-pinterest-1">petitions</a> and more &#8212; the issues that had been raised weren&#8217;t always reflected in Pinterest&#8217;s product.</p>

<p>The company had previously launched inclusive features like &#8220;skin tone ranges&#8221; to help those shopping for beauty products find matches for their skin tone. It also allowed retailers and brands to identify themselves as members of an underrepresented group, which gave their content the ability to appear in more places across Pinterest&#8217;s platform, like the Today tab, Shopping Spotlights and The Pinterest Shop, for instance.</p>
<p>Evan Sharp, Pinterest&#8217;s co-founder and Chief Design and Creative Officer, referenced the company&#8217;s image as &#8220;a positive place&#8221; at today&#8217;s event.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve been building Pinterest for 11 years, and ever since our users routinely tell us that Pinterest is the &#8216;last positive corner of the internet.&#8217; In that time, we’ve also learned that you need to design positivity into online platforms as deliberately as much as you design negativity out,&#8221; Sharp said. &#8220;The Creator Code is a human-centric way for Creators to understand how to be successful on Pinterest while using their voice to keep Pinterest positive and inclusive,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Today, Pinterest serves over 450 million users worldwide, but is challenged by large platforms serving creators like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and others, including newcomers like TikTok and those that are inching into the creator community with funds of their own, like Snapchat, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">which is paying creators for Spotlight content,</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/clubhouse-promises-its-accelerator-participants-either-brand-deals-or-5k-per-month-during-the-program/">Clubhouse, which is now funding creators&#8217; shows</a>. The increased competition for creator interest has left Pinterest needing an incentive program of its own.</p>
<p>To kick of its announcement, Pinterest’s Head of Content and Creator Partnerships, Aya Kanai, interviewed television personality <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/jvnpins/_saved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pinterest.com/jvnpins/_saved/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617889288544000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHRK_HxBH9eOgI5VHqfnrhuIrVdGw">Jonathan Van Ness</a> (Queer Eye) at today&#8217;s virtual event, where they talked about the need for positivity and inclusivity on social media.

					<description><![CDATA[Cybersecurity veteran Katie Moussouris explains what startups should (and shouldn't) do, what to prioritize, and the difference between vulnerability disclosure, penetration testing and bug bounties.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the rush to launch, cybersecurity doesn&#8217;t always get the attention it deserves, and yet it&#8217;s one of the first things that startups learn can — and will — go wrong.</p>
<p>Hacker and security researchers can be some of your biggest assets in helping your startup stay secure. Vulnerability disclosure and bug bounty programs are part of working with the hacker community to build a stronger, more resilient company. But these are not a replacement for security investments, which as a growing company you should not overlook.</p>
<p>Katie Moussouris has been in cybersecurity circles since some of the world&#8217;s biggest tech companies were startups, and helped to set up the first vulnerability disclosure and bug bounty programs. Moussouris, who runs consultancy firm Luta Security, now advises companies and governments on how to talk to hackers and what they need to do to build and improve their vulnerability disclosure programs.</p>
<p>At TC Early Stage, Moussouris explained what startups should (and shouldn&#8217;t) do, and what priorities should come first.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Knowing the basics</strong></h2>
<p>A bug bounty alone is not enough, and outsourcing the process to a platform isn&#8217;t going to save you time. Moussouris explained the basics and what differs between vulnerability disclosure, penetration testing and bug bounties.</p>
<blockquote><p>Vulnerability disclosure is the process by which you hear about vulnerability from the outside. You digest that vulnerability somehow internally in your organization and figure out what to do with it — whether to create a patch, how to prioritize that patch, and then what to release to the public [ … ] What it comes down to is that organizations need guidelines on how to handle these issues appropriately.</p>
<p>Next we&#8217;ve got penetration testing: hiring professional hackers under contract [who have] a specific set of skills that match your problem set, and you pay them. They&#8217;re under a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) to keep your vulnerabilities secret for as long as you need them — perhaps forever — and you are at your leisure as to whether or not you fix those vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Finally, bug bounties are simply adding a cash reward to the process of vulnerability disclosure programs. <em><strong>(Time stamp: 3:20)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Healthcare insurance, if you’re lucky to have it, only covers a subset of conditions in the United States. As a result, patients can often get burdened with horror story charges, like huge deductibles, out-of-network costs and expensive co-pays. So for the uninsured and insured alike, innovative ways of managing big bills are in high demand &#8212; especially as uncertainty remains around<a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyfarr/status/1379566792830377985"> how COVID-19 and long-haul symptoms will be handled by patients and payers. </a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.hellowalnut.com/">Walnut</a>, founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roshan--patel/">Roshan Patel</a>, is a point-of-sale lending company with a healthcare twist. Walnut uses a “buy now, pay later” model, popularized by Affirm and Klarna, to help patients pay for healthcare over a period of time, instead of in one $3,000 chunk. Walnut works with healthcare providers so that a patient’s bill can be paid back through $100-a-month increments for 30 months, instead of one aggressive credit card swipe.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135319" style="width: 578px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135319" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2135319" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg" alt="" width="568" height="426" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg 4128w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135319" class="wp-caption-text">A patient using Walnut to pay healthcare bills. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walnut</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s a sweet deal, but Patel added one more detail that he thinks makes Walnut stand out: The startup doesn’t charge any interest or fees to consumers.</p>
<p>“Almost every ‘buy now, pay later’ company in e-commerce charges interest or fees, and every personal loan provider charges interest or fees, but we do not,” he said. “And that&#8217;s really important to me, not making healthcare any more expensive than it already is. It’s a very patient-friendly product.”</p>
<p>Companies that use the buy now, pay later model with zero interest or fees need to make revenue somehow, and in Walnut’s case it is by charging healthcare providers a percentage of each sale or transaction.</p>
<p>If a provider’s collection rate for an out-of-pocket is 50%, Walnut would go to them and say “give us a 40% discount, and we’ll guarantee the cash for you upfront.” The startup will take the risk, and then the provider is able to make 60% of the collection rate.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="r88OWk8juw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/healthcare-entrepreneurs-should-prepare-for-an-upcoming-vc-pe-bubble/">Healthcare entrepreneurs should prepare for an upcoming VC/PE bubble</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Healthcare entrepreneurs should prepare for an upcoming VC/PE bubble&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/healthcare-entrepreneurs-should-prepare-for-an-upcoming-vc-pe-bubble/embed/#?secret=r88OWk8juw" data-secret="r88OWk8juw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Now, ideally, a provider would want to get 100% of payments they are owed, but that is wishful thinking. Patel explained that a large number of bills go unpaid due to bankruptcies or a default on payments (the average collections rate for hospitals out of pocket is less than 20%). Because of this, a company like Walnut has room to offer at least some stable upfront cash to hospitals, even if it ends up being 60% of overall bills versus 100%.</p>
<p>The company uses “extensive underwriting models” to figure out if a patient should qualify for a loan. Patel says that the startup goes beyond using credit score, which he describes as an “outdated metric”, and instead looks at thousands of data points from different providers, from side hustle income to spending habits on things like groceries and bills.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1308296" style="width: 734px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1308296" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1308296" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg" alt="" width="724" height="533" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg 3817w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=300,221 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=768,566 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=680,501 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=1536,1132 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=2048,1509 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1308296" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/gallery-540784p1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lightspring <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a> / <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shutterstock <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Walnut’s biggest challenge, says Patel, is to underwrite the population and pay the healthcare provider upfront in cash. It then collects from the patient on the back end, which comes with its own amount of risk.</p>
<p>“To be able to take on that risk for patients that are less credit-worthy is a very challenging problem, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s really solved yet in healthcare,” he said.</p>
<p>The startup is starting by working with small private practices of one to five physicians that focus on specialties like dentistry, dermatology and fertility.</p>
<p>A big part of Walnut’s success will be determined by if it can attract people that truly need flexible financing options. For example, the company doesn&#8217;t have any hospitals as a partner yet, which would tap a larger group of patients that likely need flexible financing options the most. Right now, “the people who get elective-care surgery are the ones that can afford it.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Making sense of Klarna&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/making-sense-of-klarna/embed/#?secret=gIAGD8QkZM" data-secret="gIAGD8QkZM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But Patel doesn’t see this as a disconnect; instead, he sees it as an opportunity to widen access to elective medical care to more people.</p>
<p>“I talked to a person last week who has no teeth and wants dentures but it costs $6,000,” he said. “That person should be able to afford it, and we enabled them to pay $100 a month for it.”</p>
<p>Walnut’s two biggest customer groups are the uninsured (people who have lost their jobs from COVID-19), and consumers who have high deductible plans.</p>
<p>Walnut isn’t the first. PrimaHealth Credit, Walnut’s closest competitor, offers<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/primahealth-credit-offers-a-buy-now-pay-later-lending-service-for-elective-procedures/"> point-of-sale lending procedures </a>for elective medical procedures. Think surgeries like cataract work or dental work. The company said the service is currently available in Arizona, California, Florida, Oklahoma and Texas, and will be expanded to all 50 states this year. Walnut, comparatively, is mostly focused on the East Coast and plans to expand nationwide by the end of this year.</p>
<p>PrimaHealth’s average loan size is $1,800, and Walnut’s average loan size is $5,000.</p>
<p>The company is currently piloting with a handful of healthcare providers in dermatology, dentistry and fertility. It has had more than 500 patient loan applications, totaling over $4.6 million in application volume year-to-date. Patel says that Walnut only accepted a fraction of these applications, but declined to share what percent of money it has lent so far. As Walnut refines its model, it might be able to cover other categories.</p>
<p>Up until this point, Walnut has been lending off of its own balance sheet. In order to truly scale, it will need to get a new source of capital &#8212; either a credit line, debt financing round or venture capital &#8212; to offer more loans. Patel says that the startup is in talks with banks, and turned down a debt offer due to size and rate.</p>
<p>Venture capital seems to be the solution for now: The startup announced that it has raised a $3.6 million seed round from investors including Gradient Ventures, Afore Capital, 2048 Ventures, Supernode Ventures, TA Ventures, Polymath Capital, Tack Ventures, Awesome People Ventures, Newark Ventures and NKM Capital. Angels include the CEOs of Giphy and PillPack, and the CTO of Rampm Financial as well as an NFL coach. The company is also a part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/plaid-accelerator-announces-inaugural-cohort-of-fintech-startups/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Plaid&#8217;s inaugural accelerator.</a></p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t want to be yet another startup trying to offer you an undifferentiated insurance plan,” Patel said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitch will start holding its streamers to a higher standard. The company just expanded its hate and harassment policy, specifying more kinds of bad behavior that break its rules and could result in a ban from the streaming service.</p>
<p>The news comes as Twitch continues to grapple with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303185/twitch-sexual-harassment-assault-permanent-bans-streamers">reports of abusive behavior and sexual harassment,</a> both on the platform and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-10-08-twitch-staff-call-the-company-out-on-sexual-assault-racism-more">within the company itself</a>. In December, Twitch<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/twitch-updates-its-hateful-content-and-harassment-policy-after-company-called-out-for-its-ownabuses/"> released an updated set of rules</a> designed to take harassment and abuse more seriously, admitting that women, people of color and the LGBTQ+ community were impacted by a &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; amount of that toxic behavior on the platform.</p>
<p>Twitch&#8217;s policies now include serious offenses that could pose a safety threat, even when they happen entirely away from the streaming service. Those threats include violent extremism, terrorism, threats of mass violence, sexual assault and ties to known hate groups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company will also continue to evaluate off-platform behavior in cases that happen on Twitch, like an on-stream situation that leads to harassment on Twitter or Facebook.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="UAdcAuoydV"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/twitch-updates-its-hateful-content-and-harassment-policy-after-company-called-out-for-its-ownabuses/">Twitch updates its hateful content and harassment policy after company called out for its own abuses</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitch updates its hateful content and harassment policy after company called out for its own abuses&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/twitch-updates-its-hateful-content-and-harassment-policy-after-company-called-out-for-its-ownabuses/embed/#?secret=UAdcAuoydV" data-secret="UAdcAuoydV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;While this policy is new, we have taken action historically against serious, clear misconduct that took place off service, but until now, we didn’t have an approach that scaled,&#8221; the company wrote in a blog post, adding that investigating off-platform behavior requires additional resources to address the complexity inherent in those cases.</p>
<p>To handle reports for its broadened rules, Twitch created a dedicated email address (OSIT@twitch.tv) to handle reports about off-service behavior. The company says it has partnered with a third-party investigative law firm to vet the reports it receives.</p>
<p>Twitch cites its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitch-disables-trumps-channel-over-incendiary-rhetoric/"> actions against former President Donald Trump</a> as the most high-profile instance of off-platform behavior resulting in enforcement. The company disabled Trump&#8217;s account following the attack on the U.S. Capitol and later suspended him indefinitely, citing fears that he could use the service to incite violence.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to have a higher profile than the president, but Trump isn&#8217;t the only big time banned Twitch user. Last June, Twitch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304907/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-no-reason-given">kicked one of its biggest streamers off of the platform</a> without providing an explanation for the decision.</p>
<p>Going on a year later, no one seems to know why Dr. Disrespect got the boot from Twitch, though the company&#8217;s insistence that it only acts in cases with a &#8220;preponderance of evidence&#8221; suggests his violations were serious and well corroborated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://okta.com">Okta</a> today announced it was expanding its platform into a couple of new areas. Up to this point, the company has been known for its identity access management product, giving companies the ability to sign onto multiple cloud products with a single sign on. Today, the company is moving into two new areas: privileged access and identity governance</p>
<p>Privileged access gives companies the ability to provide access on an as-needed basis to a limited number of people to key administrative services inside a company. This could be your database or your servers or any part of your technology stack that is highly sensitive and where you want to tightly control who can access these systems.</p>
<p>Okta CEO Todd McKinnon says that Okta has always been good at locking down the general user population access to cloud services like Salesforce, Office 365 and Gmail. What these cloud services have in common is you access them via a web interface.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Administrators access the speciality accounts using different protocols. &#8220;It&#8217;s something like secure shell, or you&#8217;re using a terminal on your computer to connect to a server in the cloud, or it&#8217;s a database connection where you&#8217;re actually logging in with a SQL connection, or you&#8217;re connecting to a container, which is the Kubernetes protocol to actually manage the container,&#8221; McKinnon explained.</p>
<p>Privileged access offers a couple of key features including the ability to limit access to a given time window and to record a video of the session so there is an audit trail of exactly what happened while someone was accessing the system. McKinnon says that these features provide additional layers of protection for these sensitive accounts.</p>

<p>He says that it will be fairly trivial to carve out these accounts because Okta already has divided users into groups and can give these special privileges to only those people in the administrative access group. The challenge was figuring out how to get access to these other kinds of protocols.</p>
<p>The governance piece provides a way for security operations teams to run detailed reports and look for issues related to identity. &#8220;Governance provides exception reporting so you can give that to your auditors, and more importantly you can give that to your security team to make sure that you figure out what&#8217;s going on and why there is this deviation from your stated policy,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>All of this when combined with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/okta-acquires-cloud-identity-startup-auth0-for-6-5b/">the $6.5 billion acquisition of Auth0 last month</a> is part of a larger plan by the company to be what McKinnon calls the identity cloud. He sees a market with several strategic clouds and he believes identity is going to be one of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because identity is so strategic for everything, it&#8217;s unlocking your customer, access, it&#8217;s unlocking your employee access, it&#8217;s keeping everything secure. And so this expansion, whether it&#8217;s customer identity with zero trust or whether it&#8217;s doing more on the workforce identity with not just access, but privileged access and identity governance. It&#8217;s about identity evolving in this primary cloud,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While both of these new products were announced today at the company&#8217;s virtual Oktane customer conference, they won&#8217;t be generally available until the first quarter of next year.</p>
