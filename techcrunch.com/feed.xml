										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Billions of dollars, dozens of deals, and one legal battle: the year in eVTOL was an unforgettable one, with developers picking up the pace even as the larger aviation sector was busy slowly recovering from the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Below, we catch up with leading analysts and investors to identify the top trends that shaped eVTOL this year &#8212; and will likely continue to reverberate in the years to come.</p>
<h2>Did someone say SPAC?</h2>
<p>Archer Aviation. Joby Aviation. Lilium. Vertical Aerospace. What do these companies have in common, besides the fact that they’re each developing eVTOL aircraft? They all announced or completed mergers with blank-check firms this year, in an absolutely mind-blowing injection of capital into this once nascent – even far-fetched – technology.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244974" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If 2021 should be remembered for anything in the world of eVTOL, it’s principally the massive amount of money that has gone into the sector. Three SPAC deals alone – that of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/joby-aviation-makes-its-public-trading-debut-on-the-nyse/">Joby</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/archer-lands-1-1b-order-from-united-airlines-and-a-spac-deal/">Archer</a>, and German developer Lilium – raised over $2.5 billion combined in gross proceeds, with Joby’s proceeds constituting nearly half that figure at $1.1 billion. eVTOL aircraft are not the only mobility technology to have flocked to SPACs as a financial vehicle to take them to public markets, but the sheer number of deals is certainly one of the stand-out trends of this year.</p>
<p>“What&#8217;s different with the eVTOL industry today and where they were, let&#8217;s say a year ago, is access to capital,” Kristine Liwag, senior aerospace and defense analyst at Morgan Stanley, explained.</p>
<p>This outsized influx of cash means these companies now have a meaningful amount of capital to take them through the long and thorough process of certifying their aircraft with the Federal Aviation Administration, a necessary prerequisite to launching commercial operations. Whether it will be enough is another matter and dependent on each company&#8217;s progress and cost efficiency.</p>
<p>The high cost of commercializing the technology likely drove the SPAC trend. Aviation is a capital-intensive business, and many believe that it could cost as much as $1 billion to take an eVTOL from design through manufacturing and certification.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Definitely the standout for me was the fact that a number of leading startups have found a way to get a budget that is capable of getting an aircraft towards full certification,” David Wyatt, technology analyst at IDTechEx, said. “It feels like a big step has been jumped there in terms of the likelihood of getting more of these test aircraft into the air, from a prototype phase into something that is much more of a concrete eVTOL functional aircraft.”</p>
<p>Even beyond SPACs, there has been plenty of venture funding into eVTOL companies. 2021 also saw massive funding rounds, include Beta Technologies’ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/beta-technologies-adds-368-million-in-series-a-funding-for-its-electric-aviation-ecosystem/">$368 million Series A</a> and Xpeng-backed HT Aero’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/xpeng-backed-urban-air-mobility-company-ht-aero-raises-500m/">$500 million Series A</a>.</p>
<p>“2021 has been the year where we&#8217;re not asking anymore the question of, can it be certified?” Sergio Cecutta, founder and partner at SMG Consulting, said. “Now the question we&#8217;re asking is, when will it be certified? We&#8217;re beyond, ‘Will these things ever fly? Are they certifiable?’ Yes, they are. Now we need to roll up our sleeves and do it.”</p>
<h2>Movement on the ground</h2>
<p>Air taxi developers aren’t just focused on their aircraft. In order to make the market for electric aviation a reality, they’ll need a whole lot more: ground infrastructure, like vertiports or specialized areas in airports, plus charging points capable of getting enough juice to their vehicles.</p>
<p>There’s still a <em>lot </em>of work to be done in this area – see part two for more details – but 2021 saw eVTOL operators make notable strides towards at least starting to establish infrastructure required for commercial operations by mid-decade. This includes a partnership between Lilium and ABB E-mobility to supply charging infrastructure for the Lilium Jet; separate partnerships between Joby and Archer with parking garage owner REEF Technology; and a partnership between Vertical and Heathrow Airport to explore how eVTOL could fit into the airport’s operations.</p>
<p>Archer, Joby and Volocopter are also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/how-los-angeles-is-preparing-for-the-air-taxi-takeoff/">collaborating with Urban Movement Labs</a> in Los Angeles to explore how the city can integrate urban air mobility into existing infrastructure and transportation networks.</p>
<p>“I know that airports are starting to really heavily think about this,” JetBlue Technology Ventures President Amy Burr said. “Anybody who&#8217;s doing any infrastructure project at an airport is thinking about whether or not they need to put in a vertiport.”</p>
<h2>(Contingent) orders</h2>
<p>Finally, in 2021 we saw an increase of orders for eVTOL aircraft – starting, of course, with news from United that it had placed a $1 billion order with Archer Aviation. That was followed by a cascade of orders for aircraft from Embraer-backed air taxi developer Eve Urban Air Mobility, an order from UPS for Beta Technologies, and conditional preorders topping 1,350 aircraft from Vertical Aerospace.</p>
<p>It’s important to be clear that none of these orders are firm, which makes sense because the commercial product doesn’t exist yet. Orders are contingent upon completion of development, certification and likely other performance milestones.</p>
<p>Yet, even if it should be a tempered signal for any individual company, it’s still a promising sign for the industry, Wyatt said.</p>
<p>“I think it&#8217;s promising in that obviously there is a market for these aircrafts […] It certainly gives the confidence that if these aircraft are given their flight certification, are able to fly, then there will be considerable interest from the market for these aircraft.”</p>
<h2>Auto gets involved</h2>
<p>The final notable trend of 2021 is the increased activity from legacy automakers. While startups might&#8217;ve grabbed the most headlines, these older and more established companies have also started to notice the promise of electric aviation. (Notably, established aerospace companies, like Boeing and Airbus, have maintained a more established interest in eVTOL &#8212; Boeing through its joint venture with Kitty Hawk, Wisk Aero; and Airbus with its CityAirbus NextGen eVTOL concept.)</p>
<p>Amongst automakers, Hyundai is one such example. While the company unveiled an eVTOL concept design at CES in 2020, this year it officially spun out its urban air mobility business, calling it Supernal. Honda also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/honda-motor-co-announces-plans-for-evtol-avatar-robots-and-space-technologies/">confirmed plans to develop</a> a hybrid eVTOL &#8212; notable because the company said it would be one piece of a &#8220;mobility ecosystem&#8221; that includes connected apps and Honda vehicles. Then, of course, there&#8217;s Chinese automaker Xpeng Motors, which announced at the end of October that it&#8217;s urban air mobility subsidiary HT Aero had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/xpeng-backed-urban-air-mobility-company-ht-aero-raises-500m/">raised $500 million</a> to deliver on an eVTOL car concept.</p>
<p>These efforts are worth paying attention to, because these major automakers have both the capital, as the manufacturing infrastructure  to make moves on eVTOL project. That&#8217;s no assurance of success, of course, and these larger companies may not face the same pressures (and motivations) as a startup, but it&#8217;s definitely something to keep watch of looking to the future.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Crypto companies may be choosing to avoid marginalized communities rather than devising strategic ways to include them.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The United States’ <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-imposes-sanctions-people-iran-syria-uganda-citing-rights-abuses-2021-12-07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial sanctions</a> against countries like Iran create a messy regulatory environment where cryptocurrency startups have to pick their battles carefully. So far, the battles these companies aren&#8217;t picking are having real effects on users and can sometimes directly contradict the company’s alleged decentralization philosophy.</p>
<p>“Something will come down on someone. We just don’t know where or when these regulations will be tested,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/florio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Larry Florio</a>, general counsel at <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/08/31/investing-in-syndicate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syndicate</a>, a company focused on enabling “decentralized autonomous organizations” (DAOs) for tech-savvy collectives.</p>
<p>For a previous example, the crypto custody startup BitGo was <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/20201230_bitgo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">penalized in 2020</a> by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) for failing “to implement controls designed to prevent” interacting with users from sanctioned jurisdictions. Basically, BitGo is almost like a crypto bank; it helps store clients’ assets in secure vaults. And the legal penalty came when some of those clients may have received cryptocurrency from individuals in sanctioned jurisdictions. OFAC showed this is not allowed under U.S. sanctions. Along those same lines, the crypto exchange <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/11/15/binance-warns-iranian-traders-to-withdraw-crypto-amid-sanctions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> has been known to routinely deactivate accounts owned by Iranians and Cubans.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248864" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That’s supposedly why the ConsenSys Academy, one of the industry’s leading Ethereum-centric educational organizations, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/24/consensys-suddenly-bars-iranian-students-from-ethereum-coding-class/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banned roughly 50 Iranian students</a> from its online platform in November 2021, claiming a “recent review of our records shows that you indicated that you are located in a country that we are prohibited from providing goods or services to under U.S. law.”</p>
<p>This compliance review raises questions since the program was free, with no transactions involved, and Coogan Brennan, head of developer relations at ConsenSys Academy, gave an interview to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/consensys-grants-help-iranian-women-130000273.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoinDesk in February 2021</a> about these Iranian students and the challenges they faced. Former program participant Salman Sadeghi told TechCrunch that “Iranians are treated like second-class citizens in web3.”</p>
<p>“They knew that we were from Iran from the very beginning,” Sadeghi said. “I think sanctions harm innocent people as you see, not the government. It’s not fair…<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/28/inside-irans-onslaught-on-bitcoin-mining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum mining</a> is still popular in Iran. But it’s <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/27/iranian-general-advocates-crypto-use-for-skirting-sanctions-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the government</a>, mostly, that mines cryptocurrency.”</p>
<p>Yet another thwarted student, who goes by @Alireza__28, said that he had already quit his job in Tehran to study at the academy and that getting kicked out of the program without a completion certificate, after months of participation, ruined his career plans.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“It was really humiliating,” he said. “There are many remote blockchain job opportunities that pay with crypto. It doesn&#8217;t matter where you are living. Another hope that I had was getting a job offer with a visa sponsorship [to leave Iran]. And the other big hope I had was to make a decentralized app from here, myself.”</p>
<p>It’s also unclear if the sanctions actually apply to this educational program at all. The <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/06/04/coursera-restores-access-iranian-students" target="_blank" rel="noopener">educational platform Coursera </a>does allow Iranian students with direct permission from the U.S. government. According to Michael Mosier, the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/05/27/fincens-new-head-says-controversial-trump-era-crypto-proposal-is-still-pending/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former acting director</a> of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Biden administration is trying to thaw relations with Iran. As such, OFAC might have granted ConsenSys permission to serve this population. For an example from a different sanctioned country, last year OFAC <a href="https://twitter.com/M_Mosier_/status/1447341598392606726?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved</a> a humanitarian<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/us-government-enlists-usdc-global-193616264.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> stablecoin distribution campaign</a> in <a href="https://www.circle.com/blog/circle-partners-with-bolivarian-republic-of-venezuela-and-airtm-to-deliver-aid-to-venezuelans-using-usdc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Venezuela</a>.</p>
<p>“The big takeaway from the ConsenSys stuff is that it’s worth talking to experienced lawyers in the OFAC space,” Mosier said. “I find it hard to believe that ConsenSys can’t do this. There’s a lot of times when people self-select out of something rather than deal with the risk.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, Florio countered that it is hard to fault companies taking a conservative approach to such sanctions.</p>
<p>“Sometimes even just trying to seek a waiver could raise your profile and attract more regulatory scrutiny,” Florio said. “A lot of the way that the industry works these days is don’t ask, don’t tell.”</p>
<p>There may still be hope for Iranian Ethereum fans. ConsenSys global PR lead Elo Gimenez told TechCrunch his company is “fully dedicated to our mission of building the digital economy of tomorrow, which includes exploring ways that we can lawfully share and educate around the world, including in jurisdictions where international engagement can be challenging.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, it’s still commonplace for Iranians to use centralized NFT platforms and tools provided by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin’s portfolio companies like <a href="https://decrypt.co/66541/ethereum-gitcoin-raises-11-million-spins-out-consensys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gitcoin</a> or MetaMask, usually in combination with a VPN service to mask their location. The crowdfunding platform Gitcoin, for example, is a crowdfunding platform that hosted a <a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/2215/solidity-development-course-by-women-in-blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign</a> for Persian-speaking students that was active from March until <a href="https://twitter.com/annbrody7/status/1468737168294256644?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December</a> 2021.<em> </em></p>
<p>Gitcoin COO Kyle Weiss told TechCrunch that, as of December 8, 2021, his fundraising platform is now “marking this grant as inactive out of an abundance of caution to ensure compliance with U.S. law.”</p>
<p>However, Mary Beth Buchanan, the former general counsel for the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken who previously worked for the Department of Justice, where she contributed to the Sentencing Guidelines for Business Organizations, told TechCrunch she doesn’t agree that companies like Gitcoin and ConsenSys Academy need to automatically ban users from sanctioned countries.</p>
<p>“It’s quite possible the activity they wanted to engage in might even be exempt from sanctions. It may be that the company didn’t ask the right questions,” Buchanan said. “Lots of activities are completely exempt from the sanctions regime and others can be granted a general license. You can also apply to OFAC on a case-by-case basis to ask if what you’re doing is okay.… there are phone numbers so that even average people can call OFAC and talk through whether an activity is exempt from sanctions.”</p>
<p>In short, crypto companies may be choosing to avoid marginalized communities rather than devising strategic ways to include them. Buchanan said, especially in cases that involve art or education, it’s far less expensive to be compliant than most business owners might expect. In the meantime, some people from Iran, <a href="https://twitter.com/sobradob/status/1466112990261002241" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cuba</a> and other sanctioned countries feel the crypto industry operates with a de facto caste system. Needing to hide one&#8217;s identity in order to participate in online communities is not the same thing as the community being borderless or inclusive.</p>
<p>“Yes, we can develop our own user interfaces and web3 websites,” said Aysha Amin, one of the women involved with the shuttered Gitcoin campaign, describing the esoteric concept that people refer to as web3 or “the metaverse” when describing Ethereum projects and altcoin competitors like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/solana-a-blockchain-platform-followed-by-top-crypto-investors-says-its-a-lot-faster-than-ethereum/">Solana</a>. “This kind of isolation does not seem good.”</p>
<p>Beyond Gitcoin, Amin said she’s currently participating in an <a href="https://twitter.com/0xrajeev/status/1416793642182737920" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum Foundation-supported</a> educational program, called Secureum, while also working for a Tehran-based tech company. Like many Iranians cited in this piece, she is a MetaMask user who intends to continue working in the space despite discriminatory bans on any specific platform.</p>
<p>“We started this [Farsi-language group for blockchain enthusiasts] group after finishing [another] ConsenSys blockchain developer bootcamp,” Amin said. “As long as I have my own private key, I’m not worried. MetaMask saves my info locally.”</p>
<p>For a little background, the Iranian group she’s a part of includes members that met in Japan at the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/10/devcon-shows-ethereums-world-computer-is-a-movement-not-a-product/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevCon</a> Ethereum conference in 2019. Amin joined this subgroup of five Iranian women in 2021. Their U.S.-based partner in the Gitcoin campaign, Thessy Mehrain, described the Gitcoin campaign:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have worked with Consensys Academy on diversity initiatives. As part of that, I was offered scholarships for minority communities, which I in turn extended to <a href="https://coiniran.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoinIran</a>, an Amsterdam-based organization that has the goal to educate about web3. I met them [CoinIran bloggers] at the Ethereum conference in Osaka. In 2020, a group of female developers took part in the Solidity bootcamp… a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/WomeninBlockchainCommunity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Women in Blockchain</a> chapter was formed in Tehran, the same as we have globally in NYC, Boston, Brisbane, Lagos and elsewhere… They are run locally, entirely independently to educate about the tech and its opportunities.</p></blockquote>
<p>All things considered, it appears these initiatives are more focused on education than strictly on financial transactions.</p>
<p>“Education helps an individual make informed decisions for themselves and also contribute to the progress of the society and nation,” Mehrain said. “These women are members of the global society and should be empowered by education to meaningfully contribute.”</p>
<p>And it also appears that the recent Gitcoin ban is an outlier among the global initiatives funded by Ethereum co-founders like Vitalik Buterin, founder of the Ethereum Foundation, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2018/12/05/cryptopia-in-crisis-billionaire-joe-lubins-ethereum-experiment-is-a-mess-how-long-will-he-prop-it-up/?sh=7c51977c2f0a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lubin</a>, the leading <a href="https://decrypt.co/66541/ethereum-gitcoin-raises-11-million-spins-out-consensys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investor</a> behind ConsenSys. This is partially because, as Florio pointed out, it’s impossible to discriminate across the entire metaverse.</p>
<p>“I don’t see sovereign nations giving up their foreign policy arsenal… yet it&#8217;s unenforceable to say that Iranians can’t participate in anything without applying some type of firewall to the entire country of Iran. I don’t even think the technology exists to do something like that type of internet blockade,” Florio said. “Imposing sanction laws is going to be difficult and require creative interpretations&#8230;I don’t know how the enforcement will come there or if they’ll take into account there are no known methods of fully complying in this context.”</p>
<p>For now, some crypto companies prefer to ban Iranians and other people from sanctioned jurisdictions, rather than seek a compliant legal strategy for including them.</p>
<p>“We don’t have full access all the time. It’s easy to exclude or ban us in web3,” Amin said. “Here in Iran, people who work with blockchain technology, miners, traders, developers, always worry about their access to web3. And we definitely feel this ‘second class citizens’ treatment.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">To create successful growth strategies, relevant marketing campaigns and products that deliver real value to your customers, you must first <em>understand</em> your customers. Doing that requires studying them, talking to them and building target personas to help you make them real to your team. Developing your customer profile is an integral piece of positioning your brand and an indispensable section of your brand book.</p>
<p>Many founders broaden their total addressable market (TAM) to make the numbers on fundraising decks seem more exciting, but effective customer targeting requires you to surgically narrow to a specific customer profile — right down to a name, an age and even a face. Once you’ve identified your customer, it’s critically important to articulate the demographic <em>and</em> ethnographic elements that define them. Demographic information (such as location, gender, marital status) isn’t nearly enough, and to understand the customer, you must also understand relevant ethnographic elements like their lifestyles and motivations.</p>
<p>Here’s how:</p>
<p>Pull a list of your most dedicated users for each metric that matters to your company, such as highest LTV, most frequent user, highest number of purchases or even highest referring customer. Your goal is to generate a list of customers, and the exact number may vary depending on the stage of your company. For a seed company, I’d recommend pulling a list of 15-25 customers. If you’re pre-launch and don’t have customers just yet, you can build a list of your desired users using external data from third-party apps and Google.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			By clearly articulating the preferences, pain points and motivations of your ideal customers, you’ll be able to approach messaging in an informed and strategic manner. 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Create a spreadsheet that includes at a minimum the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique customer ID</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Career/profession</li>
<li>Referral source</li>
<li>Marital status</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Purchasing behavior (defining first purchase, second purchase, third purchase, etc.) and/or engagement behavior (first, interaction, second interaction and so on.)</li>
<li>LTV</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the above parameters include both internal and external data, you’ll have to use third-party tools or even do some cyber-sleuthing (you’ll be surprised how much you can learn with a Google search). Leverage your own database for usage behavior and customer journey, but put in the elbow grease necessary to understand more about each customer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s my last day of work for the year, so we&#8217;re going to have some fun. Obviously, we&#8217;re talking crypto this morning.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jack">Jack Dorsey</a>, former Twitter CEO and present CEO of Block, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/square-is-changing-its-name-to-block/">company formerly known as Square</a>, stirred the crypto pot recently, making explicit his preferences in the larger blockchain landscape by taking swipes at decentralized internet projects that don&#8217;t fall under Bitcoin&#8217;s aegis.</p>

<hr />
<p>To avoid being accused of misinterpreting Jack, here are his key statements, starting with <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473139010197508098">the genesis tweet</a> of the conversation:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2250255" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-21-at-8.30.09-AM.png?w=549" alt="" width="549" height="278" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-21-at-8.30.09-AM.png 549w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-21-at-8.30.09-AM.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-21-at-8.30.09-AM.png?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-21-at-8.30.09-AM.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px" /></p>
<p>Which <a href="https://twitter.com/mdudas/status/1473140692255969281">went down like a party foul with well-known web3 stans</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2250256" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-21-at-8.30.33-AM.png?w=594" alt="" width="594" height="299" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-21-at-8.30.33-AM.png 594w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-21-at-8.30.33-AM.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-21-at-8.30.33-AM.png?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-21-at-8.30.33-AM.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" /></p>
<p>And a few hours after Jack&#8217;s tweet, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1473165434518224896">Elon Musk joined in the fun</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2250258" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-21-at-8.32.15-AM.png?w=550" alt="" width="550" height="252" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-21-at-8.32.15-AM.png 550w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-21-at-8.32.15-AM.png?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-21-at-8.32.15-AM.png?resize=300,137 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-21-at-8.32.15-AM.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></p>
<p>There are several different things being said here, and a few of the tweets could use a bit of explaining if you don&#8217;t live on Twitter. The Exchange has your back:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On who &#8220;owns&#8221; web3:</strong> Jack argues that regular users aren&#8217;t owners of web3 projects. Instead, the CEO claims that venture capitalists and, in turn, their investors are. Even more, Jack doesn&#8217;t expect this dynamic to change; instead, he anticipates that centralized capital pools backing a plethora of crypto projects will maintain quite a lot of control thanks to venture incentives.</li>
<li><strong>On being critical of web3: </strong>After being criticized for &#8220;stifling&#8221; web3 work, Jack dismissed the complaint and said that &#8220;critiques&#8221; can help folks choose to work on more fulfilling projects.</li>
<li><strong>On who will own web3:</strong> Elon Musk jumped into the fun to ask where web3 is, as he is struggling to find it. Jack then subtweets a16z, the venture capital firm, as the nexus point for web3 project funding, and therefore control.</li>
</ul>
<p>What matters in the above is that Jack, a well-known proponent of the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, isn&#8217;t big on web3 projects.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s notable that these two characters popped up to argue against the flood of greed that&#8217;s cropped up in the decentralized economy over the last few years, with every traditional pile of money wanting to get in on putative web3 returns.</p>
<h2>Who owns what?</h2>
<p>The core of Jack&#8217;s complaint is that leading web3 corporations are owned by venture capitalists, and therefore will have to live with venture incentives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Venture incentives,&#8221; of course, is a polite way of saying <em>running a company in such a manner that venture capitalists and their backers make lots of money. </em></p>
<p>The complaint is pretty true. Venture capitalists invested <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/venture-funds-poured-over-6-5-billion-into-crypto-in-q3-2021/">more than $6 billion</a> into crypto projects in Q3 2021 alone. That should give you an idea of the scale of the crypto world being purchased by traditional, private-market investors at the moment. More simply, pension funds own a lot of the crypto economy.</p>
<p>Jack&#8217;s diss about venture capitalists and web3 didn&#8217;t stop there. Not only did Jack say that web3 projects have a weakness in their core thanks to the economic bargains their progenitors have made with external capital, but also that they are <em>centralized. </em></p>
<p>Aside from calling someone a &#8220;nocoiner&#8221; who is going to, alternatively, &#8220;stay poor&#8221; or &#8220;ngmi,&#8221; saying that a crypto project is centralized is perhaps the rudest possible comment.</p>
<p>Is Jack wrong? No, he is not.</p>
<p>It is true that venture players are flooding the zone in web3 with cash and assistance because they think it will make them money. This leads to quite a lot of centralization. For example, I find it blisteringly funny that a16z is an investor in both Coinbase and OpenSea. And that Coinbase intends to get in on the NFT game. You know, the thing that OpenSea currently rules.</p>
<p>Even more, projects like <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/solana-generates-1-billion-in-returns-for-early-backers">Solana sold a bunch of their tokens for a song to venture investors</a>, effectively handing out upside that is forever frozen in already swollen accounts. Centralization? Of ownership <em>and</em> returns, in that case.</p>
<p>Centralization is antithetical to the original, somewhat punk Bitcoin ethos. Web3 advocates, as far as I can tell it, are perfectly content with using external funds to power their new token-based projects as a way to accelerate the future they see coming. Fiat as crutch, I suppose.</p>
<p>But Bitcoin didn&#8217;t need to raise three venture rounds in a year to grow. It just nailed an idea that <em>still </em>resonates. Something to think about.</p>
<p>Now we get to a very large <em>yeah, but</em>.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin is religion; web3 is greed</h2>
<p>While it&#8217;s nice to agree with someone on a crypto viewpoint, I don&#8217;t agree with Jack on everything.</p>
<p>For example, I don&#8217;t agree that Bitcoin is not centralized. It is to a degree that I don&#8217;t think that many people really grok. A new study found this week that &#8220;approximately 0.01% of Bitcoin holders control 27% of the 19 million Bitcoin that are now in circulation,&#8221; <a href="https://www.baystreet.ca/cryptonews/148/Bitcoin-Ownership-Increasingly-Concentrated-In-a-Few-Hands-Study">per Baystreet</a>.</p>
<p>This is why, when I consider the two warring religious camps in the crypto world &#8212; the Bitcoin maximalists who think that the original crypto project is a decentralized Jesus and the web3 &#8220;gm&#8221; crew &#8212; it&#8217;s clear that they are rather different.</p>
<p>Bitcoin maxis are <em>religious</em> in their belief that the OG crypto nailed it, and successive projects are bunk. And web3 is <em>greed</em>, a way to financialize everything online in a manner that allows traditional investors to own toll booths and tax collectors throughout the decentralized landscape.</p>
<p>So while I am more than content to nod along to Jack stirring the web3 pot, I don&#8217;t agree with his general philosophy. Still, Jack managed to point out that a bunch of naked wannabe emperors are, in fact, <em>au naturel</em>. And that&#8217;s a good way to kick off the day.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.getampla.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ampla Technologies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup which provides financing to small-to-medium sized consumer-facing businesses, announced today it has raised $40 million in a Series A round of funding co-led by VMG Partners and Forerunner Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backer Core Innovation Capital also put money in the round. In conjunction with the equity investment, Ampla has also secured $250 million in a debt facility so that it can begin financing brands. The capital infusions bring the New York-based startup’s total funding to $50 million in equity and $330 million in debt financing since its 2019 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are a number of startups out there funding SMBs and e-commerce businesses, Ampla claims that its differentiator is that it provides businesses with a line of credit that includes “omnichannel” revenue streams in underwriting. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s goal is to give founders access to more capital at lower cost, according to Ampla CEO and founder Anthony Santomo. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250198" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ampla’s flagship product, for example, aims to provide (even pre-revenue) businesses with working capital so they can do things like purchase inventory and spend on marketing. Ampla currently works with SMBs in the consumer brand industry across both e-commerce and retail channels. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its “proprietary” data-driven underwriting tool takes into consideration the two channels, and provides “fully transparent” interest rates with no hidden fees and larger credit limits, according to Santomo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the full omnichannel view, we mean that we are able to look at not only e-commerce revenue streams but also retail revenue streams to capture the entire commerce view,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike raising venture money, the working capital is non-dilutive. Indeed, a number of startups providing alternative financing have emerged in recent years, including </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/clearbanc-unicorn-clearco/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearco </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/settle-raises-15m-from-kleiner-perkins-to-give-e-commerce-companies-more-working-capital/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Settle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ampla goes a step further, Santomo added, by providing adjacent financial tools designed “to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">help emerging companies grow more efficiently.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has over 200 customers including Partake Foods, Bev, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good Planet Foods and Serenity Kids. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 30% of Ampla’s customer base so far is made up of businesses founded by people of color and over 40% by females, its execs claim.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the company declined to reveal hard revenue figures, it did say that its monthly transaction volume has grown over 300% in the last 12 months. Its headcount has quadrupled to 40 during that same timeframe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ampla plans to use its new capital to, naturally, do more hiring </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">across product, technology, sales and operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Growing our team will allow us to launch new products and iterate on existing products faster,” Santomo told TechCrunch. “All products are driven by customer feedback and demand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic created a shift in e-commerce adoption. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the pandemic hit, “Ampla quickly realized that large increases in e-commerce sales were coming across the majority of its customer base,” Santomo said. “These large increases in e-commerce sales created a universal demand for a commercial-grade working capital solution.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jason Bornstein, principal at Forerunner Ventures, led acquisition and demand planning at Bonobos (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an e-commerce-driven apparel subsidiary of Walmart) in its early days that ended up raising over $100 million in funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, he recalls, “it was never easier to build a brand online, but it was challenging to build a business online.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But over the last decade, a playbook for how to launch a digital brand has developed. The enablement layer of products and services has matured, and there’s now a vibrant ecosystem of digital brands,” he wrote via email. “When it comes to financing, however, the choices aren’t at all clear-cut. While select brands may continue to take equity and venture debt through the VC ecosystem, most brands do not have access to appropriate capital to scale. Brands deserve a financial platform that appreciates and understands their business model, capital needs, and ambitions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Forerunner became known in the market as an early supporter of digital brands, Bornstein points out that the firm has “always” believed that stores and wholesale will continue to play a meaningful role in a brand’s sales strategy and presence in the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ampla shares this belief and uniquely considers omnichannel revenue when underwriting a business,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooke Kiley, partner at VMG Catalyst, noted that VMG has a long history of investing in consumer products and has seen firsthand that there’s a lack of viable working capital options for emerging brands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The existing alternatives leave entrepreneurs confused and frustrated. With Ampla, what you see is what you get,” she wrote via email. “There are no hidden fees or intentionally confusing structure. Your business is evaluated as a whole – not just one individual revenue channel – and provided with flexible terms that are designed with the customer in mind.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.airtable.com/">Airtable</a> today announced that it quietly acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/4-million-richer-walrus-ai-has-a-pitch-for-companies-looking-for-qa-testing-tools/">Walrus.ai</a>, a no-code software testing platform, earlier this year.</p>
<p>&#8216;Acquired&#8217; may be overstating things a bit, though. Best I can tell, Walrus.ai&#8217;s homepage became unavailable a few months ago and Airtable tells me it has no plans to use any of the service&#8217;s technology. &#8216;Acquihire&#8217; may be a better description, but neither Airtable&#8217;s Chief Product Officer Peter Deng and Walrus co-founder Scott White was quite ready to use this term.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, at the end of the day, you want to work on things that align with the vision and the arc of what you&#8217;re trying to accomplish,&#8221; White told me.&#8221; Airtable is the natural evolution or the opportunity to fulfill the vision of what you set out to accomplish on a grander scale. And so I think of it as an evolution of what we&#8217;re working on, to be able to take that to the next level. I think it was an awesome opportunity.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249697" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>White and his co-founders Jake Marsh and Akshay Nathan will join the company, with White becoming the product lead for solutions at Airtable, Nathan an engineering manager in the company&#8217;s enterprise organization and Marsh joining as a software engineer. Only the co-founders are joining the company. Walrus.ai had previously raised $4 million is seed funding from investors like Homebrew, Felicis Ventures and Leadout Capital.</p>
<p>The two companies argue that their overall vision was very much aligned. While the Walrus team, aimed to make building end-to-end software tests easier by helping users write their tests in plain English, Airtable wants to turn all of its users into app developers.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;$4 million richer, Walrus.ai has a pitch for companies looking for QA-testing tools&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/4-million-richer-walrus-ai-has-a-pitch-for-companies-looking-for-qa-testing-tools/embed/#?secret=qHPebLCk3n" data-secret="qHPebLCk3n" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Democratizing software creation &#8212; really kind of making it easy to build software, it all started there,&#8221; said Deng when I asked him how this deal came about. &#8220;I got introduced to Scott and the Walrus team and it was very immediately apparent that we share the same vision. The vision of Walrus was to make building high-quality software easy for developers. But, you know, when we started talking, I was like: &#8216;well, let&#8217;s just make building software easier for everyone. Right? And how about that?&#8217; I think there was just immediate click on the DNA of the co-founders and things that they were doing and things that we were doing, and we just started talking and it just felt more and more natural to just work together.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At Airtable, Deng and White argued, the Walrus team would be able to expand on its original vision and that their skills would transfer to building a different kind of product. As White noted, Airtable aims to make it easy for its users to do very complex things and make that process easy and seamless. And at the same time, with enterprise being Airtable&#8217;s fastest-growing segment, its service is also now being used to manage very complex workflows.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think about our work on those two dimensions: about how to make the floor very low for a net new creator to come onto the platform and start building &#8212; and then making sure that our core capabilities and infrastructure will allow us to scale to these massive enterprise engagements,&#8221; White said about the work he is doing at Airtable now. Neither White nor Deng would say what exactly the Walrus team is working on now, beyond Deng saying that they are &#8220;working on big things together&#8221; that involves a number of initiatives to solve &#8220;end-user problems in a very elegant way.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">OnlyFans founder and CEO Tim Stokely is stepping down, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-21/onlyfans-ceo-tim-stokely-steps-down-giving-role-to-spokesperson-ami-gan">Bloomberg reports</a>. His successor is Ami Gan, the company&#8217;s former head of communications and marketing. This move comes after a tenuous year for OnlyFans, in which the company said it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-bans-explicit-content/">ban</a> the sex workers that thrive on the platform, a decision that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/onlyfans-suspends-decision-to-ban-explicit-content/">suspended</a> a week later.</p>
<p>If it seems strange to appoint a spokesperson as CEO of a company, you&#8217;re not off-base. But, per <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-21/onlyfans-ceo-tim-stokely-steps-down-giving-role-to-spokesperson-ami-gan">reports</a>, this was Stokely&#8217;s own decision.</p>
<p class="paywall">“We’ve worked side-by-side sharing our passion about the creator economy,” Gan, the new CEO, said. “Our priority is to continue being committed to being the safest social media platform in the world.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250266" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Gan also said that she will invest in OFTV, the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/onlyfans-promotes-its-sfw-app-as-it-seeks-funding-at-a-1b-valuation/">safe-for-work streaming app</a>, and will build new tools for creators. While Stokely&#8217;s own business background is in online pornography, Gan has worked for brands like Red Bull, Quest Nutrition and a cannabis cafe.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked OnlyFans if this change in leadership will impact sex workers on the platform and is awaiting comment.</p>
<p>OnlyFans thrives thanks to its NSFW creators, and in August, the company was <a href="https://www.axios.com/onlyfans-investors-struggle-9cc92523-6607-40ad-9893-4175e7966b52.html">on track</a> to do $2.5 billion in sales this year, up from $1.2 billion last year (OnlyFans takes 20% of creator earnings). But then, the company dropped a bombshell that would jeopardize the livelihoods of the sex workers who made the app a billion-dollar enterprise: OnlyFans was going to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-bans-explicit-content/">ban</a> NSFW content. After swift backlash, OnlyFans <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/onlyfans-suspends-decision-to-ban-explicit-content/">suspended</a> this decision, saying that it resolved issues with banking providers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As crazy as the NFT market has become, there’s been an increasing range of other things to do with NFTs other than pimp images of apes and punks &#8211; even if they have become enormously valuable.</p>
<p>We’ve seen the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/blockchain-startup-propy-plans-first-ever-auction-of-a-real-apartment-as-a-collectible-nft/">auction of apartments as NFTs</a>, for instance.</p>
<p>And now we’re seeing charities starting to benefit from the frenzy, raising funds in a transparent way, while engaging new audiences.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250252" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Even Binance has launched <a href="https://www.nftforgood.org/#/home">“NFT for Good”</a>, an open platform founded by the Binance Charity foundation, enabling people to convert their art and creativity into an auction targeting social and humanitarian issues.</p>
<p>Part of the reason it’s taking off is that NFTs <a href="https://nftevening.com/nft-charity-donations-are-on-the-rise-here-are-our-favourites/">gamify the process of fundraising</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time, Crypto art is entering the realism of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada">Dadaism</a> and Satire. Remember the Ethereum token called FUCK, which raised $30,000 in the first half-hour of a July 2017 ICO? Now we have the world’s richest <a href="https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/the-million-dollar-line-20607">line as an NFT</a>, (literally a drawn line in red ink) currently priced at 260.774 Ether or $1.04M.</p>
<p>The worlds of NFT art and satire now collide in a new project, which has just gone live on the NFT platform OpenSea, dubbed “<a href="https://opensea.io/collection/nft-the-boris-drop">Non Fungible Tories &#8211; The Boris Drop</a>”.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This consists of a set of 8-bit parody portraits of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, where <em>52%</em> of proceeds (matching the infamous <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results">Brexit vote majority figure</a>) will be going to a UK charity to help the homeless.</p>
<p>In the NFT series, the artist &#8211; who bills themselves as “Pfeffel, a punk artist” (their identity has been verified by TechCrunch as a UK-based tech founder) &#8211; satirizes some of Johnson’s most famous quotes</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Bozo.gif" alt="" width="600" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2250257" /></p>
<p>In their tribute to “a clown, an oaf, a wager of culture war, and a pound-shop Churchill”, Pfeffel has creates a series of NFTs based on Johnson’s quotes such as “<a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/56877347506589068823172852319637238320636213562928988291262062303833967558657">Watermelon smile</a>”, “<a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/56877347506589068823172852319637238320636213562928988291262062306032990814209">Letterbox</a>” and the moment he <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/56877347506589068823172852319637238320636213562928988291262062313729572208641">hid in a fridge</a> instead of answering a journalists&#8217; questions.</p>
<p>The NFTs also satirize the very Johnson latest controversy &#8211; throwing a party at No.10, <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/56877347506589068823172852319637238320636213562928988291262062328023223369729">featuring cheese and wine</a>, while the UK was in full pandemic lockdown. The “8-bit images of a 2-bit politician” will all be first editions.</p>
<p>Pfeffel has pledged that the charity <a href="https://www.crisis.org.uk/crisis-at-christmas/">Crisis at Christmas</a>, which helps the homeless on UK streets during the festive season, will benefit from the NTF auction.</p>
<p>Admittedly, there’s plenty of Johnson material for any NFT artist to lampoon.</p>
<p>Johnson has increasingly gained a reputation as a &#8216;care and conscience-free&#8217; politician, infamously coining the lines “fuck business” and “let the bodies pile up” in regards to the COVID-19 pandemic. He’s also slashed the UK’s aid budget, presided over the highest COVID death rate in Europe, and the deepest economic slump in the G7.</p>
<p>Pfeffel told TechCrunch: “One way to rebuke the devil is to laugh at him. My art laughs at Johnson. These NFTs will hopefully help to, in some way, alleviate the suffering of those on the streets who have been forgotten by a government that seems happy to party while the bodies pile up.”</p>
<p>The auction will go live on Tuesday at Noon and will end on New Year’s Eve at Noon. </p>
<p>You can follow the auction updates <a href="https://twitter.com/pfeffelart">on twitter here</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[With capital flowing freely lately, managing partners Jason Schoettler and Kevin Dunlap shared some insights on what it takes to win deals these days. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.calibratevc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calibrate Ventures</a>, a four-year-old early-stage venture capital firm backing startups leveraging artificial intelligence and automation, debuted its second fund, a $97 million vehicle that is about 25% higher than its previous fund.</p>
<p>With Calibrate Fund II, the firm has $175 million in assets under management, co-founder and managing partner Jason Schoettler told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The firm raised $80 million for its first fund in 2018. Since then, the firm invested in 17 companies, most notably Built Robotics, Embodied, FarmWise, Soft Robotics, Talage and TruckLabs. Together, those companies raised a collective $425 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249988" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A few investments have already been made from Calibrate Fund II, but they are unannounced at this time, Schoettler said.</p>
<p>With capital flowing freely lately, Schoettler, who previously worked at Shea Ventures, where he met co-founder and managing partner Kevin Dunlap, shared some insights on what it takes to win deals these days.</p>
<p>“We think domain expertise and experience go a long way to winning deals,” Schoettler said. “For example, having a network and infrastructure to help get introductions to customers or build out the board and strategic financing.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dunlap, a mechanical engineer who previously worked for companies like Ring and Solar City, believes that companies like Ring or portfolio company Soft Robotics would not exist 10 years ago and make economic sense. It is all possible now that sensors are cheaper and computing power has increased, he added.</p>
<p>“We have large strategics investing in our companies alongside us, and sometimes after us, which is good,” Dunlap said. “It means we understand the sales cycle and revenue model to generate large returns. We lead with the ability we have to help them sell on the customer and technology side. Our founders also can lean on each other because they are doing similar things, but in different verticals.”</p>
<p>They also say this is lining the firm up to be aggressive as it sees interesting activity around AI and automation. In particular, Schoettler noted that with COVID last year, activity has gone from “zero to warp speed over the past 12 months,” and the firm has been focused on building out an infrastructure around the team and this new fund is its successful fundraising to set it up.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Soft Robotics raises another $10M, citing pandemic-related demand&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/soft-robotics-raises-another-10m-citing-pandemic-related-demand/embed/#?secret=OOkpcXoiZ9" data-secret="OOkpcXoiZ9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As such, Schoettler and Dunlap grew their team in 2021 to meet that demand, adding three new venture partners, including Aimée Leifer, Paolo Pirjanian and Daniel Murray, hired Carrie Zawistowski as vice president of portfolio finance and brought on a firm to manage public relations and marketing for its portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the firm invests across a wide range of industries like education, healthcare, logistics, law, financial services, manufacturing and transportation.</p>
<p>Having mainly focused efforts around computer vision, AI, machine learning and to some extent, robotics, Schoettler and Dunlap say they are often pulled into areas where there are labor balance issues, like agriculture and construction, where labor is hard to find because people are not going into these positions.</p>
<p>Dunlap estimates that some $500 billion will be spent in the next several years on AI and AI implementation. He called out chicken producer Tyson, which announced in November that it would be <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tyson-foods-plans-spend-over-13-bln-automation-projects-2021-12-09/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investing $1.3 billion in automating its meat plants</a> over the next three years. Tyson Ventures is also an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/soft-robotics-raises-another-10m-citing-pandemic-related-demand/">investor in portfolio company Soft Robotics</a>.</p>
<p>“We expect real adoption for machine learning and advanced robotics in five to 10 years,” Dunlap added. “Automation is great for anything dirty, dull and dangerous, where it is hard to find people who are excited about taking those opportunities.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">If you want your homepage to convert, it&#8217;s crucial to ensure that there is minimal confusion and friction for the user.</p>
<p>Conversion can be thought of as a formula: Conversion = Desire &#8211; Labor &#8211; Confusion. Keep this formula in mind when building your website. Your goal is to increase desire while decreasing labor (friction) and confusion. People have short attention spans, so if your homepage is confusing, they&#8217;re going to leave.</p>
<p>This post is going to tear down the homepage of Ahrefs, an all-in-one search engine optimization platform that allows marketers to perform competitive analysis, audit their site&#8217;s search traffic and find keywords that will allow them to rank better on search engines.</p>
<p>This teardown covers all the key sections of a landing page so that you can apply their conversion tactics and copywriting strategies to your startup&#8217;s homepage.</p>
<h2>Capture attention with an objection handler</h2>
<p>The first section of your website that a visitor will see is your above-the-fold (ATF) section. This section is important, because this is your chance to make a good first impression on visitors when they visit your website. If your ATF section is confusing or uninteresting, you risk the visitors leaving and reading nothing else.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Ahrefs&#8217; ATF section has four pieces that we&#8217;ll dive into individually: the header, call to action, social proof and a subhead.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246578" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246578" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2246578" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.png" alt="Ahrefs' above the fold section has four pieces: header, call-to-action, social proof and a sub-header." width="1024" height="651" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.png?resize=768,489 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.png?resize=680,433 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246578" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve<strong><br /></strong></p></div></p>
<h2>A header that tackles the most common objection</h2>
<p>Your header must hook readers with your most compelling feature framed as a bold claim. When you handle your target audience&#8217;s biggest objection, it can serve as the bold claim that gets visitors to continue reading.</p>
<p>Ahrefs uses a common header template: Get [benefit] without [problem]. In this case, it&#8217;s flipped: With [product] you won&#8217;t have [problem] in order to get [benefit].</p>
<p>Ahrefs knows a lot of businesses need SEO but don&#8217;t have the time or resources to build expertise. So, Ahrefs tells their visitors you don&#8217;t have to be an SEO professional to use its product.</p>
<p>The underlying benefit here is that users will get more search traffic and rank higher on the web while not needing SEO expertise to do so.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246582" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246582" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2246582" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2.png" alt="Ahrefs tells their visitors you don't have to be an SEO pro to use their product." width="1024" height="792" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2.png 1218w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2.png?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2.png?resize=300,232 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2.png?resize=768,594 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2.png?resize=680,526 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246582" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>Make your call to action stand out</h2>
<p>Calls to action (CTAs) are the only way to move visitors down the relationship funnel. It&#8217;s nearly impossible to get someone to sign up without encouraging them to do so. Visitors instinctively don&#8217;t want to sign up.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Bitcoin and broader cryptocurrency prices have skyrocketed in 2021. Stories abound of pandemic-era crypto millionaires that have struck it rich in the sector.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency narrative is a private sector one by design. Bitcoin and other crypto projects began with the intent to create an immutable digital currency that is decentralized and could not be affected by government monetary policy.</p>
<p>That said, in recent years — as the marketplace crested $2 trillion in value — the public sector has increasingly taken a closer look, with nascent regulations emerging in some countries, outright bans in others and even wholesale adoption in a few.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249352" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The viewpoints of national governments — which print their own fiat currency — compared to some local governments can vary tremendously. Increasingly, there are a group of cities that see cryptocurrency as an opportunity to leverage the technology, financial and economic development potential of this new industry.</p>
<p>Certainly, bitcoin, blockchain and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are not terms one often hears around City Hall. But increasingly, they are in cities like Miami, Tampa, New York and Jackson, Tennessee, as the mayors of these cities laid down a marker for entering the cryptocurrency realm. As an example of their intention, mayors from all four cities recently agreed to take one or more of their paychecks in bitcoin.</p>
<p>As many stories on city innovation do, it starts with one local official leading on the topic and laying down a challenge to his fellow mayors. In this case, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez <a href="https://twitter.com/FrancisSuarez/status/1455562833006059528" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted out</a> that he would take his next paycheck in bitcoin. Incoming New York City Mayor Eric Adams sought to one-up him, saying he would take <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/04/new-york-mayor-elect-eric-adams-to-take-first-3-paychecks-in-bitcoin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple paychecks</a> in bitcoin.</p>
<p>“Education is the best way to dispel the fear and misunderstanding surrounding crypto, and I believe that’s the root of what Mayor Adams and I are doing,&#8221; Suarez said. &#8220;If people see us dive in headfirst, perhaps it’ll give them the confidence to dip their toes in the water.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One mayor is certainly notable, and two mayors a pattern. But with more than three mayors on board the bitcoin bandwagon, it’s clearly a trend.</p>
<p>Mayor Scott Conger of Jackson, Tennessee — one of the youngest mayors the city of about 70,000 people has elected — joined the friendly challenge and said he would take a paycheck in bitcoin, too. Conger and Suarez went back and forth <a href="https://twitter.com/MayorConger/status/1456411229220708356" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Twitter</a> about this — and Conger has been innovating in the crypto space in his small city.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, another Florida mayor jumped into the mix as well. Mayor Jane Castor of Tampa made the announcement that she would take a paycheck in bitcoin at a cryptocurrency conference in her city only a few days later. With Tampa recently crowned a <a href="https://www.fox13news.com/news/tampa-tops-forbes-list-of-emerging-tech-cities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top emerging tech city</a> and hosting 25% of tech jobs in the state, the alignment with this emerging field squares up.</p>
<p>Conger noted that what Suarez is doing doesn’t need to just be a big-city phenomenon &#8212; it can work in communities of all sizes. Seeing the interesting things happening on technology and cryptocurrency in larger cities, he thought about how that could translate in a place like Jackson — and like any good mayor, clearly had his eye toward the economic development potential for his city.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t have to be in just Miami or a large city,” he said. “Jackson has the opportunity to do that. I mean, we were the first city in the state of Tennessee to have gig fiber internet to the home. Why can’t we be the first to adopt newer technology as it comes along?”</p>
<p>Jackson has <a href="https://www.jacksonsun.com/story/news/local/2015/06/27/jackson-one-seven-tennessee-recognized-gig-city/29413037/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">super-fast internet service</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span> which allows it to compete broadly for companies in the tech sector. As a result, its mayor sees cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) companies as a natural outgrowth for the community.</p>
<p>“The space is wide open,” Conger noted. As the retail industry shrinks and the amount of physical space existing businesses use is reduced, the mayor sees an opportunity. “As DeFi, crypto and tech companies start popping up, they are going to need a place to go.”</p>
<p>Driving home the advantage he sees in his smaller community, Conger added, “Why go to a city with millions of people when you can come to a city with 70,000 people?”</p>
<p>This focus on economic development is one shared by all four of these mayors, as well as other local leaders dipping their toe in the waters of cryptocurrency, as they think about the future of jobs in their cities. In Miami, this feels core to the mayor’s effort within the cryptocurrency space.</p>
<p>“Miami is built on a common theme, the people who come here are sick and tired of being left behind — or worse — being persecuted by their governments, and they come here in search of a better life and in return, they make our city better,&#8221; Suarez said. &#8220;The Miami Movement is about bringing high-quality, high-paying jobs to our city — I want to prepare Miami for the future and to create the next generation of leaders right here at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>This focus on talent attraction and talent retention is big in Miami and in so many other cities throughout the country. Whether in tech or finance — and in this case, crypto as a blend of both — Miami is seeking to grow these sectors.</p>
<p>“The Miami Movement is a result of a perfect storm of conditions that resulted in people flocking to Miami, but the push for a growing finance and tech sector has been decades in the making,” Suarez said. “It wasn’t as ‘spur of the moment’ as many people think it was. Attracting innovation and growth to our city is a tremendous benefit to every single Miamian.”</p>
<p>We can only imagine what a place like New York City may be able to do within the cryptocurrency sector due to its long-standing supremacy in finance and the increasing strength of its tech sector. Likewise, Tampa has been on the rise for many years now, and with its rising ability to attract tech talent and economic potential, we may see some interesting differentiation start to present itself as the cryptocurrency sector matures.</p>
<p>Which will be the first city to truly make a strong play in the metaverse or perhaps even mint a municipal NFT? With this kind of leadership happening at ground level, we will know soon enough as mayors embrace the growth of this digital industry.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Tackle.io, a startup that helps software companies sell through cloud marketplaces such as AWS's, raised a $100 million Series C funding round co-led by Coatue and a16z at a $1.25 billion valuation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://tackle.io">Tackle.io</a>, an Idaho-based startup that helps software companies sell through cloud marketplaces such as AWS&#8217;s, announced today it has raised a $100 million Series C funding round. Co-led by<a href="https://www.coatue.com/"> Coatue</a> and <a href="https://a16z.com/">Andreessen Horowitz</a>, the round also saw participation from <a href="https://www.bvp.com/">Bessemer Venture Partners</a>.</p>
<p>Bringing Tackle&#8217;s total funding to $148 million, the Series C turned Tackle into a unicorn with a $1.25 billion valuation. A document sent to the press describes this figure as &#8220;a significant uplift&#8221; from its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/tackle-nabs-35m-series-b-to-help-companies-navigate-cloud-marketplaces/">$35 million Series B</a>, whose valuation wasn&#8217;t disclosed when it took place a mere nine months ago.</p>
<p>Tackle says it plans to use its new funding to accelerate the execution of its product roadmap, scale its go-to-market (GTM) teams, expand its global reach, and continue to innovate. That&#8217;s quite a list; with $100 million it may be possible.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250234" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But since the list sounds a bit vague to us, let&#8217;s dive deeper into what Tackle is tackling.</p>
<p>As often, the company started with entrepreneurs scratching their own itch, my colleague Ron Miller reported last March. Tackle&#8217;s co-founder and CTO &#8220;Dillon Woods says that at previous jobs, he found that it took several months with a couple of engineers dedicated to the task to get a product onto the AWS marketplace, and he noticed that it was a similar set of tasks each time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tackle solved that by coming up with a solution for independent software vendors (ISVs) to list onto major cloud marketplaces: those of Amazon&#8217;s AWS, Microsoft&#8217;s Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and IBM-owned Red Hat.</p>
<p>You might not have realized it yet, but &#8220;cloud marketplaces aren’t just one more channel for selling software – it’s becoming <em>the</em> channel,&#8221; a16z&#8217;s Martin Casado <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/03/09/investing-in-tackle/">wrote</a> last March. The investor joined Tackle&#8217;s board when his firm led the startup&#8217;s Series B round, and sees it as a category leader. &#8220;Tackle is the leading player for enabling companies to sell software through the cloud,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the time, Casado referred to Tackle having more than 200 customers. That number has now grown to 350, according to the company. This includes companies such as AppDynamics, Auth0, CrowdStrike, Dell, Gitlab, HashiCorp, Looker, McAfee, NewRelic, Okta, PagerDuty, Talend, and VMware, it says.</p>
<p>The clients range from startups &#8212; most of them &#8212; to corporations, but they have one thing in common: They make software. So why would they use a &#8216;zero engineering&#8217; solution to build and maintain marketplace integrations? <a href="https://tackle.io/blog/tackle-series-b-funding/">According</a> to Tackle, it&#8217;s because &#8220;software companies shouldn’t have to build software in order to sell software&#8221; – their human resources are better used elsewhere.</p>
<p>Says Tackle customer Robson Grieve, CMO at low-code platform OutSystems: &#8220;The Tackle Platform makes leveraging Marketplaces a business decision versus a distraction to product and engineering teams.&#8221;</p>
<p>This business decision – selling via cloud marketplaces – is increasingly common.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.bvp.com/atlas/state-of-the-cloud-2021#Cloud-Marketplaces">State of the Cloud 2021 report</a>, Bessemer highlighted the adoption of cloud marketplaces as one of the top 3 best practices for companies to implement for GTM in the New Normal. The VC firm has backed Tackle since its seed round, and led its <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tackleio-secures-a-7-25m-series-a-funding-led-by-bessemer-venture-partners-301074096.html">$7.25 million Series A round</a> in 2020, with partner Michael Droesch joining the startup&#8217;s board at that time.</p>
<p>Fellow VC firm Battery Ventures, which to our knowledge hasn&#8217;t invested in Tackle, also backs up that view. In its <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/Battery_Ventures/state-of-the-opencloud-2020-238800487">State of the Open Cloud 2020 report</a>, it had listed &#8220;leverag[ing]&#8221; new cloud marketplaces to discover and reach customers as an operational best practice.</p>
<p>In its own <a href="https://tackle.io/resources/reports/state-of-cloud-marketplaces/">State of the Cloud Marketplaces Report</a>, Tackle heard from 67% of survey respondents that they planned to invest more in Marketplaces as a go-to-market avenue in 2022. The report also predicts that Cloud Marketplaces will exceed $10 billion in throughput by the end of 2023, and $50 billion by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>There are several drivers behind the rise of cloud marketplaces, but the gist is that B2B sales increasingly look like B2C sales – which is why investors are betting on Tackle. &#8220;We believe Tackle is well-positioned to help all sellers accelerate their shift toward Cloud Marketplaces and digital selling,&#8221; said Coatue general partner David Schneider, who will join Tackle’s board as an observer following the round.</p>
<p>Of course, we&#8217;d like to know more about Tackle&#8217;s revenue, but it is only saying that it doubled its ARR in 2021. &#8220;This has been a tremendous year for Tackle,&#8221; said CEO John Jahnke, as the company now &#8220;expects to see explosive growth&#8221; in 2022.</p>
<p>One thing that will grow for sure is its team: It increased from 56 to 160 employees this year, and the startup is planning to double its headcount in 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the U.S., <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around 13% of greenhouse gases</a> are spewed out of commercial and residential buildings. You&#8217;d be forgiven for scratching your head and asking why. If you tour a typical New York building, you&#8217;ll often find that the tech that runs deep in the underbellies of the brick-clad behemoths looks like the 1960s and smells even worse. <a href="https://www.runwise.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Runwise</a> is already in 4,000-ish buildings, and today announced it raised $11 million to put its tech into many thousand more. The company has a winning win/win combination of saving landlords money while giving planet earth a break in the process.</p>
<p>Runwise&#8217;s selling point is taking ancient tech that often operates on on/off switches or timers rather than sensors, and sprinkling enough technology on top to ensure that buildings aren&#8217;t heating more than they need to. The company has developed wireless sensors that operate on batteries with a 10-year battery life, and a controller computer that takes charge over the building&#8217;s boilers and heating. It claims that the average time to recuperate the cost of the install (in the form of reduced heating bills) is around nine months.</p>
<p>&#8220;Five or six years ago nobody gave a shit about the environment, and we&#8217;d be like, &#8216;but it&#8217;ll have a huge impact!&#8217;. They&#8217;d ask us about the bottom line, and suddenly we&#8217;d have a conversation going,&#8221; Lee Hoffman, COO and co-founder of Runwise explains. &#8220;Our vision long term is if you run buildings better you can change the carbon profile and affordability of pretty much every city out there. That&#8217;s really our goal; there are 12 million buildings in the United States. We&#8217;re in 4,000 today, there&#8217;s really no reason we shouldn&#8217;t be in all of them.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246532" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company has been bootstrapping for a decade, with some impressive results: its tech is already available in buildings owned by some of the largest real estate operators in the country, including Related, Blackstone, Lefrak, Equity Residential, Douglas Elliman and Fairstead. Runwise claims more than 300,000 people live and work in the 4,000 or so buildings it operates. It <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">decided it&#8217;s time to kick the company into a phase of hyper growth. It raised $11 million from </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://initialized.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Initialized Capital</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://susaventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Susa Ventures</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://notation.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notation Capital</a>,<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> with participation from </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://nextview.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NextView Ventures</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and several angels.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Most buildings in New York &#8212; and pretty much the entire country and the world &#8212; run on controls that were designed in the 1960s and 70s, made by a handful of companies. If you go into a brand-new Bank of America high-rise glass tower, it has a control box that has a fancy digital display, and it&#8217;s literally inside the same control from 1960s or 70s,&#8221; Hoffman explains, and gets a little animated in his incredulity. &#8220;It runs what&#8217;s called an outdoor reset, which is basically a static Excel table. If it&#8217;s heating this many minutes, turn on the heat. If this is the temperature outside, do this. It has no idea what&#8217;s going on inside the building. It&#8217;s all hardcoded. It&#8217;s completely bonkers. And this is controlling millions of dollars of energy spend in almost every building!&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Veho's technology matches package delivery demand with qualified driver partners and lets customers know the actual time of delivery and even communicates when the driver is headed their way.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://shipveho.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Veho</a>, a startup applying technology to next-day package delivery, aims to solve the last mile of delivery — how packages get from fulfillment centers to the customer’s door. It also wants to do it with a unique flair: providing transparency into deliveries that starts with the option of when, where and how customers want their packages delivered and then real-time communication throughout the whole process.</p>
<p>Since raising its seed round in the summer of 2020, New York-based Veho has grown 40 times in revenue, while also increasing its employee count from 15 to 400, Veho co-founder and CEO Itamar Zur told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>It is already working in 14 U.S. markets, but plans to grow to 50 markets by the end of 2022. To do that, and invest in technology development, growing the team and introducing and scaling its doorstep returns program, the company announced $125 million in Series A funding that valued the company at $1 billion.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249998" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>General Catalyst led the round and was joined by Construct Capital, led by Rachel Holt, Bling Capital, Industry Ventures, Fontinalis Partners and Origin Ventures. The latest funding round gives Veho a total of $130 million raised to date, Zur said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="D09le0JrZf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/walmart-announces-golocal-a-last-mile-delivery-service-for-other-retailers/">Walmart announces GoLocal, a last-mile delivery service for other retailers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Walmart announces GoLocal, a last-mile delivery service for other retailers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/walmart-announces-golocal-a-last-mile-delivery-service-for-other-retailers/embed/#?secret=D09le0JrZf" data-secret="D09le0JrZf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>You might be asking yourself why in the world a young company would take on so much capital up front like that, but Zur responded that Veho is “a substantial platform, not a small operation at this point, and we want to maintain fast growth.”</p>
<p>“We have an opportunity in the midst of the biggest e-commerce revolution, and after growing fast through the pandemic, that is not going away,” he added. “Customer experience is changing in front of our eyes, and other than speed and communication, what brands want to provide is visibility and data. We think it is the perfect time to take in more capital to continue to grow at a phenomenal rate.”</p>
<p>Sure, Amazon has a bear hug on about 50% of the last-mile market, and there is no debate that they are doing well here. Zur doesn’t deny it either, but he does see an opportunity to offer the same kind of delivery service for the 50% of e-commerce businesses that want to offer something faster than seven to 10 business days.</p>
<p>Veho&#8217;s technology matches package delivery demand with qualified driver partners and can then let customers know the actual time of day when they will receive their package and even when the driver is headed their way. It is also making it possible to reschedule a delivery in real time, change an address or provide personal delivery instructions.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2250030" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2250030" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2250030" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg" alt="Veho" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Veho-Team-October-2021.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2250030" class="wp-caption-text">The Veho team. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Veho</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea for the company stems from Zur’s own experience. While in business school, he bought a subscription for meal delivery, but his first package never arrived. Zur recalls trying to get in touch with the delivery company, and after waiting for 40 minutes, the call was disconnected. As a result, he canceled the subscription, which is not unlike what other consumers do as they become more intolerant of receiving packages late or not at all.</p>
<p>“In an increasingly competitive e-commerce space, there are tons of companies looking for similarly fast delivery as Amazon, but lack the scale to do it,” Zur said. “Veho levels the playing field for these brands. The biggest missed opportunities are connecting the dots between the pre-packaged experience and delivery to help brands build more loyalty and for people to stay with them longer, to buy more and buy more frequently.”</p>
<p>Veho is not alone in trying to solve the last-mile problem, and is among companies around the world also raising capital for their approaches. For example, in the past six months, we saw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/e-bike-subscription-service-zoomo-raises-60m-series-b-to-disrupt-last-mile-delivery/">Zoomo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/last-mile-logistics-platform-cargamos-raises-11m-seed-round-to-expand-same-day-delivery/">Cargamos</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/last-mile-robotic-delivery-firm-coco-raises-36m/">Coco</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/deliverr-inventory-customers/">Deliverr</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/bringg-nabs-100m-at-a-1b-valuation-for-a-last-mile-delivery-platform-for-retailers/">Bringg</a> announce new rounds. Walmart also introduced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/walmart-announces-golocal-a-last-mile-delivery-service-for-other-retailers/">Walmart GoLocal program</a> in the summer for other retailers to tap into the retail giant’s delivery network.</p>
<p>Zur doesn’t see Veho competing against the likes of Deliverr or some of those others, but does see the company competing with the national shipping companies. He believes their technology was designed for “an older world” that didn’t include e-commerce, and that is what separates Veho from them — that it was built “entirely around the needs of e-commerce customers” with a vision of how that sector will grow over the next decade.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/at-9-29-cagr-last-mile-delivery-market-size-is-expected-to-reach-usd-200-42-bn-in-2027--says-brandessence-market-research-301387705.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global last-mile delivery market</a> was valued at around $108 billion in 2020 and is set to grow by <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/last-mile-delivery-market-grow-143000535.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$146.96 billion in the next four years</a>, with North America contributing to 39% of that growth, according to technology and research company Technavio.</p>
<p>With purchases shifting to e-commerce, the logistics and parcel delivery sectors are racing to keep up with demands. They’ve also been met with major setbacks in the past few years. From the aptly dubbed “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/technology/holiday-shipageddon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shipaggedon</a>” during the holiday season in 2020, to manufacturing and shipping delays for everything from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/developers-and-designers-can-help-businesses-manage-the-semiconductor-shortage/">semiconductors</a> to <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/11/5/22764088/supply-chain-shipping-delays-logistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting a ship into the port</a>.</p>
<p>Veho wants to make the delivery experience so awesome that it facilitates trust between the consumer and e-commerce company so that consumers return to order again. Zur notes this is already happening, citing that its customers, which range from selling apparel and accessories to food and packaged goods, saw a 20% increase in customer repurchase, 40% increase in customer lifetime value and an eight-point increase in net promoter score compared to customers who received their box from a traditional shipping company.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kyle Doherty, managing director at General Catalyst, said there is room for more companies going after an <a href="https://www.the-future-of-commerce.com/2021/08/03/post-pandemic-e-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$800 billion e-commerce market</a>, of which <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272391/us-retail-e-commerce-sales-forecast/#:~:text=The%20eCommerce%20market%20encompasses%20the,such%20as%20smartphones%20and%20tablets." target="_blank" rel="noopener">half stems from the U.S</a>., and that is forecasted overall to grow around $100 billion each year.</p>
<p>Like Zur, Doherty had his own frustrations receiving packages at his home in San Francisco, which he said is notorious for <a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/san-francisco-2nd-worst-u-s-city-for-package-theft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having problems with package thefts</a>.</p>
<p>“You feel helpless and that you’ve lost control of the situation,” he added. “We have had a front-row seat to the dramatic acceleration in the use of e-commerce and a stressed supply chain. We had a belief that computer technology would enable logistics providers to provide a better experience. When I was introduced to Ita, I got it instantly. He also has empathy for merchants and consumers about the consumer experience, and that stood out on many fronts.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.liveflow.io/">LiveFlow</a> has raised a $3.5M Seed round which was led by Moonfire Ventures with backing from Y Combinator, Seedcamp and WndrCo.  Also participating was Victor Jacobsson, co-founder of Klarna; Bradley Horowitz, former VP Product at Google; Oliver Jung, former VP International Expansion at AirBnB, Phillip Chambers, Peakon founder &amp; CEO, and others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some 55 billion parcels are shipped in bubble wrap every year. Plastic bubble wrap is reliant on fossil fuels and 98% of plastic packaging is single-use. You can imagine the adverse environmental impact of all this plastic.</p>
<p>The founders of <a href="http://woola.io">Woola</a> were running an online e-commerce store and saw the packaging problem first-hand. The lack of options in sustainable and scalable protective packaging led to them re-discovering wool — an unused resource that is elastic and regulates temperatures and humidity.</p>
<p>The result was their startup, which uses leftover sheep wool to replace bubble wrap. These wool-based packages can be reused, repurposed, or returned by the end-user, with the ultimate goal of making the solution ‘closed-loop’ so nothing goes to waste.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250179" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Woola opened a production facility in Estonia and launched its first product in December 2020. Wool envelopes were the first products to hit the market. It’s now expanding to the UK, France and Germany. The next product rolling out in January 2022 is targeted at beverage companies.</p>
<p>They’ve now a raised €2.5M Seed round led by Future Ventures. Future is joined by co-investors Kaarel Kotkas (CEO at Veriff), Janer Gorohhov (Co-founder at Veriff), Kristina Lilleõis (VP of People at Veriff), Zem Joaquin (founder of Near Future Summit), Bryan Meehan (executive chair of Blue Bottle Coffee). Woola’s previous investors include the co-founders of Pipedrive, Bolt and the angel fund Lemonade Stand.</p>
<p>“Bubble wrap has been dominating the packaging industry for ages – but its decline is inevitable,” said Woola’s CEO and co-founder Anna-Liisa Palatu. “The industry is broken for two reasons: fossil fuel reliance and single-use mindset. We need to get rid of both to make packaging more sustainable.” She is joined by co-founders Jevgeni Sirai and Katrin Kabun.</p>
<p>Steve Jurvetson from Future Ventures commented: “While e-commerce is booming, single-use plastic packaging is out of control. Woola can replace it all with beautiful envelopes made from scrap wool that would otherwise be burned or buried. The world needs sustainable alternatives to the petrochemical economy for a healthier future.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sheep wool is an unused resource – more than 200,000 tonnes of wool is thrown away in Europe yearly. Woola says this is enough to fulfill 120% of the global bubble wrap demand.</p>
<p>The startup will compete with whitelabel plastic bubble wrap and alternatives like Ranpak and S-Packaging.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment &#8212; which co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://za.linkedin.com/in/eerik&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjV-56z1_P0AhVF14UKHXxhDg8Qjjh6BAgDEAE&amp;usg=AOvVaw2BvAbzxJKTZ_UKLgOTiCX1">Eerik Oja</a> called a bridge round &#8212; is a prequel to a larger Series A round next year. It comprises</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $6 million equity and $24 million in debt financing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company raised $2.4 million in a seed round in June 2020 and followed it with $10 million in debt from emerging markets-focused <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/emerging-markets-lender-lendable-seeks-100m-to-fund-fintech-companies/amp/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi47a7L1_P0AhUkxIUKHWjwC3sQFnoECBgQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw3MmURVyrRSRpMST5nAYFVz">venture debt fund Lendable</a> in December. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund doubled its participation in this recently raised debt round at $20 million, while other investors completed the rest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249946" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naspers, through its early-stage investment vehicle, <a href="https://www.naspers.com/foundry">Naspers Foundry</a>, led the equity round with $3.4 million. Existing investors include Change Ventures, the lead investor from Planet42’s seed round, as well as Startup Wise Guys, Martin and Markus Villig of Bolt, and Ragnar Sass of Pipedrive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planet42, though based in South Africa, has Estonian roots due to the founders’ heritage: Oja and CFO <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://ee.linkedin.com/in/marten-orgna&amp;ved=2ahUKEwixy86k2PP0AhVBzRoKHc3aCrcQjjh6BAgIEAE&amp;usg=AOvVaw1u7QGEe_NBaeXmQ_gVyHT_">Marten Orgna</a> founded the company in 2017</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In an interview, Oja mentioned that they created the car subscription model to cater to private individuals ignored by South African banks when they need vehicle financing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our car subscription [model] is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">socially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> inclusive. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For us, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">differentiating factor is our customers would not have a car without us,” Oja said, adding that because the company is buying second-hand cars, the unit cost is lower compared to a subscription model that purchases new cars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be challenging to get a personal car in most emerging markets, especially if one’s income isn’t stable. And without a good credit history, lenders tend to ignore people with bad credit or give them unfavorable interest rates for vehicle financing.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planet42 is one of the few upstarts focused on the African market tackling this inequality via a car subscription offering</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company claims to use proprietary scoring algorithms superior to traditional credit scores in assessing risk in underbanked customer segments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has over 700 dealerships. And with its algorithms, customers can find out what budget suits them and choose new or pre-owned cars from Planet42’s dealerships network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, Planet42 buys the car and rents it out to the customer on a subscription basis. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planet42 claims that of all the customers served so far, 89% would have had no other means of gaining access to a personal vehicle</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve gotten so good with our scoring that we can now enable the customers who couldn’t get bank financing to get a brand new car</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We have figured out a way how to do it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sustainably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that we can put entry-level brand new cars in the hands of the same target market and customers who are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unfairly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ignored by banks,” the chief executive said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four years later and $50 million in equity and debt raised later, Planet42 has listed more than 7,000 cars to customers in South Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This number was 3,000 when Oja spoke with TechCrunch in March, and he noted that the company grew 25% month on month in 2021</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

While Moove focuses on financing ride-hailing cars, Planet42 and Autochek services </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are targeted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at private individuals. Planet42 has a cohesive network of automobile industry stakeholders on its platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Moove and Autochek have made inroads into other African countries after </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">initially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launching from Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for Planet42, the next attractive market lies off the continent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not doing it right now, but we’re not ruling it out for the future,” Oja answered on whether Planet42 would expand into other parts of Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the main reason is market size. South Africa has like 25% of all the passenger cars on the African continent; that means that whatever market we go next in Africa will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be smaller than South Africa. In South Africa, 1.1 million second-hand cars get sold and bought every year. In Mexico, that number is 7 million. So the Mexican market is six times larger than South Africa. So we want to go for the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> big markets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said it has bought its first cars for clients in Mexico. Similar challenges stemming from transport inequality abound in the country, where 63% of the population deal with only cash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Mexico is one of the few countries Planet42 plans to expand to in the foreseeable future, said Oja, who also said that the company has set up an office and employed two staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the company hopes to have bought over 1 million cars for its customers across its present and future markets by 2025. Planet42 said it has also made strides in becoming a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/why-south-africa-based-car-subscription-company-planet42-is-going-carbon-neutral/amp/">carbon-neutral company</a> via a wind farm project in Northern Cape, South Africa. The car subscription company financed the farm for months with money from carbon offset credits.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snapdeal filed for an initial public offering on Tuesday, joining a number of firms in India that have tapped the public market this year.</p>
<p>The New Delhi-based startup, which counts SoftBank among its backers, said in its draft prospectus that it will issue fresh shares worth $165 million. Some of its existing investors including SoftBank, Sequoia Capital India and Foxconn plan to sell as many as 30.7 million secondary shares in the IPO.</p>
<p>The 11-year-old firm, which once competed with Amazon and Flipkart in India, has lost considerable market share in recent years and shifted focus to serve consumers in smaller cities and towns.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250228" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Snapdeal, which has raised over $1.7 billion to date (according to Crunchbase and Tracxn) says more than 50 million unique customers have shopped at least once on its platform since April 2018. &#8220;75%+ of our business comes from repeat customers. More than 70% of our sales are from beyond Tier 2 towns and cities and 99% of our orders come via mobile phones. And we cover 96% of the pin codes in the country. Our users browse and connect with us in seven languages, beyond Hindi and English,&#8221; co-founder and chief executive Kunal Bahl (pictured above) <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/who-buys-from-snapdeal-kunal-bahl/">wrote</a> in recent LinkedIn post.</p>

<p>The shift in focus came after months-long talks to merge the business with Flipkart <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/31/flipkart-flipdeal-snapdeal-snapdead/">didn&#8217;t materialize in 2017</a>.</p>
<p>In its prospectus today, Snapdeal said it generated an operating revenue of $31.9 million in six months ending in September.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More than half a dozen consumer-focused Indian startups have filed for an IPO this year. While some including Zomato and Nykaa have made stellar debuts, others including Paytm, which filed for the nation&#8217;s largest IPO, has consistently performed below its issue share price. Insurance aggregator PolicyBazaar has also lost all its IPO gains.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Morris Jr., founder and managing partner of the L.A.-based venture firm <a href="https://chapterone.com/en/">Chapter One</a>, just closed a $40 million early-stage fund to focus on web3 investments, and he&#8217;s in the process of raising a separate, $20 million opportunity fund.</p>
<p>Even in this go-go market, where digital assets are suddenly top of mind for everyone, the achievements are notable for someone who hasn&#8217;t been a VC for all that long and is a solo general partner.</p>
<p>To learn more about his path in building Chapter One &#8212; which is small but growing and counts new hires from both Facebook and Stripe &#8212; we talked recently with Morris Jr., who focused on product and revenue at Tinder for four years until leaving in late 2019. We wondered what there is to learn about how an operator transitions into a full-time investing role; he suggested that a lot of it comes down to hustle and luck and social media savvy, both to build an audience and, more than ever, to track down hot deals.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250152" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Indeed, like a lot of investors, Morris Jr. got his start by writing checks on the side of his full-time job. Specifically, in 2016, aided in part by the sheen of Tinder, he wound up putting together one of the larger syndicates on the AngelList platform, where he says he went on to raise 15 special purpose vehicles.</p>
<p>Some of those companies have broken out since, including Density, a startup developing people-counting, AI-powered sensors that last month announced <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/10/density-which-provides-occupancy-tracking-sensors-to-companies-raises-125m/">$125 million</a> in funding at a post-money valuation of  $1.05 billion.</p>
<p>Deals didn&#8217;t automatically find their way to Morris, Jr., he says. He built a network by digging into Twitter to build an online audience (he has nearly 106,000 followers); he also messaged a whole lot of people who he saw were backing other people&#8217;s syndicates on AngelList.</p>
<p>Along the way, he began seeing more and more crypto deals that he wanted to fund. There were so many of these, in fact, that at some point, he says, he began to run out of enough capital to invest. By his telling, a role with Index Ventures materialized around that same time and he became a scout for the powerhouse firm, investing in a handful of seed rounds, including Dapper Labs, a blockchain company behind the popular NFT game &#8220;NBA Top Shot&#8221; that&#8217;s currently valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/nba-top-shot-creator-dapper-labs-raises-another-250-million/">$7.6 billion</a>, and the centralized finance platform Compound Labs, whose <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/price/compound">native token</a> has already returned many millions of dollars to early investors in the outfit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Armed with those wins &#8212; he says that particular scout fund for Index wound up being marked up by more than 30x &#8212; Morris Jr. set out to raise his own fund. At first, he hopped back on AngelList, raising $1 million from the first related email he sent to prospective investors, he says. Feeling emboldened, he quit his job at Tinder and decided to invest full time.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it very much seems the right move. That debut fund went on to raise $10 million altogether, and the momentum has built from there. In perhaps the most critical development for Morris Jr., Chapter One&#8217;s newest fund has garnered commitments from some of the numerous multistage venture firms that now invest substantial dollars in emerging managers in order to get more exposure to founders they might miss otherwise.</p>
<p>In Chapter One&#8217;s case, the limited partners that are providing some of capital include Sequoia Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, Kleiner Perkins, and Bain Capital. Acting in a personal capacity, Marc Andreessen and Chris Dixon of a16z are also investors in Chapter One&#8217;s new fund. (Asked why Index is not also an investor, he says they don&#8217;t invest directly in other managers&#8217; funds.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uYhUDrysi4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/variant-debuts-a-new-110m-fund-for-crypto-startups-announces-li-jin-has-joined-as-a-general-partner/">Variant debuts a new $110M fund for crypto startups, announces Li Jin has joined as a general partner</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Variant debuts a new $110M fund for crypto startups, announces Li Jin has joined as a general partner&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/variant-debuts-a-new-110m-fund-for-crypto-startups-announces-li-jin-has-joined-as-a-general-partner/embed/#?secret=uYhUDrysi4" data-secret="uYhUDrysi4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That kind of network certainly helps when Chapter One is in a competitive situation. What bigger boast can a seed-stage manager make than to explain he has inroads into the biggest venture firms in the world?</p>
<p>There is also the potential for conflict, presumably, which is maybe the point. Asked who among Chapter One&#8217;s venture backers gets to see its deals first, Morris Jr. says he has structured things in such a way that &#8220;everybody gets the same information at the same time.&#8221; He then adds that for some deals, he defers to founders who want him to &#8220;sequence those intros,&#8221; as well as advises them based on what he knows about each firm&#8217;s &#8220;taste.&#8221; It&#8217;s very &#8220;case by case,&#8221; and a &#8220;bit of a curation exercise.&#8221; he says, &#8220;where you know which partners at which funds will be attracted to specific types of companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for where Chapter One is shopping, because of Morris Jr.&#8217;s success to date with companies like Dapper and Compound Labs, the firm is pushing the pedal to the metal on web3 products and platforms, with five bets from the new fund already across DAO infrastructure, NFT experiences, and learn-to-earn games. (The most famous of these types of games is &#8220;Axie Infinity,&#8221; but a growing number of them is emerging and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/studio-behind-early-access-crypto-game-blankos-block-party-banks-monster-1-25b-valuation-from-a16z/">capturing VC dollars</a>.)</p>

<p>On this front, Morris Jr. says there are numerous reasons founders who are moving into the space might want to talk with Chapter One. He says, for example, that Chapter One intends to spend much of 2022 building out support services, including a media arm focused on web3 education, and resources for developers who are looking to better understand token usability and governance and how to create digital assets that are equitable for the communities to which they cater.</p>
<p>When it comes to finding those founders in the first place, Morris Jr. points back to his use of social media, saying that large Twitter presence helps, but so does logging time elsewhere online.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s a member, most importantly, of &#8220;hundreds of Discord groups,&#8221; noting that &#8220;the more you participate in the community, the more you meet interesting people. It&#8217;s like going to a great conference.&#8221;&#8216;</p>
<p>For web3 investors, he adds, &#8220;It’s the new way of networking.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2019, when LinkedIn began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/09/linkedin-real-name-phone-number-verification-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asking for Chinese users&#8217; phone numbers</a>, it was clear that the professional social network would have to follow a different set of rules in the country. But it realized simply setting up the real-name verification regime required by Chinese authorities wasn&#8217;t enough; it faced a mounting task of balancing censorship demand and upholding its &#8220;Western value&#8221; that extols freedom of expression.</p>
<p>The solution was to retreat. This past October, Microsoft announced it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/microsoft-to-pull-linkedin-from-chinese-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bring an end to LinkedIn&#8217;s Chinese version</a> &#8212; which still functioned largely the same as the &#8220;global&#8221; one barring, extra requirements like cell number verification. On December 13, Microsoft <a href="https://blog.linkedin.com/2021/december/linkedin-s-new-app-to-help-professionals-in-china-find-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced a LinkedIn alternative called InCareer </a>on China&#8217;s App Store and third-party Android stores. Focusing on jobs, the new app bears the facade of LinkedIn but lacks its social feed and content posting option, which would otherwise require content monitoring efforts by Microsoft&#8217;s team in China. InCareer still keeps the messaging feature.</p>
<p>In a blog <a href="https://blog.linkedin.com/2021/october/14/china-sunset-of-localized-version-of-linkedin-and-launch-of-new-injobs-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a>, LinkedIn explained its move:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249702" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p>While we’ve found success in helping Chinese members find jobs and economic opportunity, we have not found that same level of success in the more social aspects of sharing and staying informed. We’re also facing a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements in China.</p></blockquote>
<p>Microsoft is not the only foreign tech giant that has pulled its service from China. In recent years, China has introduced a slew of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/china-roundup-data-security-clampdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new cyber regulations</a> to rein in everything from how much data internet firms can collect to how they move data across borders. Yahoo, TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/as-yahoo-leaves-china-an-accelerating-stream-of-exits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exited China</a> citing an &#8220;increasingly challenging business and legal environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>China-based users with the LinkedIn app are now <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a544167" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prompted to download InCareer</a>, though they can still access the full version of the social network via a web browser and VPN. But these extra fences are set to drive users away from a platform that already had limited reach in the country.</p>
<p>LinkedIn was popular mostly among expats and Chinese users working at multinationals or cross-border businesses, while its local competitor Maimai has more prominence. In April, Maimai accounted for 91% of the time Chinese users spent on professional social networking apps, according to <a href="https://www.iresearch.com.cn/m/Detail/report?id=3825&amp;isfree=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market research firm iResearch</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s other surviving service in China, Bing, also ran into a hitch recently. The search engine became inaccessible in China on December 18, according to user reports and <a href="https://en.greatfire.org/bing.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greatfire.org</a>, though it appeared to have come back online as of December 20. TechCrunch has reached out to Microsoft regarding the situation.</p>
<p>The incident also coincided with Bing&#8217;s suspension of its search autofill feature in China for 30 days &#8220;under PRC laws,&#8221; according to a <a href="https://cn.bing.com/cnlegal?mkt=zh-CN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notice</a> posted by the search engine provider. It&#8217;s unclear what laws the site was referring to.</p>
<p>Bing was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/microsoft-confirms-bing-is-down-in-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> briefly down in China in 2019</a> when its indigenous rival Baidu&#8217;s reputation took a hit. At the time, speculation was rife that Baidu users migrating to Bing in droves might have crashed the American site.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon to see foreign tech companies playing catch-up with Chinese laws after being left alone for years. Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/01/china-roundup-apple-closes-app-store-loophole/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initiated a wave of crackdown</a> on unlicensed mobile games from its Chinese App Store years after the relevant regulation took effect. The Bing suspension might well be a similar case where the search engine, which had long been under the radar in China because few people used it, was finally ordered to close the loophole &#8212; autofill suggestions that could get on the censors&#8217; nerves.</p>
