										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Justice Department&#8217;s historic lawsuit against <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is moving along — albeit very, very slowly. In a status hearing Friday, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta set a tentative date for the case. The good news and the bad news for both parties involved is that it&#8217;s more than two years away.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/doj-case-against-google-likely-wont-go-to-trial-until-late-2023-judge-says.html">CNBC reports</a>, Mehta chose Sept. 12, 2023 as the first day of the trial, which is expected to last weeks. That date could change, but with both the Justice Department and Google agreeing to that timeline it&#8217;s a pretty good estimate.</p>
<p>It might be years before the trial, but the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1328941/download">DOJ&#8217;s lawsuit</a> against Google, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/justice-department-will-reportedly-file-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-today/">filed in October</a>, is already hanging over Silicon Valley&#8217;s head. The suit focuses on Google&#8217;s search and ads business and accuses the company of maintaining illegal monopolies in those markets. A date in 2023 gives Google plenty of time to sharpen its defenses and do what it wants until then, but it also means the specter of a major regulatory threat will loom large for the foreseeable future.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>States are also pursing their own aggressive efforts to regulate the search giant, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/google-antitrust-lawsuit-new-york-colorado-35-states-search/">two</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/google-state-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-paxton/">separate</a> major multistate lawsuits similarly focused on Google&#8217;s search and advertising power filed this week. Last week, the state of California also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/california-asks-to-join-doj-lawsuit-against-google.html">asked to join</a> the Justice Department&#8217;s lawsuit, with <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/three-additional-states-ask-court-join-justice-department-antitrust-suit-against-google">Michigan and Wisconsin</a> following suit on Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their proposed joinder, along with the separate complaint filed today by a coalition of state Attorneys General, underscores the broad and bipartisan consensus that Google’s practices in search and search advertising need antitrust redress,&#8221; Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen said of the states deciding to join the suit.</p>
<p>The historic case is the first major federal antitrust action to hit a technology company since the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/11/u-s-v-microsoft-timeline/">U.S. pursued a case against Microsoft</a> more than two decades ago. That case was settled in 2001, just three years after Google&#8217;s founding.</p>
<p>With few regulations in place to rein it in, the tech industry exploded over the course of the last twenty years. Silicon Valley&#8217;s innovations are now woven into every market and corner of society imaginable, making the era of the Microsoft antitrust saga looks downright quaint in comparison.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What&#8217;s next? That&#8217;s the question we ask ourselves here at TechCrunch every day for the past 15 years. The answer, more often than not, comes from the earliest stage founders. That&#8217;s why last year, we introduced a new event called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-sf-2020/">TechCrunch Early Stage</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/">TC Early Stage</a> is all about providing founders access to the top experts across all the core competencies involved in entrepreneurialism, from fundraising to marketing to operations. It quickly became one of the most beloved offerings from TechCrunch, so it should come as no surprise that we&#8217;re doubling down in 2021.</p>
<p>Next year, we&#8217;ll host two TC Early Stage events (virtually) one <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/">on April 1 &amp; 2</a> and one on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-2/">July  8 &amp; 9</a> with different perspectives and content at each.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>
<p>Experts in fundraising, marketing and operations will give presentations to the audience with plenty of time for live Q&amp;A. These workshops will span the entire startup experience, with speakers that include early-stage investors (lots of investors), legal whizzes, growth gurus, product-market fit wallahs, tech stack experts, recruiting aces and much more, including workshops on pitch breakdowns.</p>
<p>TechCrunch’s goal is to provide founders with insights and new relationships on par with what an accelerator experience provides, only in a single day, and with a much greater variety of experts and investors.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/">TC Early Stage</a> is designed for founders who are in their early innings, anywhere from pre-seed through Series A, when entrepreneurs need all the guidance they can get. With that in mind, the event’s heart is dozens of breakout sessions run by experts and curated by TechCrunch editors. The breakouts will be long on attendee questions and conversation, and the event is structured so that attendees can easily get to six to eight different breakouts over the course of the day.</p>
<p>Last year, we had sessions on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/how-to-time-your-series-a-fundraise/">&#8220;When It Comes To Fundraising, Timing Is Everything&#8221;</a> with Jake Saper</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/10/seed-funding-tips-and-tricks-from-uncork-capital-founder-jeff-clavier/">&#8220;Seed Funding Tips and Tricks&#8221;</a> with Jeff Clavier</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/how-to-get-what-you-want-in-a-term-sheet/">&#8220;What VCs Want In a Term Sheet&#8221;</a> with Lior Zorea</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/red-antlers-emily-heyward-explains-how-to-get-people-obsessed-with-your-brand/">&#8220;How To Get People Obsessed with Your Brand&#8221;</a> with Emily Heyward</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/founders-can-raise-funding-before-launching-a-product/">&#8220;How To Sell An Idea When You Don&#8217;t Have a Product&#8221;</a> with Charles Hudson</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/everything-you-could-possibly-want-to-learn-about-fundraising-will-be-covered-at-tc-early-stage/">&#8220;How To Get Into Y Combinator&#8221;</a> with Dalton Caldwell</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg. We&#8217;re not in the business of reinventing the wheel and have no plans to fix what ain&#8217;t broken. Expect more like this from our 2021 Early Stage events going down on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/">April 1 &amp; 2</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-2/">July 8 &amp; 9</a>. You can get a single event ticket at the Early Bird rate of $199 if you&#8217;re an early stage founder and $299 if you are a later stage founder, investor or just want to add some more tools to your knowledge kit. But you can save more when you book the dual two-event ticket &#8211; there will be different speakers and topics for each event so you won&#8217;t want to miss out on both!</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait to see you there!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While there&#8217;s been plenty of recent debate around the gig economy, Jarah Euston argued that it&#8217;s time to a rethink a bigger part of the workforce — hourly workers.</p>
<p>Euston, who was previously an executive at mobile advertising startup Flurry and a co-founder at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/16/nexla-launches-data-operations-platform-with-3-5-million-investment-at-techcrunch-disrupt/">data operations startup Nexla</a>, told me that although <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2017/home.htm">80 million Americans are paid on an hourly basis</a>, the current system doesn&#8217;t work particular well for either employers or workers.</p>
<p>On the employer side, there are usually high rates of turnover and absenteeism, while workers have to deal with unpredictable schedules and often struggle to get assigned all the hours they want. So Euston has launched <a href="https://www.workwhilejobs.com">WorkWhile</a> to create a better system, and she&#8217;s also raised $3.5 million in seed funding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>WorkWhile, she explained, is a marketplace that matches hourly workers with open shifts — employers identify the shifts that they want filled, while workers say which hours they want to work. That means employers can grow or shrink their workforce as needed, while the workers only work when they want.</p>
<p>&#8220;By pooling the labor force &#8230; we can provide the flexibility that both sides want,&#8221; Euston said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2089300" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089300" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2089300" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4.jpg?w=314" alt="WorkWhile screenshot" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4.jpg 1242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4.jpg?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4.jpg?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4.jpg?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089300" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> WorkWhile</p></div></p>
<p>WorkWhile screens workers with one-on-one interviews, background checks and tests based on cognitive science, with the goal of identifying applicants who are qualified and reliable.</p>
<p>Employers pay WorkWhile a service fee, while the platform is free for users. And because the startup aims to build a long-term relationship with its workforce, Euston said it will also invest by providing additional benefits, starting with sick leave credits earned when you work and next-day payments to your debit cards.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to find a job that works with you and doesn&#8217;t give you a take it or leave it schedule,&#8221; said Michael Zavala, one of the workers on the platform, in a statement. &#8220;WorkWhile was exactly what I was looking for with the ability to create your own schedule for full time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup is launching in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Orange County and Dallas-Forth Worth.</p>
<p>Given the broader economic and employment trends during the pandemic, there should plenty of people looking for more work, while Euston said she&#8217;s seen a &#8220;feast or famine&#8221; situation on the employer side — yes, some companies have had to freeze or cut staff, but others have grown rapidly, including WorkWhile customers including restaurant supplier Cheetah, meal delivery service Thistle and horticultural e-commerce company Ansel &amp; Ivy.</p>
<p>The funding, meanwhile, was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/khosla-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="khosla-ventures">Khosla Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. with participation from Stitch Fix founder and CEO Katrina Lake, Jennifer Fonstad, F7, Siqi Chen, Philipp Brenner, Zouhair Belkoura and Nicholas Plinkington.</p>
<p>&#8220;The majority of hourly workers are honest and reliable but some have difficult personal circumstances they need help with,&#8221; Vinod Khosla said in a statement. &#8220;Companies treat these employees as high turnover and expendable but, if given respect and appropriate support, they can become longer-term, model employees. WorkWhile wants to help solve this problem.&#8221;</p>

<p>That Bumble has privately filed puts it, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/coinbase-files-to-go-public-confidentially-and-were-hyped/">along with the crypto-focused Coinbase</a>, as far along the IPO path before we can see their numbers. When they make their S-1 filings public the two companies will provide the market a look into their financial results.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bumble and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="coinbase">Coinbase <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> are preceded in making such disclosures by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/roblox" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="roblox">Roblox, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/affirm" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="affirm">Affirm, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Poshmark. The five companies will join others in seeking IPOs over the next few months.</p>
<p>According to a recent interview with <a href="https://twitter.com/hanstung?lang=en">GGV&#8217;s Hans Tung</a> &#8212; an investor in Affirm and Airbnb and other unicorns &#8212; TechCrunch understands that quarters one, three, and four in 2021 could prove to be active IPO periods. Bumble joining the fray in the final weeks of 2020 underscores how active the start of the year could be for highly-priced private companies seeking liquidity while public markets trade near all-time highs.</p>

<p>TechCrunch reached out to Bumble for comment on the IPO report. The company declined to comment.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reports that Bumble could target a valuation of between $6 and $8 billion. This squares with prior reporting. How much revenue the market will require of Bumble to reach those prices, and at what pace of growth, is not clear.</p>
<p>But with the company <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90527896/bumble-hits-100-million-users-and-has-new-plans-to-take-over-the-dating-world">reaching 100 million users earlier this year</a>, perhaps all the math will pencil out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile travel app <a href="https://www.hopper.com/">Hopper</a> has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic as consumers canceled their trips and airlines dropped their flights. But the complications around getting airline credits and refunds have since turned into a customer service crisis for the airfare prediction and ticket booking startup, which had been <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-03/hopper-valued-at-750-million-showing-airfare-prediction-pays">valued at $750 million</a> back in 2018 before reaching unicorn status thanks to an undisclosed round it closed amid COVID lockdowns this year. Currently, hundreds of Hopper customers are trashing the app in their app store reviews, calling <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hopper" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hopper">Hopper <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a scam, threatening legal action and warning others to stay away.</p>
<p>The key complaint among many of these users was not only how their flight was canceled by an airline and that they couldn&#8217;t get a refund, but that there was no way to get in touch with someone at Hopper for any help. There wasn&#8217;t even a phone number to call, the user reviews said.</p>
<p>These complaints on the app stores have been harsh and a PR disaster for Hopper&#8217;s brand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To give you an idea of what&#8217;s being said, here&#8217;s a small sampling:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;<em>No phone number to reach and takes a week or more to get back to an email.&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;No way to contact customer service no [one] has responded to my inquiries at all. The help tab just sends you in a constant loop.&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;Warning. This company will take your money. They give zero refunds and there is no one to talk to.&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;Customer service continues to be an absolute joke. We&#8230;put support requests in a week ago, zero response.&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;Hopper is great if you want your flight cancelled and money never refunded. There is LITERALLY no customer support.&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;I understand there is a lot of traffic on the app due to COVID, but having to post a review in order to receive any sort of attention and being unable to reach out through the app for my issue was very frustrating.&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;There is no way to contact anyone. The Contact Us page is just a Q&amp;A page.&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;I was never refunded and when I reached out to their &#8216;need help&#8217; I received the generic email which stated someone will get back with me. I waited a week and sent another message and I still have not heard anything. Hopper took my money on a flight that was cancelled by the airline and never notified me.&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;Not [sic] existing customer support. If you need help your [sic] only option is &#8216;read a post.&#8217; Buyer beware. It&#8217;s a total scam.&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;I&#8217;ve reached out multiple times regarding a flight a credit from April of 2020 and they have yet to provide me with any details or help me with using the credit.&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;This company is a fraud! Do not use Hopper! I will be getting a lawyer!&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say enough bad things about this service&#8230;Have to wait 15 days for response. Unbelievable.&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;I booked a flight back in June that I still haven&#8217;t been refunded for because the airline will only refund the agent directly. Non-existent customer service.&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;I spent over 3K and 3 months later, still no refund.&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;I have been waiting seven months for a refund.&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>To date, users have left more than 550 one-star reviews on iOS and 302 on Android, per Sensor Tower data. Hundreds of these are visible when you sort by &#8220;Most Recent&#8221; reviews on iOS, which is damaging to what had been, before the pandemic, a trusted and respected travel brand.</p>

<p><script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>Hopper, to its credit, openly admitted to TechCrunch it&#8217;s been massively struggling with what it referred to as &#8220;unprecedented volumes of customer support inquiries since the start of the pandemic began,&#8221; or 2.5X its normal rate.</p>
<p>The company says it&#8217;s currently receiving over 100,000 inbound support requests per month, as consumers and airlines alike changed and canceled their flights. Since April, it&#8217;s seen over 980,000 inbound customer service requests.</p>
<p>A number of the inquiries are from customers asking for refunds due to COVID-related cancellations. Typically, airlines offer a modified flight when they make a schedule change, and many consumers will take this modification. Some customers, however, will want a refund so they can rebook a different flight or because they&#8217;ve chosen to cancel their travel plans entirely. The pandemic has exacerbated this problem, driving cancelation rates around five times higher than usual, Hopper says.</p>
<p>Another point of confusion is who should handle these refunds. Hopper says customers can either reach out to the airline directly for a refund for help rebooking or they can ask Hopper to handle it. It also noted a small number of airlines don&#8217;t allow refunds, only travel credit. The airlines dictate <a href="https://help.hopper.com/en/articles/3788336-coronavirus-covid-19-airline-polices">these policies</a>, which means Hopper can&#8217;t just offer to refund everyone &#8212; it would have lost too much money to survive, if it did so.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would have had to put out about half a billion dollars,&#8221; explains Hopper CEO Frederic Lalonde, describing the situation to TechCrunch. We had reached out to understand the situation, given the sizable customer backlash against the previously popular app.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way the airline system works is if I refund you as a customer who booked from us, I&#8217;m not going to get that money back. We would have put ourselves out of business,&#8221; Lalonde says.</p>
<p>In addition, Hopper doesn&#8217;t generally receive the refunds itself. They go directly from the airline to the customer. And many customers<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-airlines-refunds/u-s-airlines-sitting-on-10-billion-owed-to-consumers-for-canceled-flights-lawmakers-say-idUSKBN21Z27O"> had to wait on refunds this year due to COVID issues</a>. But there are some exceptions. For a few <a href="https://help.hopper.com/en/articles/2953256-low-cost-carriers">low-cost carriers</a>, like Frontier, Spirit and others, Hopper does have to process the refund from the airline and then return these to the customers. So in these cases, Hopper&#8217;s non-responses to customer support inquiries left customers without options. (We&#8217;re documenting <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/hopperrefunds-airlinestatement/home">how the airlines are responding to our inquires about Hopper refunds here</a>. It&#8217;s confusing, to say the least.)</p>
<p>But the root of Hopper&#8217;s customer service nightmare wasn&#8217;t the chaos caused by the pandemic and the airlines&#8217; cancellations themselves. It was how Hopper approached handling the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We failed our customers,&#8221; Lalonde admits. &#8220;We had a bunch of people that trusted us.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said Hopper has now addressed many of the customer complaints and issues. But many more still remain. &#8220;There&#8217;s no universe where that&#8217;s what we set out to do,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>During the course of the year as the customer service crisis escalated, Lalonde says his personal email and mobile phone was published on the web. He&#8217;s since opened up several thousands &#8212; or maybe even tens of thousands &#8212; of emails and voicemails of customers in need of assistance.</p>
<p>In hindsight, one misstep Hopper made is that it didn&#8217;t hire more customer service agents to deal with what the pandemic would bring. In fact, Hopper did the opposite &#8212; the company furloughed agents in an effort to cut costs and stay in business. At the time, Lalonde explains, there was just too much uncertainty to hire. Stores were out of toilet paper. The Western world had closed for travel. Vaccines had typically taken years to create. This was looking like a long-term, worst-case scenario.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had to build an operational plan of zero dollars of revenue for four years. That&#8217;s what I gave my board,&#8221; Lalonde says.</p>
<p>When lockdowns lifted and travel started to come back, so did some of Hopper&#8217;s agents. But the customer service issues, by then, had skyrocketed as airlines canceled and changed schedules at high rates, and began to issue Future Travel Credits (FTC). Instead of adding more agents to help solve customer service problems, Hopper decided to apply automation, with a goal of allowing customers to solve more themselves. During the course of 2020, Hopper automated exchanging flights in the app, redeeming FTC issued by airlines, managing schedule changes, adding self-serve cancellations, and it rolled out follow-up emails to customers after they requested a cancellation.</p>
<p>Lalonde had believed automation would ultimately be more critical to long-term survival than hiring more agents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would it have made a big difference [to add more agents]? Honestly, I don&#8217;t really think so. I think it would maybe have gotten 10% more done,&#8221; says Lalonde. &#8220;Could you find thousands of customers that would have gotten [help] sooner? Yes. But would it really have moved the need on the millionth inbound request we got? No.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another area where Hopper fell short was on customer communication.</p>
<p>This is most apparent from the App Store complaints.</p>
<p>Customers may be expressing frustration over refunds, but they&#8217;re even angrier that they can&#8217;t get in touch with anyone. And Hopper didn&#8217;t necessarily do itself any favors here by sending out emails which said it was aiming to get back to customers within 24 hours &#8212; an entirely unrealistic promise. (See below)</p>

<p><div id="attachment_2088381" style="width: 435px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088381" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2088381" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-16-at-7.24.18-PM.jpg?w=425" alt="" width="425" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-16-at-7.24.18-PM.jpg 454w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-16-at-7.24.18-PM.jpg?resize=94,150 94w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-16-at-7.24.18-PM.jpg?resize=188,300 188w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-16-at-7.24.18-PM.jpg?resize=425,680 425w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-16-at-7.24.18-PM.jpg?resize=31,50 31w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088381" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hopper email (provided by customer) / Hopper email (provided by customer)</p></div></p>
<p>Hopper also chose to shut down its phone line when it realized that 80% of customers were waiting on hold for 45 minutes, even though, arguably, some customers would have preferred that to nothing at all. Instead, it rolled out an online structured triage system that helped prioritize incoming complaints. It even had a button to push if users were stuck at the airport so they could get more urgent assistance.</p>
<p>The problem was customers couldn&#8217;t find Hopper&#8217;s<a href="https://help.hopper.com/en/articles/3163002-how-to-contact-customer-service"> help features</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was our communication strategy broken? Yes,&#8221; admits Lalonde.</p>
<p>He says he decided to put the team on actually dealing with the FTC and the refunds, and not talking to people. &#8220;That made us look a hell of a lot worse, optically, but we got through a lot of work&#8230;because at the end of the day, after the fifth repetitive email, people got just as angry [as when they were ignored].&#8221;</p>
<p>Hopper has since <a href="https://mailchi.mp/1ad97b2a9efb/no-one-likes-to-wait-thank-you-for-your-patience-15-travel-credit-on-us?e=782e0b93ab">apologized to customers</a> and sent out an additional $1.5M in travel credits to its customers, in addition to the refunds it has now processed, to help make up for its issues. It&#8217;s still working through the backlog of customer service issues. And it expects another good six months of chaos as the vaccines shipping now aren&#8217;t immediately going to solve the airlines&#8217; travel problem.</p>
<p>Over the next two months, Hopper also says it will be increasing its support team by 75% now that future looks more certain. It also plans to roll out in-app updates including a resolution center, escalation path, status check to prevent duplicate requests, and add in-app structured requests, in addition to more communication updates involving email campaigns, better in-app messaging, and website access to check on booking status.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a wonder how a company in this nightmare situation could even survive, much less raise funds, when its brand is being dragged through the mud and hundreds &#8212; or even thousands of customers &#8212; have been unsatisfied.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Montreal-headquarted Hopper <em>will</em> survive, at least in the near-term, thanks to a Canadian government bailout.</p>
<p>In early May, Hopper raised $70 million from both institutional and private investors. The Canadian government chose to save promising tech business impacted by the pandemic with direct financial support. The largest portion of the $70 million round (more than half, but not, say, 99%) included funds from the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) and Investissement Quebec. In addition, all of Hopper&#8217;s existing investors returned, joined by new investors <a href="https://www.inovia.vc/portfolio">Inovia</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/westcap-sf">WestCap</a>.</p>
<p>The Canadian government &#8212; which Lalonde describes as &#8220;more like socialists than you would think&#8221; &#8212; helped by de-risking the other investors by leading venture rounds into tech businesses that had been doing well pre-pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;They did this at a very large scale and it&#8217;s stabilized the tech sector in Canada,&#8221; he says. The new funds now value Hopper &#8220;right at unicorn level&#8221; in U.S. dollars, Lalonde adds, meaning the business is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)">valued</a> around $1 billion.</p>
<p>One reason why Hopper may have struggled with how to proceed during the pandemic was the sizable uncertainty around the U.S. market, which Lalonde says was &#8220;very scary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We never knew what was going to happen. If there had been a better plan there, we probably would have been able to provision a bit more. But we had no idea. The lockdowns were at the state level,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;If you&#8217;re trying to figure out how aggressive you want to be on investing, spending, emergency injections, or how things are going to recover, the more predictability there is at the government level, the easier it is to make a decision. The U.S. wasn&#8217;t the most predictable environment,&#8221; Lalonde says.</p>
<p>While Hopper&#8217;s business is saved for now, the app&#8217;s brand reputation has taken a huge hit.</p>
<p>The question now is whether that, too, is recoverable?</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; says Lalonde. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you this, the only way that the only right way to approach that is just keep doing the right thing, one customer at a time.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/space-force-commander-explains-how-the-new-military-service-operates-like-a-startup/">The Space Force commander explains how the new military service operates like a startup</a> and gave advice how startups can learn from the Space Force. The service only has 2,400 people and, according to Gen. Raymond, this lean team is possible as he&#8217;s actively working to flatten the management structure and empower decision makers. Likewise, he also explained the current geopolitical landscape, saying, in part, &#8220;China has got from zero to 60 really quickly&#8221; in regards to operating in space. As such, Gen. Raymond is seeking partnerships with allied nations and startups within their borders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The latest branch of the U.S. military was founded just a year ago and will celebrate its first birthday on December 20. General John W. &#8220;Jay&#8221; Raymond spoke at TC Sessions: Space and explained how the youngest military branch operates like a startup.</p>
<p>&#8220;In some ways, we&#8217;re a startup as well,&#8221; Gen. Raymond said. &#8220;The National Defense Authorization Act provided us a great opportunity. And that&#8217;s to be bold, think differently, start with a clean sheet of paper and build processes that work for us as needed to operate in the domain we&#8217;re responsible for.&#8221;</p>

John Raymond explain public-private partnerships for space defense</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Gen. Raymond explained one of his mantras is &#8220;big is slow.&#8221; &#8220;And if you&#8217;re going to be a big organization, you&#8217;re going to be a slower organization,&#8221; he said, explaining that his team has worked hard over the last year to &#8220;flatten the bureaucracy, reduce layers of command, get the experts that are operating our capabilities, close to a decision-maker, or better yet pushed the decision making down to that to their level.</p>
<p>To this end, the Space Force is tiny compared to other branches of the military. Last week, Gen. Raymond presided over the Space Force&#8217;s first basic training graduation. This was a class of seven, who joined the 2,400 servicemen and women who make up the Space Force&#8217;s ranks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t be more thrilled with how our organization construct is played out,&#8221; Gen. Raymond said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to visit a couple of our units where we have done this, and it is already paying dividends. They&#8217;re moving at a speed that we would not have been able to do in the past. I would just say every step though &#8212; every step of the way &#8212; you have to root out bureaucracy and be conscious about making sure that wherever that decision needs to be made, those folks are empowered to make that decision.</p>

		</p>
<p>Since its founding, it&#8217;s been clear the Space Force has taken a strong stance on gender and racial equality. Gen. Raymond explained why: &#8220;We think diversity is a strength.&#8221; This doesn&#8217;t appear just to be lip service. The Space Force has so far received accolades for its gender and racial balance. The Space Force&#8217;s small size allowed Gen. Raymond to stand up a new human capital strategy &#8220;that leverages all the authorities that are out there that are that are currently largely left untapped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have an opportunity to build diversity in from day one, which we think will be a strength,&#8221; Gen. Raymond said.</p>
<p>Several other military officials spoke at TechCrunch Sessions: Space. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/watch-space-forces-lt-gen-john-thompson-speak-on-sourcing-tech-to-secure-space/">Lt. General John Thompson spoke on how startups can best interact with Space Force</a>, where he oversees research, design, development and acquisition of satellites and their associated command and control systems for the U.S. Space Force. The general is the Commander of the Space and Missiles Systems Center.</p>
<p>Dr. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/will-roper" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="will-roper">Will Roper <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> spoke about the evolution of the procurement practices that would put money into the coffers of emerging tech companies developing solutions to the most pressing problems the military sees in the skies. He&#8217;s trying to pry open the piggy bank so more of the $60 billion he manages flows into the bank accounts of entrepreneurs and startups.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The global software as a service (SaaS) industry is sustaining its steep growth trajectory, but developing and pricing professional services is oftentimes a difficult proposition for SaaS companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-07-23-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-revenue-to-grow-6point3-percent-in-2020">Gartner</a> recently forecast that SaaS revenue worldwide could surpass $140 billion by 2022, which would represent a 40% increase over 2019’s roughly $100 billion. These are heady figures for an industry that gained its footing only 20 years ago.</p>
<p>As someone who has led many investments in SaaS companies, there is clear consensus within boardrooms, assuming compelling sales efficiency metrics: The more ARR the better. It is also clear that looking across the SaaS industry, there is strong consistency in overall software gross margins, generally landing in the 60% to 80% range.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			There is clear consensus within boardrooms, assuming compelling sales efficiency metrics: The more ARR the better.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>What is much less obvious is how to charge customers for professional services, whether for implementations, consulting work or training.</p>
<p>While historically, in the perpetual software days, such offerings were billed on a time and materials basis or for a fixed fee with a targeted gross margin of say 10%-30%, fast-forward to the recurring revenue model today and these services can be equally profitable but also result in big losses given wide differences in how companies charge for these services.</p>
<p>Looking at SaaS companies, one can see 50-point margin swings, or more, on services revenue, from -30% to 20%. Why do we see such differences in margins for professional services, and what are the implications of these differing approaches for a SaaS company’s strategy?</p>
<h2>Are professional services a profit center or a loss leader?</h2>
<p>We can start by asking why a company would accept a single-digit or even negative margins on its professional services. For some, it’s a strategy to accelerate its ARR by covering part of that expense by foregoing, say, an implementation fee for a higher annual subscription amount. The view here is to remove some friction out of the sales process by reducing any services fees. This will accelerate new logo velocity, resulting in higher ARR, and thus stronger growth, which should translate into higher stock price appreciation.</p>
<p>To execute this strategy, a SaaS company may increase its subscription price, although not by much. While this allows the provider to offer such services without detailing its cost in a separate line item, is this really the right answer? As with so many questions, the answer depends on many variables, such as: Does it expedite the sales cycle? Would charging for such services make clients more responsive and result in quicker implementations? How much costs do you need to cover such services? What is the impact of doing so on the cash position, profitability and financing needs of the business?</p>
<h2>Two professional services pricing strategies</h2>
<p>Let’s compare the three-year impact of two professional services pricing strategies, and the resulting impact on the financing needs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Company A: </strong>Provides professional services with an annual value of $10 million with a -20% gross margin, resulting in a $2 million annual loss. Total losses over the three-year period are $6 million.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just a few years ago it seemed like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/rocket-lab" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="rocket-lab">Rocket Lab <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was going to be an up-and-comer in the launch world, and so they are today — in addition to going reusable, creating a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/rocket-lab-secretly-launched-its-very-first-satellite-first-light/">low-cost satellite platform</a>, and planning a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/rocketlab-tests-new-hypercurie-engine-that-will-power-its-deep-space-delivery-vehicle/">mission to Venus</a>. CEO and founder Peter Beck, speaking at TC Sessions: Space, talked about how he and the company have taken on ever more responsibilities without burning out.</p>
<p>The company just had a successful launch earlier this week, and a month ago demonstrated its first-ever recovery of an Electron vehicle&#8217;s first stage.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a really great flight, we got way further than we thought, and the stage looks in fantastic condition,&#8221; he said of that accomplishment. &#8220;The next phase for us of this program is to do the mid-air capture with the helicopter, so we don&#8217;t dunk the stage in the water.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Reusable rockets could change the economics for small launch, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The economics of small launch against larger rideshares are always going to be different, because you have a much smaller launch vehicle to amortize your costs over,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;However, this is the reason that small dedicated launch is so valuable, you get your own rocket and all the things that comes with that. But if you can get that and have a platform that&#8217;s closer to rideshare costs, then that&#8217;s really transformational for the industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regarding the loss of a vehicle in July, Beck said that it was tough but not unexpected in this industry.</p>
<p>
		<div class="embed breakout" id="vidible_div_1" data-pid="56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a" data-bcid="564f313b67b6231408bc51ee" data-video="5fdba1bff6a45d2d1fbfac44"></div>

		</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the day that you wish never comes, but it&#8217;s the day that will always come,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The thing about Rocket Lab — this is the magic, right? — no more than seconds after we realized that we had an anomaly on our hands, the team was already working it. It was an incredibly stressful time within the company, and a lot of people were sleeping under their desks, but this is the thing with this team, if you throw something hard at us, we&#8217;re just going to work harder. And that was exactly what happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, Rocket Lab had concluded its investigation to the satisfaction of authorities shortly afterward, and exactly four weeks later had its next launch.</p>

<p>All the while they&#8217;ve been planning an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/rocketlab-tests-new-hypercurie-engine-that-will-power-its-deep-space-delivery-vehicle/">ambitious mission to Venus</a>, which Beck called &#8220;the most underrated planet in our solar system.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I managed to convince the board to hand over a rocket and spacecraft, and we&#8217;re going to go to Venus as a private mission and look for life,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So 2023 is when we&#8217;re going to head on out there and see what we can find.&#8221;</p>
<p>The exact details of the mission and spacecraft will be made more clear in time, but Beck did emphasize that this is a serious undertaking: &#8220;Look, it&#8217;s a no joke mission. I thought the moon was hard — you want to go to Venus, that&#8217;s a whole other level. But the way I view this is, if you have the resources to try, it&#8217;s just unacceptable to not. I don&#8217;t want to leave this planet knowing that I had a chance at answering arguably one of the biggest questions in the universe and didn&#8217;t try.&#8221;</p>
<p>With all these new responsibilities it&#8217;s amazing that Rocket Lab has been able to grow smoothly with no major upsets. Beck explained that while it may look like they&#8217;re just constantly adding new things to the lineup, it&#8217;s all part of a master plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody in Rocket Lab knows the plan. And the plan wasn&#8217;t to just build a launch vehicle, the plan wasn&#8217;t to just build spacecraft, there&#8217;s a much bigger plan here that we&#8217;re all trying to execute on.&#8221; he said. &#8220;I guess it looks like we&#8217;re jumping into lots of different things. A good example is&#8230; there&#8217;s a very good reason why the kick stage looks remarkably similar to a satellite — it&#8217;s because that&#8217;s what was designed on day one. Quite frankly I was shocked that the moment we announced the kick stage everybody didn&#8217;t go, &#8216;oh, Pete&#8217;s building a satellite.&#8217; Internally we have a very clear plan on what we want to try to achieve. If I had to sum up the people that work at Rocket Lab, they&#8217;re just pure executors. The team we&#8217;ve created is just incredible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a clear path and a great team, so we&#8217;re just getting on with it,&#8221; he concluded.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">By now, most of us in tech know that the inherent bias we possess as humans creates an inherent bias in AI applications — applications that have become so sophisticated they’re able to shape the nature of our everyday lives and even influence our decision-making.</p>
<p>The more prevalent and powerful AI systems become, the sooner the industry must address questions like: What can we do to move away from using AI/ML models that demonstrate unfair bias?</p>
<p>How can we apply an intersectional framework to build AI for all people, knowing that different individuals are affected by and interact with AI in different ways based on the converging identities they hold?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Start with identifying the variety of voices that will interact with your model.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Intersectionality: What it means and why it matters</h2>
<p>Before tackling the tough questions, it’s important to take a step back and define “intersectionality.” A term defined by <a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/kimberle_crenshaw">Kimberlé Crenshaw</a>, it’s a framework that empowers us to consider how someone’s distinct identities come together and shape the ways in which they experience and are perceived in the world.</p>
<p>This includes the resulting biases and privileges that are associated with each distinct identity. Many of us may hold more than one marginalized identity and, as a result, we’re familiar with the compounding effect that occurs when these identities are layered on top of one another.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://thetrevorproject.org/">The Trevor Project</a>, the world’s largest suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ youth, our chief mission is to provide support to each and every LGBTQ young person who needs it, and we know that those who are transgender and nonbinary and/or Black, Indigenous, and people of color face unique stressors and challenges.</p>
<p>So, when our tech team set out to develop AI to serve and exist within this diverse community — namely to better assess suicide risk and deliver a consistently high quality of care — we had to be conscious of avoiding outcomes that would reinforce existing barriers to mental health resources like a lack of cultural competency or unfair biases like assuming someone’s gender based on the contact information presented.</p>
<p>Though our organization serves a particularly diverse population, underlying biases can exist in any context and negatively impact any group of people. As a result, all tech teams can and should aspire to build fair, intersectional AI models, because intersectionality is the key to fostering inclusive communities and building tools that serve people from all backgrounds more effectively.</p>
<p>Doing so starts with <strong>identifying the variety of voices that will interact with your model</strong>, in addition to the groups for which these various identities overlap. Defining the opportunity you’re solving is the first step because once you understand who is impacted by the problem, you can identify a solution. Next, <strong>map the end-to-end experience</strong> journey to learn the points where these people interact with the model. From there, there are strategies every organization, startup and enterprise can apply to weave intersectionality into every phase of AI development — from training to evaluation to feedback.</p>
<h2>Datasets and training</h2>
<p>The quality of a model’s output relies on the data on which it’s trained. Datasets can contain inherent bias due to the nature of their collection, measurement and annotation — all of which are rooted in human decision-making. For example, a <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/racial-bias-found-in-a-major-health-care-risk-algorithm/">2019 study</a> found that a healthcare risk-prediction algorithm demonstrated racial bias because it relied on a faulty dataset for determining need. As a result, eligible Black patients received lower risk scores in comparison to white patients, ultimately making them less likely to be selected for high-risk care management.</p>
<p>Fair systems are built by training a model on datasets that reflect the people who will be interacting with the model. It also means recognizing where there are gaps in your data for people who may be underserved. However, there’s a larger conversation to be had about the overall <strong>lack of data representing marginalized people</strong> — it’s a systemic problem that must be addressed as such, because sparsity of data can obscure both whether systems are fair and whether the needs of underrepresented groups are being met.</p>
<p>To start analyzing this for your organization, <strong>consider the size and source of your data to identify what biases, skews or mistakes are built-in and how the data can be improved</strong> going forward.</p>
<p>The problem of bias in datasets can also be addressed by <strong>amplifying or boosting specific intersectional data inputs</strong>, as your organization defines it. Doing this early on will inform your model&#8217;s training formula and help your system stay as objective as possible — otherwise, your training formula may be unintentionally optimized to produce irrelevant results.</p>
<p>At The Trevor Project, we may need to amplify signals from demographics that we know disproportionately find it hard to access mental health services, or for demographics that have small sample sizes of data compared to other groups. Without this crucial step, our model could produce outcomes irrelevant to our users.</p>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>Model evaluation is an ongoing process that helps organizations respond to ever-changing environments. Evaluating fairness began with looking at a single dimension — like race <em>or </em>gender <em>or</em> ethnicity. The next step for the tech industry is figuring out how to best compare intersectional groupings to evaluate fairness across all identities.</p>
<p>To measure fairness, try <strong>defining intersectional groups that could be at a disadvantage and the ones that may have an advantage</strong>, and then <strong>examine whether certain metrics (for example, false-negative rates) vary among them</strong>. What do these inconsistencies tell you? How else can you further examine which groups are underrepresented in a system and why? These are the kinds of questions to ask at this phase of development.</p>
<p>Developing and monitoring a model based on the demographics it serves from the start is the best way for organizations to achieve fairness and alleviate unfair bias. Based on the evaluation outcome, a next step might be to purposefully overserve statistically underrepresented groups to facilitate training a model that minimizes unfair bias. Since algorithms can lack impartiality due to societal conditions, designing for fairness from the outset helps ensure equal treatment of all groups of individuals.</p>
<h2>Feedback and collaboration</h2>
<p>Teams should also <strong>have a diverse group of people involved in developing and reviewing AI products</strong> — people who are diverse not only in identities, but also in skillset, exposure to the product, years of experience and more. Consult stakeholders and those who are impacted by the system for identifying problems and biases.</p>
<p>Lean on engineers when brainstorming solutions. For defining intersectional groupings, at The Trevor Project, we worked across the teams closest to our crisis-intervention programs and the people using them — like Research, Crisis Services and Technology. And reach back out to stakeholders and people interacting with the system to collect feedback upon launch.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there isn’t a “one-size-fits-all” approach to building intersectional AI. At The Trevor Project, our team has outlined a methodology based on what we do, what we know today and the specific communities we serve. This is not a static approach and we remain open to evolving as we learn more. While other organizations may take a different approach to build intersectional AI, we all have a moral responsibility to construct fairer AI systems, because AI has the power to highlight — and worse, magnify — the unfair biases that exist in society.</p>
<p>Depending on the use case and community in which an AI system exists, the magnification of certain biases can result in detrimental outcomes for groups of people who may already face marginalization. At the same time, AI also has the ability to improve quality of life for all people when developed through an intersectional framework. At The Trevor Project, we strongly encourage tech teams, domain experts and decision-makers to think deeply about codifying a set of guiding principles to initiate industry-wide change — and to ensure future AI models reflect the communities they serve.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.mytaprewards.com/">Tap Network</a> is providing a new approach to loyalty rewards programs that it describes as &#8220;rewards as a service.&#8221;</p>
<p>You may recognize the Tap Network name, as well as its co-founder and CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/lin-dai" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="lin-dai">Lin Dai, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> from Hooch, a startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/11/hooch-raises-1-5m-to-expand-its-drink-a-day-subscription-cocktail-app/">offered a drink-a-day subscription service</a> before shifting focus to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/07/hooch-rewards/">a broader rewards program</a>. Dai told me he &#8220;learned a lot from the Hooch experience&#8221; but ultimately &#8220;decided that Tap is a much bigger opportunity, we&#8217;re really looking at rewards in general.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Tap Network is a new startup, one that recently raised $4 million in funding from investors including Revelis Capital, Nima Capital, the Forbes family office, Warner Music Group, Access Industries, Bill Tai, Bob Hurst, Edward Devlin and others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dai said that normal rewards programs are only accessible to the top 10% or 20% of a company&#8217;s customers. So in his view, businesses have an opportunity to &#8220;super serve the average customers who 40 years ago might not have been considered important customers, but who today could be building a loyalty behavior pattern.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2089165" style="width: 463px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089165" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2089165" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/img-1.jpg?w=453" alt="Tap Network" width="453" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/img-1.jpg 457w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/img-1.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/img-1.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/img-1.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/img-1.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089165" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tap Network</p></div></p>
<p>He added that making rewards programs accessible to more customers has an added benefit for many businesses, because &#8220;whether it’s a major bank or major travel company, they are starting to accrue billions of dollars that are locked up in these wallets.&#8221; Those points might never be redeemed, but they&#8217;re still considered liabilities from an accounting perspective.</p>
<p>Tap Network aims to solve this problem by allowing customers to spend those points through a broader network of rewards, which can usually be redeemed at a lower point level. It&#8217;s offered as a white-label addition to an existing rewards program, with each program choosing the rewards that might be the best fit for their customers.</p>
<p>For example, Uber recently worked with Tap Network to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-rewards-expansion-apple-music-hbo-max-140052177.html?guccounter=1">expand its Uber Rewards program</a>, offering new Tap Network-powered rewards like free Apple Music or HBO Max, as well as the option to donate to causes like World Central Kitchen. And the minimum number of points needed to claim a reward fell from 500 points to 100 points.</p>
<p>Other companies using Tap Network include Warner Music Group (which, as previously mentioned, is also an investor) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/24/brave-ads/">privacy-focused browser company Brave</a>.</p>
<p>Dai said that in the future, Tap could even allow consumers to combine rewards points from different programs: &#8220;If I want to redeem something, I might be able to take a little bit of my Uber points, a little bit of my Warner points, a little bit of points from another program,&#8221; and combine them.</p>

<p>He pointed to three things when asked what&#8217;s a good first step for interfacing with the Space Force:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Join the Space Enterprise Consortium (SpEC)</strong>. He describes it as &#8220;a purpose-built consortium that values partnerships between government, traditional industry partners, and non-traditional partners like academia, small businesses and startups&#8221; that&#8217;s grown to more than 440 members in three years.</p>
<p>At the end of the interview, Gen. Thompson notes that he&#8217;s working on expanding the deployment of SpEC&#8217;s funds to reach more &#8220;game-changing technologies that those non-traditional small businesses and startups are bringing to SpEC.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Watch for Space Pitch Days.</strong> The next event is in the spring of 2021. These pitch days give startups an inside track to government contracts. Apparently, after the first event held with the Air Force, which Gen. Thompson hosted, contracts were offered within three minutes of the pitches.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Look into SpaceWERX</strong>; a program launched this December to help Space Force work with private sector companies to field new technology for military applications. Like its Air Force counterpart, this &#8220;werx&#8221; center is a key component for Space Force&#8217;s acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/roper" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="roper">Roper <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> just announced it last week at the Space and Missile System Center,&#8221; Gen. Thompson said, &#8220;[This] is an integral part of the acquisition enterprise of the United States. Space Force is a full partner in the SpaceWERX endeavor. And using the WERX model, we hope to inject more small businesses and startups into our innovation ecosystem.&#8221;</p>

<p>The news comes as a pretty massive blow to DJI. The 14-year-old Chinese company has been an utterly dominant force in the drone category. Here in the States, it commands an estimated 77% of the market.</p>
<p>Increased tensions between the U.S. and China have long been a looming concern for DJI’s presence in the States, with surveillance capabilities being a particular sticking point. Along with their wildly successful consumer drones, DJI also has a wide reach in both industrial and governmental applications. In fact, the company specifically offers a<a href="https://enterprise.dji.com/government"> government line of products</a> as part of its enterprise offerings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>DJI is one of dozens of companies added to the list. Also of note is chipmaker SMIC. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross didn&#8217;t mince words in a statement issued after the list went public:</p>
<blockquote><p>China’s corrupt and bullying behavior both inside and outside its borders harms U.S. national security interests, undermines the sovereignty of our allies and partners, and violates the human rights and dignity of ethnic and religious minority groups. Commerce will act to ensure that America’s technology—developed and produced according to open and free-market principles—is not used for malign or abusive purposes.</p>
<p>China actively promotes the reprehensible practices of forced labor, DNA collection and ubiquitous surveillance to repress its citizens in Xinjiang and elsewhere. Over the last two years this administration has added nearly 50 entities to the Entity List for their support for the Chinese Communist Party’s despicable offensive against vulnerable ethnic minorities. With these new additions, we are applying those principles to the rest of China, including in Tibet, and to the authoritarian regimes to which these practices are being exported.</p></blockquote>
<p>The DOC notably placed Huawei and several of its affiliates on the list last year, a move that has severely hamstrung the hardware giant. Among other things, it’s cut off the company’s access from key U.S. technologies like Google’s Android and other software. Huawei has opted to develop its own operating system, but the landing has been a difficult one to stick.</p>
<p>There’s been a good deal of talk around restricting use of the company’s technology by federal and state departments, but this update could prove even more sweeping. DJI has been bracing for this manner of revelation over the past year and change. The drone maker <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/73687758-f050-11e9-ad1e-4367d8281195">has spent a lot of time</a> and resources lobbying on Capitol Hill. There&#8217;s been a good deal of speculation around the shape these bans will take after a new president is sworn in on January 20.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, DJI was flagged as part of the report&#8217;s focus on &#8220;wide-scale human rights abuse.&#8221; Likely that specifically revolves around issues of &#8220;high-technology surveillance&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>The ERC determined to add the entities AGCU Scientech; China National Scientific Instruments and Materials (CNSIM); DJI; and Kuang-Chi Group for activities contrary to U.S. foreign policy interests. Specifically, these four entities have enabled wide-scale human rights abuses within China through abusive genetic collection and analysis or high-technology surveillance, and/or facilitated the export of items by China that aid repressive regimes around the world, contrary to U.S. foreign policy interests.</p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to DJI for comment.</p>
<p>Competitor Skydio has offered this rather celebratory response to today&#8217;s news:</p>
<blockquote><p>Based apparently on DJI’s support for abhorrent human rights violations, today’s addition of DJI to the entity list sends an unmistakable message: DJI does not share our values and cannot be trusted. DJI had already acknowledged its obligation to share sensitive information collected in the U.S. and around the world with the Chinese Communist Party&#8211;a serious security risk. Now we learn that DJI has profited for years by supporting the suppression of the Uighurs in Xinjiang province&#8211;the world’s most egregious example of human rights abuses. Today’s news also sends an unmistakable signal to the marketplace: companies should think twice about doing business with a known violator of human rights.”</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.creditas.com/">Creditas</a>, the Brazilian lending business, has raised $255 million in new financing as financial services startups across Latin America continue to attract massive amounts of cash.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s credit portfolio has crossed 1 billion reals ($196.66 million) and the new round will value the company at $1.75 billion thanks to $570 million raised in outside financing over five rounds.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/creditas" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="creditas">Creditas <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is the latest company to benefit from a boom in financial services startup investing across the region. As the year dawned, venture investments into fintech startups in Latin America had grown from $50 million in 2014 to top $2.1 billion in 2020 across 139 deals, <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/latin-america-fintech-drivers/">according to a report from CB Insights</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Investors in the round include new investors like LGT Lightstone, Tarsadia Capital, Wellington Management, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/e-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="e-ventures">e.ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and an affiliate of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/advent-international" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="advent-international">Advent International, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Sunley House Capital. Previous investors including SoftBank Vision Fund 1, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/softbank" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="softbank">SoftBank <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Latin America DFund, VEF, Kaszek and Amadeus Capital Partners also returned to put more money into the company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Creditas is still in the early innings of penetrating the huge untapped secured lending market in Brazil and Mexico&#8221; says Paulo Passoni, managing partner of SoftBank Latam fund, in a statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company&#8217;s growth is a testament both to the need for new lending products across Latin America and the perspicacity of investors like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kaszek-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kaszek-ventures">Kaszek Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> whose portfolio has included several massive wins from bets on startups tackling financial services in Latin America.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The journey since our investment in the Series A has been absolutely extraordinary. The team has executed on its vision, and Creditas has evolved into an asset-light ecosystem that resolves key financial needs of its customers throughout their lifetimes,” says Nicolas Szekasy, managing partner of Kaszek Ventures, in a statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another big winner is Redpoint&#8217;s e.ventures fund, which has focused on investments in Latin America for the last several years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;By empowering Brazilians to take control of their lending needs at reasonable rates, Creditas creates a beloved consumer product that will drive significant value for customers and investors. Having been involved since the seed stage through Redpoint e.ventures, we&#8217;re thrilled to support the company with our Global Growth Fund as well, as they change the Brazilian fintech landscape,&#8221; said Mathias Schilling, co-founder and managing partner of e.ventures.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Creditas has plans to use the cash to expand its home and auto lending as well as a payday lending service based on customers&#8217; salaries and a retail option to sell through buy now, pay later loans based on a customer&#8217;s salary.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company is also looking to expand to other markets, with an eye toward establishing a foothold in the Mexican market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Founded in 2012, when the founders worked out of a five-square-meter office on Berrini Avenue in São Paulo, the company now boasts a robust business with hundreds of employees and a business resting on a secured lending marketplace and independent home and auto lending operations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company also released quarterly results for the first time, showing losses narrowing from 74.9 million Brazilian reals to 40.5 million reals in the year ago quarter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zomato" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zomato">Zomato <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has raised $660 million in a financing round that it kicked off last year as the Indian food delivery startup prepares to go public next year.</p>
<p>The Indian startup said Tiger Global, Kora, Luxor, Fidelity (FMR), D1 Capital, Baillie Gifford, Mirae and Steadview participated in the round &#8212; a Series J &#8212; which gives Zomato a post-money valuation of $3.9 billion. Zomato had previously disclosed a fundraise of about $212 million as part of a Series J round from Ant Financial, Tiger Global, Baillie Gifford and Temasek.</p>
<p>Deepinder Goyal, the co-founder and chief executive of Zomato, said the 12-year-old startup is also in the process of closing a $140 million secondary transaction. &#8220;As part of this transaction, we have already provided liquidity worth $30m to our ex-employees,&#8221; he tweeted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup originally anticipated to close a round of about $600 million by January this year, but several obstacles, including the current pandemic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/indias-zomato-raises-100m-from-tiger-global-says-it-is-planning-to-file-for-ipo-next-year/">delayed the fundraise effort</a>. Additionally, Ant Financial, which had originally committed to invest $150 million in this round, only delivered a third of it, Zomato&#8217;s investor Info Edge disclosed earlier this year.</p>

<p>The Gurgaon-headquartered startup, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/20/uber-sells-food-delivery-business-in-india-to-zomato/">acquired the Indian food delivery business of Uber</a> early this year, competes with Prosus Ventures-backed <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/swiggy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="swiggy">Swiggy </a>in India. A third player, Amazon, has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/amazon-launches-food-delivery-service-in-india/">emerged in the market</a>, though it currently offers its food delivery service in only parts of Bangalore.</p>
<p>At stake is India&#8217;s food delivery market, which analysts at Bernstein expect to balloon to be worth $12 billion by 2022, they wrote in a report to clients &#8212; accessed by TechCrunch. With about 50% of the market share, Zomato is the current leader among the three, Bernstein analysts wrote.</p>
<p>Zomato eliminated hundreds of jobs this year to improve its finances and navigate the coronavirus pandemic, which significantly hurt the food delivery business in India in the early months. Goyal said the food delivery market is &#8220;rapidly coming out of COVID-19 shadows. December 2020 is expected to be the highest ever GMV month in our history. We are now clocking ~25% higher GMV than our previous peaks in February 2020.&#8221; He added, &#8220;I am supremely excited about what lies ahead and the impact that we will create for our customers, delivery partners, and restaurant partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>In September, Goyal told employees that Zomato was working for its IPO for “sometime in the first half of next year” and was raising money to build a war-chest for &#8220;future M&amp;A, and fighting off any mischief or price wars from our competition in various areas of our business.”</p>
<p>Making money with food delivery has been especially challenging in India. Unlike Western markets such as the U.S., where the value of each delivery item is about $33, in India, a similar item carries the price tag of $4, according to estimates by Bangalore-based research firm RedSeer.</p>
<p>“The problem is that there are very few people in India who can afford to place an order from a food delivery firm each day,” said Anand Lunia, a venture capitalist at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/india-quotient" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="india-quotient">India Quotient, </a>in an interview with TechCrunch earlier this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">So much for a year-end IPO slowdown.</p>

Let&#8217;s get into the filing!</p>
<h2>Poshmark</h2>
<p>Poshmark is an e-commerce marketplace that allows users to sell new and used fashion-related goods to one another. It sits atop secular trends towards e-commerce over traditional retail, mobile commerce over static and what I would call a cultural rethinking of used goods in recent years.</p>
<p>And of course, Poshmark has braved the economic waves that COVID-19 brought to the global market.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s model is simple: It holds no inventory, instead providing a marketplace where buyers and sellers connect, juiced with an algorithmically built feed of items and an emphasis on digital social interactions. At the end of 2019, the company&#8217;s audience was 83% female and 80% of its members were part of the Gen Z and millennial generations.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not hard to understand how Poshmark makes money, with the company charging 20% of a sale price for goods over $15, or a capped rate for cheaper goods.</p>
<p>In theory, the company has a workable flywheel for growth. Attracting new users via marketing helps it build a deeper user base. Those users generate more social activity and purchases, which, in turn, could bring in more sellers.</p>
<p>That would help keep Poshmark&#8217;s goods selection fresh. Which, could attract even more buyers. More goods and more sales means more revenues for Poshmark&#8230; which can then spend some of the resulting margin back into marketing, kickstarting the process all over again.</p>
<p>But despite that winsome circular updraft, the company has posted regular losses, which means Poshmark has had to outspend its business model to keep its growth up. Until 2020, that is. This year, things turned around in profit-terms for the e-commerce marketplace, ending with the company turning in consecutive profitable quarters.</p>
<p>Poshmark&#8217;s cash generation also improved in 2020, putting it on strong footing heading into its public offering. As with other companies that wound up enjoying a strong 2020 based at least in part on COVID-19 and its resulting economic impacts, investors will have to math out what happens to the company in 2021.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about the company&#8217;s historical growth and how it wound up generating net income this year.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>From the first nine months of 2019 to the same period of 2020, Poshmark grew its revenues 28%, from $150.5 million to $192.8 million. Its profitability, however, swung sharply from a net loss of $33.9 million in the first three quarters of 2019 to net income of $8.1 million during the same period of 2020.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://unfold.com">Unfold</a>, the social media startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/squarespace-acquires-unfold/">acquired by Squarespace</a> last year, is launching a new tool for users to share all the links that are important to them.</p>
<p>This is the first step <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/unfold-ee0f" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="unfold-ee0f">Unfold <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has taken beyond its story-format authoring tools. Co-founder Andy McCune told me that the team has a bigger vision now — just as <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/squarespace" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="squarespace">Squarespace <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has become &#8220;the all-in-one platform for your web presence,&#8221; Unfold aims to become &#8220;the all-in-one platform for your social presence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re both playing in very saturated spaces with a lot of competitors,&#8221; McCune said. &#8220;We both stand out because we appeal to the person that cares about design. That’s always been the North Star.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the case of the new <a href="https://unfold.com/biosites">Bio Sites</a>, he said one of the goals is to help Unfold users — whether they&#8217;re individuals or large brands — become less reliant on a single social media platform. After all, he noted that when you build a following on Instagram, you&#8217;re building on &#8220;borrowed territory,&#8221; and &#8220;you don&#8217;t really own your audience.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2089113" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089113" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2089113" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BioSites_Interface.gif?w=680" alt="Unfold Bio Sites" width="680" height="441" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089113" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Unfold</p></div></p>
<p>By creating a simple profile that highlights the links of your choice, then by linking your Instagram and other social profiles to your Bio Site, you can then point audiences to other channels where you have more control — or at least diversify the platforms that you&#8217;re relying on.</p>
<p>McCune and his co-founder Alfonso Cobo aren&#8217;t the first ones to think of this idea. For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/linktree-raises-10-7m-for-its-lightweight-link-centric-user-profiles/">Linktree raised funding</a> earlier this year, and there are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21443811/social-media-bio-links-business-tiktok-instagram-influencers">other startups creating similar products</a>. But Cobo said Bio Sites benefit from Unfold&#8217;s design-centric approach, allowing users to create simple profiles that aren&#8217;t just functional, but also look great and reflect their personality.</p>
<p>Cobo also noted that Bio Sites are created from the Unfold native app — it&#8217;s launching on Android today, with plans for iOS in January. The feature will be available to all Unfold users, including free users, but subscribers to the premium Unfold+ and Unfold for Brands tiers get additional features like custom URLs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re really going to be expanding in the next few weeks with presence and expressibility tools to help users stand out in different ways,&#8221; Cobo said. &#8220;We&#8217;re also very interested in commerce and will be exploring that route in the future, too.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a return to active launch, constellation satellite operator <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/oneweb" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="oneweb">OneWeb <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has sent 36 new satellites to join its existing spacecraft on orbit. This is the third large batch of OneWeb satellites to be delivered, after an initial launch of six in 2019, and then a second and third launch of 34 satellites each in February and March of this year. The company then ran into financial difficulties that led to its filing for bankruptcy protection in March, before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/oneweb-emerges-from-bankruptcy-aims-to-begin-launching-satellites-again-on-december-17/">emerging from said bankruptcy in July</a> thanks to a deal funded in part by the U.K. government, and in part by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/03/the-uk-government-to-acquire-satellite-company-oneweb-in-deal-funded-in-part-by-indias-bharti-global/">Bharti Global</a>. In short, it&#8217;s <em>been a year</em> for OneWeb.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s launch took off from the Vostochny Cosmodrome, and used a Russian Soyuz-2.1b rocket to make the trip. This is the first-ever commercial launch from Vostochny (prior commercial launches handled by Roscosmos have used the Baikonur Cosmodrome), and it meant that OneWeb could launch 36 satellites instead of 34, because of its position relative to OneWeb&#8217;s target orbit.</p>

<p>OneWeb is building a constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites that will provide high-bandwidth connectivity for use in Earth-based networks. The company aims to ultimately have 648 satellites on orbit, and intends to speed up the pace of its launches in order to achieve its target by 2022, which will enable it to offer global network coverage to its customers.</p>
<p>Getting ramped and operational is key to OneWeb being able to generate revenue from its offering. The company is also competing with major, well-capitalized LEO networks being created by both <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Amazon &#8212; but we heard from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Dave Limp just this past week at TC Sessions: Space that there should be plenty of room for multiple winners in the LEO broadband market, as there&#8217;s no shortage of demand for high-quality connectivity at a global scale.</p>
<p>While OneWeb&#8217;s arrangement with Bharti and the U.K. has helped it emerge from bankruptcy, Bharti founder and chairman Sunil Mittal <a href="https://spacenews.com/oneweb-optimistic-about-raising-the-funding-needed-to-complete-its-constellation/">noted earlier this week</a> that the company will likely need to raise a total of $2.5 billion to finish its constellation &#8212; half of which is provided by the U.K./Bharti consortium.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;ve seen a big wave of proptech startups emerge to reimagine how houses are bought and sold, with some tapping into the opportunity with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/sundae-snags-36m-to-build-out-its-distressed-property-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">distressed property</a>, and others exploring the &#8220;<a href="http://opendoor.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iBuyer</a>&#8221; model where houses are bought and fixed up by a single startup and resold to homeowners who don&#8217;t want to invest in a fixer-upper. But the vast majority of homes are still sold the traditional way, by way of a real estate agent working via a broker.</p>
<p>Today, a startup is announcing that it has raised seed funding not to disrupt, but improve that basic model with a more flexible approach that can help agents work in a more modern way, and to ultimately scale out the number of people working as agents in the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.avenue8.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Avenue 8</a>, which describes itself as a &#8220;mobile-first residential real estate brokerage&#8221; &#8212; providing a new set of tools for agents to source, list and sell homes, and handle the other aspects of the process that fall between those &#8212; has raised $4 million. This is a seed round, and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/avenue-8" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="avenue-8">Avenue 8 <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> plans to use it to expand further in the cities where it is already active &#8212; it&#8217;s been in beta thus far in the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas &#8212; as well as grow to several more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is notable because of the backers that the startup has attracted early on. It&#8217;s being led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/craft-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="craft-ventures">Craft Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> &#8212; the firm co-founded by David Sacks and Bill Lee that has amassed a <a href="https://www.craftventures.com/portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prolific and impressive portfolio of companies</a> &#8212; with Zigg Capital and Good Friends (an early-stage fund from the founders of Warby Parker, Harry&#8217;s and Allbirds) also participating.</p>

<p>There has been at <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/5230/proptech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">least $18 billion in funding</a> raised by proptech companies in the last decade, and with that no shortage of efforts to take the lessons of tech &#8212; from cloud computing and mobile technology, through to artificial intelligence, data science and innovations in e-commerce &#8212; and apply them to the real estate market.</p>
<p>Michael Martin, who co-founded Avenue 8 with Justin Fichelson, believes that this pace of change, in fact, means that one has to continually consider new approaches.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;It&#8217;s important to remember that Compass&#8217;s growth strategy was to roll out its technology to traditional brokerages,&#8221; he said of one of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/30/real-estate-platform-compass-raises-another-370m-on-a-6-4b-valuation-en-route-to-an-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">big juggernauts</a> in the space (which itself has seen its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/with-the-real-estate-industry-facing-headwinds-softbank-backed-compass-lays-off-15-of-staff-after/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">challenges</a>). &#8220;But if you built it today, it would be fundamentally different.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="N9hPOD6xFm"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/with-the-real-estate-industry-facing-headwinds-softbank-backed-compass-lays-off-15-of-staff-after/">With the real estate industry facing headwinds, SoftBank-backed Compass lays off 15% of staff</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;With the real estate industry facing headwinds, SoftBank-backed Compass lays off 15% of staff&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/with-the-real-estate-industry-facing-headwinds-softbank-backed-compass-lays-off-15-of-staff-after/embed/#?secret=N9hPOD6xFm" data-secret="N9hPOD6xFm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">And he believes that &#8220;different&#8221; would look not unlike Avenue 8. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The startup is based around a subscription model for a start, rather than a classic 30/70 split on the sales commissions that respectively (and typically) exist between brokers and agents. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Around that basic model, Avenue 8 has built a set of tools that provides agents with an intuitive way to use newer kinds of marketing and analytics tools both to get the word out about their properties across multiple channels; analytics to measure how their efforts are doing, in order to improve future listings; and access to wider market data to help them make more informed decisions on valuations and sales. It also provides a marketplace of people &#8212; valets &#8212; who can help stage and photograph properties for listing, and Avenue 8 doesn&#8217;t require payments to be made to those partners unless a home sells.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It also provides all of this via a mobile platform &#8212; key for people in a profession that often has them on the move. </span></p>
<p>Targeting agents that have in the past relied essentially on using whatever tools the brokers use &#8212; which often were simply their own sites plus some aggregating portals &#8212; Avenue 8&#8217;s pitch is not just better returns but a better process to get there.</p>
<p>“We’ve heard time and time again that agents struggle to identify and leverage the technology and tools to successfully manage their relationships and properties. Changing buyer/seller expectations have accelerated the digital transformation of most agents’ workflows,” said Ryan Orley, partner at Zigg Capital, in a statement. “Avenue 8 is building and integrating the right software and resources for our new reality.”</p>
<p>What&#8217;s also interesting about Avenue 8 is how it can open the door to a wider pool of agents in the longer run.</p>
<p>The real estate market has been noticeably resilient throughout the pandemic, with lower interest rates, a generally lower overall home inventory and people spending more time at home (and wanting a better space) creating a high level of demand. With a number of other industries feeling the pinch, a flexible platform like Avenue 8&#8217;s creates a way for people &#8212; who have taken and passed the certifications needed to become agents &#8212; to register and flexibly work as an agent as much or as little as they choose, creating a kind of &#8220;Uber for real estate agents,&#8221; as it were.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="433H8RQR2a"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/30/real-estate-platform-compass-raises-another-370m-on-a-6-4b-valuation-en-route-to-an-ipo/">Real estate platform Compass raises another $370M on a $6.4B valuation en route to an IPO</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Real estate platform Compass raises another $370M on a $6.4B valuation en route to an IPO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/30/real-estate-platform-compass-raises-another-370m-on-a-6-4b-valuation-en-route-to-an-ipo/embed/#?secret=433H8RQR2a" data-secret="433H8RQR2a" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That scaling opportunity is likely one of the reasons why this has potentially caught the eye of investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Avenue 8&#8217;s organic growth is clear evidence that the market demands a mobile-first, digital platform,” said Jeff Fluhr, general partner at Craft Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;Michael and Justin have a clear vision for modernizing real estate while keeping agents at the center. Avenue 8’s model helps agents take home more even in today’s environment where commissions are compressing.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, just as Uber&#8217;s changed the way that on-demand transportation is ordered and delivered, Avenue 8 is starting to see some interesting traction in terms of its place in the real estate market. Although it was originally targeted at agents with the pitch of being like &#8220;a better broker&#8221; &#8212; providing the services brokers are regulated to provide, but with a more modern wrapper around it &#8212; it&#8217;s also in some cases attracting brokerages, too. Martin said that it&#8217;s already working with a few smaller ones, and ultimately might consider ways of providing its tools to larger ones to manage their businesses better.</p>
