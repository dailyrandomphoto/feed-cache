										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nestled in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521321716/d157488ds1a.htm">Rivian&#8217;s S-1 IPO filings</a> was a note that there the EV company&#8217;s &#8220;cornerstone investors&#8221; had &#8220;indicated an interest&#8221; in buying up to $5 billion worth of its stock at its IPO price. One of those parties was Amazon, and the American e-commerce giant appears to have pulled the trigger Friday afternoon on its buy.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001018724/000089924321044350/xslF345X03/doc4.xml">recent Form 4 filing</a>, Amazon bought roughly $200 million worth of Rivian stock at its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/electric-automaker-rivian-largest-ipo-2021/">IPO price of $78 per share</a>. The buy worked out to 2,564,102 shares in total, worth a hair under the target dollar amount of a flat two hundred million at their purchase price.</p>
<p>Amazon now owns a total of 158,363,834 shares of Rivian, valued at some $20,579,380,228.3 at the company&#8217;s closing price of $129.95 per share set this afternoon. As Amazon paid just $78 per share for its most recent tranche of Rivian stock, the company has already seen upside of more than $133 million on the purchase.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233688" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In percentage terms, Amazon&#8217;s latest purchase of Rivian stock at its IPO price works out to just 1.6% of its total stake in the company, after its various pre-IPO holdings and warrants converted to Class A shares in the company now that it is publicly traded. When considering its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/amazon-reveals-20-stake-in-rivian-ahead-of-ev-makers-ipo/">previous ownership</a>, Amazon now owns about 22% of Rivian.</p>
<p>Rivian&#8217;s IPO has been a blockbuster event, raising an ocean of capital for the EV company and boosting its market cap into the stratosphere. Yahoo Finance <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RIVN/">indicates</a>, for example, that Rivian is worth north of $127 billion today at the close of the week&#8217;s trading cycle.</p>
<p>Given that Rivian built just 12 cars in Q3, the company is worth around $10 billion per manufactured unit from its last reporting period. That ratio will fall in coming quarters, but underscores just how much of Rivian&#8217;s valuation is predicated on future results, and not past performance.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Let’s examine a series of winning fintech results from BNPL, consumer finance, proptech and corporate finance before turning to fintech's earnings misses from Q3 2021.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startup investors around the world are pouring capital into fintech startups. With good reason, it appears, if third-quarter earnings from public companies in the sector are any indication.</p>
<p>Earnings reports released this week show a host of fintech players with strong operating results, both delighting investors and boosting share prices. For private companies, seeing their public champions do well is more than simply encouraging; strong results from their comps could help upstarts continue to attract venture capital.</p>
<p>It’s shaping up to be fintech’s year, both in the public and private markets. After raising a record total of $52.9 billion in 2018, global fintech companies saw their private investment plateau in both 2019 ($46.5 billon) and 2020 ($48.4 billion), according to <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q3-2021/">data collected by CB Insights</a>. But this year, global fintech startups raised $94.7 billion through Q3.</p>
<p>That wave of capital has borne a host of new unicorns, as investors wager that there’s ample growth ahead for fintech companies generally. Meanwhile, third-quarter results from companies like Affirm, SoFi and Marqeta support the view that the sector still has a way to go in filling white space, coloring over incumbents and aging systems.</p>
<p>Let’s examine a series of winning fintech results from BNPL, consumer finance, proptech and corporate finance players. After parsing those results and relating what they may mean for startups in those subsectors, we’ll discuss fintech earnings misses from Q3.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Hint:</strong> Trading incomes that were once the toast of the fintech market caused more than a few companies to stumble when they released their recent operating results.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Consumer lending is strong</h2>
<p>Public buy now, pay later (BNPL) company Affirm beat investor expectations in <a href="https://investors.affirm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/affirm-reports-fiscal-year-2022-first-quarter-results">the most recent quarter</a>, which is the first quarter of its fiscal 2022. And the recently listed fintech raised its guidance for its current fiscal year.</p>
<p>Affirm saw active consumers of its BNPL offering grow 124% to 8.7 million during the quarter, and the number of transactions per active consumer increased 8% to 2.3. But where it saw real growth was in the number of active merchants on its platform, which increased from 6,500 to 102,000 thanks to the adoption of Shop Pay Installments by merchants on Shopify.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back when most commerce took place on the local high street, shoppers who exchanged personally identifiable information with merchants received something in return.</p>
<p>Shops kept track of customers&#8217; hat, shoe and dress sizes, along with their birthdays, anniversaries and personal preferences. In return, buyers got a first look at new products and service that anticipated their wants — personalized shopping.</p>
<p>For most of the internet era, that work was performed with tools like browser cookies and tracking pixels, but consumer desire for greater privacy (and increased regulation) is forcing online marketers to rethink basic practices.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233463" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>What if instead of surreptitiously tracking our behavior, they just asked us for relevant details?</p>

<p>&#8220;Think of the kind of things you’d tell a store associate helping you find the right gifts to purchase for your family,&#8221; says Ben Parr, president and co-founder of Octane AI. &#8220;That’s zero-party data.&#8221;</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/collect-and-leverage-zero-party-data-to-personalize-marketing-and-drive-growth/">a highly detailed post with multiple examples</a>, he shares methods for collecting zero-party data that will engage customers and drive higher conversions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just e-commerce: New restrictions on data sharing and collection will raise customer acquisition costs for everything from auto sales to real estate. If your startup is formulating a zero-party data strategy, please read.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, November 17 at 3 p.m. PST/6 p.m. EST, I&#8217;ll interview Ben Parr on Twitter Spaces about zero-party marketing best practices. To get a reminder, please <a href="https://twitter.com/TechCrunch">follow @techcrunch on Twitter</a>.</p>

<h2>Demand Curve: How Zapier acquires customers via its homepage</h2>

<p>Your homepage is your most valuable asset when it comes to explaining what you do and the value you provide.</p>
<p>At its root, it&#8217;s an advanced exercise in storytelling, but many startups completely overthink it, which is why studying how the competition presents itself will help you save time and money on testing and optimization.</p>
<p>As an example, Demand Curve’s Joey Noble tears down automation service Zapier’s homepage, delving into the copywriting and conversion tactics that have helped the platform gain millions of users worldwide.</p>

<p>In an expansive interview, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky and TechCrunch Managing Editor Jordan Crook looked back at how the travel company has adapted since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Their chat covered topics as far afield as Airbnb’s “work anywhere” policy, how it’s addressing liability issues for hosts and his biggest regret from the COVID-19 era:</p>
<blockquote><p>I overrode the host cancellation policy and refunded more than a billion dollars of guest bookings. I think it was the right thing to do. But I did it unilaterally, without consulting the hosts. They got really pissed off and it broke some trust with some of our host community.</p></blockquote>

<p>Raising debt is never easy for startups, and for fintechs with a business model that revolves around lending, raising a line of credit from banks or lending institutions can take several months.</p>
<p>Offering &#8220;debt as a service,&#8221; Sivo aims to rectify this problem through its platform, which requires few agreements and fees, and makes raising debt “as easy as plugging into an API,” reported Ryan Lawler.</p>
<p>&#8220;Early returns have been positive: In just about three months since launch, Sivo has received about $4 billion in demand and actually signed $1.5 billion in term sheets from originators who wish to leverage its debt-as-a-service offering,&#8221; he writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;And, according to founder and CEO Kate Hiscox, the company is in the process of onboarding 600 originators who are hoping to tap into its programmatic debt lines.&#8221;</p>

<p>Investing in companies that have astronomical valuations based on expected growth can work out really well. But when the gulf between expectation and reality becomes too great, markets can crash.</p>
<p>According to Alex Wilhelm, today’s IPO market and valuations are based on real growth, but investors should still remain wary.</p>
<p>“The public is increasingly able to invest in higher-risk tech companies, and as multiples rise, the amount of air that tech valuations sit upon is expanding,” he writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The public is now at risk.&#8221;</p>

<p>This week, salad chain Sweetgreen set an IPO range of $23 to $25 per share, giving it a multiple of about 8.2x and a valuation between between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of lettuce, but the pricing shows how much tech-enabled DTC firms can flex, writes Alex Wilhelm, who compared Sweetgreen&#8217;s range to IPO pricing for Allbirds and Rent the Runway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Modern software multiples these are not, but nor are they poor,&#8221; says Alex. &#8220;In fact, they are better than I would have guessed, more evidence that I am a mixture of Scrooge and the Grinch.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a recent episode of TechCrunch Live, Managing Editor Jordan Crook spoke to Guild Education CEO Rachel Carlson, co-founder Brittany Stich, and Aileen Lee, founder and managing partner of Cowboy Ventures, about the education upskilling platform&#8217;s origins and growth arc.</p>
<p>Cowboy Ventures led a $2 million seed round in 2015 while the founders were just starting their entrepreneurial journey.</p>
<p>“[We felt like we had to] show up and be a founding team,” said Carlson.</p>
<p>“We tried to fake it a little bit. We had this great intellectual first meeting, and at the next one, I felt like I had to show up and show her that I made a business. I was a little less authentic.”</p>

<p>For several years, I&#8217;ve earned a living sitting at a desk in my living room. Each day, I get up, brew some coffee, and go to work.</p>
<p>“‘Remote’ is fundamentally disadvantaged,&#8221; said Phil Libin, founder and CEO of startup studio All Turtles and mmhmm at TechCrunch Disrupt. &#8220;We’re not remote, we’re distributed. We’re distributed intentionally in the same way that the internet is a distributed system.”</p>
<p>Managing Editor Eric Eldon interviewed Libin and Wendy Nice Barnes, chief people officer at Gitlab, to learn more about how to foster company culture, manage individuals and hire efficiently in a distributed workplace.</p>
<p>“It’s much easier now versus getting in my car, commuting to an office, having to check in and go through security — and then go sit in a room and be there for five or six hours,&#8221; said Barnes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you have the flexibility and you’re intrigued and you’re going to learn faster through the interview process remotely.”</p>

<p>Fintech reporter Ryan Lawler interviewed Expensify CEO David Barrett this week about the timing of the company&#8217;s IPO, and why they chose a traditional direct listing over a more trendy SPAC.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We’re aiming to be the most pro-employee IPO ever. So even though it’s a traditional IPO, with the exception of a collection of insiders, all of our employees can trade up to 15% of their shares starting today. Normally, you can only get that kind of &#8216;day one&#8217; liquidity if you did a direct listing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Barrett said getting liquidity for early shareholders was also a major consideration, as the company is already profitable.</p>
<p>&#8220;It really came down to — there’s no future where we don’t end up going public at some point. So then it’s no longer if we should go public, it’s really about when.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fact that Q3 earnings for Robinhood and Coinbase were both below expectation has Alex Wilhelm wondering whether Wall Street is underestimating just how volatile the crypto market is.</p>
<p>&#8220;The speed of the crypto economy as a whole may be simply too quick for public-market investors to fully grok,&#8221; he writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the exchanges aren’t even the swingiest of crypto-themed investments.&#8221;</p>

<p>To better understand what goes through a founder’s mind when considering a sale, Ron Miller hosted a panel at TC Sessions: SaaS with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jyoti Bansal, who sold his previous startup AppDynamics to Cisco for $3.7 billion.</li>
<li>Monica Sarbu, who sold her startup Packetbeat to Elastic.</li>
<li>Nick Mehta, who sold his email archiving startup LiveOffice to Symantec.</li>
</ul>
<p>“It was four days of long board meetings and discussions and debates and fights and getting to the decision. So it wasn’t an easy decision,&#8221; said Bansal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though, at $3.7 billion, everyone thought it should probably be a no-brainer; it wasn’t.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Jared Spataro, corporate vice president for Microsoft 365, talks about Microsoft's move to a cloud-centric model.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We tend to take the cloud for granted today as a way of delivering and building software, but it wasn&#8217;t always the case. Less than a decade ago, in fact, companies like Microsoft sold <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/adobes-complex-journey-from-boxes-to-the-cloud/">most of their software in boxes</a> or in large on-prem installations inside customer data centers.</p>
<p>Around 2012, as the company began thinking about what the future of computing might look like, it became clear that software would eventually move to the cloud. Microsoft would have to go through a long journey of changing internal processes and convincing customers the cloud was a more efficient way to deliver software.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that in those days, whether we were talking Office or SharePoint, the company&#8217;s content management system, the software was developed over long multiyear cycles and delivered as one massive change. Not every customer upgraded because they had built systems to work with a previous version, and there was a large cost associated with upgrading.</p>
<p>That meant that existing customers often used older versions and didn&#8217;t take advantage of the latest innovations that Microsoft spent significant resources creating.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The fact that the company was ahead of its customers on this had to be scary, but Microsoft understood that the cloud was the future. 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Today, Microsoft&#8217;s cloud software business is booming — the productivity and business category, where Office 365 and other cloud productivity software live, alone raked in $15 billion in business in the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2022-Q1/press-release-webcast">most recent earnings report</a> (this category also includes LinkedIn revenue). That&#8217;s up 22% from a year earlier. That number included boxed software, by the way, which is still sold in parts of the world. In case you&#8217;re wondering, boxed sales declined 13% for the same period, as companies and individuals increasingly chose cloud.</p>
<p>Last month, I interviewed Jared Spataro, corporate vice president for Microsoft 365, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/jared-spataro-will-talk-about-building-microsofts-saas-business-at-tc-sessions-saas/">at TechCrunch Sessions: SaaS</a>. He was at Microsoft during the company&#8217;s transition to the cloud, and we talked about what was involved in making such a huge shift and how the company convinced often reluctant customers that the cloud was the way to go.</p>
<h2>Leading through change</h2>
<p>Nobody likes a massive change, and it seemed like a big unknown for most customers looking at the cloud in 2012. Sure, there were successful SaaS companies at that point, Salesforce being a prime example, but it was a much smaller company than it is today.</p>
<p>There was still a prevailing feeling that the cloud represented a gamble. &#8220;When we first started thinking about making a transition from our previous model to the cloud, we of course, had those conversations with customers, and I&#8217;ll never forget customers saying, &#8220;No way, don&#8217;t go chase that. We&#8217;re not interested. Don&#8217;t spend your money there, spend your money in places where we want you to improve the product,&#8221; Spataro told me.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">News broke yesterday that MoviePass co-founder Stacy Spikes purchased ownership of the beleaguered brand for an undisclosed sum. The transaction follows one of the more spectacular tech flameouts in recent memory. The service was plagued by ever-changing price tiers, blowback from the country’s biggest theater chain and major issues with its app.</p>
<p>Spikes tells TechCrunch that he was fired from the service he helped launch in 2018, after voicing concern over the price of its $10/month subscription service. It was one of a number of factors under the leadership of Helios and Matheson that ultimately led to the company’s protracted undoing.</p>
<p>This April, Spikes announced the launch of PreShow Interactive, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/preshow-interactive/">which we described as</a>, “a new way [for gamers to] earn in-game currency in exchange for watching ads.” In a conversation with TechCrunch, Spikes says that PreShow may live on in a different form, as part of a revamped MoviePass set to launch at some point next year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233508" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>All of this still sounds very much up in the air. First up on the company’s checklist is getting access to the defunct service’s code and other assets. Spikes also plans to test the waters and determine whether there is enough demand to warrant MoviePass’s return. With an industry struggling to bring back audiences after a seemingly endless global pandemic, is it possible that this is the right moment for a more thoughtful return of movie ticket subscriptions?</p>
<p><strong>TC: You had experience in the music industry that may have prepped you for the changes the movie industry has undergone over the past several years. It was a canary in the coal mine for a major part of the entertainment industry essentially imploding.</strong></p>
<p>SS: With subscription, you saw Napster, Pandora, Spotify, Rhapsody &#8212; all of this stuff on the horizon. You’re absolutely right, the music industry went first. Netflix was on the back end of a lot of those music subscription plays getting up and on their feet and making its digital transition out of DVDs and into digital. That was where digital really took hold first, and you saw it transforming the landscape.</p>
<p><strong>When you had the idea for MoviePass, was there a sense that someone needed to disrupt theaters the way these services disrupted music?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Being one of the few executives of color, I started Urban World Film Festival, to try and help filmmakers of color have a place. Ava DuVernay came out of that festival, Malcolm Lee, Tim Story, Lee Daniels. All this talent came up out of Urban World. Our initial thought was, their films were having a tough time getting into mainstream theaters and getting traction.</p>
<p>What I was going to do is create a circuit that they would play 10 markets, we had a subscriber group, we would four-wall the theaters, and it would make the circuit. We were trying to figure out what technology we would use. Who&#8217;s a member? How do you get to the theater? How do you just walk in? As we were building that someone said, “well, why don&#8217;t you just use it to help all independent movies?” And then it kept bubbling up from there.</p>
<p><strong>How different was your view of what MoviePass would be from the model that Helios and Matheson ultimately put in place?</strong></p>
<p>At the end of the day, when I was CEO, we price tested $15 up to $90. We were A-B testing these things all day long. What you are trying to do is find the vector point between what&#8217;s a profitable business price and what&#8217;s too expensive for people and you cut out the ability to grow, and what&#8217;s too cheap that you never, you&#8217;re never going to make money. We knew going below a certain point, financially, you couldn’t float the boat. There was no way. I think the big difference was we already knew that. When they came in with the idea that they know better, they fired me. They said, “you don&#8217;t agree with our view of the world.” Within four or five months of the deal, I was let go and kicked off the board.</p>
<p><strong>What are the primary reasons MoviePass failed?</strong></p>
<p>At the end of the day as a business, that price wasn&#8217;t sustainable. That&#8217;s a simple truth. It doesn’t get more complicated.</p>
<p><strong>There was the technical aspect of it, too. Shutdowns and other things were extremely frustrating for users.</strong></p>
<p>That wasn’t technical, because it was intentional. When I was CEO, the MoviePass app worked great. It functioned. Peopled loved the ease of service. I can go wherever I want, I can walk up to any theater. We had a larger footprint than Fandango and Movie Tickets combined. In any theater, probably except for drive-ins or cash-only, you could use MoviePass. So that ease of use and simplicity was perfect. We worked a lot of years to get that that right. Everything that transpired after that was intentional. Those weren&#8217;t technical issues. Them deciding to pull AMC Theaters, or your app not working fully were not technical issues.</p>
<p><em>[Editor’s note: As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/08/business/moviepass-settlement-ftc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted in this piece</a>, the FTC accused MoviePass of going to, “great lengths to deny consumers access to the service they paid for while also failing to secure their personal information.” MoviePass <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/10/ftc-finalizes-settlement-operators-moviepass-related-allegations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">settled with the FTC last month</a>.]</em></p>
<p><strong>You mentioned AMC. Do you think you will try to court some of these larger theater chains?</strong></p>
<p>My goal is to help Hollywood return, help movie-going return. I think there is a place in the universe for &#8220;only sign up to one exhibitor,&#8221; and that&#8217;s the only one you go to. That’s your subscription plan, you only go there. I think there&#8217;s a place in the universe for people who want to go be able to go multiple places, and they may pay a little more for that. I think there&#8217;s room in the ecosystem for that, and I and our team have always only been driven to help drive movie going. We think that subscription can be a really big benefit for the industry.</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel there&#8217;s enough goodwill left in the name MoviePass? Is it smart to return under that banner?</strong></p>
<p>I guess the question is, is the consensus that the buying company was MoviePass, or the five years of the brand leading up to that was MoviePass? My experience, and I&#8217;m seeing, is people who signed up prior to 2017 know the difference. I think that there was a brand there. They knew what we were trying to do. We were the underdog. And we were trying to build something unique in our space.</p>
<p><strong>Why does it make sense specifically to return to the brand versus starting from scratch?</strong></p>
<p>When I look at Apple after Steve Jobs left, and I look at Dell computers after Michael Dell left. And you know, when founders get forced out of companies, there&#8217;s a lot of cases where those founders came back. And they fought for that thing that they work years to give birth to. I started working on MoviePass in 2005. And so it&#8217;s 16 years. And so I think there&#8217;s an affinity to when you build something that you just believe in. And so do we do a name change? I don&#8217;t know. I mean, we&#8217;ll find out. I think there&#8217;s going to be a listening tour. We&#8217;re going to hear people, get feedback, but that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m here to do. But I think there&#8217;s something there that we want to try for.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the records referred to third or fourth fiscal quarter 2022 as a relaunch time frame. Does that sound right?</strong></p>
<p>There’s a lot of things that have to come together. When I was asked, I said we’re going to explore. I think if the industry is not going to support it, I think if consumers don&#8217;t like the idea of it, I think if studios aren&#8217;t interested in it, as well, you know, I would probably go “okay, I paid a little bit for this, we talked to a lot of people, everybody thinks movie subscription is a dumb idea. We just all need to keep paying more prices, and people need to keep going to the theaters less, let&#8217;s just let this ship keep going where it&#8217;s going.” If you get that overwhelming sense, then we&#8217;ll just kind of keep moving. But if there is a sense that the stakeholders do want to lean into something that can help the industry overall, how do we get out of our ivory towers that are built, that are only designed for that circuit?</p>
<p><strong>The PreShow site lists the service as launching summer 2021. We’re in autumn right now. What&#8217;s the time frame there?</strong></p>
<p>The thought was, there&#8217;s a possibility of combining. I think PreShow needs a home, it needs a place to launch from. The thought was, is there a way to pull in some of what PreShow was trying to build. Maybe there&#8217;s a way to reduce the cost inside of MoviePass, to offset some of that. I don&#8217;t know is that a freemium model? I don&#8217;t know is that at a supplementary model? I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s a select as you go, your own choice. I think those things would have to get tested and figured out.</p>
<p><strong>So PreShow won’t exist in the form it was initially envisioned.</strong></p>

We thought we could just launch it and the audience would be there, but you have to either build that audience or buy that audience. MoviePass might give it that audience that so many brands want to be in front of.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s possible that some of that could subsidize the cost of movie tickets.</strong></p>
<p>It could be. Or it might be something that reduces a person&#8217;s monthly charge that they pay, versus completely subsidizing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I have in my hands the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/products/detail/game-and-watch-the-legend-of-zelda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Legend of Zelda Game &amp; Watch</a>, the second in Nintendo&#8217;s line of whimsical throwback handhelds clearly meant as stocking stuffers for those who already have (or can&#8217;t find) a Switch. It does a fine job, and the three old-school Zelda games included are great options for Nintendo-hard adventure that actually fits in a pocket.</p>
<p>Announced a couple months back, this $50 gadget is very similar physically to last year&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/nintendos-mario-game-watch-is-a-choice-gaming-stocking-stuffer-of-2020/">Mario Game &amp; Watch</a>, the first in the series based on Nintendo&#8217;s pre-Game Boy line of handhelds. The only difference is the addition of the start and select buttons, which are actually used in the Zelda games.</p>
<p>The games themselves are the inimitable original, The Legend of Zelda; its brutally hard side-scrolling sequel The Adventure of Link; and cherished puzzle box classic Link&#8217;s Awakening, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/links-awakening-remake-is-a-classic-well-worth-revisiting/">recently remade in style</a>. There&#8217;s also a recreation of a classic monochrome Game &amp; Watch from the &#8217;80s, though its entertainment value is, frankly, limited.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233122" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>You can play each straight through, or hit the Game button to switch to another, saving your progress. There are no save states beyond that, though, so get ready to die a gazillion times in Zelda II.</p>
<p>The display is nothing fancy but matches the game resolution well, looking as clear as can be expected at that size. It&#8217;s definitely harder to play on this handheld than on a TV, but very doable. For the record, these close-up pictures show more pixilation than you notice when playing; there&#8217;s definitely no screen door effect as you see in the shot below. In a nice little bit of attention to detail, Link&#8217;s Awakening has an aspect ratio adjustment option; the original Game Boy screen was narrower than 4:3, so you can switch between them on the fly. Notably this is the original monochrome version, not colorized.</p>

<p>The &#8220;watch&#8221; portion consists of a clock and now also a timer app. The clock is quite fun, actually: At midnight and noon Link begins his quest in the original game, starting out by collecting his sword and progressing rather haphazardly through the game, repeatedly killing the endlessly spawning monsters on a screen for a minute at a time — and sometimes dying himself, only to likewise be revived — before moving on to the next one. It&#8217;s not recorded by a simple AI playing the game, so you won&#8217;t see the exact same thing happen over and over.</p>
<p>At 7:59, for instance, he is clearing a green dungeon room of Stalfos, and as the clock strikes 8 he always advances into the boss room, where he plays the flute to reduce Digdogger, slaughters the poor shrunken thing, and collects his fifth piece of the Triforce. At 11:30 he enters the final dungeon and at midnight effortlessly dispatches Ganon in a bit of an anticlimax — and the cycle repeats, albeit with a different color scheme. The dungeons and overworld are not exactly as in the original game but have been modified in various ways to allow for the clock. Still, you get a sense of progression as this Sisyphean Link progresses through the game, collecting the various tools and treasures over and over.</p>

<p>The timer is a limited but helpful little item which does exactly what you might expect, counting down from any full minute increment under an hour. Link battles waves of enemies in Zelda II style, and seems to have as much trouble as I do killing those stupid blue knights. It tracks his highest &#8220;score&#8221; for a given time, so you can set it to three-minute rounds and take bets on how he does.</p>

<p>The hardware, as I said, is largely unchanged, but the addition of the start and select buttons means that A and B, already rather far down the device, are even lower. I think it has graduated from &#8220;not ideal&#8221; to &#8220;uncomfortable&#8221; if you plan to play for longer than a few minutes and have average-size hands or larger. Nintendo, we can shift those up half an inch, can&#8217;t we? Fortunately the device is very light.</p>
<p>On the rear of the Zelda Game &amp; Watch is a little Triforce that, for no reason at all, lights up very dimly. It&#8217;s a sweet little totally unnecessary detail and indicative of someone over there really loving this thing.</p>
<p>Battery life will likely depend on how bright you make the screen, but it&#8217;s at least five or six hours, and likely more. I&#8217;m testing it right now and will update this post later.</p>
<p>Another fun detail, and perhaps I missed this on the Mario one, is that the box it comes in doubles as a little stand; you fold out cut-out legs and it holds the device at the proper angle to be seen — the viewing angle isn&#8217;t great, so leaving it flat or propped straight up isn&#8217;t ideal.</p>
<p>All in all the Zelda Game &amp; Watch is a fun little gadget that any lover of the NES and Game Boy classics will appreciate. The only question is whether you&#8217;ll be able to get hold of one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Oxygen, a startup that is bringing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/oxygen-seed/">digital banking services to freelancers and micro- and small-sized businesses</a>, is in talks to raise a new round at a valuation of over $500 million, two sources familiar with the matter told me.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-headquartered firm is in advanced stages of talks to raise about $70 million, the sources said. London-based Tribe Ventures is in talks to lead Oxygen&#8217;s Series B round, the sources added, requesting anonymity because the details are private.</p>
<p>Banks in the U.S. &#8212; and elsewhere &#8212; have traditionally refused to serve individuals without a traditional job and a consistent salary flow.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233475" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Hussein Ahmed, who previously worked at Amazon, faced this issue himself when he started to work as a freelance consultant for other startups. &#8220;That&#8217;s when I stumbled upon the market segment we are serving today,&#8221; he said in a podcast last year. Ahmed was working from a WeWork and realized that &#8220;everyone around me, from photographers to real estate brokers to accountants, were facing the same problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was then when Ahmed started <a href="https://oxygen.us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxygen</a>. The startup offers consumers and small businesses accounts at zero monthly fee. These accounts, which are FDIC insured, can be operated without a minimum balance and come with a Visa debit card.</p>
<p>The startup, which counts Y Combinator and Runa Capital among its backers, has amassed over 600,000 customers.</p>
<p>Oxygen declined to comment on the fundraise talks, but through a spokesperson Ahmed said the startup has seen a &#8220;massive growth in 2021,&#8221; and increased its revenue by 10 times this year. &#8220;We are having continuous conversations about how to best fund our future plans and will comment when we can.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each year millions of people are diagnosed with cancer. Meanwhile, hundreds of clinical trials testing potential treatments are ongoing. But there’s a gap between the people who need treatment and the people who actually end up in those studies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women and ethnic minorities are often underrepresented in cancer trials. For example, one 2018 meta-review of 310 clinical trials conducted between 2003 and 2016 found that non-Hispanic whites </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29099678/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">were more likely to be enrolled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in clinical trials than African American or Hispanic and Latino participants. Over the course of 14 years, 83% of trial participants were white, 6% were Black, 5.3% were Asian/Pacific Islander, 2.6% were Hispanic and less than 1% were American Indian/Alaskan Native. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excluding breast cancer, just 41% of trial participants were women. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233383" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been movement at the FDA to attempt to correct this. For instance, in 2020, the FDA </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/enhancing-diversity-clinical-trial-populations-eligibility-criteria-enrollment-practices-and-trial"><span style="font-weight: 400;">released industry guidance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to enhance the diversity of clinical trial participation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One company currently operating in this space is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/trialjectory-uses-self-reported-clinical-data-to-match-cancer-patients-with-clinical-trials/">Trialjectory</a>, founded in 2017. The startup</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matches cancer patients to clinical trials. In 2019, it only had about 2,000 members. In 2021, the company is on track to reach 50,000 cancer patients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thirty-five percent of patients on Trialjectory are people from underrepresented backgrounds. Of that 35%, 60% are African American, 30% are Hispanic or Latino and the final 10% represent a mix of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Native American, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and “other race/ethnicity,” according to figures provided by a company PR representative. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sixty percent of these patients are women &#8212; though that figure may be skewed because of a focus on breast cancer trial matching. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch spoke to Trialjectory&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Tzvia Bader about the company’s growth strategy, creating patient community, why the pandemic has changed how people view their own healthcare and how tech and education go hand in hand in building diverse clinical trials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The below interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. </span></p>
<p><b>TC: I’m curious to hear about the growth in the amount of patients on your platform. What do you think has fueled it over the past few years? </b></p>
<p><b>Bader: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think a lot of the growth is with this changed mindset and understanding of patient roles. Until now, the majority of patients outsourced their treatment to a physician. Whatever he says goes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the key things that happened was that we, as patients, need to own more of the decision-making. We don’t outsource our flights anymore, we go to Kayak. We don’t outsource buying a house, we go to Zillow. Fighting for our lives&#8230;we can’t outsource that. We want to be on top of it and know all our options. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second thing is related a little to COVID. When COVID started, treatment got pushed to the side. They were left at home with mobile devices and a computer, frightened not just from COVID but because of their cancer. That basically gave them an even bigger kick in the butt to own their journey and look for options. It expedited this trend of taking ownership and leadership [of care.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, if you think about COVID: Who is owning the journey? It’s us. We decide when to get tested. We decide when to get the vaccine. We don’t need to go to a physician to refer us. It’s already creating this mindset of: I need to be in charge, I need to be in control. </span></p>
<p><b>Let’s say a patient decides ‘I want to be more active in my cancer care.’ How exactly are they finding you?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We like to be wherever patients are. Patients are online. They spend 90% of their time online educating themselves, searching, trying to understand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We follow every aspect of their journey, and are creating content, like e-books to support them. We’re collaborating with advocacy groups. Even more importantly, there’s a big impact from patient-to-patient discussion and patient-to-physician discussion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve seen tremendous growth from this. Patients who found us, and used us, and told other patients. They’re part of patient communities, and they reach out online and offline for that type of support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we realized this network impact of the community we structured it even more. We have a program now called the patient champion. Patients that have used us become brand ambassadors and we’re leveraging them to share information with the communities they’re a part of. [</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Editor’s note: These ambassadors are unpaid, and the company says they have “a couple hundred” since the program was formalized roughly two months ago.] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s one of the key pillars of our growth strategy. Patients want to help other patients. </span></p>
<p><b>How do you select your patient champions?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are people in our community who have indicated they want to participate, and are physically capable of doing it. Then, they do whatever they feel comfortable doing. Some would just like to share their story. That goes all the way to building additional communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, not all breast cancer patients are the same. Those that are in their 20s before kids suffer from different types of challenges, compared to those in their 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s. There&#8217;s a lot that comes into play also in terms of what drives the treatment decisions, and what&#8217;s a concerning factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of what the champions do is highlight those, and then provide support and information around it.</span></p>
<p><b>How have you been able to access groups that are historically underrepresented in clinical trials? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason we’re able to reach them is exactly because we’re reaching out directly to the patient. And, we’re reaching out to the large proportion of patients &#8212; 85% of patients &#8212; who are being treated in the community setting &#8212; not the large research institutions. The majority of them live in the America that’s not large cities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re investing a lot in empowering them, in educating them and helping them understand their journey. We don’t leave them in a place where they’re still dependent on going to the oncologists, or they’re dependent on the oncologists’ time or knowledge to expose them to clinical trials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s just not going to happen. Your oncologist doesn’t necessarily have time to invest in searching [for clinical trials]. And if patients have to search for themselves they get overwhelmed and confused. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We identify clinical trials, and explain why they are important. The information we give is patient-friendly. We show them key information that’s important to them: how many times treatment is given, how treatment is given. You need to understand if you can still go to work. Will I be able to maintain any kind of work-life balance? This is information they care about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also have a team in place whose main job is support. A lot of time people from more diverse populations will want to talk to someone. They want to hear a voice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have a team that is there for what I call “the last mile.” They’re there to listen and connect them with help if they need additional assistance. It might be: someone can’t go by themselves because they don’t have family nearby. So we might connect them to an advocacy group that can support them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We help remove barriers to help them act upon their options. </span></p>
<p><b>It’s one thing to match patients with clinical trials. But how do you actually &#8220;activate&#8221; them, or get them to enroll? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we really want to activate and empower people to take action, we need to help them understand, and help them navigate the journey. What we’ve found is that a lot of this helped with the activation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more I understand my options, the more likely I am to act upon it. Otherwise I might be afraid to bring it to my oncologist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a real use case. We had a patient whose oncologist wanted to put them on one of the PD-L1 inhibitors. But he saw on our platform that almost 40% of similar patients had reported progression with that treatment. So then he saw that one of the trials was a combination of that drug and another immunotherapy drug. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He went to his oncologist and said, what do you think of that [trial]? It changes the dialogue: he comes to his physician, and he understands his options. And, the physician actually said: ‘I hadn’t heard about that trial. I think it’s worth pursuing.’ </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s about giving the right options, giving them the data points and knowledge without scaring them, and without using language they don&#8217;t understand. And then from there, they’re acting upon it.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook announced today that it&#8217;s rolling out new shopping features: Shops in Groups, product recommendations and a test of Live Shopping for Creators.</p>
<p>Shops in Groups enables admins of Facebook groups to set up an online store on their associated Facebook Page. It&#8217;s up to the admins where this money goes &#8212; in the case of OctoNation, a page that tested the feature, the profits went to OctoNation&#8217;s nonprofit that educates people about octopuses (octopi?). This could get hairy in groups that don&#8217;t have a clear philanthropic aim, but it&#8217;s not as though Facebook groups have never been sites for drama before. Still, Yulie Kwon Kim, Meta&#8217;s vice president of Product Management, pointed out that many group admins are volunteers, and these shops could offer them a revenue stream for their work.</p>
<p>&#8220;The money goes to the group admin, and they can decide how they want to use it,&#8221; she told TechCrunch. &#8220;This is a great way for people to sustain and keep the group going.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233317" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/facebook-groups-to-gain-personalization-features-subgroups-chat-and-tools-for-making-money/">had previously announced its plans</a> for group monetization features &#8212; including shops, fundraisers and subscriptions &#8212; at its Facebook Communities Summit hosted earlier this month.</p>

<p>Facebook also said that users often ask for product recommendations in groups &#8212; think about a skincare or makeup group &#8212; so now, if a user mentions a product that is listed in a Facebook shop, they can tag it and embed it into their comment. Top product recommendations from groups will appear within users&#8217; news feeds.</p>
<p>Facebook has had Live Shopping <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/06/facebook-live-shopping/">for years</a>, but as partnerships between brands and creators become more common, the app has begun testing a feature that would make these collaborations appear more seamless. Now, instead of an influencer directing fans to another page to watch them sell a product or vice versa, creators and brands can cross-stream on both of their pages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>This year, Facebook &#8212; now under the company name Meta &#8212; has consistently worked on building out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/facebook-whatsapp-e-commerce-features/">shopping tools</a> for businesses and creators. So it only makes sense that as the holiday season draws nearer, the company is launching more ways to spend money on the Facebook app. These features will be available starting today on the web and on the Facebook mobile apps for iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Right now, Meta&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/facebook-will-no-longer-allow-advertisers-to-target-political-beliefs-religion-sexual-orientation/">primary revenue stream</a> comes from advertising, but the company&#8217;s investment in shopping could offer another source of income. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113127348899371" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> this summer that as Meta rolls out more creator and commerce tools, it&#8217;s committed to not taking a cut from the earnings of businesses and creators until 2023. He added that when the company does introduce a revenue share, it will be less than Apple&#8217;s 30% cut. But by building a robust infrastructure for e-commerce now, the company is positioning itself for future profit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Priti Choksi, partner at Norwest Venture Partners, has a portfolio that includes Bright, Lumosity, Citcon, UPSIDE Foods and Birdies. But before she ever entered the world of VC, she was an operator at companies like Facebook and Google. She managed business development teams and ran M&amp;A and has vast experience in the world of growing and scaling companies.</p>
<p>So, it should go without saying, we&#8217;re absolutely amped to have Choksi join us on <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-live-with-norwest-venture-partners-and-birdies?utm_source=TC%20Post&amp;utm_campaign=post" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 17 at 12 p.m. PST/3 p.m. EST for an episode of TechCrunch Live</a>. Choksi will be joined by founder Bianca Gates of <a href="https://birdies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Birdies</a>.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Live is all about helping founders build better venture-backed businesses. The first step in that, usually, is getting some funding. We&#8217;ll talk to Choksi and Gates about how they first met, what drew Choksi to invest in Birdies and how they&#8217;ve worked together since. We&#8217;ll also take a look through Birdies&#8217; early pitch deck and hear what really sang for NVP and other investors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232075" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Founders, this is a great opportunity to learn what makes VCs tick and refine your fundraising process accordingly.</p>

<p>TechCrunch Live is accessible to anyone who is available on Wednesdays at noon PST/3 p.m. EST, but the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-live/">full library of on-demand TechCrunch Live content</a> is reserved exclusively for TechCrunch+ members.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Wellness startup <a href="https://bellabeat.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bellabeat</a>, which has primarily marketed its wearable health trackers to women, recently introduced <a href="https://bellabeat.com/ivy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ivy</a>, a stylish, comfortable health tracker with a long-lasting battery life, poised as a prettier version of a Fitbit. But the accompanying subscription &#8220;Coach&#8221; software supporting the new bracelet feels like it&#8217;s still in beta, which is concerning for a product aiming to offer health guidance to real-world users.</p>
<p>Over the past eight years, Bellabeat has established a track record of releasing wearable devices that look attractive enough to wear as everyday jewelry, like its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/21/bellabeats-new-hybrid-smartwatch-tracks-your-stress-and-goes-with-your-outfit/">Time</a> smartwatch and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/26/bellabeat-leafs-new-wearable-and-app-help-women-tackle-stress/">Leaf</a> health tracker. Ivy, launched this September, aims to be its most comprehensive product yet &#8212; tracking sleep patterns, heart rate, menstrual cycles, steps, hydration, activity, mindfulness and more.</p>
<p>As a simple health tracker, the Ivy succeeds in what it sets out to do, by tracking your sleep, heart rate and steps. Based on your daily achievements, the app gives you a wellness score. While it encourages you to exercise, it also encourages you to set aside time for daily meditations and other fun activities, which can range from reading to playing sports to going shopping. You&#8217;re also presented with a readiness score, which is calculated based on ongoing analysis of your heart rate, resting heart rate, respiratory rate and cardiac coherence.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229954" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But at $250, the Ivy isn&#8217;t cheap &#8212; especially when most of us have a free pedometer built into our cell phones. Yet the device is in such high demand that current orders won&#8217;t ship until the end of November &#8212; the company sold more than 50,000 units in its eight-month preorder phase, and over 18,000 since launching in September. Across its various products, which sync with the Bellabeat app, the company has over 100,000 monthly active users. It&#8217;s clear that the Y Combinator alum is onto something with its premise: women are interested in health tech, but they don&#8217;t always want to wear a tracker that makes them feel like a cyborg.</p>
<h2>Nutrition glitches</h2>
<p>When you onboard onto the Bellabeat app, you&#8217;re presented with three main goals to choose from: &#8220;weight loss,&#8221; &#8220;get fit&#8221; or &#8220;get healthy.&#8221; Then, you can select from supportive goals: &#8220;better sleep,&#8221; &#8220;healthy aging&#8221; and &#8220;better sex.&#8221; Bellabeat&#8217;s premium &#8220;Coach&#8221; service &#8212; which sells for $99 per year &#8212; offers daily meal plans and weekly shopping lists to help women eat a balanced diet.</p>
<p>When TechCrunch tested the service, we selected &#8220;get healthy&#8221; as our main goal and were presented with meal plans that regularly averaged about 1,500 calories per day. We changed our goal to &#8220;weight loss,&#8221; and found the daily meal plans remained about the same.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Bellabeat why its standard meal plans were just 1,500 calories. A representative for Bellabeat told us the meal plans were generated due to a bug in the app, and to check it again. Upon returning to the app, the recipes were filled with inconsistencies, however. In one recipe, hummus on toast amounted to a shockingly inflated 904 calories, while veggie moussaka appeared as 1,653 calories, equal to about three McDonald&#8217;s Big Macs. When TechCrunch followed up about this, the representative said that the company was still working out some kinks with the app. But the app was not presented to us as a beta &#8212; the product is already on the market, retailing for $250 with a $99 yearly subscription. Even users who aren&#8217;t subscribed to the Coach service can still see recommended meal plans and the calorie counts for those meals. But when you upgrade, you get full recipes, as well as many exercises and health videos.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2233477" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233477" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2233477" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bellabeatscreens.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="371" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bellabeatscreens.jpg 2385w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bellabeatscreens.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bellabeatscreens.jpg?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bellabeatscreens.jpg?resize=768,419 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bellabeatscreens.jpg?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bellabeatscreens.jpg?resize=1536,837 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bellabeatscreens.jpg?resize=2048,1116 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bellabeatscreens.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233477" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bellabeat screenshots by TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>To be clear, Bellabeat isn&#8217;t marketing itself as a calorie-counting app in the same way that apps like Noom or MyFitnessPal are &#8212; the latter apps are food diaries, asking users to input everything that they eat in a day. Research suggests that apps like MyFitnessPal are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5700836/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widely used</a> among people with eating disorders, as they can enable restrictive habits. Noom, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/wellness/noom-weight-loss-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claims to be anti-diet</a>, but is said to offer <a href="https://christinejbyrne.com/eating-disorder-recovery-means-not-dieting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small daily calorie allowances</a> which can be connected to the onset of eating disorders, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckeatingdisorders/comments/cnvwwf/signed_up_for_noom_and_immediately_regretted_it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harmful</a> for people recovering from an eating disorder. Plus, since these apps can scan barcodes of packaged foods to determine exact calorie counts, some users report feeling encouraged to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-48842898" target="_blank" rel="noopener">choose processed foods</a> over homemade meals &#8212; it&#8217;s easier to know how many calories are in a frozen dinner than in one you make yourself.</p>
<p>However, even though Bellabeat doesn&#8217;t ask users to input everything they eat in a day, the not-so-subtle implication of its recommended meal plans is that you shouldn&#8217;t be eating more than 1,500 calories per day, which can be harmful. According to the United States Department of Agriculture&#8217;s <a href="https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/2015-2020_Dietary_Guidelines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dietary Guidelines for Americans</a>, women should eat between 1,600 and 2,400 calories per day. Exact daily intake recommendations vary depending on an individual&#8217;s lifestyle and various other health factors.</p>
<p>&#8220;What frustrates me the most about health trackers that recommend a low-calorie allowance is that they do not take into account important factors about the individual using the app. They spit out a general number, and in this case, the same number for both weight loss and weight maintenance, with limited science behind it,&#8221; said Gabi Kahn, MS, RD, who specializes in nutrition for mothers. &#8220;Apps like these that recommend a 1,500 calorie diet to every woman are promoting disordered eating. They lead to people obsessing over every calorie they consume, overthinking every food choice to the point of obsession and overanalyzing every bite of food they eat.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Wellness gone awry</h2>
<p>Women&#8217;s wellness is a tricky industry and one undergoing more scrutiny in recent years about its messaging to women. The <a href="https://slate.com/business/2021/03/weight-watchers-name-change-ww-dieting-culture.html#:~:text=The%20company%20rebranded%20as%20WW,the%20same%20unhealthy%20diet%20culture.&amp;text=In%202018%2C%20Weight%20Watchers%20changed,company%20was%20all%20about%E2%80%94dieting." target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebrand</a> of &#8220;Weight Watchers&#8221; to &#8220;WW&#8221; (with the tagline &#8220;wellness that works&#8221;) is indicative of a larger trend in marketing health products to women: instead of telling women to lose weight, these companies tell women to be healthier. This cause sounds noble enough, yet it perpetuates the false idea that weight is the only indicator of health, rather than just <a href="https://www.self.com/story/the-science-on-weight-and-health">one data point</a> amid many factors. And as the industry shifts away from weight loss and toward the more sanitized &#8220;wellness,&#8221; lawmakers are paying close attention to link between <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/lawmakers-confront-tiktok-snapchat-and-youtube-about-eating-disorder-content/">social media apps and eating disorders</a>, and particularly their impact on the mental health of minors.</p>
<p>Bellabeat is targeting a similar market. The company said that most of its clients are between the ages of 25 to 55, with 66% falling between ages 28 and 44.</p>
<p>Though Bellabeat does work with a team of 14 medical professionals &#8212; including a nutritionist &#8212; that expertise is easily undermined by these technical difficulties. Since reporting the bug to Bellabeat, the number of calories in these daily meal plans has increased to a more reasonable value for weight maintenance. But at the time that TechCrunch tested the product and was served these low-calorie meal plans, Ivy had already been on the market for about two months and sold almost 70,000 units. Solving such massive bugs at that point is dangerous for a product that women are using to make decisions about their health.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Husband-and-wife co-founders Daniel and Brenna Stitzel have developed a way for foodies to monetize their culinary creations.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Husband-and-wife co-founders Daniel and Brenna Stitzel are developing a way for foodies to monetize their culinary creations and closed on a round of $1.5 million in pre-seed funding to officially launch <a href="https://joinfoody.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foody</a>.</p>
<p>The investment was led by Serena Ventures, with Goodwater Capital and a group of angel investors joining, including Patreon’s Jack Conte, former Postmates exec Vivek Patel, Greenoaks Capital&#8217;s Neil Mehta and KeepTruckin’s Shoaib Makani.</p>
<p>Most Americans — <a href="https://www.reportlinker.com/insight/americans-cooking-habits.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">98% of them — cook at home at least once a week</a>, but finding recipes means long internet searches and wading through food blog stories and ads to get to the recipe.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233013" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Foody enables users to buy recipes, or upload their own, and keep them in one ad-free place. It also is partnering with Michelin-star chefs, like Jeremiah Tower, and food bloggers to monetize their recipes and other content while building relationships with fans.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233019" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233019" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233019" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Foody-Product.png" alt="Foody" width="1024" height="749" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Foody-Product.png 3424w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Foody-Product.png?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Foody-Product.png?resize=300,220 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Foody-Product.png?resize=768,562 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Foody-Product.png?resize=680,498 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Foody-Product.png?resize=1536,1124 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Foody-Product.png?resize=2048,1499 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Foody-Product.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233019" class="wp-caption-text">Foody app. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Foody</p></div></p>
<p>The idea for the company came about when Brenna Stitzel decided to go to culinary school in 2020 after a career in banking. When the global pandemic shut down her school and available food items on store shelves dwindled, Stitzel began getting inquiries from friends about what they could make with the pantry staples on hand.</p>
<p>“People were looking for content, so I started putting out recipes, but I wasn’t satisfied with the tools available,” she added. “There was not one great software to help food creators of all kinds, from restaurants to authors, to monetize their content and get it out there, nor was there one central place for home chefs to save, share and store their recipes.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Stitzels then set out to build a tool for creators to publish and share recipes that they can push out to fans with QR codes and URLs. Foodies can sign up for free to use the site, and then be able to put together a collection of recipes for a small fee.</p>
<p>Foody is launching with over 30 creators, including a curated list of a dozen featured creators, including Tower, Brandon Jew (Mister Jiu&#8217;s), Evan and Sarah Rich (Rich Table), Harold Villarosa, Gaby Dalkin, Amanda Frederickson, Amanda Haas, Laura and Sayat Ozyilmaz, A16 Restaurant and Tu David Phu.</p>
<p>In Serena Ventures, the Stitzels said they found partners “who share our vision for building amazing software that empowers creators and improves the day to day lives of home cooks.”</p>
<p>“Food and cooking are such big parts of my life, both for my profession and with my family,” Serena Williams, founder and managing partner of Serena Ventures, said in a written statement. “I’m so excited to try new recipes on Foody, and I believe it’s time culinary creators from every culture and background have an opportunity to turn their creativity into income.</p>
<p>The company intends to use the new funding to grow its team of 10 in engineering and development to build out new products and features, Dan Stitzel said.</p>
<p>“We have a big vision for what amazing kitchen software could be that includes planning weekly meals and integrating with grocery delivery services,” he added.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Given that VCs are putting more money to work in Africa this year as the quarters tick along, it’s reasonable to anticipate that 2022 could bring even greater total venture investment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The global venture capital market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">is increasingly active</a>, but few locales are seeing the sort of investment acceleration that African startups are enjoying this year.</p>
<p>New data indicates that African startups have already outraised all known prior years, meaning 2021 is sure to be a record. But, more importantly, the pace at which African startups are raising money in 2021 is accelerating, with September data indicating that it was perhaps the best month ever.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Given that venture capitalists are putting more money to work in Africa this year as the quarters tick along, it’s reasonable to anticipate that 2022 could bring even greater total venture investment to the continent.</p>
<p>Investors told The Exchange that their investment pace is picking up tempo and prices are rising. But it’s not all good news on the African front. There may be a dearth of late-stage checks despite a surfeit of early-stage deals, and the African startup economy remains weighted toward a single country (Nigeria) and category (fintech).</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220369 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Any heating market won’t warm evenly, and the African startup scene is no exception to the rule. Still, the type of funding that the continent’s startups may need is in rich global supply, so perhaps this is a supply chain issue that can be resolved?</p>
<p>Read on for more data and notes from Novastar Ventures&#8217; West Africa director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/waswani">Brian Odhiambo</a> and Acuity Venture Partners managing partner <a href="https://twitter.com/anovitske">Lexi Novitske.</a></p>
<h2>Strong totals, promising early-stage</h2>
<p>While we don&#8217;t have full confirmation yet, we are pretty sure that Africa crossed the $3 billion milestone in VC funding this year so far.</p>
<p>African startup observer Maxime Bayen was first to <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxBayen/status/1444951568214904836">point out that the milestone was impeding</a>: According to <a href="https://thebigdeal.substack.com/p/q3-2021-2020">data from his Substack newsletter, The Big Deal</a>, the first three quarters already totaled more than $2.9 billion. His prediction? That, if things continue at this pace, startup funding in Africa for 2021 will <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxBayen/status/1457664777673654276">amount to $4 billion</a>.</p>

		<a href="http://www.pz.harvard.edu/who-we-are/people/emily-weinstein">Emily Weinstein</a> is a senior researcher at <a href="http://www.pz.harvard.edu/">Project Zero</a> at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">We’ve spent the last decade studying the questions that loom large in the current news cycle. What are the implications of social media for teen mental health? What are the benefits of growing up digital? What’s dispiriting or even toxic, and for whom?</p>
<p>We’ve talked about these issues with <em>a lot </em>of teens. Based on research with more than 3,600 teenagers, we wrote a book (out next year from the MIT Press) called “Behind Their Screens: What Teens Are Facing (And Adults Are Missing).” We’ve worked closely with youths and families in different contexts, from schools and community centers to summer camps and even hospitals. One crucial insight: We need to think about teens’ tech experiences with a much wider lens.</p>
<p>We must focus on creating the best HX<em> &#8212;</em> <em>human experience</em> &#8212; for teens. A focus on HX broadens our attention to talking about, engaging with and designing tech in ways that align with our needs as human beings. HX urges us to think beyond the pitfalls of specific social media apps and more holistically about their place in a teen’s life.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230577" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s tempting to put all the blame for teens’ struggles on social media. But teens need us to start by asking and really listening to their stresses, worries and joys. What are their current vulnerabilities and struggles? What are true sources of comfort, connection and happiness? And what particular tech experiences amplify or undercut well-being?</p>
<p>HX is about what people are seeing <em>and </em>how they make sense of it. For one teen, workout videos are motivating and support healthy habits. For another teen, these same videos reinforce a painful sense that they’re not fit enough, thin enough or “productive” enough.</p>
<p>Therefore, “fixing” algorithms and the content teens see is important but isn’t a panacea.</p>
<p>This past summer, we ran a series of co-design workshops with teens. Our aim was to reimagine how to think about and support digital well-being. One teen gave voice to a concept that resonated powerfully with others. She described challenges of contemporary teen experiences as “the grind” &#8212; “a culture of needing to be productive all the time … experiencing everyone sharing what they’re doing and feeling like you’re not doing enough.” Social media speeds up the gears of grinds that feel constant and never-ending.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The grind, other teens told us, is the engine of “pressure to do the most and spread myself thin.” Really, it’s a series of pressures — a feeling that they need to do “the most” in many different domains, all at the same time.</p>
<p>There is a grind to “curate my own quirky yet mainstream social media and real-life persona,” and another to “look my best at all times.” Nearly everyone identified a social grind: feeling like they need to “always be socializing, and be posting about it so people know,” or “making sure that I&#8217;m posting with a variety of people to signal that I have a lot of friends” and even “prioritizing social life over everything including mental health.”</p>
<p>Yet alongside constant “fun,” teens simultaneously feel grinds linked to academic pressure (reinforced, they said, by people posting grades, test scores or class schedules filled with AP courses) and acute career pressure (amplified by a sense of “constantly needing to prove that I have an important plan for my life”). They described pressure to be fully informed about the news and civic issues, to be set in their interests and identities, to be funny and supportive as friends — and signal it all on social media.</p>
<p>Teens are not monolithic, and their grinds also vary based on their different identities and contexts. A teen who immigrated to the U.S. said “being an immigrant sort of forces a grind on me.” A queer teen talked about a grind related to “the &#8216;right&#8217; way to be gay &#8212; assumptions about the way I dress and present.”</p>
<p>Critically, the grind is about tech, but it’s not just about the tech. It’s a collision of pressures that are developmentally linked and powerfully magnified by browsing, scrolling and posting.</p>
<p>Using a wider HX lens prompts questions about how we can help teens recalibrate their relationships to technology. Adults are often mired in an us-versus-them battle with teens over screens. When we assume teens want to be on their phones around the clock, we see it as our job is to save them from themselves. But teens repeatedly tell us otherwise.</p>
<p>“People are always glued to their phones, but so am I and I hate that,” a 15-year-old said.</p>
<p>“My phone distracts me from my homework and from the life moments I am currently in,” a 17-year-old said. “I know it’s a problem so I am trying to limit how much time I spend on my phone since hours and hours can go by of talking to my friends or liking pictures on Instagram.”</p>
<p>A 16-year-old added: “TikTok runs my life.”</p>
<p>To hold our attention, today’s technologies are designed to tap our most basic <em>human </em>desires to keep us clicking, scrolling and wanting more. For teens, app features can play on developmental sensitivities. Design collides with needs for peer connection, vulnerabilities to social pressures and natural sensitivity to questions about who they are and who they want to be. We shouldn’t mistake tech dependence as a sign that teens don’t care about optimizing their HX.</p>
<p>Social media companies have an urgent responsibility to do more to protect teens’ experiences. But we don’t have to wait on tech companies to begin supporting HX now.</p>
<p>Savvy teens tell us how they’ve become curators of their on-screen experiences, unfollowing and muting accounts that intensify the grind feelings. They actively seek out content that makes them feel seen, inspired or that makes them laugh.</p>
<p>They’re also intentional about when and how they use tech: Some have pacts with friends about putting their phones on “do not disturb” during in-person time or deciding not to post pictures while together because monitoring feedback becomes too distracting. During the pandemic, studying together quietly over video chat was a way to feel less lonely and more connected.</p>
<p>We need to help <em>all</em> teens develop the inclinations to focus on HX and the skills to support it.</p>
<p>There are things we can do as individuals to improve our HX, but bigger questions loom: Can companies adjust their platforms to protect vulnerable teens &#8212; and will they? What kinds of oversight and regulation are needed? While we debate the best path forward, millions of teens continue to scroll on. Supporting their HX can’t wait.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company is answering the question of how you fairly come up with a way to share the attention between big and small sellers]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s tough to be a seller when there are so many products out there on marketplaces just waiting to be discovered. <a href="http://promoted.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Promoted.ai</a> is out to help people find you, securing $2 million in funding to continue developing its tool that matches buyers to sellers in marketplace search.</p>
<p>The company was started by two former Pinterest engineer and engineer manager, Andrew Yates and Dan Hill, who wanted to help buyers find what they want more easily, which leads to repeat purchases. And then they wanted sellers to see immediate feedback about how their products appear in a search and tools to improve sales.</p>
<p>“We are predicting for every item in search what someone will engage with and ultimately buy,” Yates told TechCrunch. “It’s the complete package. What we discovered from the industry and customers is that we need to have a data infrastructure so that you can have data in the right place at the right time.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233094" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>He explained that Promoted’s technology is more than simply an item, but the optimization of the entire picture: how you fairly come up with a way to share the attention between big and small sellers, then taking into account if the user is satisfied with that search.</p>
<p>Yates and Hill, based in the Bay Area, launched Promoted in 2020 and were part of Y Combinator’s recent winter cohort. In addition to the accelerator, major investors in the capital infusion include Interlace Ventures and Rebel Fund.</p>
<p>Vincent Diallo, managing partner at Interlace, said he was attracted to the company largely due to the team, which he felt had “amazing experience in the space.”</p>
<p>Interlace primarily invests in commerce technology, and Diallo saw two trends that Promoted was addressing: The first was the movement of retailers to increase their range in e-commerce and delivery by opening a marketplace. The second was the increased number of verticalized marketplaces trying to capture a subset of the market through one kind of customer behavior and building a community.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“A big part of Amazon’s performance is from the ad manager and ad revenue, so we were convinced there was an opportunity to build a tool like this,” Diallo added.</p>
<p>The company is targeting enterprise deals and plans to use the new funding on hiring. However, their funding round was a bit unusual.</p>
<p>Much of the team is made up of former Facebook, Pinterest and Google engineers, and with the competitive talent environment, rather than go the traditional seed funding route, the founders decided to give equity for the founding engineering team and raise the remaining funds from individual angel investors putting in $50,000 or less.</p>
<p>“We had to turn away some fantastic funds to make this work, but in exchange, we have a great network of champions, experts and advocates,” Yates said. “We found it better to give equity directly to engineers to recruit top talent because equities are so hot and experienced machine learning and ads engineer cash salaries are so high. We will end up raising additional capital for scaling up the team.”</p>
<p>Though the company is still young, it is already working with marketplace apps like Hipcamp and Snackpass, and customers are seeing lifted conversion rates. For example, Promoted increased Hipcamp’s total booking rate by over 7%, Yates said.</p>
<p>Next up, the company will be focusing on the launch manager side of the product and building out a tool similar to an ads manager for listings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority CEO Steve Hill unveiled The Boring Company&#8217;s plan for a subterranean shuttle that would whisk visitors to different parts of the city&#8217;s vast Convention Center campus, he predicted it would take just under two minutes to travel between its farthest stations.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the system doesn&#8217;t work, we will get all of our money back,&#8221; Hill said, in June 2019, according to the <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/traffic/official-tunnel-project-could-speed-up-las-vegas-strip-travel-1681216/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Las Vegas Review Journal</a>.</p>
<p>That two-minute promise was repeated to the media as recently as April, according to an email between a Boring Company (TBC) representative and the LVCVA. That email was part of a 5,051-page drop of documents <a href="https://www.plainsite.org/tags/elon-musk-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">obtained by Plainsite</a> under public records legislation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232083" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>So far, it seems the two-minute target is still out of reach.</p>
<p>Detailed trip reports from the same records request show that in its first six weeks of operation, the LVCC Loop&#8217;s Tesla taxis took an average of nearly four minutes to span the system.</p>
<p>The data, which cover over 30,000 free rides and 75,000 passengers, reveals that there was no day on which the trips took an average of less than three minutes, and one day they needed an average of five. (TechCrunch excluded days on which the system transported fewer than a thousand people in total.) Videos of rides taken during a large auto conference last week (which was too recent to be included in this batch of public documents) show similar trip times.</p>
<p>A few minutes&#8217; delay won&#8217;t make a big difference to the average convention attendee, of course, but could add up to big financial penalties if TBC misses ridership targets during giant shows like CES. The disparity also calls into question TBC&#8217;s promises for a much larger public Loop network in Las Vegas that recently got the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/elon-musk-boring-company-las-vegas-loop-expand-strip/">go-ahead</a>. Ultimately, the LVCC Loop&#8217;s performance could signal whether Musk&#8217;s subterranean taxis can be a viable form of urban transportation, or more of a Tesla-boosting amusement ride.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2233083" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Boring-Compnay-Tesla-Getty.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233083" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2233083 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Boring-Compnay-Tesla-Getty.jpg" alt="Elon Musk's Boring Company Demonstrates Transport Tunnel Underneath Las Vegas Convention Center" width="2000" height="1154" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Boring-Compnay-Tesla-Getty.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Boring-Compnay-Tesla-Getty.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Boring-Compnay-Tesla-Getty.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Boring-Compnay-Tesla-Getty.jpg?resize=768,443 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Boring-Compnay-Tesla-Getty.jpg?resize=680,392 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Boring-Compnay-Tesla-Getty.jpg?resize=1536,886 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Boring-Compnay-Tesla-Getty.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2233083" class="wp-caption-text">A digital map is shown in the Central Station during a media preview of the Las Vegas Convention Center Loop on April 9, 2021 in Las Vegas, Nevada. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Getty Images / Ethan Miller</p></div></p>
<p>The larger Vegas Loop system is planned to comprise 51 stations and around 29 miles of tunnels, linking many of the city&#8217;s tourist sites. On its project page for the Vegas Loop, TBC suggests a trip from the city&#8217;s NFL stadium to the Convention Center would also take four minutes, despite the distance being more than four times longer than the LVCC Loop today.</p>
<p>The real-world travel data also raises doubts as to whether the LVCC Loop as it stands can meet its capacity goal of transporting 4,400 conference attendees per hour.</p>
<p>TBC achieved that number during a demonstration event in May, by squeezing three riders (without luggage) into each of the 62 Tesla Model 3, X and Y vehicles in the system. In reality, however, an average of just two passengers rode in each Loop vehicle between its opening to conventioneers in early June and mid-July.</p>
<p>A contract signed by TBC in 2019 specifies a $300,000 penalty for each large convention where TBC cannot move around 4,000 people per hour. A penalty that large could impact the viability of the Loop, which earned just $230,500 for transportation services during its first month of operation in June. (TBC also gets a monthly management fee of $167,000, regardless of how many cars it operates.)</p>
<p>The highest number of passengers per hour the LVCC had transported by mid July was 1,355. A big reason for this is that the LVCC does not generally have its largest conferences in the heat of a Nevada summer, and there were simply not that many passengers requiring transportation. During a beauty convention in June, for example, a Loop operations engineer wrote to the LVCVA: &#8220;I trimmed back the [number of] cars now because we are seeing a super low volume of passengers.&#8221; Some evenings, Loop management closed the system early after no passengers had entered the system for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>The Loop has three levels of service. Level 2, offering just five cars and no station attendants, is when there are no active conventions on the LVCC campus. Level 3, with 23 vehicles, can handle up to 20,000 visitors. Level 4, with from 30 to 62 Teslas, is for the largest events.</p>
<h2>The big tech test</h2>
<p>The acid test for the system will likely be the CES convention in January, which can attract 185,000 attendees. Last week, the Loop got permission to operate with 70 vehicles, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/elon-musks-loop-gets-autopilot-and-an-intruder/">TechCrunch predicted</a> in August. Even so, it will need to either cut trip times or persuade at least three passengers into each vehicle to avoid the capacity penalty. It will also have to cut down on &#8220;ghost cars&#8221; driving without passengers on board &#8212; which actually accounted for a majority of trips during the Loop&#8217;s opening event in early June.</p>
<p>The current tunnels seem unlikely to accommodate many more vehicles. During the 70-vehicle test last week, a city inspector noted: &#8220;There were some occasions where vehicles entered and exited the tunnels within stations within 1 to 2 seconds apart.&#8221; The Loop&#8217;s safety analysis is based on maintaining six seconds of headway between cars.</p>
<h2>Positive reviews</h2>
<p>The good news is that riders seem to like the Loop. &#8220;Customers really love the system and it is clearly their preferred method of travel around the campus. Wait times are manageable to about two minutes max during the largest of surges,&#8221; wrote Seth Hooper, director of Loop Operations, at the end of June. Multi-colored &#8220;rainbow road&#8221; tunnel lights that were originally turned on for just two minutes every quarter hour are now an almost permanent fixture, due to rider demand.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the system&#8217;s biggest problems continues to be unauthorized visitors. As well as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/elon-musks-loop-gets-autopilot-and-an-intruder/">intruder vehicle</a> that TechCrunch revealed in October, the Loop has had multiple incursions by convention center employees apparently keen to have a peek. &#8220;The biggest culprits of unauthorized vehicles are LVCVA carts,&#8221; wrote Hooper.</p>
<p>Even animals got in on the action. In late July, two TBC employees tried to rescue a kitten that had fallen into a storm sewer near the system&#8217;s South station.</p>
<p>TBC and the LVCVA did not immediately respond to questions about the cat&#8217;s ultimate fate, nor to other detailed queries about the trip data. However, TBC is cataloguing the safety and security incidents that any transportation system faces. On at least three occasions, Loop drivers have struck fences or bollards when misjudging turns, causing minor damage. The only injury to a passenger (by the end of June) was a Loop passenger sustaining a small laceration and contusion to her finger when another passenger closed a vehicle door on her hand.</p>
<p>All of this data will be invaluable to TBC as it plans to scale up the technology to serve an entire city. It is not yet known whether the Vegas Loop, unlike the LVCC system, will accommodate children and pets, nor exactly how much tickets for the paid system will cost.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobility 54 Investment SAS, a corporate venture capital subsidiary of Toyota Tsusho Corporation and CFAO group, DOB Equity and InfraCo Africa have invested $3.4 million (€3 million) in electric motorcycle startup <a href="https://www.zem.bo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zembo</a> to help it grow its business.</p>
<p>Zembo, a French startup with operations in Uganda, was founded in 2018 and sells electric motorcycles through a lease-to-own program. It also operates a network of solar charging and battery swapping stations in the East African country.</p>
<p>Mobility 54 said it will help the startup to scale its operations across Africa “by leveraging the group’s (Toyota’s) automotive footprint throughout the continent.” Additionally, Mobility 54 will work with Zembo to forge new partnerships, especially for its battery and solar panel businesses &#8212; an area in which the startup anticipates the greatest growth.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233178" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Mobility 54’s investment in Zembo envisions to accelerate the carbon neutrality in Africa by electrification of the mobility industry. Toyota Tsusho and CFAO group will contribute to deploy Zembo’s business in Africa by leveraging the group’s automotive footprints throughout the continent,” Mobility 54 said in a statement.</p>
<p>The new funding will go toward increasing the number of motorcycles, by about 2,000, and the installation of more than 60 charging and battery swapping stations across Uganda’s capital, Kampala. Its motorcycles cover 37 miles (60km) on a single charge.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to partner with impact-focused institutions like InfraCo Africa, DOB Equity, and Mobility 54 to continue developing electric boda bodas (motorcycles) and charging stations for our customers,” said Zembo co-founder, Étienne Saint-Sernin.</p>
<p>“Zembo’s mission to improve incomes for Uganda’s boda boda riders while cutting air pollution is shared by our supporters and is a driving force for this partnership. We look forward to continuing to serve our customers and making sustainable mobility a reality in Uganda,” he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zembo assembles the electric motorcycles in Uganda and works with external financial institutions to sell them through rent-to-own plans. Its battery-as-a-service model allows riders to swap discharged batteries with fully charged ones at a fee.</p>
<p>InfraCo Africa’s CEO, Gilles Vaes, <a href="https://infracoafrica.com/infraco-africa-dob-equity-and-mobility-54-announce-investment-to-scale-zembos-vision-for-electric-mobility-in-uganda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> “… Zembo has a great track record of delivering electric two-wheeler vehicles to the market and our joint effort with DOB Equity and Mobility 54 to scale and develop the business will expand the company’s ability to cut urban air pollution, create jobs and promote economic development in Kampala. The project also aligns with global efforts to improve air quality and to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century.”</p>
<p>InfraCo Africa, part of Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG), which is funded by six governments and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), provides funding and expertise to infrastructure projects, while DOB Equity is a Dutch family-backed investor with an interest in East Africa.</p>
<p>Motorcycle taxis are popular across Africa, and are widely used in major cities like Kampala. However, they are regarded as a major source of noise and air pollution, problems that would be addressed by a transition to electric power.</p>
<p>Zembo Storm motorcycles is one of the many businesses that are rising in African markets to offer e-mobility solutions as cleaner travel options.</p>
<p>Other players include Kenya’s Opibus, which is set to start mass production of motorcycles next year. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/ev-conversion-startup-opibus-raises-7-5m-to-start-bus-and-motorcycle-mass-production/">Opibus told TechCrunch</a> in an earlier interview that the competitive advantage of electric transport includes declining operational costs of up to 60% lower than fossil fuel alternatives.</p>
<p>A switch to electric power also holds the promise of lowering carbon emissions, which contribute greatly to the climate change problems that the world is working to address.</p>
<p>Reports, however, show that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bolt-to-expand-ev-option-in-south-africa/">electric mobility in Africa</a> is nascent even as opportunities remain vast, especially if the infrastructure to support its adoption is built. To bridge the gap, companies like Zembo and Opibus are building their own infrastructure.</p>

As first reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776563/spacex-starlink-rectangular-dish-router-mounting-internet-satellites" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1"><em>The Verge</em></a>, the company now offers a <a href="https://api.starlink.com/public-files/Accessories_Guide_Rectangular.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">rectangular option</a> (PDF) that&#8217;s smaller and lighter than its original circular one. Users have to install that antenna on their rooftop or anywhere high up with a clear view of the sky to be able to access its satellite internet.</p>
<p>The original version is a standard dish that&#8217;s 23-inch wide, but the rectangular version is only 12 inches wide and 19 inches long. It&#8217;s also only 9.2 pounds, which is almost half the weight of its circular counterpart. The new terminal&#8217;s smaller form factor could give users more options when it comes to potential locations where they can install it. In addition, the rectangular terminal comes with more accessory options, including a long pole users can simply stick in the ground so they no longer have to mount the antenna on their rooftop.</p>
<p>SpaceX <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starlink-internet-service-99-a-month-045831110.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">launched</a> Starlink as a beta service in late 2020 and offered customers access to its satellite internet for $99 a month. Users would have to pay $499 on top of that for its hardware kit, though, which includes the antenna, its stand, power supply and a WiFi router. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell <a href="https://sea.pcmag.com/networking/45600/spacex-prepares-to-cut-starlink-dish-cost-by-half-later-this-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">said</a> in August that the original dish cost $3,000 to produce, and while the company was able to get that down to $1,300, it was still selling the kit at a loss.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233212" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Shotwell also said at the time that the terminal it&#8217;s releasing this year &#8220;will cost roughly half&#8221; of what its current user terminals cost and that the company may be able to cut that in half again. <em>The Verge notes</em>, however, that the hardware kit is still being sold for $499 even with the rectangular antenna, and SpaceX has yet to reveal whether it will be sold at a lower price in the future. Potential new customers who don&#8217;t mind paying the same price for it can get the rectangular terminal when they order a kit, so long as they&#8217;re in the US.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Salesforce users tend to have a similar complaint in the amount of time it takes to update records, but <a href="https://www.getweflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weflow</a> aims to conquer this form of “Salesforce fatigue.”</p>
<p>The Berlin-based company is developing a tool — still in private beta — that makes it faster to update Salesforce and reduces much of the busy work that takes up salespeople’s time.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2018/03/13/salesforce-essentials-is-here-now-millions-of-small-businesses-can-grow-and-innovate-faster-on-the-worlds-1-crm-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">83% of Fortune 500 companies use the platform</a> to improve sales productivity, many sales professionals <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spend the bulk of their time on tasks other than selling</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233123" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Serial entrepreneurs Henrik Basten and Janis Zech worked together at Fyber and experienced this firsthand while running revenue teams. They started Weflow in late 2020 to be a revenue workspace built on top of Saleforce’s database to help salespeople add information inside Salesforce records quickly and manage their pipeline.</p>
<p>“People want to create a solution that is more like Asana for pipeline management,” CEO Zech told TechCrunch. “However, what is helpful is that Salesforce is an open ecosystem that you can build on top of. We observed people go into their pipeline and have 30 tabs open with notes scattered about. We were thinking that if salespeople don’t enjoy using it, we would create a more modern experience that was easier to update.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2233125" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233125" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233125" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png" alt="Weflow" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png 2340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png?resize=2048,1151 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233125" class="wp-caption-text">Weflow pipeline table. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Weflow</p></div></p>
<p>Here’s how it works: Users can sign up with their Salesforce account, access their pipeline and update deals, tasks, notes and activities with a few clicks. All of the data stays in Salesforce. Salespeople typically perform this task once a week and schedule two or three hours for it, but Zech estimates that Weflow can reduce that down to 20 minutes.</p>
<p>In addition, the company created a modern notepad, built for Salesforce, for users to build templates so that salespeople are asking the same questions and writing in the same fields. There is also a task manager.</p>
<p>Now today, the company announced $2.7 million in pre-seed funding, led by Cherry Ventures, to get its tool to public launch. Cherry was joined by a group of angel investors, including Christian Reber, Sascha Konietzke, Chris Schagen, Alexander Ljung, Eric Quidenus-Wahlforss and Andreas Bodczek.</p>
<p>Filip Dames, partner at Cherry Ventures, said he and the founders had known each other from Fyber, and when they came to him with Weflow, Dames was “happy to be a support on this journey.”</p>

<p>When Dames looked across this firm’s portfolio, he noted that most startups began with sales, a process that is hard to ramp up, especially when sales tools are “expensive and clunky.”</p>
<p>“With the ability to build something on top of Salesforce, there is a wide canvas in which direction the company can go,” he added. “Janis and Henrik are on a mission in a space that is large enough to create venture returns. Salesforce brings in $20 billion in revenue, and that enables a lot of new businesses to be created. By making the interface more fun to use, you can spend more time with the customer.”</p>
<p>In the last couple of months, Basten and Zech have built up a team of 10, and there are 15 co-development partners piloting the product currently, with a handful being added each week. Zech says the product will launch early next year.</p>
<p>They will be using the new funding to invest in marketing and product development. Weflow is product-led and will eventually have a free version, Zech added.</p>
<p>“We want to help everyone because the problem is very well understood by whoever you talk to about Salesforce, so we have an interest in solving this and have a good starting point,” he said.</p>
