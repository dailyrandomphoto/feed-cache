					<description><![CDATA['I think you want insight from people who understand how human beings listen and learn and grow.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this month, Cowboy Ventures&#8217; Ted Wang joined us at TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising, where he spoke about executive coaching and why he encourages founders in his portfolio to have a CEO coach. Wang, who has an executive coach himself, sees coaching as a key way to drive sustained personal growth, a factor that he believes separates the middling CEOs from the best ones.</p>
<h2>Why CEOs need coaching</h2>
<p>Just like professional athletes at the top of their game still need coaching, executives can need external validation and comment on where they are and aren&#8217;t delivering, Wang says. These insights can be tough for executives to catch on their own and might require a level of honesty that can be challenging for a CEO to expect from anyone involved with their company.</p>
<blockquote><p>Roger Federer &#8212; the famous tennis player who has won 20 Grand Slam events &#8212; he has a coach, but he doesn&#8217;t just have a coach, he has a coach for tennis. I&#8217;m pretty sure Roger knows the rules of the game and all the different strokes he needs to hit, so why would he have a coach? The answer is really that it&#8217;s about having a second set of eyes; when you&#8217;re in the moment … it&#8217;s hard to be able to see yourself and assess yourself. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 4:52)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Coaches can help entrepreneurs reflect and reframe the things being communicated with them.</p>
<blockquote><p>A good example &#8212; you might be at a board meeting and one of your board members is being critical of your VP of marketing, and one way to think of that is &#8220;Oh, OK, here are some things we need to solve for this person,&#8221; but another point of view that a coach might open your eyes to, is actually maybe this person thinks you&#8217;re not hiring the right people. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 8:59)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>While advisers can help startups navigate tactical situations, therapists may be more focused on helping clients navigate emotional states and improve themselves. Coaching exists in a very nebulous gray area between startup advisers and licensed therapists, Wang says, but coaching is more focused on improving yourself as a business leader rather than solving a particularly vexing startup issue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://vochi.ai/">VOCHI</a>, a Belarus-based startup behind a clever computer vision-based video editing app used by online creators, has raised an additional $2.4 million in a &#8220;late-seed&#8221; round that follows the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/vochi/">initial $1.5 million round</a> led by Ukraine-based Genesis Investments last year. The new funds follow a period of significant growth for the mobile tool, which is now used by over 500,000 people per month and has achieved a $4 million-plus annual run rate in a year&#8217;s time.</p>
<p>Investors in the most recent round include TA Ventures, Angelsdeck, A.Partners, Startup Wise Guys, Kolos VC, and angels from other Belarus-based companies like Verv and Bolt. Along with the fundraise, VOCHI is elevating the company&#8217;s first employee, Anna Bulgakova, who began as head of marketing, to the position of co-founder and Chief Product Officer.</p>
<p>According to VOCHI co-founder and CEO lya Lesun, the company&#8217;s idea was to provide an easy way for people to create professional edits that could help them produce unique and trendy content for social media that could help them stand out and become more popular. To do so, VOCHI leverages a proprietary computer-vision-based video segmentation algorithm that applies various effects to specific moving objects in a video or to images in static photos.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;To get this result, there are two trained [convolutional neural networks] to perform semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation and Instance Segmentation,&#8221; explains Lesun, of VOCHI&#8217;s technology. &#8220;Our team also developed a custom rendering engine for video effects that enables instant application in 4K on mobile devices. And it works perfectly without quality loss,&#8221; he adds. It works pretty fast, too &#8212; effects are applied in just seconds.</p>

<p>The company used the initial seed funding to invest in marketing and product development, growing its catalog to over 80 unique effects and more than 30 filters.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2181216" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2181216" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2181216" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VOCHI.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="351" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VOCHI.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VOCHI.png?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VOCHI.png?resize=300,155 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VOCHI.png?resize=768,397 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VOCHI.png?resize=680,351 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VOCHI.png?resize=1536,794 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VOCHI.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2181216" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> VOCHI</p></div></p>
<p>Today, the app offers a number of tools that let you give a video a particular aesthetic (like a dreamy vibe, artistic feel, or 8-bit look, for example). It can also highlight the moving content with glowing lines, add blurs or motion, apply different filters, insert 3D objects into the video, add glitter or sparkles, and much more.</p>
<p>In addition to editing their content directly, users can swipe through a vertical home feed in the app where they can view the video edits others have applied to their own content for inspiration. When they see something they like, they can then tap a button to use the same effect on their own video. The finished results can then be shared out to other platforms, like Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok.</p>
<p>Though based in Belarus, most of VOCHI&#8217;s users are young adults from the U.S. Others hail from Russia, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and parts of Europe, Lesun says.</p>
<p>Unlike some of its video editor rivals, VOCHI offers a robust free experience where around 60% of the effects and filters are available without having to pay, along with other basic editing tools and content. More advanced features, like effect settings, unique presents and various special effects require a subscription. This subscription, however, isn&#8217;t cheap &#8212; it&#8217;s either $7.99 per week or $39.99 for 12 weeks. This seemingly aims the subscription more at professional content creators rather than a casual user just looking to have fun with their videos from time to time. (A one-time purchase of $150 is also available, if you prefer.)</p>
<p>To date, around 20,000 of VOCHI&#8217;s 500,000 monthly active users have committed to a paid subscription, and that number is growing at a rate of 20% month-over-month, the company says.</p>

<p>The numbers VOCHI has delivered, however, aren&#8217;t as important as what the startup has been through to get there.</p>
<p>The company has been growing its business at a time when a dictatorial regime has been cracking down on opposition, leading to arrests and violence in the country. Last year, employees from U.S.-headquartered enterprise startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/05/pandadoc-employees-arrested-in-belarus-after-founders-protest-against-lukashenko-regime/">PandaDoc were arrested</a> in Minsk by the Belarus police, in an act of state-led retaliation for their protests against President Alexander Lukashenko. In April, Imaguru, the country’s main startup hub, event and co-working space in Minsk &#8212; and birthplace of a number of startups, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/09/facebook-acquires-video-filter-app-msqrd-to-square-up-to-snapchat/">MSQRD, which was acquired by Facebook</a> &#8212; was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/belarusian-regimes-thugs-shut-down-imaguru-the-countrys-key-startup-hub/">also shut down by the Lukashenko regime</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, VOCHI was being featured as App of the Day in the App Store across 126 countries worldwide, and growing revenues to around $300,000 per month.</p>
<p>&#8220;Personal videos take an increasingly important place in our lives and for many has become a method of self-expression. VOCHI helps to follow the path of inspiration, education and provides tools for creativity through video,&#8221; said Andrei Avsievich, General Partner at Bulba Ventures, where VOCHI was incubated. &#8220;I am happy that users and investors love VOCHI, which is reflected both in the revenue and the oversubscribed round.&#8221;</p>
<p>The additional funds will put VOCHI on the path to a Series A as it continues to work to attract more creators, improve user engagement, and add more tools to the app, says Lesun.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two Democratic senators introduced a bill Thursday that would strip away the liability shield that social media platforms hold dear when those companies boost anti-vaccine conspiracies and other kinds of health misinformation.</p>
<p>The Health Misinformation Act, introduced by Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), would create a new carveout in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to hold platforms liable for algorithmically promoted health misinformation and conspiracies. Platforms rely on Section 230 to protect them from legal liability for the vast amount of user-created content they host.</p>
<p>&#8220;For far too long, online platforms have not done enough to protect the health of Americans,&#8221; Klobuchar said. &#8220;These are some of the biggest, richest companies in the world and they must do more to prevent the spread of deadly vaccine misinformation.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The bill would specifically alter Section 230&#8217;s language to revoke liability protections in the case of &#8220;health misinformation that is created or developed through the interactive computer service&#8221; if that misinformation is amplified through an algorithm. The proposed exception would only kick in during a declared national public health crisis, like the advent of COVID-19, and wouldn&#8217;t apply in normal times. The bill would task the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) with defining health misinformation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Features that are built into technology platforms have contributed to the spread of misinformation and disinformation, with social media platforms incentivizing individuals to share content to get likes, comments, and other positive signals of engagement, which rewards engagement rather than accuracy,&#8221; the bill reads.</p>
<p>The bill also makes mention of the <a href="https://www.counterhate.com/disinformationdozen">&#8220;disinformation dozen&#8221;</a> — just 12 people, including anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and a grab bag of other conspiracy theorists, who account for a massive swath of the anti-vax misinformation ecosystem. Many of the individuals on the list still openly spread their messaging through social media accounts on Twitter, Facebook and other platforms.</p>
<p>Section 230&#8217;s defenders generally view the idea of new carveouts to the law as dangerous. Because Section 230 is such a foundational piece of the modern internet, enabling everything from Yelp and Reddit to the comment section below this post, they argue that the potential for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/safe-tech-act-section-230-warner/">unforeseen second-order effects</a> means the law should be left intact.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cJZpuGBTfI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/safe-tech-act-section-230-warner/">The SAFE TECH Act offers Section 230 reform, but the law&#8217;s defenders warn of major side effects</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The SAFE TECH Act offers Section 230 reform, but the law&#8217;s defenders warn of major side effects&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/safe-tech-act-section-230-warner/embed/#?secret=cJZpuGBTfI" data-secret="cJZpuGBTfI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But some members of Congress — both Democrats and Republicans — see Section 230 as a valuable lever in their quest to regulate major social media companies. While the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/biden-jonathan-kanter-doj/">White House is pursuing its own path</a> to craft consequences for overgrown tech companies through the Justice Department and the FTC, Biden&#8217;s office said earlier this week that the president is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/20/politics/white-house-section-230-facebook/index.html">&#8220;reviewing&#8221; Section 230</a> as well. But <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/trump-section-230-ndaa/">as Trump also discovered</a>, weakening Section 230 is a task that only Congress is positioned to accomplish — and even that is still a long shot.</p>
<p>While the new Democratic bill is narrowly targeted as far as proposed changes to Section 230 go, it&#8217;s also unlikely to attract bipartisan support.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="tv5qMrk5w7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/hype-machine-sinan-aral/">MIT professor wants to overhaul &#8216;The Hype Machine&#8217; that powers social media</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Republicans are also interest in stripping away some of Big Tech&#8217;s liability protections, but generally hold the view that platforms remove too much content rather than too little. Republicans are also more likely to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-has-blocked-sen-johnson-for-spreading-covid-misinformation-2021-6">sow misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines</a> themselves, framing vaccination as a partisan issue. Whether the bill goes anywhere, it&#8217;s clear that an alarming portion of Americans have no intention of getting vaccinated — even with a much more contagious variant on the rise and colder months on the horizon.</p>
<p>&#8220;As COVID-19 cases rise among the unvaccinated, so has the amount of misinformation surrounding vaccines on social media,&#8221; Luján said of the proposed changes to Section 230. &#8220;Lives are at stake.&#8221;</p>

			E-commerce in LatAm has taken off at a compound annual industry growth rate of 16% over the past five years.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>The holdout: Latin America</h2>
<p>Venture capitalists have been investing heavily in last-mile delivery over the past five years on a global scale, but Latin America (LatAm) has lagged behind. Over $11 billion has been invested globally in last-mile logistics over the past decade, but Latin America only saw about $1 billion over the same period (Source: PitchBook and WIND Ventures research).</p>
<p>Within this, only about $300 million was in Spanish-speaking Latin America — a surprisingly small amount for a region that has 110 million more consumers than in the U.S.</p>
<p>Brazil-based <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-01/softbank-backed-loggi-valued-near-2-billion-in-funding-round">Loggi</a> accounts for about 60% of last-mile VC investment in Latin America, but it only operates in Brazil. That leaves major Spanish countries like Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Argentina without a leading independent last-mile logistics company.</p>
<p>In these countries, about 60% of the last-mile delivery market is dominated by small, informal companies or independent drivers using their own trucks. This results in inefficiencies due to a lack of technologies such as route optimization as well as a lack of operating scale. These issues are quickly becoming more pronounced as e-commerce in LatAm has taken off at a compound annual industry growth rate of 16% over the past five years.</p>
<p>Retailers are missing an opportunity to give customers what they want. Customers today expect free, reliable same- or next-day delivery — on-time, all the time, and without damage or theft. All of these are challenging in LatAm. Theft, in particular, is a significant problem, because unprofessional drivers often steal products out for delivery and then sell them for a profit. Cost is a problem, too, because free same- and next-day deliveries are simply not available in many places.</p>
<h2>Operational and technological roadblocks abound</h2>
<p>Why does Latin America lag when it comes to the last mile? First, traditional LatAm e-commerce delivery involves multiple time-consuming steps: Products are picked up from the retailer, delivered to a cross-dock, distributed to a warehouse, delivered to a second cross-dock, and then finally delivered to the customer.</p>
<p>By comparison, modern delivery operations are much simpler. Products are picked up from the retailer, delivered to a cross-dock, and then delivered directly to the customer. There’s no need for warehousing and an extra pre-warehouse cross-dock.</p>
<p>And those are just the operational challenges. Lack of technology also plays a significant role. Most delivery coordination and routing in LatAm are still done via a spreadsheet or pen and paper.</p>
<p>Dispatchers have to manually pick up a phone to call drivers and dispatch them. In the U.S., computerized optimization algorithms dramatically cut both delivery cost and time by automatically finding the most efficient route (e.g., packing the most deliveries possible on a truck along the route) and automatically dispatching the driver that can most efficiently complete the route based on current location, capacity and experience with the route. These algorithms are almost unheard of in the Latin America retail logistics sector.</p>
<h2>Major retail brands are the last-mile catalyst<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Waymo, Google’s former self-driving car project that’s now an independent business unit under Alphabet, is expanding its presence in the eastern U.S. The company said Thursday it would be opening offices in Pittsburgh, joining a growing suite of companies developing and testing autonomous vehicle technology in the Steel City.</p>
<p>The company will start by hiring around a dozen engineers, a source familiar with the move told TechCrunch, and they’ll co-locate in Google’s existing offices in the Bakery Square district. As of Thursday, only around three open positions for the Pittsburgh area were listed on Waymo’s website, but the company will be adding more roles soon.</p>
<p>Some of the new team will come from Pittsburgh-based RobotWits, a tech startup focused on autonomous vehicle decision-making. That includes RobotWits’ founder and CEO Maxim Likhachev, and other members of its engineering and technical team. While Waymo did not technically acquire the startup, it did acquire RobotWits&#8217; IP rights, the source said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are no current plans to deploy the so-called Waymo Driver, its autonomous driving platform, in Pittsburgh, the source added. Instead, the new team will work on motion planning development, real-time route planning and developing Driver. Thus far, Driver has seen deployment in the Phoenix, Arizona metro area. Its Waymo Via trucking and cargo service will be deployed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/waymo-and-jb-hunt-partner-to-bring-autonomous-trucks-to-texas-in-new-pilot/">in a test run</a> with trucking logistics company J.B. Hunt Transport Services in Texas.</p>
<p>AV tech rivals Aurora, Motional, Argo AI have already established offices in the city; combined with talent at Carnegie Melon University, the city has established itself as a bona fide hub for autonomous engineering development. Pittsburgh is also home to many smaller AV startups, including Locomation, which is working on autonomous trucks.</p>
<p>Waymo’s Pittsburgh location will join its network of offices in Mountain View, San Francisco, Phoenix, New York, Dallas and Hyderabad, India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absci Corp., a Vancouver company behind a multifaceted drug development platform, went public on Thursday. It’s another sign of snowballing interest in new approaches to drug development &#8212; a traditionally risky business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absci focuses on speeding drug development in the preclinical stages. The company has developed and acquired a handful of tools that can predict drug candidates, identify potential therapeutic targets and test therapeutic proteins on billions of cells and identify which ones are worth pursuing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are offering a fully integrated end-to-end solution for pharmaceutical drug development,” Absci founder Sean McClain tells TechCrunch. “Think of this as the Google index search for protein drug discovery and biomanufacturing.” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IPO was initially priced at $16 per share, with a pre-money valuation of about $1.5 billion, </span><a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-21-014101/abscis-1a4.htm#i8a03bb75979e49c49617dec3b9c42425_16"><span style="font-weight: 400;">per S-1 filings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is offering 12.5 million shares of common stock, with plans to raise $200 million. However, Absci stock has already ballooned to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=absci+stock&amp;oq=absci+stock&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j35i39j0i20i131i263i433j69i59j69i60l2.2401j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">$21 per share as of writing</a>. Common stock is trading under the ticker “ABSI.”</span><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has elected to go public now, McClain says, to increase the company’s ability to attract and retain new talent. “As we continue to rapidly grow and scale, we need access to the best talent, and the IPO gives us amazing visibility for talent acquisition and retention,” says McClain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absci was founded in 2011 with a focus on manufacturing proteins in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">E. coli</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By 2018, the company had launched its first commercial product called SoluPro &#8212; a bioengineered E. coli system that can build complex proteins. In 2019, the company scaled this process up by implementing a “protein printing” platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its founding Absci has grown to 170 employees and raised $230 million &#8212; the most recent influx was a $125 million crossover financing round closed in June 2020 led by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casdin Capital and Redmile Group. But this year, two major acquisitions have rounded out Absci’s offerings from protein manufacturing and testing to AI-enabled drug development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January 2021, Absci acquired Denovium, a company using deep learning AI to categorize and predict the behavior of proteins. Denovium’s “engine” had been trained on more than 100 million proteins. In June, the company also acquired Totient, a biotech company that analyzes the immune system’s response to certain diseases. At the time of Totient&#8217;s acquisition, the company had already reconstructed 4,500 antibodies gleaned from immune system data from 50,000 patients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absci already had protein manufacturing, evaluation and screening capabilities, but the Totient acquisition allowed it to identify potential targets for new drugs. The Denovium acquisition added an AI-based engine to aid in protein discovery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we&#8217;re doing is now feeding [our own data] into deep learning models and so that is why we acquired Denovium. Prior to Totient we were doing drug discovery and cell line development. This [acquisition] allows us to go fully integrated where we can now do target discovery as well,” McClain says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These two acquisitions place Absci into a particularly active niche in the drug development world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To start with, there’s been some noteworthy fiscal interest in developing new approaches to drug development, even after decades of low returns on drug R&amp;D. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first half of 2021, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported that new drug developers raised about </span><a href="https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/data-insights/ipo/biotech-listings-shows-few-signs-cooling"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$9 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in IPOs on Western exchanges. This is despite the fact that drug development is traditionally high risk. R&amp;D returns for biopharmaceuticals hit a record low of 1.6% in 2019, and have rebounded to only about 2.5%, a Deloitte 2021 </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/deloitte-uk-measuring-the-return-from-pharmaceutical-innovation-2021.pdf#page=8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report notes. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the world of drug development, we’ve seen AI play an increasingly large role. That same Deloitte report notes that “most biopharma companies are attempting to integrate AI into drug discovery, and development processes.” And, drug discovery projects received the greatest amount of AI investment dollars in 2020, according to Stanford University’s Artificial Intelligence Index </span><a href="https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-AI-Index-Report_Master.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More recently, the outlook on the use of AI in drug development has been bolstered by companies that have moved a candidate through the stages of preclinical development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, Insilico Medicine, a Hong Kong-based startup, announced that it had brought an AI-identified drug candidate for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis through the preclinical testing stages &#8212; a feat that helped close a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/a-i-drug-discovery-platform-insilico-medicine-announces-255-million-in-series-c-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$255 million Series C round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Founder Alexander Zharaonkov told TechCrunch the PI drug would begin a clinical trial on the drug late this year or early next year. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AI drug discovery platform Insilico Medicine announces $255 million in Series C funding&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/a-i-drug-discovery-platform-insilico-medicine-announces-255-million-in-series-c-funding/embed/#?secret=C9iAvrdh18" data-secret="C9iAvrdh18" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a hand in AI and in protein manufacturing, Absci has already positioned itself in a crowded, but hype-filled space. But going forward, the company will still have to work out the details of its business model.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absci is pursuing a partnership business model with drug manufacturers. This means that the company doesn’t have plans to run clinical trials of its own. Rather, it expects to earn revenue through “milestone payments” (conditional upon reaching certain stages of the drug development process) or, if drugs are approved, royalties on sales.</span><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This does offer some advantages, says McClain. The company is able to sidestep the risk of drug candidates failing after millions of R&amp;D cash is poured into testing and can invest in developing “hundreds” of drug candidates at once. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, Absci does have nine currently “active programs” with drug makers. The company’s cell line manufacturing platforms are in use in drug testing programs at eight biopharma companies, including Merck, Astellas and Alpha Cancer technologies (the rest are undisclosed). Five of these projects are in the preclinical stage, one is in Phase 1 clinical trials, one is in a Phase 3 clinical trial and the last is focused on animal health, per the company’s S-1 filing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One company, Astellas, is currently using Absci’s discovery platforms. But McClain notes that Absci has only just rolled out its drug discovery capabilities this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, none of these partners have formally licensed any of Absci’s platforms for clinical or commercial use. McClain notes that the nine active programs have milestones and royalty “potentials” associated with them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company does have some ground to make up when it comes to profitability. So far this year, Absci has generated about $4.8 million in total revenue &#8212; up from about $2.1 million in 2019. Still, the costs have remained high, and S-1 filings note that the company has incurred net losses in the past two years. In 2019, the company reported $6.6 million in net losses in 2019 and $14.4 million in net losses in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s S-1 chalks up these losses to expenditures related to cost of research and development, establishing an intellectual property portfolio, hiring personnel, raising capital and providing support for these activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absci has recently completed the construction of a 77,000-square-foot facility, notes McClain. So going forward the company does foresee the potential to increase the scale of its operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the immediate future, the company plans to use money raised from the IPO to grow the number of programs using Absci’s technology, invest in R&amp;D and continue to refine the company’s new AI-based products. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram head Adam Mosseri <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRot2ucpUoA/">confirmed</a> the company is testing a new feature called &#8220;Limits,&#8221; which would give users the ability to temporary lock down their accounts when they&#8217;re being targeted by a flood of harassment. The announcement of the new feature was made today during a video where Mosseri condemned the recent racism that took place on Instagram&#8217;s platform following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2020_Final">Euro 2020 final,</a> and noted the company was working on improvements to both internal and customer-facing tools to help address this problem.</p>
<p>The company had previously commented on and condemned the racist abuse, which had seen England footballers Bukayo Saka, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/12/england-players-racism-euros-defeat/">viciously harassed</a> by angry fans making racist comments after the team&#8217;s defeat earlier this month. Mosseri <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57848106">explained at the time</a> the company was using technology to try to prioritize user reports, and it mistakenly marked some reports as benign comments instead of referring them to human moderators. One of the possible complications was that many of the harassing comments were using emoji, which Instagram&#8217;s systems may have struggled to understand given emoji can have different meanings in different contexts.</p>
<p>Today, Mosseri again acknowledged Instagram&#8217;s mistake and noted it has since fixed the issue. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2020_Final">He said</a> Instagram had been proactively sweeping the footballers&#8217; comments, but hadn&#8217;t anticipated the wave of user reports.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He also pointed out that Instagram receives millions of user reports per day and even getting 1% of them wrong leads to tens of thousands of problematic posts that remain on the platform in error.</p>
<p>Mosseri then mentioned several user-facing tools that could help people deal with harassment more directly on their own accounts to prevent abuse. This includes Instagram&#8217;s tools like Block and <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/instagram-launches-restrict-feature-to-help-stop-bullying/">Restrict</a>. The latter is tool that allows users to approve a user&#8217;s comments before anyone else sees them or read someone&#8217;s messages without sending read receipts. Another <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/instagram-launches-tools-to-filter-out-abusive-dms-based-on-keywords-and-emojis-and-to-block-people-even-on-new-accounts/">more recently added tool called Hidden Words</a> lets users block certain keywords in both comments and direct messages.</p>
<p>He added that the Limits feature could have helped the footballers, as it would have offered simple settings to limit unwanted comments and reactions.</p>
<p>The feature had been <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1413197700745547776">spotted</a> earlier this month by social media consultant Matt Navarra, who shared screenshots of how it worked, but Instagram had yet to formally announce it.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here’s a few more screenshots of Instagram’s ‘Limits’ features <a href="https://t.co/ssR7VmpG7m">pic.twitter.com/ssR7VmpG7m</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1413197717208190980?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In the images that were shared, users with the feature would find a new section called Limits in Instagram&#8217;s privacy controls that explained that they could temporarily limit comments and messages from specific groups of followers.</p>
<p>Users could then toggle on or off groups to limit, including recent followers and accounts that are not following you, as these could include accounts that were spam or those created just to harass you. As is often the case, when there&#8217;s a flood of incoming abuse, it will not come from an account&#8217;s longtime followers, but rather from newcomers who have sought out the account just to harass them.</p>
<p>The feature will also allow users to set a duration for the Limits in terms of a number of days or even weeks.</p>
<p>An Instagram spokesperson also confirmed the feature worked as the images show, noting it would be a tool that would help people manage &#8220;intense instances of harassment or abuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re in high school and you are going through a breakup or you just switched schools. Or maybe you are a professional footballer and you&#8217;re receiving a lot of harassment,&#8221; explained Mosseri, when detailing how Limits could be useful in different situations. &#8220;Whatever it is, we know that people sometimes are in temporary moments of real risk of pain, and we want to give them tools to protect themselves in those situations,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Instagram declined to say when the feature would become publicly available, but noted it&#8217;s being tested on mobile in select countries for the time being.</p>

		Denis Mars is the CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://www.proxy.com/">Proxy</a>, which designs and builds privacy-first, human-led, identity technologies. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Over the years, I’ve had a front-row seat to the future of technology.</p>
<p>In my role at Y Combinator as director of admissions, I saw hundreds of startup pitches. Many shared a particular attribute: They followed the path of quickly growing users and monetizing the data extracted from the user.</p>
<p>As time went on, I began to see the full picture of what our technologies were creating: A “Minority Report” world where our every move is tracked and monetized. Some companies, like Facebook, lived by the mantra “move fast, break things.” Not only did they break things, they failed us by propagating disinformation and propaganda that, ultimately, cost some people their lives.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And that happened because of a growth-at-all-costs mindset. Some of the biggest consumer-facing Silicon Valley companies in the 21st century flourished by using data to sell ads with little or no consideration for user privacy or security. We have some of the brightest minds in technology; if we really wanted to, we could change things so that, at the very least, people wouldn’t have to worry about privacy and the security of their information.</p>
<p>We could move toward a model where people have more control over their own data and where Silicon Valley explores innovations in privacy and data security. While there are multiple long-term approaches and potential new business models to explore, there are ways to approach a privacy-first mindset in the near term. Here are a couple of ways to start moving toward a future in which people can have control over their data.</p>
<h2>Workplace applications should lead the charge in enabling more secure identity technologies</h2>
<p>We need to approach technology by consciously designing a future where technology works for humans, businesses and society in a secure and ethical way.</p>
<p>Approaching technological growth without understanding or considering the consequences has eroded trust in Silicon Valley. We must do better &#8212; and we can start in the workplace by better protecting personal data through self-sovereign identity, an approach that gives people control and ownership over their digital identity.</p>
<p>Using the workplace as a starting point for better privacy and security of people’s digital identities makes sense because many technologies that have been widely adopted &#8212; think personal computers, the internet, mobile phones and email &#8212; started out in the workplace before they became household technologies, thereby inheriting the foundational principles. With a return to office life on the horizon, there’s no better time than now to reexamine how we might adopt new practices in our workplaces.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			We could move toward a model where people have more control over their own data and where Silicon Valley explores innovations in privacy and data security.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>So how would employers do this? For starters, they can use the return to office as an impetus for contactless access and digital IDs, which protect against physical and digital data breaches, the latter of which are becoming more common.</p>
<p>Employees could enter offices through their digital IDs, or tokenized IDs, which are stored securely on their phones. They will no longer need to use plastic cards with their personal information and photo imprinted on them, which are easy to fake or duplicate, improving security for both the employer and employee.</p>
<p>Contactless access isn’t a big leap nowadays, either. The pandemic primed us for digital identification &#8212; because the use of contactless payment accelerated due to COVID, the change to contactless ID will be seamless for many.</p>
<h2>Invest in critical privacy-centric infrastructure</h2>
<p>Tokenized identification puts the power in the user’s hands. This is crucial not just for workplace access and identity, but for a host of other, even more important reasons. Tokenized digital IDs are encrypted and can only be used once, making it nearly impossible for anyone to view the data included in the digital ID should the system be breached. It’s like Signal, but for your digital IDs.</p>
<p>As even more sophisticated technologies roll out, more personal data will be produced (and that means more data is vulnerable). It’s not just our driver’s licenses, credit cards or Social Security numbers we must worry about. Our biometrics and personal health-related data, like our medical records, are increasingly online and accessed for verification purposes. Encrypted digital IDs are incredibly important because of the prevalence of hacking and identity theft. Without tokenized digital IDs, we are all vulnerable.</p>
<p>We saw what happened with the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack recently. It crippled a large portion of the U.S. pipeline system for weeks, showing that critical parts of our infrastructure are extremely vulnerable to breaches.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we need to think about making technology that serves humanity, not vice versa. We also need to ask ourselves if the technology we create is beneficial not just to the user, but to society in general. One way to build technology that better serves humanity is to ensure that it protects users and their values. Self-sovereign identity will be key in our future as other technologies arise. Among other things, we will see our digital wallets house far more than just credit cards, making the need for secure digital IDs more critical. Most importantly, people and companies just need control over their own data, period.</p>
<p>Given the broader general awareness of privacy and security in recent years, employers must take the threat of personal-data vulnerability seriously and lead the way in self-sovereign identity. Through the initial step of contactless access and digital IDs in the workplace, we can begin to inch closer toward a more secure future, at least in terms of our own data and identity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://play.date">Playdate</a>, the adorable whimsy-and-nostalgia-box/handheld game system built by Panic (with some help from Teenage Engineering), has taken one more big step toward reality: it has an official preorder date. And it&#8217;s soon!</p>
<p>The company announced this morning that preorders for the handheld will go live on July 29th at 10 a.m. Pacific.</p>
<p>Looking to get one from the first batch? <strong>Here&#8217;s the other stuff you need to know:</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li>The handheld will cost $179, and they&#8217;ll be selling an optional case accessory for $29. They&#8217;re offering both as a bundle for $199, saving you a couple bucks if you already know you want both. No word yet on when the previously announced docking station will go on sale.</li>
<li>It sounds like the actual ship date still isn&#8217;t fully locked in, but Panic says the first batch (20,000 units or so) should start going out &#8220;towards the end of the year,&#8221; with additional units going out in 2022. The company stresses that they&#8217;re not capping preorders so they can&#8217;t really &#8220;sell out,&#8221; but ordering earlier means getting it sooner.</li>
<li>Preorders will be capped at two per person.</li>
</ul>
<p>Panic first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/panics-playmate-is-a-pint-sized-gaming-machine-with-a-season-of-12-intriguing-titles/">announced the Playdate in 2019. </a>Games on the Playdate are released in &#8220;seasons&#8221;; in season one, two new titles will be released each week for 12 weeks. As experimental as it is charming, Panic is pretty open about what to expect of the titles. From their product page: &#8220;Some are short. Some are long. Will you love them all? Probably not. Will you have a great time trying them? Absolutely.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian, the Amazon-backed electric automaker that aims to be the first to bring an EV pickup truck to market, plans to open a second U.S. manufacturing factory, sources told TechCrunch, confirming an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/rivian-us-plant/exclusive-amazon-backed-rivian-confirms-plan-for-second-u-s-assembly-plant-idUSL1N2OX2H4">earlier report from Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>Rivian wouldn&#8217;t elaborate on when it planned to build the factory, but did confirm it was in the process of identifying a site for a second plant. Reuters reported that the factory, dubbed Project Tera, would also include battery cell production, a detail that would drive up the cost and size of the factory.</p>
<p>“While it&#8217;s early in an evolving process, Rivian is exploring locations for a second U.S. manufacturing facility,&#8221; spokesperson Amy Mast said in an emailed statement. &#8220;We look forward to working with a supportive, technology-forward community in order to create a partnership as strong as the one we have with Normal, Illinois.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The news comes a week after Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe sent a letter to customers that the company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/rivian-delays-deliveries-of-r1t-r1s-electric-vehicles-again/">pushing back deliveries</a> of its long-awaited R1T electric pickup truck and R1S SUV several more months due to delays in production caused by “cascading impacts of the pandemic,” particularly the ongoing global shortage of semiconductor chips. The R1T deliveries will begin in September with the R1S to follow “shortly,” Scaringe wrote in the message.</p>
<p>Rivian plans to assemble its consumer products — the R1T, R1S — as well as the commercial delivery vans slated for Amazon at its factory in Normal, Illinois. That factory, which once produced the Mitsubishi Eclipse through a joint venture between Mitsubishi and Chrysler Corporation, has been completely updated and expanded.</p>
<p>The Normal factory has two separate production lines producing vehicles. One is dedicated for the R1 vehicles and other line is for its commercial vans. Amazon ordered 100,000 of these vans, with deliveries starting in 2021.</p>
<p>The automaker has raised more than $8 billion from a diverse set of backers that includes Ford, Cox Automotive, T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., Fidelity Management and Research Company, Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, Coatue and D1 Capital Partners. That capital will be needed to keep its 7,000-person workforce running and while building an assembly factory, a project that will cost at least $1 billion if it follows industry estimates.</p>

					<description><![CDATA['I think successful growth folks tend to be voracious learners; they're resourceful and have that sort of get-shit-done mindset; they're ultimately simplifiers and actually generalists.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With more venture funding flowing into the startup ecosystem than ever before, there&#8217;s never been a better time to be a growth expert.</p>
<p>At TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising earlier this month, Greylock Partners&#8217; Mike Duboe dug into a number of lessons and pieces of wisdom he&#8217;s picked up leading growth at a number of high-growth startups, including StitchFix. His advice spanned hiring, structure and analysis, with plenty of recommendations for where growth teams should be focusing their attention and resources.</p>
<h2>How to define growth</h2>
<p>Before Duboe&#8217;s presentation kicked off, he spent some time zeroing in on a definition of growth, which he cautioned can mean many different things at many different companies. Being so context-dependent means that &#8220;being good at growth&#8221; is more dependent on honing capabilities rather than following a list of best practices.</p>
<blockquote><p>Growth is something that&#8217;s blatantly obvious and poorly defined in the startup world, so I do think it&#8217;s important to give a preamble to all of this stuff. First and foremost, growth is very context dependent; some teams treat it as a product function, others marketing, some sales or &#8220;other.&#8221; Some companies will do growth with a dedicated growth team; others have abandoned the team but still do it equally well. Some companies will goal growth teams purely on acquisition, others will deploy them against retention or other metrics. So, taking a step back from that, I define growth as a function that accelerates a company&#8217;s pace of learning.</p>
<p>Growth is everyone&#8217;s job; if a bunch of people in the company are working on one problem, and it&#8217;s just someone off in the corner working on growth, you probably failed at setting up the org correctly.  <em><strong>(Timestamp: 1:11)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>While growth is good, growing something that is unsustainable is an intense waste of time and money. Head of growth is often an early role that founders aim to fill, but Duboe cautioned early-stage entrepreneurs from focusing too heavily on growth before nailing the fundamentals.</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve seen many companies make the mistake of working on growth prior to nailing product-market fit. I think this mistake becomes even more common in an environment where there&#8217;s rampant VC funding, so while some of the discipline here is useful early on, I&#8217;d really encourage founders to be laser-focused on finding that fit before iterating on growth. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 2:29)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Where to focus growth energy</h2>
<p>The bulk of Duboe&#8217;s presentation focused on laying out 10 of the &#8220;most poignant and generalizable&#8221; lessons in growth that he&#8217;s learned over the years, with lessons on focus, optimization and reflection.</p>
<h3>Lesson 1: Distill your growth model (&#8220;business equation&#8221;)</h3>
<blockquote><p>Growth modeling and metric design &#8212; I view as the most fundamental part of growth. This does not require a growth team so any good head of growth should require some basic growth model to prioritize what to work on. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 3:09)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>The first point Duboe touched on was one on how to visualize your growth opportunities using models, using an example from his past role leading growth at Tilt, where his team used user state models to determine where to direct resources and look for growth opportunities.</p>
<h3>Lesson 2: Retention before acquisition</h3>
<blockquote><p>The second lesson is to prioritize retention before driving acquisition, a very obvious or intuitive lesson, but it&#8217;s also easy to forget given it&#8217;s typically less straightforward to figure out how to retain users versus acquiring new ones. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 4:19)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Retention is typically cheaper than acquiring wholly new users, Duboe noted, also highlighting how a startup focusing on retention can help them understand more about who their power users are and who exactly they should be building for.</p>
<h3>Lesson 3: Embrace ideas from all corners, but triage</h3>
<p>Bringing on new ideas is obviously a positive, but often ideas need guidelines to be helpful, and setting the right templates early on can help team members filter down their ideas while ensuring they meet the need of the organization.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla will secure nickel from the commodity production giant BHP, the automaker’s latest move to secure direct sources of raw materials that are projected to surge in demand before the decade is out.</p>
<p>BHP’s Nickel West division will supply an undisclosed amount of the mineral from its mines in Western Australia. The two companies also agreed to work together to increase battery supply chain sustainability and to identify ways to decrease carbon emissions from their respective operations using energy storage paired with renewable energy.</p>
<p>Nickel is a key mineral in lithium-ion batteries, and a cornerstone of Tesla’s next-gen battery chemistry. While many lithium-ion batteries have cathodes made from nickel, manganese and cobalt, Tesla is taking a different tack. At Tesla&#8217;s Battery Day 2020, Musk said the automaker would invest in a nickel-rich, cobalt-free cathode for some models, citing greater energy density.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tesla also hasn&#8217;t been shy about its own intention to increase battery cell production in the coming decade, aiming to produce 100 gigawatt hours of batteries by 2022, to a staggering 3 terawatt hours per year by 2030.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tesla claims it can drive battery costs down even lower with new material science innovations&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/tesla-claims-it-can-drive-battery-costs-down-even-lower-with-new-material-science-innovations/embed/#?secret=UbMN8kD6yY" data-secret="UbMN8kD6yY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>To that end, the company is moving fast to secure purchase agreements with leading nickel producers. Earlier this year, the automaker announced a partnership with a nickel producer in the French Pacific territory New Caledonia. Just a few months later, Tesla chairperson Robyn Denhlm confirmed that the company was looking to purchase around $1 billion per year in battery minerals from Australia alone.</p>
<p>Musk has repeatedly urged miners to produce more nickel. On an investment call last July, he told producers, “Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way.” At Battery Day, he reiterated his position: “In order to scale, we really need to make sure that we’re not constrained by total nickel availability,” he said. “I actually spoke with the CEOs of the biggest mining company in the world and said, ‘Please make more nickel, it’s very important.’”</p>
<p>But finding an environmentally friendly nickel source is a challenge. Some of that has to do with issues endemic to present-day recovery and smelting techniques; others are more directly manageable by mining companies. For example, nickel mining operations in Indonesia, the world’s largest producer of the metal, have come under fire for their reliance on coal and their waste disposal techniques.</p>
<p>BHP claims its operation is one of the most sustainable in the world, and Tesla’s decision to partner with it could be seen as something of a confirmation of that fact. The commodity producer in February said up to 50% of the electricity to power one of its nickel refineries would come from solar energy resources.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the world’s nickel supply is currently consumed by the steel industry. While nickel demand in the EV and energy storage sectors is currently relatively small, the <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/total-nickel-demand-by-sector-and-scenario-2020-2040">International Energy Agency</a> estimates that will increase more than 4,000% over the next 20 years — from 81 metric tons in 2020 to 3,352 metric tons by 2040.</p>
<p>Nickel West has historically been a tiny fraction of BHP’s overall business, dwarfed by its iron ore, copper and petroleum businesses. The commodity producer tried to sell Nickel West a number of times since around 2015, but it appears to have changed its tune with the forecasted groundswell of demand from the EV and energy storage sectors.</p>
<p>Industry analysts Benchmark Minerals <a href="https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/membership/tesla-bhp-strike-major-deal-in-race-for-sustainable-nickel/">estimated</a> the deal with Tesla could be worth up to 18,000 tons of nickel annually.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A large chunk of the internet dropped offline on Thursday. Some of the most popular sites, apps and services on the internet were down, including UPS and FedEx (which have since come back online), Airbnb, Fidelity, and others are reporting Steam, LastPass, and the PlayStation Network are all experiencing downtime.</p>
<p>Many other websites around the world are also affected, including media outlets in Europe.</p>
<p>What appears to be the cause is an outage at Akamai, an internet security giant that provides networking and content delivery services to companies. At around 11 a.m. ET, Akamai <a href="https://edgedns.status.akamai.com/incidents/n5zl6dythvfv">reported an issue</a> with its Edge DNS, a service that&#8217;s designed to keep websites, apps and services running smoothly and securely.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>&mdash; *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1418238318375014404?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>DNS services are critically important to how the internet works, but are known to have bugs and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/23/icann-ongoing-attacks-dns/">can be easily manipulated</a> by malicious actors. Companies like Akamai have built their own DNS services that are meant to solve some of these problems for their customers. But when things go wrong or there&#8217;s an outage, it can cause a knock-on effect to all of the customer websites and services that rely on it.</p>
<p>Akamai said it was &#8220;actively investigating the issue,&#8221; but when reached a spokesperson would not say if its outage was the cause of the disruption to other sites and services that are currently offline. A spokesperson for ThousandEyes, an internet monitoring company bought by Cisco in 2020, attributed the outage to Akamai.</p>
<p>Akamai would not say what caused the issue but that it was already in recovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have implemented a fix for this issue, and based on current observations, the service is resuming normal operations. We will continue to monitor to ensure that the impact has been fully mitigated,&#8221; Akamai told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/Akamai/status/1418257652660985858">a follow-up tweet</a>, the company said it was &#8220;not a result of a cyberattack.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the first time we&#8217;ve seen an outage this big. Last year Cloudflare, which also provides networking services to companies around the world, had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/cloudflare-dns-goes-down-taking-a-large-piece-of-the-internet-with-it/">similar outage</a> following a bug that caused major sites to stop loading, including Shopify, Discord and Politico. In November, Amazon&#8217;s cloud service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/amazon-web-services-outage-takes-a-portion-of-the-internet-down-with-it/">also stumbled</a>, which prevented it from updating its own status page during the incident. Online workspace startup Notion also had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/notion-outage-dns-domain-issues/">a high-profile outage</a> this year, forcing the company to turn to Twitter to ask for help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India’s central bank is considering launching a digital currency, according to a top executive, giving a clear indication of its intentions for the first time after previously stating that it was studying the idea.</p>
<p>T Rabi Sankar, the deputy governor of Reserve Bank of India, said at a conference today that the central bank is considering introducing the nation’s digital currency in a “phased” manner while legal changes are made to the South Asian nation’s foreign-exchange rules and IT laws.</p>
<p>The digital currency, which will be backed by sovereign, will lower the economy’s reliance on cash, enable cheaper and smoother international settlements, and protect people from the volatility of privacy cryptocurrencies, he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Every idea has to wait for its time, and the time for CBDC [central bank digital currency] is near. We have carefully evaluated the risks,” he told an audience at a conference held by think-tank Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy.</p>
<p>Sankar said the central bank’s “endeavor is that as we move forward [with the plan],” so that India’s digital currency “can reiterate its leadership position in payment systems of the world.”</p>
<p>The top executive’s remarks follows European Central Bank saying last week that it will begin a 24-month “investigation phase” that, if successful, could lead to the creation of a digital euro by 2025.</p>
<p>Also last week, China&#8217;s central bank said its digital yuan trial had reached $5.3 billion in transaction value by the end of June.</p>
<p>“Central banks have increased their attention on digital currencies,” said Sankar. &#8220;CBDC will be in the arsenal of most if not all central banks in the world. A calibrated and nuanced approach will be considered at the drawing board as well as with stakeholder consultations,” he said, adding that the central bank has been exploring the benefits and risks of issuing a sovereign CBDC for “quite some time.”</p>
<p>“We have studied specific-purpose CBDCs proposed by different central banks around the world for wholesale and retail segments. The launch of a general-purpose CBDC for population scale is being considered, and RBI is working towards a phased introduction strategy and examining use cases with little or no disruption of India’s banking and monetary systems,” he said. &#8220;However, conducting pilots in wholesale and retail segments may be a possibility in near future.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his remarks, Sankar also hinted that the central bank hasn&#8217;t changed its stand on private cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.</p>
<p>In 2018, an Indian government panel recommended banning all private cryptocurrencies and proposed up to 10 years of jail time for offenders. The panel also suggested the government to explore a digital version of the fiat currency and ways to implement it.</p>
<p>At the time, RBI said the move was necessary to curb “ring-fencing” of the country’s financial system. It had also argued that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies cannot be treated as currencies as they are not made of metal or exist in physical form, nor were they stamped by the government.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are not commodities or claims on commodities as they have no intrinsic value; some claims that they are akin to gold clearly seem opportunistic,&#8221; Sankar said today.</p>
<p>The 2018 notice from the central bank sent a panic to several local startups and companies offering services to trade in cryptocurrency. Nearly all of them have either since closed shop, or pivoted to serve other markets.</p>
<p>This proposal was challenged by several exchanges and traders, who filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court. The nation’s apex court <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/india-lifts-ban-on-cryptocurrency-trading/">ruled in their favor last year</a>. This ruling was seen as “historic” but it has yet to impact the earlier circular on the policy level. In the meantime, the country has hinted that it plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/30/india-plans-to-introduce-law-to-ban-bitcoin-other-private-cryptocurrencies/">introduce a law to ban private cryptocurrencies</a>.</p>
<p>In the agenda published on the lower house website earlier this year, a legislation sought to “prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India,” but allow “for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology [blockchain] of cryptocurrency and its uses.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://gopuff.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gopuff</a>, the &#8220;instant&#8221; grocery delivery startup that has been on an acquisition and expansion tear in the last several months to scale its business, is also racing to raise money to fuel those efforts. Documents uncovered by <a href="https://primeunicornindex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prime Unicorn Index</a> and shared with TechCrunch show that the startup has filed papers in Delaware to raise up $1 billion raise at a $14 billion pre-money valuation.</p>
<p>As with all Delaware filings, they only tell part of the story, so the company might ultimately raise more or less before the round closes. (And in this case it looks like &#8220;more.&#8221;)</p>
<p>For some funding context, it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/gopuff-new-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only in March</a> that Gopuff raised $1.15 billion at an $8.9 billion valuation. And that round came just months after a $380 million round (at a $3.8 billion) valuation. With Gopuff&#8217;s instant grocery model comes instant funding, it seems: together the three rounds would total around $2.5 billion in funding in the space of 10 months. (Investors in the company&#8217;s previous rounds have included Accel, D1 Capital Partners, Fidelity Management and Research Company, Baillie Gifford, Eldridge, Reinvent Capital, Luxor Capital, and SoftBank.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Much like the investment race in the transportation-on-demand market, a large part of the fundraising in instant grocery seems to be aimed at scaling as fast as possible to build technological, operational and customer moats.</p>
<p>So for Gopuff, some of the money it&#8217;s raised so far has been used to expand organically. That is, it&#8217;s investing to acquire new customers and build out its infrastructure &#8212; riders, &#8220;dark&#8221; stores stocked with their products, and most recently &#8220;Gopuff kitchens&#8221; &#8212; within the 650+ cities in the U.S. where it already operates its $1.95 flat fee &#8220;in minutes&#8221; delivery service. It will likely be doing so at a particularly fast pace, considering that others like DoorDash are also moving in to compete in earnest around the same model for quick deliveries of a limited selection of food and drinks, home essentials, and over-the-counter medication.</p>
<p>But alongside that, some of the cash it is amassing is also being used for acquisitions. So far, these have been limited to the U.S. and to expand Gopuff&#8217;s breadth in that market. It bought alcohol retailer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/gopuff-acquires-bevmo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BevMo for $350 million</a> in November 2020; and in June of this year Gopuff acquired logistics tech company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/delivery-service-gopuff-acquires-rideos-for-115-million-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rideOS for $115 million</a>.</p>
<p>The next stage of that acquisition process looks like it may be focused on snapping up similar companies in key markets where Gopuff wants to be in the future, particularly internationally, as it works to fill out a reported ambition of <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/gopuff-revenue-triples-but-growing-competition-to-test-expansion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reaching $1 billion in revenues this year</a> (3x last year&#8217;s numbers).</p>
<p>In June, there were <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/amazon-gopuff-are-said-to-explore-deal-for-german-startup-flink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors around that Gopuff had approached Flink</a>, an instant grocery player in Germany. While that has not gone anywhere (yet?), well-placed sources have told us &#8212; and, it seems, <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/dija-acquisition-gopuff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">others</a> &#8212; that Gopuff is also casting its international eye on England, engaging in discussions to acquire two different instant delivery companies based out of London, first <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/amazon-gopuff-are-said-to-explore-deal-for-german-startup-flink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fancy</a> back in February, and more recently, <a href="https://www.dijanow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dija</a>.</p>
<p>Gopuff also declined to comment on Dija but we have multiple, well-placed sources telling us it&#8217;s in the works. (The Fancy deal closed in May.)</p>
<p>London is a hugely competitive market for instant grocery delivery at the moment &#8212; not least because it is dense and often hard to get around, has demonstrated a strong consumer appetite for on-demand delivery services, and has a population of younger people with a decent amount of disposable income to pay a little more for convenience.</p>
<p>That speaks of opportunity, but also possibly too many hopefuls as well. In addition to Dija and Fance, we have Turkey&#8217;s Getir, backed by Sequoia and a number of others on an ambitious international roll at the moment; Gorillas (like Flink, from Berlin); Zapp; and Weezy &#8212; all offering &#8220;instant&#8221; grocery delivery. And these are just the standalone, newer startups. Still to come: established restaurant delivery players like Deliveroo that might also throw their hats into the ring.</p>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that field, we&#8217;ve heard that Dija has been struggling to raise more money, and that led to the startup looking for buyers as an alternative.</p>
<p>That is a trend that&#8217;s playing out elsewhere too: In Spain <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/instant-grocery-startup-getir-makes-its-first-acquisition-to-expand-into-spain-and-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getir earlier this month acquired Blok</a>, another new instant player that was struggling to get investors on board. We confirmed with well-placed sources that Dija had also talked with Getir in this context (that didn&#8217;t go anywhere) before Gopuff entered the picture. There will likely be more of these.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a bloodbath,&#8221; is how one big investor recently described the instant grocery market to me.</p>
<p>Given that online grocery remains a relatively minor part of the market &#8212; even with the pandemic and its habit-changing impact on e-commerce, it&#8217;s still under 10% of sales, even in the most adoption-friendly cities &#8212; there is still a lot to play for in &#8220;instant&#8221; groceries. But if this latest round shows us anything, it&#8217;s that the most promising of these delivery companies will continue raising a lot more money to position themselves as consolidators within it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Imagine a world where no one&#8217;s privacy is breached, no faces are scanned into a gargantuan database and no privacy laws are broken. This is a world that is fast approaching. Could companies simply dump the need for real-world CCTV footage, and switch to synthetic humans, acting out potential scenarios a million times over? That’s the tantalizing prospect of a new U.K. startup that has attracted funding from an influential set of investors.</p>
<p>U.K.-based <a href="https://www.mindtech.global/">Mindtech Global</a> has developed what it describes as an end-to-end synthetic data-creation platform. In plain English, its system can imagine visual scenarios such as someone&#8217;s behavior inside a store, or crossing the street. This data is then used to train AI-based computer vision systems for customers such as big retailers, warehouse operators, healthcare, transportation systems and robotics. It literally trains a &#8220;synthetic&#8221; CCTV camera inside a synthetic world.</p>
<p>It’s now closed a $3.25 million early-stage funding round led by U.K. regional backer <a href="https://www.mercia.co.uk/fund/npif-mercia-equity-finance/">NPIF – Mercia Equity Finance</a>, with <a href="https://dtl.vc/">Deeptech Labs</a> and <a href="https://www.iqt.org/">In-Q-Tel</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That last investor is significant. In-Q-Tel invests in startups that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Q-Tel">support</a> U.S. intelligence capabilities and is based in Arlington, Virginia.</p>
<p>Mindtech’s Chameleon platform is designed to help computers understand and predict human interactions. As we all know, current approaches to training AI vision systems require companies to source data such as CCTV footage. The process is fraught with privacy issues, and is costly and time-consuming. Mindtech says Chameleon solves that problem, as its customers quickly “build unlimited scenes and scenarios using photo-realistic smart 3D models”.</p>
<p>An added bonus is that these synthetic humans can be used to train AI vision systems to weed out human failings around diversity and bias.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2181000" style="width: 702px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2181000" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2181000" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mindtech-CEO-Steve-Harris.jpg" alt="Mindtech CEO Steve Harris" width="692" height="553" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mindtech-CEO-Steve-Harris.jpg 692w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mindtech-CEO-Steve-Harris.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mindtech-CEO-Steve-Harris.jpg?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mindtech-CEO-Steve-Harris.jpg?resize=680,543 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mindtech-CEO-Steve-Harris.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 692px) 100vw, 692px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2181000" class="wp-caption-text">Mindtech CEO Steve Harris. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mindtech</p></div></p>
<p>Steve Harris, CEO, Mindtech said: “Machine learning teams can spend up to 80% of their time sourcing, cleaning and organizing training data. Our Chameleon platform solves the AI training challenge, freeing the industry to focus on higher-value tasks like AI network innovation. This round will enable us to accelerate our growth, enabling a new generation of AI solutions that better understand the way humans interact with each other and the world around them.”</p>
<p>So what can you do with it? Consider the following: A kid slips from its parent’s hand at the mall. The synthetic CCTV running inside Mindtech’s scenario is trained thousands of times over how to spot it in real-time and alert staff. Another: a delivery robot meets kids playing in a street and works out how to how to avoid them. Finally: a passenger on the platform is behaving erratically too close to the rails &#8212; the CCTV is trained to automatically spot them and send help.</p>

<p>Nat Puffer, managing director (London), In-Q-Tel commented: “Mindtech impressed us with the maturity of their Chameleon platform and their commercial traction with global customers. We’re excited by the many applications this platform has across diverse markets and its ability to remove a significant roadblock in the development of smarter, more intuitive AI systems.”</p>
<p>Miles Kirby, CEO, Deeptech Labs said: “As a catalyst for deep tech success, our investment and accelerator program supports ambitious teams with novel solutions and the appetite to build world-changing companies. Mindtech’s highly experienced team are on a mission to disrupt the way AI systems are trained, and we’re delighted to support their journey.”</p>
<p>There is of course potential for darker applications, such a spotting petty theft inside supermarkets, or perhaps &#8220;optimising&#8221; hard-pressed warehouse workers in some dystopian fashion. However, in theory, Mindtech&#8217;s customers can use this platform to rid themselves of the biases of middle-managers, and better serve customers.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The co-founders set out to build an email marketing automation platform for customers that wanted to do more than email campaigns and newsletters.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.sendlane.com/">Sendlane</a>, a San Diego-based multichannel marketing automation platform, announced Thursday it raised $20 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>Five Elms Capital and others invested in the round to give Sendlane total funding of $23 million since the company was founded in 2018.</p>
<p>Though the company officially started three years ago, co-founder and CEO Jimmy Kim told TechCrunch he began working on the idea back in 2013 with two other co-founders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>They were all email marketers in different lines of business, but had some common ground in that they were all using email tools they didn’t like. The ones they did like came with too big of a price tag for a small business, Kim said. They set out to build their own email marketing automation platform for customers that wanted to do more than email campaigns and newsletters.</p>
<p>When two other companies Kim was involved in exited in 2017, he decided to put both feet into Sendlane to build it into a system that maximized revenue based on insights and integrations.</p>
<p>In late 2018, the company attracted seed funding from Zing Capital and decided in 2019 to pivot into e-commerce. “Based on our personal backgrounds and looking at the customers we worked with, we realized that is what we did best,” Kim said.</p>
<p>Today, more than 1,700 e-commerce companies use Sendlane’s platform to convert more than 100 points of their customers’ data — abandoned carts, which products sell the best and which marketing channel is working — into engaging communications aimed at driving customer loyalty. The company said it can increase revenue for customers between 20% and 40% on average.</p>
<p>The company itself is growing 100% year over year and seeing over $7 million in annual recurring revenue. It currently has 54 employees right now, and Kim expects to be at around 90 by the end of the year and 150 by the end of 2022. Sendlane currently has more than 20 open roles, he said.</p>
<p>That current and potential growth was a driver for Kim to go after the Series A funding. He said Sendlane became profitable last year, which is why it has not raised a lot of money so far. However, as the rapid adoption of e-commerce continues, Kim wants to be ready for the next wave of competition coming in, which he expects in the next year.</p>
<p>He considers companies like ActiveCampaign and Klaviyo to be in line with Sendlane, but says his company’s differentiator is customer service, boasting short wait times and chats that answer questions in less than 15 seconds.</p>
<p>He is also ready to go after the next vision, which is to unify data and insights to create meaningful interactions between customers and retailers.</p>
<p>“We want to start carving out a new space,” Kim added. “We have a ton of new products coming out in the next 12 to 18 months and want to be the single source for customer journey data insights that provides flexibility for your business to grow.”</p>
<p>Two upcoming tools include Audiences, which will unify customer data and provide insights, and an SMS product for two-way communications and enabled campaign-level sending.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The myriad emerging and longer-term transportation technologies promise to change how people and packages move about the world or within their own neighborhoods. They also present myriad regulatory and policy hurdles that lawmakers, advocates and even investors and industry executives are attempting to navigate.</p>
<p>At the center — at least in the United States — sits Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg. The small-town mayor in Indiana turned presidential candidate and now cabinet member under the Biden administration oversees public transport, highway safety and nascent technologies like autonomous vehicles. The Harvard graduate, Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University and former U.S. Navy officer is in a position to bring complexity or clarity to the future of transportation.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=petebuttigiegpost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=petebuttigiegpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disrupt 2021</a>, Secretary Buttigieg will join us for a fireside chat where we&#8217;ll dig into some of the thorniest questions around transportation and how to ensure that moving from Point A to Point B is a universal right, not a privilege. We&#8217;ll ask Buttigieg about micromobility and public transit, President Biden&#8217;s push for the federal government to use electric vehicles, autonomous vehicle guidance and new regulatory requirements around reporting vehicle crashes when an advanced driver assistance and automated driving system is engaged — a move that could spur a new wave of startups and benefit some in-car technologies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The upshot: If it involves technology that moves people and packages, we aim to talk about it.</p>
<p>Secretary Buttigieg is just one of the many high-profile speakers who will be on our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=petebuttigiegpost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=petebuttigiegpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disrupt Stage</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=petebuttigiegpost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=petebuttigiegpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Extra Crunch Stage</a>. During the three-day event, writer, director, actor and <strong>Houseplant</strong> co-founder <strong>Seth Rogen</strong> will be joined by Houseplant Chief Commercial Officer Haneen Davies and co-founder and CEO Michael Mohr to talk about the business of weed, <strong>Duolingo</strong> CEO and co-founder<strong> Luis von Ahn</strong> will discuss gamifying education and prepping for a public offering and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong will dig into the volatile world of cryptocurrency and his company&#8217;s massive direct listing earlier this year.</p>
<p>Other speakers include Twitter CISO <strong>Rinki Sethi</strong>, Calendly founder and CEO <strong>Tope Awotona</strong>, Mirror co-founder and CEO <strong>Brynn Putnam</strong>, Evil Geniuses CEO <strong>Nicole LaPointe Jameson</strong> and Andreessen Horowitz General Partner <strong>Katie Haun</strong>.</p>
