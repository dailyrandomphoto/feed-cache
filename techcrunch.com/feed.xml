										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Five-year old self-driving truck startup Embark Trucks Inc. said Wednesday it would merge with special purpose acquisition company Northern Genesis Acquisition Corp. II in a deal valued at $5.2 billion.</p>
<p>Embark takes a different approach to autonomous trucking: As opposed to manufacturing and operating a fleet of trucks themselves, which is the route rival TuSimple is taking, Embark offers its AV software as a service. Carriers and fleets can pay a per-mile subscription fee to access it. The company includes carriers Mesilla Valley Transportation and Bison Transport, and companies Anheuser-Busch InBev and HP Inc., amongst its partners.</p>
<p>Carriers purchase trucks with compatible hardware directly from OEMs, so Embark says it has designed its system to be “platform agnostic” across multiple components and manufacturers. The company says its software can simulate up to 1,200 60-second scenarios per second, and make adaptive predictions using those scenarios for the behaviour of other vehicles on the road.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Embark said in an investor presentation for the SPAC deal that it was targeting “driver-out,” or operating on roads without a safety driver, by 2023 and launching at a commercial scale across the American sunbelt the following year. However, Embark still has technical milestones yet to achieve, noting in the presentation that the software still needs to accomplish actions such as interactions with emergency vehicles, and responding to blown tires and other mechanical failures.</p>

<p>Upon closing, the transaction will inject Embark with around $615 million in gross cash proceeds, including $200 million in private investment in public equity (PIPE) funding from investors including CPP Investments, Knight-Swift Transportation, Mubadala Capital, Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global Management.</p>
<p>Embark also said former Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao was joining its board, likely a boon for a company operating in the autonomous trucking industry, which is still only authorized for commercial deployment in 24 states.</p>
<p>Embark was founded in 2016 by CEO Alex Rodrigues and CTO Brandon Moak, who worked together on autonomous driving while completing engineering degrees from Canada&#8217;s University of Waterloo. After launching out of Y Combinator, the company quickly went on to raise $117 million in total funding, including a $30 million Series B led by Sequoia Capital and a $70 million Series C led by Tiger Global Management.</p>
<p>The transaction is anticipated to close in the second half of 2021. The company joins competitor AV trucking developer Plus in going public via a SPAC merger. TuSimple opted for a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/self-driving-truck-startup-tusimple-files-to-go-public/">traditional initial public offering</a> in March.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/hunterwalk/status/1407711650442924033">this Hunter Walk tweet</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1407711957449334789">the ensuing chatter</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch</strong> recently sat down with <strong>Leading Investor</strong> from <strong>Well Known Firm</strong> to chat about their investing theses, the state of today&#8217;s venture capital market, and why prices are so high for early-stage startups.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been hunting down Leading Investor for some time, so it&#8217;s great to get their thoughts on today&#8217;s startup market and the larger venture capital industry. Let&#8217;s have some fun!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TechCrunch:</strong> To kick things off, the early-stage startup market has been super active lately. How has the accelerating cadence of deal-making impacted how you and Well Known Firm invest?</p>
<p><strong>Leading Investor:</strong> We&#8217;ve made no changes to our process. Everyone who has is weak of conviction and poor of wallet.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> Got it, got it. The rapid-fire, early-stage market, though, does seem expensive at times. At least compared to historical norms. Are you worried about overpaying for nascent startup shares?</p>
<p><strong>LI:</strong> Every deal that we&#8217;ve been a part of has been fairly priced. Every deal that we didn&#8217;t win was overpriced. Every deal we didn&#8217;t see was stupid.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> Cool. Sure. Let&#8217;s talk about the technology market more generally. Where are you seeing the most startup opportunity? Or perhaps more simply, where are you paying the most attention today for future deals?</p>
<p><strong>LI:</strong> Please consult our portfolio page. Here is a name of a startup we&#8217;ve backed. Here&#8217;s another. Those are the hot areas and the hot companies. All other areas are ice-cold, overpriced, and generally over-hyped.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> So &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>LI:</strong> Let me cut you off there to name drop Eric from Zoom, with whom I have a great relationship. Salesforce. Snowflake. On-demand pricing. Historical Twilio reference. Also have you read Recently Published Book? Someone gave me a copy and I read the dust cover. Books are good. I read them.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> Right. Turning to the venture capital market, how competitive is Well Known Firm these days? Other firms are offering more services in addition to capital than you are. Does that impact your win rate in competitive deals?</p>
<p><strong>LI:</strong> Our firm&#8217;s services are real and impactful and accretive. Other VCs offer services but don&#8217;t deliver. You have to deliver. Delivery is key. We&#8217;re like the AWS of service delivery. Except free. We only demand the right to profit from founder success while enriching ourselves as the cost of our fine, free services.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> All right. Let&#8217;s talk about the exit market. We&#8217;ve seen a pretty active IPO market, and TechCrunch has heard that SPACs are getting incredibly frisky, even pinging Series B-funded companies in case they want to go public. What&#8217;s your take on that?</p>
<p><strong>LI:</strong> Here&#8217;s a generic answer that doesn&#8217;t answer your question but ensures that my portfolio companies continue to receive all possible inbound in case we need to float a company that won&#8217;t make it as a venture-backed, private company. Public investors are dumb and will happily hold our bags. They are the valets of the investing world.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> Last question, how are returns at your firm? You&#8217;ve raised successively larger funds over the years. Is your IRR holding up as you&#8217;ve taken more capital under management?</p>
<p><strong>LI:</strong> Recall that Well Known Firm invested in Very Old Company, so our returns have historically been strong. Regarding Every Deal Since Then, it&#8217;s a bit too soon to tell. But recall Very Old Company that did well. That&#8217;s how we do things at Well Known Firm.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> Sorry one more before we let you go. Your firm still only has male partners and nearly all of them are white. Why has progress been so slow in building a more diverse team at Well Known Firm?</p>
<p><strong>LI:</strong> Sorry, I have a hard stop that started 15 second ago.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The notorious Clop ransomware operation appears to be back in business, just days after<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/ukrainian-police-arrest-multiple-clop-ransomware-gang-suspects/"> Ukrainian police arrested six alleged members of the gang</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, a law enforcement operation conducted by the National Police of Ukraine along with officials from South Korea and the U.S. saw the arrest of multiple suspects believed to be linked to the Clop <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> gang.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> It&#8217;s believed to be the first time a national law enforcement group carried out mass arrests involving a ransomware group.</span></p>
<p>The Ukrainian police also claimed at the time to have successfully shut down the server infrastructure used by the gang. But it doesn’t seem the operation was completely successful.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the Clop operation fell silent following the arrests, the gang has this week published a fresh batch of confidential data which it claims to have stolen from two new victims — a farm equipment retailer and an architects office — on its dark web site, seen by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>If true — and neither of the alleged victims responded to TechCrunch’s request for comment — this would suggest that the ransomware gang remains active, despite last week’s first-of-its-kind law enforcement sting. This is likely because the suspects cuffed included only those who played a lesser role in the Clop operation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">Cybersecurity</a> firm Intel 471 said <a href="https://twitter.com/Intel471Inc/status/1405292359286358019">it believes</a> that last week&#8217;s arrests targeted the money laundering portion of the operation, with core members of the gang not apprehended.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not believe that any core actors behind Clop were apprehended,&#8221; the security company said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>&#8220;The overall impact to Clop is expected to be minor although this law enforcement attention may result in the Clop brand getting abandoned as we&#8217;ve recently seen with other ransomware groups like DarkSide and Babuk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clop appears to still be in business, but it remains to be seen how long the group will remain operational. Not only have law enforcement operations dealt numerous blows to ransomware groups this year, such as U.S. investigators&#8217; recent recovery of millions in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> they claim was paid in ransom to the Colonial Pipeline hackers, but Russia has this week confirmed it will begin to work with the U.S. to locate cybercriminals.</p>
<p>Russia has until now taken a hands-off approach when it comes to dealing with hackers. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russian-security-chief-says-moscow-will-cooperate-with-us-against-hackers-report-2021-06-23/">Reuters reported Wednesday</a> that the head of the country’s Federal Security Service (FSB) Alexander Bortnikov was quoted as saying it will co-operate with U.S. authorities on future cybersecurity operations.</p>
<p>Intel 471 previously said that it does not believe the key members of Clop were arrested in last week’s operation because “they are probably living in Russia,&#8221; which has long provided safe harbor to cybercriminals by refusing to take action.</p>
<p>The Clop ransomware gang was first spotted in early 2019, and the group has since been linked to a number of high-profile attacks. These include the breach of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/execupharm-clop-ransomware/">U.S. pharmaceutical giant ExecuPharm</a> in April 2020 and the recent data breach at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/accellion/">Accellion</a>, which saw hackers exploit flaws in the IT provider’s software to steal data from dozens of its customers including the University of Colorado and cloud security vendor Qualys.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Video game giant Electronic Arts is continuing to make M&amp;A moves as it looks to bulk up its presence in the mobile gaming world.</p>
<p>Fresh off the $2.4 billion acquisition of Glu Mobile this past April, their biggest purchase to date, Electronic Arts announced Wednesday that they are buying Warner Bros. Games’ mobile gaming studio Playdemic for $1.4 billion in an all-cash deal. The Manchester studio is best known for its release &#8220;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/golf-clash/id1089225191">Golf Clash</a>&#8221; which the studio boasts has more than 80 million downloads globally.</p>
<p>The rather ominously-named startup is being jettisoned to its new home ahead of the $43 billion WarnerMedia-Discovery deal where the rest of the Warner Bros. Games division will live post-merger.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Electronic Arts is the second-largest Western video games company with a market cap around $40 billion. Their success has largely come from desktop and console titles including titles in their most popular franchises like Battlefield, Star Wars and Titanfall. Mobile dominance hasn&#8217;t come easy to the company which has spent much of the past decade or so trying to keep pace with competitors like Activision Blizzard which struck gold with its 2016 King acquisition. <i></i></p>
<p>Electronic Arts has been on a studio buying spree as of late &#8212; in 2021 they&#8217;ve announced three major acquisitions worth some $5 billion combined.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s become increasingly obvious over the last few years, as Vladimir Putin has tightened his grip on his country, that Russian entrepreneurs who want to engage properly with the rest of the world have had to leave their mother country. Gone are the days when a startup in Russia might attract attention from many Western investors. The same, alas, is true of Russian-speaking Belorussians, many of whom have left the country after brutal crackdowns there. Ukraine’s economy also remains sub-par due to the ongoing Russian aggression in the East of the country. So it’s fallen to enterprising Russian-speaking investors in and outside Russia to work out the best ways to harness the obvious talent out there.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.leta.vc/">Leta Capital</a> makes a play of investing in Russian-speaking entrepreneurs based just about anywhere. It’s now launching its third and largest fund to date and says it will invest over $100 million in UK, European, and US-based growth-stage tech companies over the next three years. Its focus will be Seed/ Round A / Round B investments. It intends to invest in the range of $2-5 million and will be  focused on software, IT, and internet technologies</p>
<p>The new fund will to hone in on East European and Russian-speaking entrepreneurs. Particularly those operating out of international hubs such as London and New York.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Leta’s founder and former tech entrepreneur Alexander Chachava says Russian-speaking startups based abroad are often &#8211; these days &#8211; over-looked and under-valued by Western VCs and investors, and I dare say he’s right. Prejudice isn’t just about skin color, as we all know.</p>
<p>Chachava says his fund has invested over $45 million to date since 2012, going into 30 technology companies including Synthesis AI, Unigine, InDriver,  NovaKid (which I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/novakids-esl-app-for-children-raises-4-25m-series-a-led-by-portfolio-and-learnstart-investors/">covered last year</a>) and 365Scores.</p>
<p>Exits include the sale of Bright Box HK to Zurich Insurance Group in 2017, and WeWork’s acquisition of sales and marketing platform Unomy.</p>
<p>Chachava said: “While we are significantly broadening our geographic focus towards key global hubs,  our strategy effectively remains the same: to identify exciting, high-potential technology start-ups and entrepreneurs, and support them in realizing their international ambitions.”</p>
<p>Chachava says his own research suggests there are in excess of 17,000 Russian-speaking and East European tech entrepreneurs and start-ups active in the UK, Europe, and US.</p>
<p>“Our analysis shows they continue to be undervalued and overlooked for funding, despite often generating significant cash when it comes to ARR. These entrepreneurs are some of the most dynamic and technically skilled in the world, and for investors, they represent a massive untapped opportunity.”</p>
<p>He has a point. Significant businesses such as Telegram, Revolut, TradingView, PandaDoc, and Preply were all started by Russian speakers who are emigres from their respective Russian-influenced countries.</p>
<p>Leta says its first “evergreen” fund of $15 million was fully deployed in early 2020, delivering a gross IRR of 27% per annum to investors. Its second $50 million fund had its first closing in September 2018 and has committed about 60% of its capital, says the company.</p>
<p>Leta will invest out of an entity in the Cayman Islands, but doesn&#8217;t plan to have an office right now, and nor will it need it to invest.</p>
<p>As Chachava told me over a Zoom call: &#8220;The last two years, we have not been not traveling too much, our work has been downgraded to Zoom calls. But before that, we spent a couple of months in the US, a couple of months in Western Europe. I was a frequent visitor to London but I don&#8217;t think we need space anymore in our modern world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Turning the page from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/the-early-stage-venture-capital-market-is-weird-and-chaotic/">the early-stage venture capital market</a> to the super late-stage exit market, this morning we&#8217;re talking about endpoint security company SentinelOne&#8217;s IPO in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/sprinklr-raises-200m-on-2-7b-valuation-three-years-after-last-investment/">context of Sprinklr&#8217;s own</a>.

<hr />
<p>SentinelOne&#8217;s IPO, expected to price on June 29 and trade June 30, is a fascinating debut. Why? Because the company sports a combination of rapid growth and expanding losses that make it a good heat check for the IPO market. Its debut will allow us to answer whether public investors still value growth above all else. And this week, the company gave us an early dataset regarding its market value in the form of an IPO price range. This means we can do some unpacking and thinking.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1995214" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>A reminder regarding why we dwell on the exit market for unicorns: We care because the value of late-stage startups when they reach a liquidity point helps set valuation comps for myriad smaller startups. Furthermore, the level of public-market enthusiasm for loss-making, growth-focused companies will determine the scale of returns for many a venture capitalist, founder and early employee.</p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s talk about SentinelOne&#8217;s cybersecurity IPO price range; Sprinklr&#8217;s social-media software debut will play foil.</p>
<h2>The price of growth</h2>
<p>It can make good sense to pay up for a quickly growing company&#8217;s shares. This is why you may hear of a startup raising an early-stage round at a very high revenue multiple.</p>
<p>Why put a $50 million price tag on a startup that just crossed the $1 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) threshold? If it&#8217;s growing sufficiently quickly, the math can pencil out. If that startup was growing at 300% per year, say, the revenue multiple that you paid in the round valuing the startup at $50 million would fall sharply over the next year, at which point other investors would probably scramble to put more capital into the firm at a higher price.</p>
<p>Bingo! You just got a markup on your initial investment, and the company has found someone else to lead their next round at a higher price, giving it even more capital to keep its growth game going and make your early investment appear prescient. See? Venture capital is easy.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The same general idea applies to companies going public. Growth matters, and the more rapidly a company is adding revenue, the more money it will be worth because investors can anticipate its future scale (within reason). Some companies that sport quick growth can have other issues that impact their value. Extensive debt, for example, a history of uneven growth, or deteriorating economics could come into play. Or simply very high losses.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2019, LinkedIn&#8217;s engineering team <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2019/data-hub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> DataHub, a metadata tool it had built to help it organise, search and discover insights from its vast data trove. In 2020, LinkedIn <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2020/open-sourcing-datahub--linkedins-metadata-search-and-discovery-p" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open sourced it</a>. Now, a startup co-founded by one of the creators of DataHub and by a former senior engineer from Airbnb who helped build the latter company&#8217;s Dataportal, is coming out of stealth &#8212; backed by LinkedIn, among others &#8212; to usher the DataHub platform into its latest chapter: commercialization.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.acryldata.io/company" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acryl Data</a>, as the company is called, is launching today with $9 million led by 8VC, with LinkedIn and Insight also participating, to help other companies use the tools for their own big data needs.</p>
<p>The impetus for Acryl Data comes from the salient fact that big data, and specifically being able to organize, understand, make the most of fragmented big data troves (with information coming from and living in multiple places, be it Snowflake, or Databricks, or Looker, or something else altogether), is a challenge that impacts any organization that has a large digital component in its operations. Traditionally, big tech companies have been some of the more innovative in addressing that issue, with a number of them also open sourcing their technology to make it usable by others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The breakthrough for the founders of Acryl &#8212; discovered before they started the company, when they were still working at their respective big tech companies &#8212; was the realization that metadata held the key to organizing that big data information.</p>
<p>&#8220;The interesting part about metadata is actually that it has become a big data problem,&#8221; said Shirshanka Das, the LinkedIn alum who is CEO and co-founded the company with Swaroop Jagadish (the Airbnb alum who is CTO). &#8220;And so all of the data infrastructure DNA that we have, in terms of building large-scale data collections, streaming, indexing, searching &#8212; those all need metadata management solutions that can actually scale to the demands of the modern enterprise. That, I think, is really our secret sauce, that we&#8217;ve been able to build a metadata platform that takes in all the best practices of doing data infrastructure right, and applied it to doing metadata infrastructure.&#8221;</p>
<p>As an open source project, DataHub has picked up some significant traction. In addition to LinkedIn itself, Expedia, Saxo Bank, Klarna and many others are using the framework &#8212; essentially a generalized metadata search and discovery tool &#8212; to build their own metadata graph to connect their various data entities together. Altogether the project has racked up <a href="https://github.com/linkedin/datahub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 3,200 GitHub stars</a> and has more than a 100 contributors.</p>
<p>Acryl Data, like other open source commercialization efforts, is setting out to build a toolset that will make that framework easier to scale and apply in more use cases, particularly at those companies that might lack the resources to build these implementations on their own. The first of these, it says, will be a data catalogue that is based on design learnings from Airbnb&#8217;s Dataportal. LinkedIn will be collaborating with Acryl Data, along with the wider open source community, on future products.</p>
<p>“LinkedIn’s unique view of the global economy provides us with the opportunity to improve economic outcomes for hundreds of millions of people around the world through data-driven insights and AI-powered products. To discover the right data, navigate the tens of thousands of derived datasets that our researchers and engineers use every day and manage them well, we rely on DataHub,&#8221; said Igor Perisic, Chief Data Officer at LinkedIn, in a statement. &#8220;We are excited to partner with Acryl Data to continue to advance DataHub with them.”</p>
<p>The opportunity is a big one. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/collibra-nabs-another-112-5m-at-a-2-3b-valuation-for-its-big-data-management-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collibra</a>, a competitor in the same space, last year raised a round at a $2.3 billion valuation. Another, Alation, was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-03/snowflake-backed-data-startup-alation-valued-at-1-2-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at $1.2 billion</a> earlier this month. But with a lot of space for innovation left, it&#8217;s interesting to see the people who built some of the most foundational tools in the space getting stuck in as entrepreneurs themselves to meet the challenge.</p>
<p>“The modern data stack needs a fundamental rethink in how metadata is managed,&#8221; said Insight Partners MD George Mathew, in a statement. &#8220;We believe a next-generation, real-time metadata platform is needed, and Acryl Data is the best team to lead this transformation based on their groundbreaking work with DataHub.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin, Ford&#8217;s micromobility subsidiary, has launched its first custom designed and built electric scooter. The company says the S-100T scooters are its safest and longest lasting, two qualities that it hopes will attract the attention of cities as it aims its strategy at exclusive partnerships. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the company launches its service in Sacramento in July, it&#8217;ll deploy 25 of the new S-100T scooters along with its existing fleet. Spin hopes to scale to 350 S-100Ts by August and have more than a few thousand in the market by the end of the year, according to a spokesperson for the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The S-100T joins Spin&#8217;s other vehicles, the original S-100, the three-wheeler S-200 and a new e-bike, which are manufactured in partnership with Segway-Ninebot and Okai. Spin will continue these partnerships in order to maintain a diverse fleet.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin has been working on its own scooter since 2019, when many of the scooters on the road came off-the-shelf and fell apart fast. A Los Angeles Times report found </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-bird-scooters-money-profit-strategy-20190505-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LA-area Bird scooters lasted only 126 days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At that time, the founders decided to really set a new standard not only for Spin itself, but also for the industry on what e-scooter durability should be,” Maxime Veron, VP of product at Spin, told TechCrunch. “So we really set out to create the toughest scooter out there, and that has been the north star for the design, build and testing of the S-100T.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ‘T’ stands for ‘tough,’ Veron added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And we really tested it, tortured it, I should say, way beyond the expectation of the industry, and that’s why we expect it to last twice as long as other e-scooters,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin expects the S-100T to last over three years, compared to about 18 months for its S-100. The company reached this estimated lifespan after performing 400 different safety and durability tests, many of which involved pulverizing the vehicle and making it withstand temperatures from -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 149 degrees Fahrenheit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low life expectancy of scooters is one of the main reasons why it’s been so hard for companies to achieve profitability, which is why Spin is focusing its scooter design around durability. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Durability is the biggest lever we have in terms of profitability,” said Veron. “It’s gonna help both our bottom line in terms of making sure that the scooters last longer, and our top line of attracting customers who will love the ride.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veron says the S-100T is designed to be modular, with a single frame design that’s durable and allows for easy repairs and parts replacements, which should help with lifespan and sustainability of the vehicle. Perhaps one day, both the design and Spin’s ownership of the vehicles will also help the company come up with a good end-of-life strategy and design for recyclability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Durability has been the number one, but we will be able over time to improve on all the key checkpoints including end-of-life because we control it all,” said Veron.</span></p>

<p>Tong was a principal designer at IDEO, a co-founder at IFTTT, head of product design at Pinterest, an EIR at IMO Ventures and is now a startup advisor at Design Fund.</p>
<p>When it comes to thoughtfully crafting products, and ensuring that those designs fit in line with the company&#8217;s broader short and long-term goals, there is perhaps no one better suited to show us how it&#8217;s done.</p>
<p>Tong joins a long list of experts in a variety of startup core competencies who will be speaking at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2">TC Early Stage in July</a>. That list includes <strong>Sequoia&#8217;s Mike Vernal</strong> (Product Market Fit Is All About Tempo), <strong>Coatue&#8217;s Caryn Marooney</strong> (formerly Facebook&#8217;s head of comms) and <strong>Superhuman&#8217;s Rahul Vohra</strong> (Growth Hacking). You can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2">check out the agenda here</a>.</p>
<p>The coolest part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2">TC Early Stage</a> is that all sessions are designed with plenty of time for audience Q&amp;A, so founders can get specific, tailored advice about their own business challenges.</p>
<p>These mini-bootcamps kick off in just two weeks so we hope you&#8217;ll be joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2">TC Early Stage</a>&#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2">Grab your ticket here</a>!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For all that&#8217;s said about fundraising and working alongside investors, rarely do we get to see founders and their investors in candid conversation with one another. Extra Crunch Live is changing that. On the weekly live show, we sit down with founders and the VCs who funded them to talk about how they came together on the deal, what stood out about the other party that led to their commitment and how they operate today. We also (usually) take a walk through their early pitch decks to get a feel for how success starts.</p>
<p>On an upcoming episode of <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-emergence-capital-and-retail-zipline?ref=928ff1c911ab">Extra Crunch Live</a>, we&#8217;ll sit down with Emergence&#8217;s Lotti Siniscalco and Retail Zipline&#8217;s Melissa Wong to discuss all that and more. The event goes down on Wednesday, June 23 at 3 p.m. ET/noon PT. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-emergence-capital-and-retail-zipline?ref=928ff1c911ab">You can register to attend right here.</a></p>
<p>Siniscalco is a principal at Emergence Capital, investing in early-stage enterprise software companies. She currently serves on the board of directors at Whistic and High Alpha. Prior to Emergence, she was an investor in financial services and technology at Advent International, a PE firm, and led diligence for Ribbit Capital (also fintech focused) before that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In other words, she&#8217;s an expert in fintech and can bring a wealth of wisdom to our conversation around fundraising and startup growth.</p>
<p>Melissa Wong, on the other hand, has spent 10 years in retail communications at Old Navy. It was here that she realized a problem that Zipline Retail, a retail communication and store execution platform, could solve and set out on her own venture.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live also features the ECL Pitch-off, where startups in the audience can virtually &#8220;raise their hand&#8221; to pitch their startup live on our stream. Our expert guests will give their feedback on each pitch. If you want to throw your hat in the ring, you have to show up.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is accessible to everyone, but only Extra Crunch members can access the content on demand. We do these every week, so there are scores of episodes across a wide variety of startup sectors in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">ECL Library</a>. It&#8217;s but one of many reasons to become an Extra Crunch member. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/">Join here.</a></p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’ve been working on an H-1B in the U.S. for nearly two years. While I’m grateful to have made it through the H-1B lottery and to be working, I’m feeling unhappy and frustrated with my job. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I really want to start something of my own and work on my own terms in the United States. Are there any immigration options that would allow me to do that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Seeking Satisfaction</strong></p>
<p>Dear Seeking,</p>
<p>Job dissatisfaction and frustration while on H-1B is normal, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwardgorbis/">Edward Gorbis</a>. He is the founder of <a href="https://www.careermeetsworld.com/">Career Meets World</a> and a performance coach who specifically works with immigrants and first-generation professionals to help them find fulfillment and thrive in their careers and life. I recently spoke with him for <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/076-coaching-immigrant-leaders-with-edward-gorbis/">my podcast</a>, “Immigration Law For Tech Startups.”</p>
<p>He says that “once immigrants reach stability, they start to think, ‘Who am I, what do I value, what’s my core identity?’” He partners with people to help them to gain a better understanding of why they think the way they do, teach them how our brain really works, and then reshape and retrain the brain for success.</p>
<p>Gorbis says that imagining overcoming the hurdles that stand in the way of doing the work that will fulfill you is the first step. So, here are some options that can help you imagine how to move toward building the life of your dreams.</p>

<h2>Raise $250,000 and be the CEO</h2>
<p>A great new option for aspiring entrepreneurs is <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/073-international-entrepreneur-parole-is-back/">International Entrepreneur Parole</a>, a new immigration program in the United States that allows CEOs, CTOs and others to obtain a 2.5-year immigration status. You can live in the U.S. and run your company. Your spouse can work and you could be eligible for a 2.5-year extension.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/International-Entrepreneur-Parole.pdf?7fd8bf&amp;7fd8bf">How to qualify?</a> You’ll need to own at least 10% of a U.S. company, such as a Delaware C corporation registered in California. Ideally, you’ll want to show that your company bank account has at least $250,000 raised from qualifying U.S. investors prior to applying, but you can demonstrate other evidence to show that your company has the potential to grow rapidly and create jobs in the U.S.</p>
<h2>See yourself at another company</h2>
<p>There is technically no limit on how many <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/what-we-do/h-1b_speciality_occupations/">H-1B</a> employers you can have or how many hours you work — or how few hours you work — in an H-1B position. So, think about other companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security compliance is precisely three things: incredibly boring, time consuming, and entirely necessary to run a business in the modern age. Compliance isn&#8217;t going away, but startups like Drata are making it slightly easier to bear.</p>
<p>Drata helps companies get their SOC 2 compliance quicker by using automation. SOC 2 is a certification used to show that a company can store customer data in the cloud securely, but the process is notoriously complex and can take months to complete — and you have to do it all over again every year. That&#8217;s particularly burdensome for startups and smaller firms.</p>
<p>Drata says it can get companies SOC 2-compliant faster and keep them in compliance for longer by integrating with popular business tools and cloud services to get a better picture of a company&#8217;s security posture.</p>
<p>Now with a new round of $25 million at Series A in the bank, Drata said it&#8217;s expanding its compliance platform to also include ISO 27001, another <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/the-dos-and-donts-of-bug-bounty-programs-with-katie-moussouris/">core security standard</a> used all over the world to help companies protect their systems and safeguard data.</p>
<p>The round landed six months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/drata-raises-3-2m-for-its-compliance-audit-platform/">its $3.2 million seed round</a> in January, and was led by GGV Capital, with participation from Silicon Valley CISO Investors, Okta Ventures, Cowboy Ventures, Leaders Fund, and SV Angel.</p>
<p>Drata CEO and co-founder Adam Markowitz told TechCrunch that the company is growing on average 100% month-over-month since it launched out of stealth and is serving hundreds of customers, including three-person startups to publicly traded companies.</p>
<p>The startup joins several other companies in the compliance space. Secureframe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/secureframe-series-a-cybersecurity-compliance/">raised $18 million</a> at Series A in March to offer SOC 2 and ISO 27001 certifications. Strike Graph raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/strike-graph-raises-3-9m-to-help-automate-security-audits/">a $3.9 million seed round</a> last year to help companies automate security audits and get FedRamp certification needed to provide technology to the federal government. And, Startup Battlefield participant Osano in 2019 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/osano-series-a/">raised $5.4 million</a> at Series A to build out its risk and compliance platform.</p>
<p><em>An earlier version of this article misstated the company&#8217;s location. It is based in San Diego, not Boston.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> represent the two most successful cloud companies in their respective categories. Over the last few years the two cloud giants have had an evolving partnership. Today they announced plans for a new set of integration capabilities to make it easier to share data and build applications that cross the two platforms.</p>
<p>Patrick Stokes, EVP and GM for Platform at Salesforce, points out that the companies have worked together in the past to provide features <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/salesforce-aws-expand-partnership-to-bring-amazon-connect-to-service-cloud/">like secure sharing</a> between the two services, but they were hearing from customers that they wanted to take it further and today&#8217;s announcement is the first step towards making that happen.</p>
<p>&#8220;[The initial phases of the partnership] have really been massively successful. We&#8217;re learning a lot from each other and from our mutual customers about the types of things that they want to try to accomplish, both within the Salesforce portfolio of products, as well as all the Amazon products, so that the two solutions complement each other really nicely. And customers are asking us for more, and so we&#8217;re excited to enter into this next phase of our partnership,&#8221; Stokes explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He added, &#8220;The goal really is to unify our platforms, so bring [together] all the power of the Amazon services with all of the power of the of the Salesforce platform.&#8221; These capabilities could be the next step in accomplishing that.</p>

<p>This involves a couple of new features the companies are working on to help developers on both the platform and application side of the equation. For starters that includes enabling developers to virtualize Amazon data inside Salesforce without having to do all the coding to make that happen manually.</p>
<p>&#8220;More specifically, we&#8217;re going to virtualize Amazon data within the Salesforce platform, so whether you&#8217;re working with an S3 bucket, Amazon RDS or whatever it is we&#8217;re going to make it so that that the data is virtualized and just appears just like it&#8217;s native data on the Salesforce platform,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Similarly, developers building applications on Amazon will be able to access Salesforce data and have it appear natively in Amazon. This involves providing connectors between the two systems to make the data flow smoothly without a lot of coding to make that happen.</p>
<p>The companies are also announcing event sharing capabilities, which makes it easier for both Amazon and Salesforce customers to build microservices-based applications that cross both platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can build microservices-oriented architecture that spans the services of Salesforce and Amazon platforms, again without having to write any code. To do that, [we&#8217;re developing] out of the box connectors so you can click and drag the events that you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>The companies are also announcing plans to make it easier from an identity and access management perspective to access the platforms with a guided setup. Finally, the companies are working on applications to build Amazon Chime communications tooling into Service Cloud and other Salesforce services to build things like virtual call centers using AWS machine learning technology.</p>
<p>Amazon VP of Global Marketing Rachel Thorton says that having the two cloud giants work together in this way should make it easier for developers to create solutions that span the two platforms. &#8220;I just think it unlocks such possibilities for developers, and the faster and more innovative developers can be, it just unlocks opportunities for businesses, and creates better customer experiences,&#8221; Thornton said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Salesforce also has extensive partnerships with other cloud providers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/salesforce-announces-its-moving-marketing-cloud-to-microsoft-azure/">including Microsoft Azure</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/13/salesforce-deepens-data-sharing-partnership-with-google/">Google Cloud Platform</a>.</p>
<p>As is typically the case with Salesforce announcements, while all of these capabilities are being announced today, they are still in the development stage and won&#8217;t go into beta testing until later this year with GA expected sometime next year. The companies are expected to release more details about the partnership at Dreamforce and re:Invent, their respective customer conferences later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://frumtak.is/english/">Frumtak  Ventures</a>, one of the few VCs in Iceland, has raised its third fund, Frumtak III. The $57 million (ISK 7b, €48m) fund will focus on post-seed and Series A startups.  The firm says its typical ticket size will range from $1-5 million (€850k-4.2m).</p>
<p>Frumtak was a somewhat lesser-known European VC until it popped up on our radar as the backers behind the Controlant real-time supply chain monitoring startup, the technology from which was pictured beside Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York, when he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/icelands-controlant-with-50m-backing-emerges-as-key-player-in-cold-chain-for-covid-19-vaccine/">held up a box containing the first-ever shipment</a> of the COVID-19 vaccine to the city. Controlant has been a key player in the global distribution cold chain associated with vaccines.</p>
<p>However, the fund has also backed digital banking solutions provider Meniga, digital therapeutics scaleup Sidekick Health, travel CRM and travel booking system provider Kaptio, live event and fan engagement data analytics company Activity Stream, and Data Market, which was acquired by Qlik in  2014.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Svana Gunnarsdottir, managing partner of Frumtak Ventures said: “We are proud of the accomplishments of our portfolio companies and their teams, as well as the investment decisions we made through our first two funds. We look forward to continuing our support of high-potential startups and brilliant founders with Frumtak III.  We are also grateful  for the confidence shown to us by our LP’s, many of whom have been with us since our first fund in 2009.”</p>
<p>Concurrently, Asthildur Otharsdottir has joined the firm as partner and Frumtak III’s lead investment manager.  Otharsdottir was previously Frumtak’s Chairman for 6 years and has been on the board of Marel and Icelandair Group.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Freight technology startup, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/freighthub">Forto</a>, which we most recently covered when it raised $50 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/digital-freight-forwarder-forto-raises-another-50m-in-round-led-by-inven-capital/">late last year</a>, is upping the stakes.</p>
<p>It’s now raised $240 million in a round led by Softbank Vision Fund 2 to expand its trade shipments between China and Europe. Forto manages shipping containers from origin to destination. Softbank is also hedging its bets after investing in China&#8217;s Full Truck Alliance (YMM.N), which plans a $20 billion IPO.</p>
<p>That means Forto’s valuation close to $1.2 billion, after it’s raised a total of $360 million. Also participating in the round were new investors Citi Ventures and G Squared. Existing investors including Northzone, Cherry Ventures and Unbound also took part, Forto said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>German logistics startups are proliferating. Trucking specialist Sennder, a digital road freight forwarder, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/digital-road-freight-forwarder-sennder-raises-160m-series-plans-european-expansion/">raised</a> $160 million in Series D financing earlier this year.</p>
<p>Forto says it has 2,500 clients, including Home 24 and German supermarket chain Edeka, and ships up to 10,000 containers a year by sea, rail and air.</p>

With this, the company has now raised a total of $55 million, according to [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.planetscale.com/">PlanetScale</a>, the company behind the open-source <a href="https://vitess.io/">Vitess</a> database clustering system for MySQL that was first developed at YouTube, today announced that it has raised a $30 million Series B funding round led by Insight Partners, with participation from a16z and SignalFire. With this, the company has now raised a total of $55 million, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/planetscale">Crunchbase</a>.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s announcement comes only a few weeks after PlanetScale launched its new hosted database platform, also dubbed PlanetScale. The company had previously offered a hosted version of Vitess, but with this new service, it is going a step further and offering what it calls a &#8220;developer-first database&#8221; that abstracts away all of the infrastructures to ensure that developers won&#8217;t have to think about cloud zones, cluster sizes and other details.</p>
<p>Indeed, PlanetScale CEO and co-founder Jiten Vaidya was quite open about the limitations of this earlier product. &#8220;What we had built last year was pretty much hosted Vitess, which was no different than how a lot of cloud providers today give you databases,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So none of this ease of use, none of this elegance, none of these state-of-the-art experiences that the developers want and expect today, we had built into our product.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But a few months ago, the company brought on former GitHub VP of Engineering <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isamlambert/">Sam Lambert</a> as its Chief Product Officer. Vaidya noted that Lambert brought a lot of developer empathy to PlanetScale and helped it launch this new product.</p>
<p>&#8220;People come to you because they&#8217;re not database experts, but they have data, they have problems,&#8221; Lambert said. &#8220;And too many companies, especially in the database world, do not think about the daily lives of their users like we do. They don&#8217;t think about the complete journey of what the user is actually trying to do, which is to provide value to their customers. They&#8217;re just very impressed with themselves for storing and retrieving data. And it&#8217;s like, yep, we&#8217;ve been doing that. We&#8217;ve been doing that since the 60s. Can we do something else now?&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s users today include the likes of Slack, Figma, GitHub and Square, so it&#8217;s clearly delivering value to a lot of users. As Lambert noted, PlanetScale aims to offer them a product that is simple and easy to use. &#8220;Just because it is simple and easy to use, and beautiful, honestly &#8212; like just beautiful, well-designed tooling &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s inferior. It doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s missing anything. It means the others are missing the poetry and the additional elements of beauty that you can add to infrastructure products,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>PlanetScale plans to use the new funding to scale its team globally and accelerate the adoption of its platform. Insight Partners Managing Director Nikhil Sachdev will join the company&#8217;s board, with the firm&#8217;s Managing Director Praveen Akkiraju also joining as a board observer.</p>
<p>&#8220;PlanetScale is setting a new bar for simplicity, performance and scalability for cloud-based databases in the serverless era,&#8221; said Sachdev. &#8220;The developer experience for databases has been painful for too long. PlanetScale is breaking that chain, solving longstanding problems related to scalability and reliability in an extremely elegant, tasteful, and useful way.&#8221;</p>

First off, it’s a large Series A even by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">today’s standards</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The financing also marks the previously bootstrapped Lower’s first external round of funding in its seven-year history. Lower is also something that is kind of rare these days in the startup world: profitable. Silicon Valley-based Accel has a history of backing profitable, bootstrapped companies, having also led large Series A rounds for the likes of 1Password, Atlassian, Qualtrics, Webflow, Tenable and Galileo (which went on to be acquired by SoFi). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, Galileo founder Clay Wilkes introduced the VC firm to Dan Snyder, Lower’s founder and CEO. The two companies have a few things in common besides being profitable: they were both bootstrapped for years before taking institutional capital and both have headquarters outside of Silicon Valley.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were immediately intrigued because Ohio-based Lower echoes both of these themes,” said Accel partner John Locke, who led the firm’s investment in Lower and is taking a seat on the company’s board as part of the investment. “Like Galileo, Lower will be one of the most successful bootstrapped fintech companies globally. The combination of a company built in a nontraditional region across the globe and a bootstrapped company reminds us of [other] companies we have partnered with for a large Series A.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>There were other unnamed participants in the round, but Accel provided the &#8220;majority&#8221; of the investment, according to Lower.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyder co-founded Lower in 2014 with the goal of making the homebuying process simpler for consumers. The company launched with Homeside, its retail brand that Snyder describes as &#8220;a tech-leveraged retail mortgage bank&#8221; that works with realtors and builders, among others. In 2018, the company launched the website for Lower, its direct-to-consumer digital lending brand with the mission of making its platform a one-stop shop where consumers can go online to save for a home, obtain or refinance a mortgage and get insurance through its marketplace. This year, it launched the Lower mobile app with a savings account.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, Lower has funded billions of dollars in loans and notched an impressive $300 million in revenue in 2020 after doubling revenue every year, according to Snyder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our history is maybe a little atypical of fintech companies today,” he told TechCrunch. “We’ve had a view going back to the start of the company that we wanted to run it profitably. That’s been one of our pillars, so that’s what we’ve done. Also, we all grew up in the mortgage industry, so we saw firsthand the size of the market, but also how broken it was, so we wanted to change it.”</span></p>
<p>In launching the direct-to-consumer digital lending brand, the company was working to make the homebuying process more &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">digital, transparent and easier for consumers to access,” Snyder said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the company didn’t want to lose the human touch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We tried to design the app flow in a way where you can get as far along as you can in the application but if you want, at any point in time, to talk or chat with someone, we’re available,” Snyder added.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168949" style="width: 603px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168949" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2168949" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lower-App-Dark-3.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="593" height="421" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lower-App-Dark-3.jpg 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lower-App-Dark-3.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lower-App-Dark-3.jpg?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lower-App-Dark-3.jpg?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lower-App-Dark-3.jpg?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lower-App-Dark-3.jpg?resize=1536,1092 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lower-App-Dark-3.jpg?resize=2048,1456 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lower-App-Dark-3.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168949" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lower</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower&#8217;s typical customer is the millennial and now Gen Z who’s aspiring to own their first home, according to Snyder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They might be thinking, &#8216;OK, I might be living in an apartment now, but in the next few years I’m going to meet someone and/or have a child and I want to unlock the investment that is a home,&#8217; &#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;And we’ll help them on that journey.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower&#8217;s recently launched new app offers a deposit account it’s dubbed “HomeFund.” The interest-bearing FDIC-insured deposit account offers a 0.75% Annual Percentage Yield and is designed to help consumers save for a home with a &#8220;dollar-for-dollar match in rewards&#8221; up to the first $1,000 saved, Snyder said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower works with more than 35 major insurance carriers nationally, including Nationwide, Liberty Mutual and Allstate. It has more than 1,600 employees, about half of which are based in Lower’s home state. That’s up from about 650 employees in June of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the company plans to add more services and has an “aggressive roadmap” for adding new features to its platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, for example, Lower sells primarily to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And while it services the majority of its loans, like many large lenders, it uses a subservicer. That will change, however, in early 2022, when Lower intends to launch its own native servicing platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while the company intends to continue to run profitably, Snyder said he and his co-founders “think the time is now to gain share.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to become a global brand, raise money and gain market share,” he added. “We’re going to continue to double down on product and build out our capabilities. We are the best-kept secret in fintech and plan to change that with smart branding, advertising and sponsorships.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And last but not least, Lower is eyeing the public markets as part of its longer-term roadmap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ultimately, we know we can build a great public company,” Snyder told TechCrunch. “We’re of the scale to be a public company right now, but we’re going to keep our heads down and we’re going to keep building for the next few years and then I think we can be in a spot to be a strong public business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel’s Locke points out </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that in the U.S., mortgage and home finance are among the largest financial service markets, and they have primarily been handled by large banks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For most consumers, getting a mortgage through these banks continues to be an overly complex, slow-moving process,” Locke told TechCrunch. “We believe by providing consumers a great mobile experience, Lower will gain share from incumbent banks, in the same way that companies like Monzo have in banking or Venmo in payments or Trade Republic and Robinhood in stock trading.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Diversity and inclusion have become central topics in the world of work. In the best considerations, improving them is a holistic effort, involving not just conceiving of products with this in mind, but hiring and managing talent in a diverse and inclusive way, too. A new startup called <a href="https://www.getpequity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pequity</a> that has built a product to help with the latter of these areas, specifically in equitable compensation, has now raised some funding &#8212; a sign of the demand in the market, as well as how tech is being harnessed in aid of helping it.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based startup has raised $19 million in a Series A led by Norwest Venture Partners. First Round Capital, Designer Fund, and Scribble Ventures also participated in the fundraise, which will be used to continue investing in product and also hiring: the company has 20 on its own books now and will aim to double that by the end of this year, on the heels of positive reception in the market.</p>
<p>Since launching officially last year, Pequity has picked up over 100 customers, with an initial focus on fast-scaling companies in its own backyard, a mark of how D&amp;I have come into focus in the tech industry in particular. Those using Pequity to compare and figure out compensation include Instacart, Scale.ai and ClearCo, and the company said that in the last four months, the platform&#8217;s been used to make more then 5,000 job offers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2169118" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169118" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2169118" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-IMG_9292.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="265" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-IMG_9292.jpg 2578w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-IMG_9292.jpg?resize=150,133 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-IMG_9292.jpg?resize=300,265 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-IMG_9292.jpg?resize=768,679 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-IMG_9292.jpg?resize=680,601 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-IMG_9292.jpg?resize=1536,1357 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-IMG_9292.jpg?resize=2048,1810 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-IMG_9292.jpg?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2169118" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.getpequity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pequity <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Kaitlyn Knopp, the CEO who co-founded the company with Warren Lebovics (both pictured, right), came up for the idea for Pequity in much the same way that many innovations in the world of enterprise IT come to market: through her own first-hand experience.</p>
<p>She spent a decade working in employment compensation in the Bay Area, with previous roles at Google, Instacart, and Cruise. In that time, she found the tools that many companies used were lacking and simply &#8220;clunky&#8221; when it came to compensation analysis.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way the market has worked so far is that platforms had compensation as an element but not the focus,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It was the end of the tagline, the final part of a &#8216;CRM for candidates.&#8217; But you still have to fill in all the gaps, you have to set the architecture the right way. And with compensation, you have to bake in your own analytics, which implies that you have to have some expertise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, as with other aspects of enterprise software, she added that the very biggest tech companies sometimes worked on their own tools, but not only does that leave smaller or otherwise other-focused businesses out of having better calculation tools, but it also means that those tools are siloed and miss out on being shaped by a bigger picture of the world of work. &#8220;We wanted to take that process and own it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Pequity product essentially works by plugging into all of the other tools that an HR professional might be using &#8212; HRIS, ATS, and payroll products &#8212; to manage salaries across the whole of the organization in order to analyse and compare how compensation could look for existing and prospective employees. It combines a company&#8217;s own data and then compares it to data from the wider market, including typical industry ranges and market trends, to provide insights to HR teams.</p>
<p>All of this means that HR teams are able to make more informed decisions, which is step number one in being more transparent and equitable, but is also something that Pequity is optimized to cover specifically in how it measures compensation across a team.</p>
<p>And in line with that, there is another aspect of the compensation mindset that Knopp also wanted to address in a standalone product, and that is the idea of building a tool with a mission, one of providing a platform that can bring in data to make transparent and equitable decisions.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the comp tools that I&#8217;ve interacted with are reactive,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You may have to do, say, a pay equity test, you do your promotion and merit cycles, and then you find all these issues that you have to solve. We&#8217;re flagging those things proactively with our analytics, because we&#8217;re plugging into those systems, which will give you those alerts before the decisions need to be made.&#8221;</p>
<p>As an added step in that direction, Knopp said that ultimately she believes the tool should be something that those outside of HR, such as managers and emploiyees themselves, should be able to access to better understand the logic of their own compensation and have more information going into any kind of negotiation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it will be interesting to see whether modernized products like Pequity, which are tackling old problems with a new approach and point of view, find traction in the wider market. If one purpose in HR is to address diversity and inclusion, and part of the problem has been that the tools are just not fit for that purpose, then it seems a no-brainer that we&#8217;ll see more organizations trying out new things to see if they can help them in their own race to secure talent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Compensation reflects a company’s values, affects its ability to hire talent, and is the biggest expense on its P&amp;L. And yet, most comp teams run on spreadsheets and emails,” said Parker Barrile, Partner at Norwest, in a statement. “Pequity empowers comp teams to design and manage equitable compensation programs with modern software designed by comp professionals, for comp professionals.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>, the company behind the popular open-source Next.js React framework, today announced that it has raised a $102 million Series C funding round led by Bedrock Capital. Existing investors Accel, CRV,<br />
Geodesic Capital, Greenoaks Capital and GV also participated in this round, together with new investors 8VC, Flex Capital, GGV, Latacora, Salesforce Ventures and Tiger Global. In total, the company has now raised $163 million and its current valuation is $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>As Vercel notes, the company saw strong growth in recent months, with traffic to all sites and apps on its network doubling since October 2020. About half of the world&#8217;s largest 10,000 websites now use Next.js . Given the open-source nature of the Next.js framework, not all of these users are obviously Vercel customers, but its current paying customers include the likes of Carhartt, Github, IBM, McDonald’s and Uber.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168971" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/vercel_example.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168971" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2168971" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/vercel_example.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="276" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/vercel_example.jpg 580w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/vercel_example.jpg?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/vercel_example.jpg?resize=300,276 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/vercel_example.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2168971" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vercel</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;For us, it all starts with a front-end developer,&#8221; Vercel CEO Guillermo Rauch told me. &#8220;Our goal is to create and empower those developers &#8212; and their teams &#8212; to create delightful, immersive web experiences for their customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Vercel, Rauch and his team took the Next.js framework and then built a serverless platform that specifically caters to this framework and allows developers to focus on building their front ends without having to worry about scaling and performance.</p>
<p>Older solutions, Rauch argues, were built in isolation from the cloud platforms and serverless technologies, leaving it up to the developers to deploy and scale their solutions. And while some potential users may also be content with using a headless content management system, Rauch argues that increasingly, developers need to be able to build solutions that can go deeper than the off-the-shelf solutions that many businesses use today.</p>
<p>Rauch also noted that developers really like Vercel&#8217;s ability to generate a preview URL for a site&#8217;s front end every time a developer edits the code. &#8220;So instead of just spending all your time in code review, we&#8217;re shifting the equation to spending your time reviewing or experiencing your front end. That makes the experience a lot more collaborative,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So now, designers, marketers, IT, CEOs [&#8230;] can now come together in this collaboration of building a front end and say, &#8216;that shade of blue is not the right shade of blue.'&#8221;</p>
<p>“Vercel is leading a market transition through which we are seeing the majority of value-add in web and cloud application development being delivered at the front end, closest to the user, where true experiences are made and enjoyed,” said Geoff Lewis, founder and managing partner at Bedrock. “We are extremely enthusiastic to work closely with Guillermo and the peerless team he has assembled to drive this revolution forward and are very pleased to have been able to co-lead this round.”</p>
