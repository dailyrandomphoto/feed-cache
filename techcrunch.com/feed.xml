										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tokyo-based ispace has been selected to deliver rovers from Canada and Japan to the lunar surface after they launch aboard SpaceX rockets. The company will use its recently revealed Hakuto-R lander for both missions, currently scheduled for 2022 and 2023.</p>
<p>The Canadian Space Agency selected three private Canadian companies, each with separate scientific missions, to ride the lander. Mission Control Space Services, Canadensys and NGC are the first companies to receive awards under the CSA&#8217;s Capability Demonstration program, part of the agency’s Lunar Exploration Accelerator Program. LEAP, unveiled by the Canadian government in February 2020, earmarks $150 million over five years to support in-space demonstrations and science missions from Canadian private industry.</p>
<p>As part of the mission, the ispace lander will deliver the United Arab Emirates’ The Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC)&#8217;s 22-pound rover, &#8220;Rashid.&#8221; The rover will be equipped with an artificial intelligence flight computer from space robotics company Mission Control Space Services. Mission Control’s AI will use deep-learning algorithms to recognize lunar geology as the Rashid rover traverses the surface.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>ispace will carry cameras &#8220;to capture key events during the mission&#8221; for Canadensys. The Japanese company will also collect lunar imagery data for demonstration of NGC&#8217;s autonomous navigation system.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are honored that all three of the companies awarded by CSA have each entrusted ispace’s services to carry out their operations on the lunar surface,&#8221; ispace founder and CEO Takeshi Hakamada said in a statement. &#8220;We see this as a show of the trust that ispace has developed with CSA over the past years, as well as a recognition of ispace’s positive position in the North American market.&#8221;</p>
<p>ispace will also be transporting a transformable lunar robot payload to the moon for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), in addition to conducting operations and providing lunar data. The data collected on this mission, Mission 2, will be used to aid the design of a future crewed pressurized rover.</p>
<p>JAXA&#8217;s lunar robot will be only around 80mm in diameter before it transforms to its surface form and will weigh only around 250 grams. That mission is scheduled to take place in 2023. ispace did not disclose the financial terms of the deals.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2158430" style="width: 1002px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2158430" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2158430 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jaxa.png" alt="" width="992" height="419" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jaxa.png 992w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jaxa.png?resize=150,63 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jaxa.png?resize=300,127 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jaxa.png?resize=768,324 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jaxa.png?resize=680,287 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jaxa.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 992px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2158430" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://global.jaxa.jp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JAXA <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>“While the robot travels on the lunar surface, images on behavior of the regolith, and images of lunar surface taken by the robot and the camera on the lunar lander will be sent to the mission control center via the lunar lander,” JAXA said in a news release. “The acquired data will be used for evaluation of the localization algorithm and the impact of the regolith on driving performance of the crewed pressurized rover.”</p>
<p>ispace unveiled their Hakuto-R lander design in July 2020. The Hakuto project was born out of the Google Lunar XPRIZE competition, in which teams competed to be the first to send a lunar rover to the moon, have it travel 500 meters and send back to Earth photos and video. None of the five finalists, including Hakuto, were able to complete a launch, and the competition <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/23/googles-lunar-xprize-to-go-unclaimed-as-moonshot-deadline-looms/">subsequently ended</a> in 2018 without a winner.</p>
<p>The MBRSC and JAXA rovers will have different deployment mechanisms from the landers, though Hakamada did not provide further details during a media briefing Wednesday.</p>
<p>The landers are being assembled in Germany and the assembly phase has just started, Hakamada said. “So we’re very confident we will meet this schedule,” he added.</p>
<p>Using water on the lunar surface is one of ispace’s long-term objectives. The company hopes to have more capability in the future to sustain resource utilization activities, Hakamada said.</p>
<p>This is only one of several lunar missions <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/nasa-picks-spacex-falcon-heavy-for-332m-mission-to-launch-lunar-gateway-components-in-2024/">launching on SpaceX rockets</a>. NASA announced in April that the space startup was selected to send humans to the lunar surface as part of its Artemis project, at a total award value of $2.89 billion. SpaceX will also be taking payloads from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/firefly-aerospaces-lunar-lander-will-fly-to-the-moon-on-a-spacex-falcon-9-in-2023/">Firefly Aerosapce</a> to take up its lunar lander in 2023.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">All eyes have recently been on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/basecamp-employees-quit-ceo-letter/">Basecamp</a>, which lost about a third of its workforce at the end of last month after banning “societal and political discussions” at work. Late last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/brian-armstrongs-new-problem-60-plus/">Coinbase</a> was embroiled in a similar controversy after its CEO declared that political activism at work is a distraction, leading to a smaller but still significant employee exodus.</p>
<p>Before that, controversies erupted at Google, Facebook and other prominent tech firms, leading to virtual employee walkouts and work stoppages. We continue to see headlines that highlight tech company employee revolts over management edicts or perceived policy failures.</p>
<p>These company meltdowns reflect a societal change, and those in the startup community ought to take notice. The strife may be attributable to changing generational expectations in some cases, or an excess of “tech bro” culture in others, but the reality is that things have changed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			“Don’t discuss politics at work” used to be a standard expectation. But employee expectations have shifted, and leaders have to recognize and respond to that.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>A generation ago, it was standard policy to keep politics out of work. Today, it’s virtually impossible to separate the political from the personal, and employees are encouraged to bring their whole selves to work, which includes their backgrounds and belief systems.</p>
<p>Political and societal topics impact the everyday lives of employees and the world is more connected than ever. Startup leaders shouldn’t declare a political void &#8212; especially if they’re striving for a diverse and inclusive workforce. We’ve seen what happens when we don’t discuss these issues &#8212; systemic racism and workplace discrimination are allowed to go unchecked.</p>
<p>I’m the CEO and founder of a growing tech company, and also served as an HR executive at several Fortune 500 companies, which means I&#8217;ve seen all sides of the issues at play here.</p>
<p>That gives me some insight on the cultural problems gripping many tech businesses &#8212; and some thoughts on solutions. While companies have every right to create rules and policies on employee conduct and internal use of technology, leaders get better results when they approach these issues intentionally and transparently. As we’ve seen with Basecamp and others, banning political activities and discussions outright can result in unintended consequences.</p>
<h2>How to change policies without all the drama</h2>
<p>It’s impossible to know exactly what caused some of the recent tech company exoduses unless you were there. But most of us have experienced toxic workplace cultures, and having studied the issue extensively as an HR professional and then as a founder, my educated guess is that the recent employee actions that attracted negative media attention are symptoms of a situation that has been simmering for a long time.</p>
<p>If you’re a startup leader who wants to avoid similar controversies, how can you create or change policies without all the drama? Here are some tips to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Look in the mirror and analyze culture. </strong>People who found successful companies build a culture whether they consciously set out to do that or not. One explanation for cultural growing pains at startups is that many companies unconsciously create a monoculture populated by employees of similar backgrounds, skill sets, attitudes and life experiences. As the company grows, you bring in people with different backgrounds and perspectives to join the group and strengthen the business. But it’s important to remember that company culture and policies need to evolve and mature as the organization grows as well, or conflict will inevitably arise. Leaders can avoid that by being thoughtful about every aspect of the policies they create and adjusting the culture to support all employees, not just those who started on Day One.</li>
<li><strong>Get help as your company scales.</strong> CEOs set the tone, and for an early-stage startup, policies tend to be less formal and arise directly from company values. But as the organization matures, you may need to codify practices, such as how you handle time off, parental leave and pay structures. Just as you’d turn to the board for financial advice, it’s best to turn to HR and employee relations experts for workplace guidance. Get counsel from HR on how to avoid unintended consequences and communicate changes appropriately. Depending on what kind of policies you’re putting in place, it might also be a good idea to get input from employees.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use employee feedback to understand impact.</strong> It’s important to understand what’s going on in your organization before you make policy changes and take other actions that shape the company culture. Collecting employee feedback through surveys and open discussions will allow you to gain visibility into employee priorities and concerns and proceed with greater transparency and decisiveness. Consulting employees before making changes, and even after a policy change, will help you build trust and see if adjustments are needed. Some decisions must be made without staff input; workplaces are not democratic. If possible, try to understand where employees stand so you can better anticipate the impact. One caveat is to not take silence as approval. Just because employees stay after a controversial policy change doesn’t mean they are necessarily OK with it. Many startups put employees in golden handcuffs with benefits or stock options so attractive they “put up with it” for the future payoff. Anonymous surveys will help you understand the sentiment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don’t capitalize on employee policies for press:</strong> It’s not unusual for tech company leaders to publicly issue policy changes to create controversy. Just recently, Coinbase announced a <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/how-coinbase-is-rethinking-its-approach-to-compensation-9aaf7d5d638e">new compensation policy</a> that eliminates negotiations, a decision that is attracting scrutiny. Generally speaking, this practice isn’t necessarily a bad thing; some leaders have used their platforms to change calcified industry standards for the better. But leaders owe it to their teams to be judicious about publicly announcing new policies that affect staff. Employees shouldn’t be used as a pawn to garner press coverage. Employees want changes and programs that are driven by authenticity and what is right for the company, not changes spurred by the news of the week. With Basecamp, the company created an employee-run DEI committee when it was the “thing to do,” but the CEO disbanded it as soon as it became uncomfortable. This type of performative employee support is a surefire way to deteriorate employee confidence and morale. Be thoughtful about decisions and be prepared to stick through it even if challenges arise.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Addressing systemic problems requires a systemic approach</h2>
<p>“Don’t discuss politics at work” used to be a standard expectation. But employee expectations have shifted, and leaders have to recognize and respond to that. There is more value to be gleaned from encouraging employees to fully be themselves at work, which helps create an inclusive environment, but it’s also important to know you can’t drop these commitments the minute they become inconvenient.</p>
<p>While startup founders play a leading role, it is also on employees and everyone within the startup community to call out bias or inappropriate behaviors in the workforce and at the leadership level. The reality is that most employees at startups are highly skilled in a job market that values technical talent, putting them in a privileged position to take a risk, speak up or just leave when an organization’s culture is toxic or discriminatory. Their voice and actions will speak volumes for millions of workers who don’t have the ability to walk out the door and risk losing their livelihood — and their next paycheck.</p>
<p>The good news is that several Basecamp employees tried to make a change by suggesting a group focused on diversity. When that effort was shut down, they used their feet to send a message. To drive change, those in positions of privilege and power mustn’t stay silent as bystanders &#8212; they have to take a stand for others who aren’t in the position to do so themselves. If all of us harness our privilege to support others who are more vulnerable, we will inevitably create more equitable, welcoming workplaces for everyone.</p>
<p>The turmoil some tech companies are experiencing really comes down to culture and ego. We need to recognize that the old-school “no politics” rule led to situations where systemic racism, sexism and other forms of bigotry festered unchecked. We have an obligation to do better.</p>
<p>Company leaders who acknowledge the direct impact politics can have on employees, engage in open discussions with staff and approach policy changes in a way that reflects the organization’s core values can thrive, even in a divisive political climate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s been a lot of talk about racial equality in the year since George Floyd was murdered in Minneapolis, but achieving it is far easier said than done given the current state of affairs. Consider: according to the <a href="https://kcpr.mxfig.com/5c538c40d7ccca0f92010099/l/Ji8w7yvbcA02ik6rE?messageId=71N7939qBJUUj1f3A&amp;rn=iM3b6l2bMBSZp5mbvNkI&amp;re=ISbvNmLjZXesR3YpJHdzBUZp5mbvNmI&amp;sc=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://kcpr.mxfig.com/5c538c40d7ccca0f92010099/l/Ji8w7yvbcA02ik6rE?messageId%3D71N7939qBJUUj1f3A%26rn%3DiM3b6l2bMBSZp5mbvNkI%26re%3DISbvNmLjZXesR3YpJHdzBUZp5mbvNmI%26sc%3Dfalse&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622167730234000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHtFgP3ma-l8BEqaCitWdOeYRBsJg">U.S. Government Accountability Office</a>, historically Black colleges and universities have $15,000 on average in endowment per student, while comparable non-HBCUs have $410,000 on average in endowment per student.</p>
<p>That matters, a lot. While higher learning institutions are almost universally focused on diversifying their student base, HBCUs are largely responsible for the nation&#8217;s Black middle class, and the larger the endowment, the stronger the school and its ability to support its educators, researchers, and in the case of public HBCUs, its public service mission. Venture capitalist Jamison Hill says that his own father, who attended North Carolina A&amp;T State University in Greensboro, has long maintained that &#8220;if it weren&#8217;t for that experience, there&#8217;s no way he could have gone on to get a high-paying job, where he met my mother, who laid the foundation for the success of our family.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hill, who most recently spent more than six years with Bain Capital Ventures, is now doing something to protect that legacy, along with a kind of dream team that features Laura Weidman Powers, who has cofounded or led numerous impact-focused startups and nonprofits, including <a href="http://www.code2040.org/">Code2040</a>; and Luci Fonseca, who helped establish the Institute for Black Economic Mobility at McKinsey &amp; Co. and has focused on impact investing at Salesforce Ventures, among her other roles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All three have joined the four-year-old venture firm <a href="https://base10.vc/">Base10 Partners</a> to invest a new, $250 million growth-stage fund &#8212; the firm&#8217;s first later-stage vehicle &#8212; and fully half the profits from that fund will be directed to HBCUs to create student scholarships and support university endowments.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a brilliant play on the part of Base10, a Bay Area outfit that closed its second early-stage fund last year with $250 million in capital commitments. Called the Advancement Initiative, the fund has already managed to work checks into eight high-fliers &#8212; Attentive, Nubank, Brex, Plaid, Aurora Solar, Wealthsimple, CircleCI, and KeepTruckin.</p>
<p>In each case, the fund participated in heavily oversubscribed rounds, but given its mission, the companies&#8217; founding teams made room for its capital, as did other investors. (As an added sweetener, Base10 has promised to create scholarships in the name of each of these portfolio companies to fund the education of HBCU STEM students. Think: The Plaid Scholarship, The Brex Scholarship, and so forth.)</p>

<p>A fresh take on how the venture world can help close the racial inequality gap in the U.S., it could conceivably prove even more effective than other initiatives, including that of LPs who are increasingly pushing VCs to diversify their investing ranks.</p>
<p>The fund could be particularly impactful if it inspires copycat efforts. HBCUs confer nearly half of all STEM degrees for African-American students, says Base10, yet all 107 HBCU endowments combined are equal to just 7% of Stanford&#8217;s roughly $30 billion endowment.</p>
<p>So how will it work? For now, says Hill, the idea is to operate the fund as any growth-stage fund, meaning the overarching criteria is to back companies with the potential to produce outsize returns, no matter the skin color of their founders. Ultimately, however &#8212; &#8220;our hope is that this is not one and done,&#8221; says Hill &#8212; the idea is to drive change even further by layering in requirements about who can receive a check from the outfit.</p>
<p>As for the fund&#8217;s returns, some will flow directly back to particular HBCUs because they are limited partners in the Advancement Initiative fund, including the private university Howard University in Washington, D.C. and Florida A&amp;M University in Tallahassee, Florida.</p>
<p>Indeed, while the fund&#8217;s LPs also include earlier Base10 backers, along with organizations that serve minority communities and impact- and mission-oriented foundations, the Advancement Initiative was particularly focused on &#8220;removing any barriers to HBCUs investing,&#8221; says Weidman Powers, adding that it invited them to invest with &#8220;no fees, no minimums, no real closing date.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rest of the returns being set aside from HBCUs will be poured into a donor-advised fund that&#8217;s focused on increasing financial inclusion for the many institutions that do not currently have endowments large enough to support a private market strategy.</p>
<p>Given the late-stage of the companies it is backing &#8212; and the buzzy deals into which it&#8217;s getting &#8212; it&#8217;s likely, too, there will be profits.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve found that a lot of companies are very willing to have a conversation with us,&#8221; says Fonseca, who says the idea is to plug between $10 million an $20 million into each of the fund&#8217;s portfolio companies. &#8220;The toughest part is just getting in front of the CEO,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;Once we get in front of that person and we tell that story, we tell them the vision, they&#8217;re immediately sold.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’ve been urging you to <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/zM4H0xNn">apply to Startup Battlefield</a> at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> for weeks now, and you have just over 12 hours left before the application window slams shut on <strong>May 27 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>. Don’t procrastinate — the experience alone, whether you win the $100,000 prize or not, can improve the trajectory of your business.</p>
<p><strong>Case in point:</strong> Mollie Breen started out as a mathematician at the National Security Agency before co-founding an IoT/OT security startup called <a href="https://perygee.com/">Perygee</a>. She and her team competed in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/">Startup Battlefield</a> last year at Disrupt 2020. Although they didn’t reach the finals, Breen has plenty to say about the experience. Here’s what she shared with us in a quick Q&amp;A.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> <strong>Why did you apply to Startup Battlefield?                                             </strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Breen:</strong> I admired the leadership and growth of other companies that, at one point, were Startup Battlefield contestants. I noticed they had similar traction to us when they applied, and their products resembled ours in their ability to disrupt the respective industry.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What was the training process like?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Breen:</strong> It was incredibly valuable both in the short term and long term. Every team gets a weekly session with the Battlefield editor. Together you rehearse and go over every iteration of the pitch line-by-line and slide-by-slide. After each session, I walked away with constructive feedback on everything — the content, the speaking style and even the font color on a particular slide.</p>
<p>This was a unique opportunity, and we put in extra hours to be ahead of schedule, sent drafts for review in the off hours and even doubled down on additional practice with Q&amp;As. As a result, we couldn’t have been more prepared for pitch day. And the training has stayed with Perygee well past the sessions and the competition.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What did it feel like to pitch at Disrupt?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Breen:</strong> Pitching at Disrupt was, in some ways, like other pitches except that you have an international audience. Since, at that point, we had practiced our pitch dozens of times, the real unknown during the competition was the Q&amp;A with the VC judges.</p>
<p>There was additional pressure to answer succinctly and convincingly within a time constraint that you wouldn’t have during a normal one-on-one pitch. But with the prep help from the TechCrunch team, I felt ready to speak in front of such a large audience. I encourage anyone who might be nervous about the big stage to go for it and trust you’ll have more than enough preparation when you get there.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What was the post-pitch impact? Did you meet investors, press or other key partners?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Breen:</strong> It helped accelerate our progress. Following Battlefield, we closed an oversubscribed fundraising round. We acquired additional beta users, including our first beta user who messaged us after reading about Perygee on TechCrunch. We also gained numerous press opportunities to share our story.</p>
<p>It’s almost a year since Startup Battlefield, and I’m still impressed by how many people start the conversation saying they watched the pitch while reading our company’s background. It’s a reminder that the opportunities created by being a TechCrunch Battlefield company continue.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you have any great news to share since your pitch?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Breen:</strong> At TechCrunch Battlefield we were a small team doing MVP testing and just about to start raising. Since the pitch, we have scaled on all fronts. We grew the founding team and the engineering team, and we deployed the product to enterprise networks. Some of those deployments include contacts who reached out because of TechCrunch — and we raised our seed round!</p>
<p><strong>TC: Is there anything else you’d like to share?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Breen:</strong> I’m grateful for the camaraderie and relationships we developed with the other teams. What you didn’t see on stage during the pitches was all of us cheering one another on from the group chat or social media feed. Even now, we continue to support one another through navigating business questions or promoting product launches. If it weren’t for Startup Battlefield, I would never have met this awesome group of startups.</p>
<p>You have just 24 hours left to channel your inner Mollie Breen. <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/zM4H0xNn">Apply to Startup Battlefield</a> before the deadline expires on <strong>May 27 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>. Get moving!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Managing the technical side of open-source projects is often hard enough, but throw in the inevitable conflicts between contributors, who are often very passionate about their contributions, and things get even harder. One way to establish ground rules for open-source communities is the <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/">Contributor Covenant</a>, created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coraline_Ada_Ehmke">Coraline Ada Ehmke</a> back in 2014. Like so many projects in the open-source world, the Contributor Covenant was also a passion project for Ehmke. Over the years, its first two iterations have been adopted by organizations like the CNCF, Creative Commons, Apple, Google, Microsoft and the Linux project, in addition to <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/adopters/">hundreds of other projects</a>.</p>
<p>Now, as work is starting on version 3.0, the <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/">Organization for Ethical Source</a> (OES), of which Ehmke is a co-founder and executive director, will take over the stewardship of the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;Contributor Covenant was the first document of its kind as code of conduct for open-source projects &#8212; and it was incredibly controversial and actually remains pretty controversial to this day,&#8221; Ehmke told me. &#8220;But I come from the Ruby community, and the Ruby community really embraced the concept and also really embraced the document itself. And then it spread from there to lots of other open-source projects and other open-source communities.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The core of the document is a pledge to &#8220;make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation,&#8221; and for contributors to act in ways that contribute to a diverse, open and welcoming community.</p>
<p>As Ehmke told me, one part that evolved over the course of the last few years is the addition of enforcement guidelines that are meant to help community leaders determine the consequences when members violate the code of conduct.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things that I try to do in this work is when people criticize the work, even if they&#8217;re not arguing in good faith, I try to see if there&#8217;s something in there that could be used as constructive feedback, something actionable,&#8221; Ehmke said. &#8220;A lot of the criticism for years for Contributor Covenant was people saying, &#8216;Oh, I&#8217;ll say one wrong thing and be permanently banned from our project, which is really grim and really unreasonable.&#8217; What I took from that is that people are afraid of what consequences project leaders might impose on them for an infraction. Put that way, that&#8217;s kind of a reasonable concern.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ehmke described bringing the Covenant to the OES as an &#8220;exit to community,&#8221; similar to how companies will often bring their mature open-source projects under the umbrella of a foundation. She noted that the OES includes a lot of members with expertise in community management and project governance, which they will be able to bring to the project in a more formal way. &#8220;I&#8217;m still going to be involved with the evolution of Contributor Covenant, but it&#8217;s going to be developed under the working group model that the organization for ethical source has established,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>For version 3.0, Ehmke hopes to turn the Covenant into what she described as more of a &#8220;toolkit&#8221; that will allow different communities to tailor it a bit more to their own goals and values (though still within the core ethical principles <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/principles/">outlined by the OES</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;Microsoft’s adoption of Contributor Covenant represents our commitment to building healthy, diverse and inclusive communities, as well as our intention to contribute and build together with others in the ecosystem,&#8221; said Emma Irwin, a program manager in Microsoft’s Open Source Program Office. &#8220;I am honored to bring this intention and my expertise to the OES&#8217;s Contributor Covenant 3.0 working group.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you drive past potholes and faded lane dividers on your morning commute to work, chances are you&#8217;ll continue to see such road blemishes until someone alerts the local department of transportation to the problem by filing a complaint. Utah-based startup <a href="https://blyncsy.com/">Blyncsy</a> wants to help governments be a bit more preemptive than that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The movement and data intelligence company is launching an AI-powered technology, called Payver, that will use crowd-sourced video data to give transport agencies up-to-date information on which roads require maintenance and improvements. Blyncsy is offering this service to governments at a reduced cost and with no long-term commitment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utah’s DOT will be the first to pilot the program beginning June 1, deploying Payver in the Salt Lake County region, which covers more than 350 road miles. Blyncsy will be announcing other pilots in different states over the next few weeks. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governments are typically a bit slower to adopt new technologies, and while the </span><a href="https://www.transportation.gov/smartcity"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. DOT has spent more than $250 million in public and private funds for smart city</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and advanced transportation options, much of the progress tends to revolve around making public transit in cities greener and more efficient. Blyncsy founder and CEO Mark Pittman argues inefficient road maintenance is not only unsafe, but it also causes higher carbon emissions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The inspiration for Payver came in 2017 when the UDOT executive director set a goal that it would be the first department in the country to have real-time situational awareness on our roadways, and we’ve been working on solving that problem for them,” Pittman told TechCrunch. “They want to know what’s happening and when it’s happening automatically so the public doesn’t have to be involved. So if there’s roadside debris or stop signs missing or paint lines that need to be fixed, how does the department know without the public having to call and complain or without an accident occurring?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blyncsy’s Payver technology works by collecting any kind of HD images and videos from a variety of sources, such as Nexar dash cameras, and analyzing the data sets with machine vision to deliver output to customers. The insights are available to transit agencies in a dashboard format, but Payver also integrates into the maintenance management software that determines a rank order of repair jobs.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the UDOT pilot, Payver will initially focus on monitoring paint lines, which is the basic requirement to support an autonomous environment, but may expand into potholes, construction barrels, knocked over signs and whatever else can go wrong from daily wear. UDOT has a budget of about $90,000 for this pilot, according to Rob Miles, UDOT’s director of traffic and safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now, we do a lidar scan of our roadways every two years, so we’re always out there collecting data of some sort, but it’s not at a high enough fidelity that we can manage our striping off of it,” Miles told TechCrunch. “We&#8217;re still really managing striping off of public complaints. We&#8217;re hoping with a different data collection system that we can move from that complaint-based system to something that has less opinion and more measurable data behind it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pittman said optimizing active mobility forms by helping predict repairs needed for pedestrian crossings or safe locations for bike lanes will be a priority for Payver as the technology advances, which is important for maintaining equity and inclusion in mobility. Payver can also help bridge the racial and socioeconomic gap in road conditions, says Pittman, helping DOTs deliver equitable services to the entire public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pete Buttigieg recently talked about how transportation as it is has helped support systemic racism at times and pigeonhole communities because of the way we build roads often with lower income populations being closer to freeways,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The same thing is also true when you think about roadway maintenance. Lower-income populations are much less likely to complain and higher-income populations are a lot more likely to complain, but the impact of a pothole in a low-income population means a broken axle, which can determine the viability of that family surviving. That&#8217;s not true in a high-income environment.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://home.breinify.ai/">Breinify</a> is a startup working to apply data science to personalization, and do it in a way that makes it accessible to nontechnical marketing employees to build more meaningful customer experiences. Today the company announced a funding round totaling $11 million.</p>
<p>The investment was led by Gutbrain Ventures and PBJ Capital with participation from Streamlined Ventures, CXO Fund, Amino Capital, Startup Capital Ventures and Sterling Road.</p>
<p>Breinify co-founder and CEO Diane Keng says that she and co-founder and CTO Philipp Meisen started the company to bring predictive personalization based on data science to marketers with the goal of helping them improve a customer&#8217;s experience by personalizing messages tailored to individual tastes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re big believers that the world, especially consumer brands, really need strong predictive personalization. But when you think about consumer big brands or the retailers that you buy from, most of them aren&#8217;t data scientists, nor do they really know how to activate [machine learning] at scale,&#8221; Keng told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>She says that she wanted to make this type of technology more accessible by hiding the complexity behind the algorithms powering the platform. &#8220;Instead of telling you how powerful the algorithms are, we show you [what that means for the] consumer experience, and in the end what that means for both the consumer and you as a marketer individually,&#8221; she said.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="fAHyC4UnMa"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-marketing/">Marketing in 2021 is emotional and not just transactional</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Marketing in 2021 is emotional and not just transactional&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-marketing/embed/#?secret=fAHyC4UnMa" data-secret="fAHyC4UnMa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That involves the kind of customizations you might expect around website messaging, emails, texts or whatever channel a marketer might be using to communicate with the buyer. &#8220;So the AI decides you should be shown these products, this offer, this specific promotion at this time, [whether it&#8217;s] the web, email or SMS. So you&#8217;re not getting the same content across different channels, and we do all that automatically for you, and that&#8217;s [driven by the algorithms],&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Breinify launched in 2016 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/12/breinify-tells-online-retailers-what-customers-want-to-buy-at-a-specific-point-in-time/">participated in the TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield</a> competition in San Francisco that year. She said it was early days for the company, but it helped them focus their approach. &#8220;I think it gave us a huge stage presence. It gave us a chance to test out the idea just to see where the market was in regards to needing a solution like this. We definitely learned a lot. I think it showed us that people were interested in personalization,&#8221; she said. And although the company didn&#8217;t win the competition, it ended up walking away with a funding deal.</p>
<p>Today the startup is growing fast and has 24 employees, up from 10 last year. Keng, who is an Asian woman, places a high premium on diversity.</p>
<p>&#8220;We partner with about four different kinds of diversity groups right now to source candidates, but at the end of the day, I think if you are someone that&#8217;s eager to learn, and you might not have all the skills yet, and you&#8217;re [part of an under-represented] group we encourage everyone to apply as much as possible. We put a lot of work into trying to create a really well-rounded group,&#8221; she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Collaborative software is so hot right now, but the space is also incredibly crowded. It can be hard to rise above the noise, but Coda has managed to do so with $140 million in funding and a valuation topping $600 million.</p>
<p>So it should go without saying that we&#8217;re excited to hear from Coda CEO Shishir Mehrotra and Madrona investor S. Somasegar, who invested in the company&#8217;s Series C round, on an upcoming episode of <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-madrona-and-coda">Extra Crunch Live</a>.</p>
<p>Soma is a managing director at Madrona, responsible for investments in Snowflake, UIPath, Coda, Pulumi, Seekout and more. He invests in a broad array of categories, including machine learning, next-gen cloud infrastructure, future of work, robotic process automation and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Before Madrona, Soma spent 27 years at Microsoft as SVP of the Developer Division. He&#8217;s got experience both as an operator and investor and will have plenty of wisdom to impart on the episode.</p>
<p>Mehrotra, for his part, has built a pretty massive business that has not only scaled well, but competes directly with giants like Google. Coda is a collaborative doc/spreadsheet software that looks to take on the G Suite. Before Coda, Mehrotra was an executive at YouTube and, prior to that, held leadership roles at Microsoft working on Windows, Office and SQL Server.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk to these two about fundraising for a product like Coda, what attracted Soma to the platform and how they work alongside one another today. We&#8217;ll also have an Extra Crunch Live Pitch-Off, where folks in the audience can come on &#8220;stage&#8221; and pitch their wares. Mehrotra and Soma will give their live feedback and, let&#8217;s face it, make all of us better at pitching in general.</p>
<p>The episode goes down on June 2 at 3 p.m. EDT/noon PDT and is accessible to anyone. However, only Extra Crunch members can access this episode (and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">entire ECL library</a>) on-demand. If you&#8217;re not a member yet, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/">join here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The NFT world is all about reshaping the idea of digital ownership, but art hardware startup <a href="https://infiniteobjects.com/">Infinite Objects</a> sees a big opportunity in making physical copies of those assets as it looks to reshape digital art and collectibles.</p>
<p>The startup makes screens that show a single video from a single artist and don&#8217;t do anything else. You can&#8217;t download apps to the screens or upload your own photos to them or check the time or weather. If you even want another piece of art from Infinite Objects, you can&#8217;t just download it, you have to actually go to their site and buy another display with that artwork on it. Each screen boasts information about the work, edition numbers and serial numbers etched on the back of it, inextricably tying the physical display to the work that it displays.</p>
<p>Infinite Objects CEO Joe Saavedra tells TechCrunch they&#8217;ve raised $6 million in seed funding from a host of backers including Courtside VC, which led the deal, and NBA Top Shot creator Dapper Labs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For the longest time, Infinite Objects was an NFT platform without the NFTs. The company has worked with artists since 2018 to make (often limited run) series of physical display frames highlighting a specific digital work of the artist that looped forever. Sure, users could watch that looping video on the Infinite Objects website whenever they wanted, but the value was in owning an official copy of that artist&#8217;s work. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>When the wider popularity of NFTs as a speculative asset hit earlier this year, Saavedra saw a huge opportunity as internet users began discussing the future of digital art and digital scarcity. His team had already flirted with NFTs, partnering with artist Beeple back in December &#8212; months before he would spring out of relative obscurity in art circles with a $69 million sale at the Christie&#8217;s auction house &#8212; to release &#8220;physical tokens&#8221; of NFTs he was selling on the platform Nifty Gateway.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Saavedra sees a bigger opportunity for companies and creators in the NFT world to make their assets more approachable and understandable to a general audience with what his company is building, but he also sees a chance to transform NFTs from blind ownership to something more focused on actually appreciating the digital art that&#8217;s been purchased.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it comes to ownership, it&#8217;s exciting to be buying an NFT for $500 or $5,000, but what&#8217;s not exciting is having to open Safari on your phone to show it off,&#8221; Saavedra tells TechCrunch. &#8220;This physical vessel that we&#8217;ve designed is just so understandable for people who maybe don&#8217;t even understand what the blockchain at all, but they certainly understand limited edition physical merchandise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saavedra is dismissive of other digital displays that cycle through artwork and says that art owners could also just toss images of their NFTs onto the TV if they wanted to, but that they all only serve up art as &#8220;glorified screensavers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team at Infinite Objects sees broader opportunities in the NFT world but they&#8217;ve been tight-lipped on exactly what these efforts will look like. You can see some potential hints in the list of backers in this round, including most interestingly NBA Top Shot creator Dapper Labs. The startup has been building out its own blockchain called Flow and Saavedra was quick to sing its praises in our conversation, noting that it&#8217;s more scalable and sustainable than the Ethereum network. Dapper Labs recently announced its first major third-party NFT platform, partnering with avatar startup Genies &#8212; another investor in this round &#8212; for a digital accessories storefront that&#8217;s being launched this summer.</p>
<p>Serena Ventures, Betaworks, Brooklyn Bridge Ventures, GFR Fund, Kevin Durant &amp; Rich Kleiman, Genies and Ashton Kutcher&#8217;s Sound Ventures also participated in the round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday evening, Twitter announced that </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/twitter-spaces/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spaces</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; its Clubhouse competitor &#8212; will start rolling out for use on the web. Earlier this month, Twitter Spaces became available for any user with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">more than 600 followers</a> on the iOS or Android apps, and around the same time, Clubhouse finally released its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/clubhouse-android-app-launch/">long-awaited Android app</a>. Still, Clubhouse has yet to debut on the web, marking a success for Twitter in the race to corner the live social audio market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Instagram is positioning itself as a Clubhouse competitor, allowing users to “go live” </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/instagram-live-takes-on-clubhouse-with-options-to-mute-and-turn-off-the-video/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the ability to mute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their audio and video. How will each app differentiate itself? Twitter CFO Ned Segal attempted to address this at JP Morgan’s 49th Annual Technology, Media, &amp; Communications conference this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Twitter is where you go to find out what’s happening in the world and what people are talking about,” said Segal. “So when you come to Twitter, and you look at your home Timeline and you see a Space, it’s gonna perhaps be people who you don’t know but who are talking about a topic that’s incredibly relevant to you. It could be Bitcoin, it could be the aftershock from the Grammys, it could be that they’re talking about the NFL Draft.” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter’s </span><a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1397688581846568961"><span style="font-weight: 400;">focus areas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the web version of Spaces include a UI that adapts to the user’s screen size and reminders for scheduled Spaces. Before joining a space, Twitter will display a preview that shows who is in a Space, and a description of the topic being discussed. Users will also be able to have a Space open on the right side of their screen while still scrolling through their Timeline.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most crucially, this update lists accessibility and transcriptions as a focus area. For an audio-only platform, live transcriptions are necessary for Deaf and hard-of-hearing people to join in on the conversation.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, accessibility has often been treated as an afterthought throughout the rise of live audio. Clubhouse does not yet support live captioning. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Something I think that gets lost in the conversation around robotics is just how many different tasks can &#8212; and at some point will &#8212; be automated. Here I’m talking specifically about agtech. We’ve seen a ton of agricultural robotics come across our desk in recent years, and one of the more remarkable things about it all is just how broad the applications are.</p>
<p>There are all of the usual automated tasks you’d expect: produce picking, payload carting, weed pulling. All necessary farming tasks that seem to be well served by the industry. But what of rocks? Honestly, it’s something that hadn’t really occurred to me, having not spent any time on farms, aside from the occasional elementary school field trip.</p>
<p>TerraClear first<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/smartsheet-co-founders-next-project-is-a-robotic-rock-picker-upper/"> entered our radar in 2018</a>, mostly due to the founder’s former company (Smartsheet). Rocks are, quite literally, a big problem for farmers and farming equipment, so the company built a tractor/robot designed to pick them up. The system, which ships next year, will be able to grab up to 400 rocks an hour &#8212; individual rocks weighing up to 300 pounds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/S1ELdkR1Bbo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The company just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/rock-picking-robotics-startup-terraclear-raises-25-million/">announced a $25 million Series A</a>, which brings its total funding up to $36 million, says founder and CEO Brent Frei.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="nu08cbRCVS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/rock-picking-robotics-startup-terraclear-raises-25-million/">Rock-picking robotics startup TerraClear raises $25 million</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rock-picking robotics startup TerraClear raises $25 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/rock-picking-robotics-startup-terraclear-raises-25-million/embed/#?secret=nu08cbRCVS" data-secret="nu08cbRCVS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;There are more than 400 million arable acres worldwide that have been waiting for a cost-effective and productive solution to this problem,&#8221; said Frei. &#8220;Repetitive tasks like this are optimal targets for automation, and the technologies we are bringing to the field dramatically reduce the labor and time needed to prep fields for planting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since we’re talking about farms and robots, Bowery Farming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/indoor-farming-company-bowery-raises-300m/">deserves a mention for a massive $300 million round</a>. That puts the NYC-based company’s value at a beefy $2.3 billion. Robots, sensors and AI are a big part of Bowery’s vertical farming approach. The company’s already sending its produce to 850 grocery stores, along with a deal with Amazon Fresh.</p>
<p>It’s probably safe to say that indoor farming has a future for all sorts of reasons having to do with land use, climate and beyond.</p>

<p>Of course today’s research is tomorrow’s unicorns (this is not actually a saying…yet), and there are a couple of projects worth noting this week. Leading <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/robotic-finger-buried-underground-0526">off the bunch is MIT</a>, which is giving robotic inspection the finger. The oddly (but not inaccurately) named Digger Finger is capable of sensing and identifying objects underground. It’s a useful skill that could someday be deployed for landmines, finding underground cables and a variety of other tasks.</p>
<p>And here’s a nice feel-good story, as it were. A<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6544/831"> new paper published in Science</a> from University of Pittsburgh engineers highlights the value of adding tactile feedback for prosthetic arms. This delivers some clear advantages over traditional vision sensing. Per the paper:</p>
<blockquote><p>Flesher et al. added an afferent channel to the brain-computer interface to mimic sensory input from the skin of a hand (see the Perspective by Faisal). The improvements achieved by adding the afferent input were substantial in a battery of motor tasks tested in a human subject.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instacart is speeding up grocery delivery. The company announced today it&#8217;s debuting a faster delivery service, &#8220;Priority Delivery,&#8221; in select markets across the U.S. and Canada, with the aim of attracting customers who would have otherwise quickly run to the store for their smaller orders or more urgent demands. At launch, the service will operate in several larger U.S. metros, and will offer deliveries in as fast as 30 minutes, the company says. Instacart is also expanding other speedier delivery services, including 45-minute and 60-minute options, to more cities and retailers in the months to come.</p>
<p>Today, many customers use Instacart to order their larger weekly or monthly grocery orders, but still run to the store when they need a smaller number of items &#8212; like ingredients for tonight&#8217;s meal, for example. The new Priority Delivery wants to be an alternative to these shorter trips, effectively becoming the grocery delivery alternative to using a store&#8217;s express lane checkout.</p>
<p>In the markets where Priority Delivery is live, it will be indicated by supported retailers in the Instacart app with a lightning bolt icon that notes the expected delivery time, like &#8220;30 minutes or less.&#8221; Customers will also be given the option to choose Priority during checkout, instead of Standard delivery or a scheduled time, if they prefer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company tells us there&#8217;s not an item limit nor minimum on these types of orders. However, shorter requests &#8212; like milk, a few bags of chips and a couple of bottles of wine, for instance &#8212; will be fulfilled faster than orders where the customer is requesting specialty deli items, a pickup from a bakery or has a larger basket size.</p>
<p>When the basket size grows larger or the order becomes more complicated, the app will update to display that the 30-minute window is no longer available and display the new delivery time.</p>
<p>Instacart hasn&#8217;t yet finalized its pricing for the service, but Priority Delivery will carry an upcharge of some kind. However, the company tells us the fee will be &#8220;small&#8221; and &#8220;incremental,&#8221; and will likely be dynamic based on market considerations. It notes that the different delivery options and their associated fees and taxes are displayed during checkout, so there are no surprises.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;10 investors predict MaaS, on-demand delivery and EVs will dominate mobility&#8217;s post-pandemic future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/10-investors-predict-maas-on-demand-delivery-and-evs-will-dominate-the-post-covid-future-of-mobility/embed/#?secret=8Dkp4JhwKC" data-secret="8Dkp4JhwKC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Initially, Priority Delivery will be available in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, San Diego, San Francisco and Seattle, across more than 300 store locations, including grocers and specialty retailers. It plans to roll out the service to more markets and retailers over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that no two grocery shops are created equal &#8212; whether it’s a bulk buy for the week ahead or just a few ingredients for tonight’s dinner &#8212; so we’re launching new features that support the many ways people shop for their groceries today,&#8221; noted Daniel Danker, vice president of Product at Instacart, in a statement about the launch. &#8220;For many customers, every minute counts when they’re in a pinch and need something in a hurry. With today’s launch of Priority Delivery, we’re redefining the ‘quick run to the store’ and bringing the grocery express lane online for customers,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>In addition, Instacart will expand access to 45-minute and 60-minute delivery options to more cities across the U.S., allowing consumers other options for faster delivery, even if the Priority service is not available.</p>
<p>The move to increase delivery speeds across its footprint could help Instacart better compete with grocery delivery rivals, like Walmart and Amazon&#8217;s grocery businesses, as well as Target-owned Shipt.</p>
<p>It also shortly follows Amazon&#8217;s announcement last week that it would be <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/21/amazon-is-shutting-down-its-prime-now-fast-delivery-app.html">shutting down its standalone Prime Now delivery app and website</a>, to instead direct shoppers who want faster delivery on groceries to the Amazon app and website. However, in Amazon&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s promising two-hour delivery windows on both Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods; not as low as 30 minutes. Meanwhile, Walmart&#8217;s membership-based delivery service, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/plus/faq/free-unlimited-delivery">Walmart+</a>, doesn&#8217;t currently guarantee same-day delivery even for its paying subscribers, as its time slots are on a first-come, first-serve basis. Among the big names, that leaves Shipt &#8212; which offers same-day delivery, but not necessarily in 30 minutes.</p>
<p>The update may also make Instacart more competitive with other types of fast delivery businesses which don&#8217;t serve grocery retailers &#8212; like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/gopuff-new-funding/">goPuff&#8217;s &#8220;instant needs&#8221; delivery service</a>, <a href="https://help.uber.com/merchants-and-restaurants/article/how-do-i-become-an-essentials-partner-on-uber-eats?nodeId=8acbbb47-9eb0-4c92-90b1-b05c72a9484d">Uber Eats Essentials</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/doordash-launches-a-convenience-store/">DoorDash, which last year expanded to include convenience store items</a> &#8212; including things like chips, ice cream, spices, packaged foods and others that might have otherwise made for a quick store trip.</p>
<p>Instacart&#8217;s new service is rolling out now to customers in supported markets.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The world of hybrid work is here, and the usual 10-minute intro call, swag bag and first-day team lunch are just not enough to make your new employee feel welcome.</p>
<p>While many companies have found a way to interview and select candidates in a fully remote environment, fewer have spent time and resources on aligning the “pre-boarding” and onboarding process for the new hybrid world of work. Many employers still rely on old ways of welcoming new hires, despite our totally changed work environment.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			It’s important to capitalize on candidates’ enthusiasm and eagerness from the moment the offer is signed, instead of when they log in on Day One.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In our experience at Greenhouse, where we help companies as diverse as BuzzFeed, HubSpot and Intercom hire talent across their organization, first impressions can make or break a candidate’s chances of staying at a company.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/dont-underestimate-the-importance-of-effective-onboarding.aspx">69%</a> of employees will stay for more than three years if their onboarding experience is good, while <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/employee-relations/pages/reducing-new-employee-turnover-among-emerging-adults.aspx">20%</a> will leave within 45 days if it&#8217;s bad. That difference is costly, as it takes, on average, around <a href="https://www.shrm.org/about-shrm/press-room/press-releases/pages/human-capital-benchmarking-report.aspx">$4,129 and 42 days to fill a position</a>.</p>
<p>Replacing someone can cost up to 50%-60% of their annual salary. At the same time,<a href="https://www.saplinghr.com/10-employee-onboarding-statistics-you-must-know-in-2021"> 58% of organizations</a> said they were guilty of centering their onboarding processes on administrative and paperwork requirements alone.</p>
<p>Here is how we advise our clients to set up every new hire for success right from the start.</p>
<h2>The company’s Day One comes long before the candidate’s Day One</h2>
<p>Most of us can remember the excitement (and anxiety) of receiving and signing an offer for a new job. It’s important to capitalize on candidates’ enthusiasm and eagerness from the moment the offer is signed, instead of when they log in on Day One.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/">RevenueCat</a>, a startup offering a series of tools for developers of subscription-based apps, has raised $40 million in Series B funding, valuing its business at $300 million, post-money. Founded by developers who understood the difficulties in scaling a subscription app first-hand, RevenueCat&#8217;s software development kit (SDK) solution gives companies the tools they need to build a subscription business, including not just adding subscriptions themselves, but maintaining them over time even as the app stores implement changes. It also aids by sharing subscription data with other tools the business uses, like those for advertising, analytics or attribution.</p>
<p>The funding round was led by Y Combinator&#8217;s Continuity Fund and included participation from Index Ventures, SaaStr, Oakhouse, Adjacent, and FundersClub, as well as Blinklist CTO Tobias Balling and Algolia CEO Nicolas Dessaign. With the round, YC Continuity Partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anuhariharan/">Anu Hariharan</a> is joining RevenueCat&#8217;s board, which today includes Index&#8217;s Mark Fiorentino in addition to the founders.</p>
<p>Explains RevenueCat CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeiting/">Jacob Eiting</a>, the idea for the company came about after he and co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguelcarranza/">Miguel Carranza Guisado</a> (CTO) struggled to figure out subscription infrastructure while working together at Elevate. After years of untangling a &#8220;subscription mess&#8221; in order to figure out answers to basic questions like subscriber retention and lifetime value, they realized there was potential in helping solve this problem for other developers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple and Google, Eiting explains, aren&#8217;t always up to date with what companies actually need to build subscription businesses. &#8220;They&#8217;re kind of learning as they go. They just weren&#8217;t able to provide us the data we needed, and then also the infrastructure to do that is non-trivial.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2157214" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2157214" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2157214" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RevenueCat_series_b-2-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="357" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RevenueCat_series_b-2-1.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RevenueCat_series_b-2-1.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RevenueCat_series_b-2-1.jpg?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RevenueCat_series_b-2-1.jpg?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RevenueCat_series_b-2-1.jpg?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RevenueCat_series_b-2-1.jpg?resize=1536,806 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RevenueCat_series_b-2-1.jpg?resize=2048,1075 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RevenueCat_series_b-2-1.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2157214" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> RevenueCat</p></div></p>
<p>When Eiting and Guisado sat down to work on on RevenueCat in 2017, no one else was even building anything like this. But the demand for the startup&#8217;s tools and integrations soon resonated with developers who had faced similar challenges it the growing subsection app market.</p>
<p>Using the service, developers can access a real-time dashboard that display key metrics, like subscription revenue, churn, <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/lifetime-value/">LTV</a> (lifetime value), subscriber numbers, conversions and more. The data can then be shared through integrations with other tools and services, like Adjust, Amplitude, Apple Search Ads, AppsFlyer, Branch, Facebook Ads, Google Cloud Intercom, Mixpanel, Segment, <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/integrations">and several others. </a></p>
<p>After launching out of Y Combinator&#8217;s accelerator the following year, RevenueCat was soon live with 100 apps and had crossed $1 million in tracked revenue by the time it<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/24/revenuecat-seed-funding/"> raised its $1.5 million seed round. </a></p>
<p>Today, RevenueCat has over 6,000 apps live on its platform, with over $1 billion in tracked subscription revenue being managed by its tools. That&#8217;s double the number of apps that were using its service <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/revenuecat-secures-15m-series-a-for-app-subscription-platform/">as of its $15 million Series A last August</a>.</p>
<p>With the additional funding, the company will lower its pricing to put its tools in reach of more developers. Previously, it charged $120 per month for its charts and some of its integrations, or $499 per month for access to all integrations. This was affordable for larger companies, but could still be a difficult sell to the long tail of app developers where revenues ranged from $10K to $50K per month.</p>
<p>Now, RevenueCat will charge a small percentage of an app&#8217;s sales instead of a flat fee. Developers with up to $10,000 in monthly tracked revenue (MTR) can get started with the service for free and as their demands grow &#8212; like needing access to charts, support for web hooks, integrations and others &#8212; they can <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/pricing">move up to either the Starter or Pro plans</a> as $8/mo or $12/mo per $1,000 in MTR, respectively.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited to give those tools to developers, especially on the small end, because it might be what they need to get out of that &#8216;less than $10K range,'&#8221; Eiting says. &#8220;Also, the beauty of freemium, or having a really generous free tier, is that it makes your tool the de facto &#8212; you remove as much friction as possible for providing software services and then, if you get your pricing right &#8212; which I think we have &#8212; it all kind of pays for itself,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>The company also plans to use the new funds to further invest in its business, expanding from App Store and Google Play support to include Amazon&#8217;s Appstore. It will also grow its team.</p>
<p>As part of its expected growth, RevenueCat recently hired a Head of Product, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jefago/?originalSubdomain=de" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/jefago/?originalSubdomain%3Dde&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1621973532621000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF7Vb2goPqCDEnTBUMXq5s97FbUAg">Jens-Fabian Goetzmann</a>, previously a PM at Microsoft and then product head at fitness app 8fit. Currently 30 people, in the year ahead, RevenueCat will grow to 60 people, <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/revenuecat">hiring</a> across design, product, engineering, sales and other roles.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world is moving toward subscriptions — and for companies, building out this model translates to weeks of developers’ time,&#8221; says YC Continuity&#8217;s Hariharan. &#8220;RevenueCat helps developers rollout subscriptions in minutes and creates a source of truth for customer data. With developers creating solutions to problems in the world, it’s important that they can find ways to monetize, grow, and support their most committed customers. RevenueCat is doing so by building subscriptions 2.0.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Boston-based <a href="https://www.filtered.ai/">Filtered.ai</a> has raised a $7 million round to accelerate its hiring cadence, and built out the go-to-market model for its <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">its engineering and developer-focused hiring service, it recently announced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">TechCrunch caught up with the company to discuss not only why it decided to leave bootstrapping behind, but also to dig into how its service could widen the market for some technical roles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The startup was born back in 2016 out of a need when its founder and CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/deliber8prakts?lang=en">Paul Bilodeau</a> started to work on it as an internal project while employed at a consultancy. Filtered later split from the consulting group in 2019, signing a term sheet to raise capital in March of 2020. Then COVID-19 arrived, and things got a bit turbulent.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But before we get lost in the money side of things, let&#8217;s talk about what the company does.</p>
<p>Filtered&#8217;s product is interesting as it could help shake up a hiring system for technical roles for startups that is rife with bias and wasted time. If you are friends with any developers, for example, or data scientists, you are aware of how not-good their hiring process can be.</p>
<p>To pick two issues: Resumes are often a pretty poor indicator of talent, and on-site whiteboard sessions are super unpopular. Filtered is taking on both by providing <em>skills-based</em> take-home tests with AI aboard to help detect fraud. The hiring company can play back those sessions to see how candidates approached problems. Filtered also allows companies to ask candidates open-ended interview questions via video, removing the need for formulaic phone screens that are only good for providing full-employment to junior HR staff.</p>
<p>Filtered claims that its system can get companies to the point of making offers more quickly.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all well and good, but what TechCrunch was most curious about was what the startup&#8217;s service might manage when it comes to making hiring more equitable. If it&#8217;s more skills-focused than resume-centric, does that shake up who gets hired? It does, the company thinks. Once resumes lose some of their luster, and candidates are vetted on skills over keyword optimization in their applications, &#8220;diversity just happens,&#8221; Bilodeau explained.</p>
<h2>The round</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s get back to the money. The timing of Filtered&#8217;s anticipated venture capital round and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic were unfortunately timed rather close to each other.</p>
<p>So, Bilodeau told TechCrunch in an interview that his startup effectively raised capital on a drip basis throughout 2020, until it finally closed its round in the fourth quarter of the year. That timing was somewhat fortuitous for its investors &#8212; <a href="https://svdcapital.com/">Silicon Valley Data Capital</a> and <a href="https://aifund.ai/">the AI Fund</a> &#8212; as Filtered&#8217;s CEO said that that was the company&#8217;s best quarter in its history.</p>
<p>From bootstrapping to taking on capital, what changed at Filtered that led it to decide to raise external funding? Per Bilodeau, he didn&#8217;t want to raise money. And he said that crowing about fundraising news is somewhat nonsensical, likening it to sharing on LinkedIn that he took out a mortgage on a house.</p>
<p>But as Filtered wanted to hire proactively instead of when it closed a new deal, picking up new funds made sense. The startup also wanted to work more on its marketing efforts, shake up its pricing and move toward a land-and-expand model from an enterprise sales focus. More money would make all of that a bit easier, so it took on capital.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we&#8217;re hoping that Filtered can somehow quantify the impact it has on hiring diverse folks for technical roles. If it&#8217;s material, that could be even more exciting than rapid revenue growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian said that deliveries of the R1T Launch Edition, the limited edition release of its first series of “electric adventure vehicles,” will be delayed by a month, according to an update on its website.</p>
<p>Customers who preordered can now expect to start receiving their pickup trucks in July instead of June, with Launch Edition deliveries to be completed by Spring 2022. The change was first spotted by the Rivian Forum. The one-month delay was due to a combination of small issues, including delays on shipping containers, the ongoing chip shortage as well as ensuring the servicing piece is properly set up, a Rivian spokesperson said. Rivian noted that it has been largely unaffected by the chip shortage compared to the rest of the industry because its products don&#8217;t require as many as other vehicles on the market today.</p>
<p>The Amazon-backed EV startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/rivian-to-begin-deliveries-of-electric-pickup-truck-in-june-2021/">told preorder holders in July 2020</a> to expect deliveries of the truck in June 2021, with R1S electric SUV deliveries starting two months later in August. The delivery timeline has already been extended once, after Rivian <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/20/rivian-shuts-down-all-facilities-over-covid-19-pandemic-concerns/">suspended construction work</a> on its factory due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rivian is working to maintain the August delivery time of the R1S, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Despite the delay, it looks like Rivian will still be first to bring an electric truck to market among both new EV entrants and legacy automakers. Lordstown Motors CEO Steve Burns said in an investor call last week that deliveries for the company’s “Endurance” truck are still on track for September (despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">slashing production numbers in half</a>). Ford’s F-150 Lighting, the electric version of its nameplate pickup, is expected in 2022. And Tesla recently confirmed that its Cybertruck will start production late this year.</p>

<p>Rivian also said it will be starting its drive program in August, which will let customers schedule at-home drives or attend a tour event. The company will be releasing details on launch dates and reservations for the tour events in the coming weeks. Rivian selected Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Detroit and Seattle as the first batch of cities on the tour.</p>
<p>In addition, it released a few product updates. The off-road upgrade is now optional on Launch Edition and Adventure Package vehicles, which effectively lowers the price of these vehicles by $2,000. For customers who want the off-road package, they can add it for $2,000 bringing it the vehicle back up to its original price. Every Rivian will now also come with an onboard air compressor, previously available only with the Off-Road Upgrade.</p>
<p>Customers can also add Rivian Adventure Gear to their configuration. This includes a rooftop tent, cargo bars and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/08/rivians-camp-kitchen-in-action/">camp kitchen</a> (that now comes with a 30-piece kitchen set).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/mmhmm/">mmhmm</a>, the communications platform developed by Phil Libin and the All Turtles team, is getting a variety of new features. According to Libin, there are parts of video communication today that can not only match what we get in the real world, but exceed it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how this next iteration of mmhmm is meant to deliver.</p>
<p>The new headline feature is mmhmm Chunky, which allows the presenter to break up their script and presentation into &#8220;chunks.&#8221; Think of the presenter the same way you think of slides in a deck. Each one gets the full edit treatment and final polish. With Chunky, mmhmm users can break up their presentation into chunks to perfect each individual bit of information.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A presenter can switch between live and pre-recorded chunks in a presentation. So you can imagine a salesman making a pitch and switching over to his explanation of the pricing as a pre-recorded piece of his pitch, or a teacher who has a pre-recorded chunk on a particular topic can throw to that mid-class.</p>
<p>But mmhmm didn&#8217;t just think about the creation side, but also the consumption side. Folks in the audience can jump around between chunks and slides to catch up, or even view in a sped-up mode to consume more quickly. Presenters can see where folks in the audience are as they present or later on.</p>
<p>Libin sees this feature as a way to supercharge time.</p>
<p>&#8220;At mmhmm, we stopped doing synchronous updates with our fully distributed team,&#8221; said Libin. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have meetings anymore where people take turns updating each other because it&#8217;s not very efficient. Now the team just sends around their quick presentations, and I can watch it in double speed because people can listen faster than people can talk. But we don&#8217;t have to do it at the same time. Then, when we actually talk synchronously, it&#8217;s reserved for that live back-and-forth about the important stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>mmhmm is also announcing that it has developed its own video player, allowing folks to stream their mmhmm presentations to whichever website they&#8217;d like. As per usual, mmhmm will still work with Zoom, Google Meet, etc.</p>
<p>The new features list also includes an updated version of Copilot. For folks who remember, Copilot allowed one person to present and another person to &#8220;drive,&#8221; or art direct, the presentation from the background. Copilot 2.0 lets two people essentially video chat side by side, in whatever environment they&#8217;d like.</p>
<p>Libin showed me a presentation/conversation he did with a friend where they were both framed up in Libin&#8217;s house. He clarified that this feature works best with one-on-one conversations, or, one-on-one conversations in front of a large audience, such as a fireside chat.</p>
<p>Alongside mmhmm Chunky, streaming and Copilot 2.0, the platform is also doing a bit of spring cleaning with regards to organization. Users will have a Presentation Library where they can save and organize their best takes, and organizations can also use &#8220;Loaf&#8221; to store all the best videos and presentations company-wide for consumption later. The team also revamped Presets to make it easier to apply a preset to a bunch of slides at once or switch between presets more easily.</p>
<p>A couple other notes: mmhmm is working to bring the app to both iOS and Android very soon, and launch out of beta on Windows.</p>
<p>Libin explained that not every single feature described here will launch today, but rather you&#8217;ll see features trickle out each week as we head into summer. He&#8217;ll be giving a keynote on the new features <a href="https://www.mmhmm.app/events/#welcome-to-mmhmm-summer">here</a> at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most marketers today know how to send targeted communications to customers, and there are many tools to help, but when it comes to sending personalized in-house messages, there aren&#8217;t nearly as many options. <a href="https://www.pynhq.com/">Pyn</a>, an early-stage startup based in Australia, wants to change that, and today it announced an $8 million seed round.</p>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz led the investment with help from Accel and Ryan Sanders (the co-founder of BambooHR) and Scott Farquhar (co-founder and co-CEO at Atlassian).</p>
<p>That last one isn&#8217;t a coincidence, as Pyn co-founder and CEO Joris Luijke used to run HR at the company and later at Squarespace and other companies, and he saw a common problem trying to provide more targeted messages when communicating internally.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to do this my entire professional life, trying to personalize the communication that we&#8217;re sending to our people. So that&#8217;s what Pyn does. In a nutshell, we radically personalize employee communications,&#8221; Luijke explained. His co-founder Jon Williams was previously a co-founder at Culture Amp, an employee experience management platform he helped launch in 2011 (and which raised more than $150 million), so the two of them have been immersed in this idea.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="F6rjlFuXcX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/create-a-handbook-and-integrate-ai-to-onboard-remote-employees/">Create a handbook and integrate AI to onboard remote employees</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Create a handbook and integrate AI to onboard remote employees&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/create-a-handbook-and-integrate-ai-to-onboard-remote-employees/embed/#?secret=F6rjlFuXcX" data-secret="F6rjlFuXcX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>They bring personalization to Pyn by tracking information in existing systems that companies already use, such as Workday, BambooHR, Salesforce or Zendesk, and they can use this data much in the same way a marketer uses various types of information to send more personalized messages to customers.</p>
<p>That means you can cut down on the company-wide emails that might not be relevant to everyone and send messages that should matter more to the people receiving them. And as with a marketing communications tool, you can track how many people have opened the emails and how successful you were in hitting the mark.</p>
<p>David Ulevitch, general partner at a16z and lead investor in this deal, points out that Pyn also provides a library of customizable communications materials to help build culture and set policy across an organization. &#8220;It also treats employee communication channels as the rails upon which to orchestrate management practices across an organization [by delivering] a library of management playbooks,&#8221; Ulevitch wrote in a blog post announcing the investment.</p>
<p>The startup, which launched in 2019, currently has 10 employees, with teams working in Australia and the Bay Area in California. Williams says that already half the team is female and the plan is to continue putting diversity front and center as they build the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joris has mentioned &#8216;radical personalization&#8217; as this specific mantra that we have, and I think if you translate that into an organization, that is all about inclusion in reality, and if we want to be able to cater for all the specific needs of people, we need to understand them. So [diversity is essential] to us,&#8221; Williams said.</p>
<p>While the company isn&#8217;t ready to discuss specifics in terms of customer numbers, it cites Shopify, Rubrik and Carta as early customers, and the founders say there was a lot of interest when the pandemic hit last year and the need for more frequent and meaningful types of communication became even more paramount.</p>

Now that Acorns has decided to list via a SPAC &#8212; more on that in a moment &#8212; we do.</p>
<p>So this morning, we&#8217;re unpacking <a href="https://sqy7rm.media.zestyio.com/Project-Oak-Press-Release_5_27_Final.pdf">the Acorns deal</a> and <a href="https://sqy7rm.media.zestyio.com/Acorns-Investors-Webcast.pdf">its investor deck</a>, but we&#8217;re also trying to better understand why venture capitalists have poured so very much money into the space and the resulting economic picture that arises from the companies that they have funded. Acorns is our test subject, then.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll start with a quick overview of its SPAC-led deal before getting into its results. Into the breach!</p>
<h2>The Acorns SPAC deal</h2>
<p>If your eyes are blurring as we review yet another SPAC transaction&#8217;s details, I get you. Let&#8217;s be brief. Here&#8217;s what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acorns is merging with Pioneer Merger Corp., a public blank-check company.</li>
<li>Acorns CEO Noah Kerner and &#8220;Pioneer&#8217;s sponsor&#8221; are each giving 10% of their equity to select customers.</li>
<li>When combined, the entity will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol OAKS.</li>
</ul>
<p>You know, the thing you plant <em>acorns</em> to grow. Har har.</p>
<p>Here are the financial details of the transaction, via the company&#8217;s investor deck:</p>
