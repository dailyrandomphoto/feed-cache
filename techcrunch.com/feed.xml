										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Thoma Bravo-owned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/sophos/">Sophos</a> has announced it&#8217;s acquiring <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/braintrace">Braintrace</a>, a cybersecurity startup that provides organizations visibility into suspicious network traffic patterns. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Braintrace, which was founded in 2016 and has raised $10 million in funding, has developed a network detection and response (NDR) solution that helps organizations to easily inspect network traffic to identify and filter out suspicious activity. It does this using remote network packet capture (RNCAP) technology, which provides visibility into network traffic patterns, including encrypted traffic, without the need for man-in-the-middle decryption. It also provides visibility into cloud network traffic, a task that typically needs to be carried out on-site, and supports all of the major cloud providers including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/aws/">AWS</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/microsoft-azure/">Microsoft Azure</a>.</p>
<p>The deal will see Sophos integrate Braintrace’s NDR technology into its own adaptive cybersecurity ecosystem, which underpins all of its security products and services. The technology will also help Sophos collect data from firewalls, proxies and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/vpn/">VPNs</a>, allowing it to look for network traffic that contains instructions for malware like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/trickerbot-malware-tax-day/">TrickBot</a>, and attackers that misuse Cobalt Strike, as well as pre-empting other malicious traffic that might lead to ransomware attacks</p>
<p>Braintrace’s developers, data scientists and security analysts have joined its global Sophos&#8217; managed threat response (MTR) and rapid response teams as part of the deal.</p>
<p>Commenting on the deal, which Sophos claims will make it one of the largest and fastest-growing managed detection and response (MDR) providers, the company&#8217;s CEO Joe Levy said: “We’re excited that Braintrace built this technology specifically to provide better security outcomes to their MDR customers. It’s hard to beat the effectiveness of solutions built by teams of skilled practitioners and developers to solve real-world cybersecurity problems.”</p>
<p>Bret Laughlin, co-founder and CEO of Braintrace, added: &#8220;We built Braintrace’s NDR technology from the ground up for detection and now, with Sophos, it will fit into a complete system to provide cross-product detection and response across a multi-vendor ecosystem.”</p>
<p>The deal comes a little over a year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/thoma-bravo-completes-3-9b-sophos-acquisition/">Thoma Bravo completed its $3.9 billion takeover of Sophos</a>, and sees the private equity firm further increasing its reach in the cybersecurity space. It acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/thoma-bravo-buys-cybersecurity-vendor-proofpoin-for-12-3b-in-cash/">security vendor Proofpoint</a> for $12.3 billion back in April, and recently led a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/zero-trust-unicorn-illumio-closes-225m-series-f-led-by-thoma-brava/">$225 million funding round in zero trust unicorn Illumio</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify announced this morning a new partnership with online GIF database GIPHY to enable discovery of new music through GIFs. No, the GIFs themselves won&#8217;t play song clips, if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re thinking. Instead, through a series of new Spotify-linked GIFs, there will be an option to click a button to be taken to Spotify directly to hear the artist&#8217;s music. At launch, artists including <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/dojacat-sza-doja-cat-kiss-me-more-K389zFp6niBWAk41i9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://giphy.com/gifs/dojacat-sza-doja-cat-kiss-me-more-K389zFp6niBWAk41i9&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627046730181000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDR16INL7zhKuyA7_grltZ9KP9DQ">Doja Cat</a>, <a href="https://giphy.com/theweeknd" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://giphy.com/theweeknd&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627046730181000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF85_9RxUrSmFIl39NRHkQUlHUmlA">The Weeknd</a>, <a href="https://giphy.com/postmalone" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://giphy.com/postmalone&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627046730181000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF1u97eHxUnxYzqU_RGSXFpOXybBg">Post Malone</a>, <a href="https://giphy.com/nickiminaj" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://giphy.com/nickiminaj&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627046730181000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFMie9S4PVq8bEJnEpg7rEIYHDO-g">Nicki Minaj</a>, <a href="https://giphy.com/thekidlaroi" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://giphy.com/thekidlaroi&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627046730181000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE9DKCd1LBzTTqPWm7EMBrW6HR4hQ">The Kid LAROI</a>, <a href="https://giphy.com/conangray" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://giphy.com/conangray&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627046730181000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5h93zFlIqbYetV2tstiEc96ckag">Conan Gray</a>, and others will have Spotify-linked GIFs available on their official GIPHY profile page. More artists will be added over time.</p>
<p>The idea behind the new integration is to help connect users with Spotify music from their everyday communications, like texts, group chats, and other places where GIFs are used. This is similar to Spotify&#8217;s existing integrations with social media apps like <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-09-09/share-what-youre-listening-to-on-spotify-with-snapchat/">Snapchat</a> and <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8430172/spotify-instagram-stories-users-share-what-listening-to">Instagram</a>, where users can share music through the Stories and messages they post. Essentially, it&#8217;s a user acquisition strategy that leverages online social activities &#8212; in this case, sharing GIFs &#8212; while also benefiting the artists through the exposure they receive.</p>
<p>You can find the new Spotify-linked GIFs on the artist&#8217;s page on GIPHY.com or through GIPHY&#8217;s mobile app. The supported GIFs will include a new &#8220;Listen on Spotify&#8221; button at the bottom which will appear alongside the GIF when it&#8217;s shared. When clicked, users are redirected from the GIF to the artist&#8217;s page on Spotify where they can stream their music or browse to discover more songs they want to hear.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2180912" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180912" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2180912" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/mobile-promo_doja.gif?w=400" alt="" width="400" height="500" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180912" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify/GIPHY</p></div></p>
<p>Spotify says the feature is part of a broader partnership it has with GIPHY, which will later focus on bringing a more interactive listening experience to users.</p>
<p>The move to partner with GIPHY follows a recent expansion of the existing partnership between Spotify and GIPHY&#8217;s parent company, Facebook. The social networking giant bought the popular GIF platform in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/facebook-to-acquire-giphy-in-a-deal-reportedly-worth-400-million/">a deal worth a reported $400 million</a> back in 2020, a couple years after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/27/google-acquires-gif-platform-tenor/">Google snatched up GIPHY rival, Tenor</a>. Since then, Facebook has worked to better integrate GIPHY with its apps, like<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/spotify-adds-timestamped-podcast-sharing-and-other-social-features/"> Facebook and Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Facebook and Spotify had also teamed up<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-is-expanding-spotify-partnership-with-new-boombox-project/"> on a new &#8220;Boombox&#8221; project</a> that allows Facebook users to listen to music hosted on Spotify while browsing through the Facebook app. This is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/facebook-introduces-a-new-miniplayer-that-streams-spotify-within-the-facebook-app/">powered by a &#8220;miniplayer&#8221;</a> that allows anyone who comes across the shared music to click to play the content while they scroll their feed.</p>
<p>Spotify <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-07-22/elevate-your-gif-game-with-giphy-and-spotifys-new-music-feature/">says</a> the new feature will be available to users globally from verified GIPHY artists&#8217; pages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More doesn’t necessarily mean better &#8212; and that’s a lesson for life and for tech. To focus on the latter, the startup ecosystem is experiencing a boggling influx of capital right now. However, the increase in dollars isn’t being evenly distributed to all founders. For the vast majority of people, especially women and nonbinary entrepreneurs, it’s still hard to raise money &#8212; and <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/the-vc-female-founders-dashboard">perhaps even harder than before the pandemic. </a></p>
<p>All Raise, a nonprofit that has for years worked to advance women and nonbinary folks within tech, has been watching closely the dip in funding for female and nonbinary founders. Per VP of Marketing Caroline Caswell, while pockets of progress do exist, funding for female founders is still “lukewarm.” She noted how in the first half of this year, 1.6% of venture capital went to female founders, down 30% from 2.3% in 2020, which was already a dip from the year prior, <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/the-vc-female-founders-dashboard">per PitchBook.</a></p>
<p>“The narrative that ‘VC is back?’ ” Caswell said. “It is back for the same people as it was before.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The misconception that the hot-deal summer is benefitting everyone has given All Raise some urgency to launch a new product for women and nonbinary founders, which it’s announcing today.</p>
<p>The nonprofit is <a href="https://allraise.org/masterclasses ">releasing a series of master classes</a> meant to give an inside glimpse at raising first institutional rounds and scaling companies. The material, which includes pre-recorded sessions from All Raise’s in-person Founder Bootcamp, will be free to access for anyone interested.</p>
<p>Instructors include checkwriters such as Cowboy Ventures’ Aileen Lee and Benchmark Capital’s Sarah Tavel, as well as seasoned executives like Figma’s VP of Communications Nairi Hourdajian and Solv Health co-founder and CEO Heather Fernandez. All Raise said that it did not track ethnicity or racial data of its instructors, however it did offer a breakdown of the 400 beta users who tested the master class series.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2180750 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png" alt="" width="828" height="438" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png 2668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png?resize=768,406 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png?resize=680,360 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png?resize=1536,813 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png?resize=2048,1084 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px" /></p>
<div>Users&#8217; self-reported data shows that the largest concentration &#8212; 39% &#8212; of users are White, while 11% are African-American/Black and 6% are Latinx and Hispanic. Most users don&#8217;t identify as white.</div>
<p>There’s constantly a disconnect between tactical content on how to fundraise and true access to capital; tips don’t necessarily lead to a closed check, which leaves some founders skeptical of yet another launch of resources.</p>
<p>That said, Caswell says that the master classes are trying to move beyond the “typical Sandhill Road Medium post” or Twitter threads, and thinks that the explicitness and real-world examples could serve as an empowering tool to founders.</p>
<p>Topics range from basics like how to prepare for your Series A to more nuanced thoughts like the emotions of fundraising, and how to say goodbye to a team. The programming is meant to be a more intimate look at early-stage tech, beyond what you’d find on a Twitter thread, Caswell explains.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2180749" style="width: 869px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180749" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2180749" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png" alt="All Raise seed curriculum" width="859" height="396" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png 2666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png?resize=300,138 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png?resize=768,354 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png?resize=680,313 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png?resize=1536,708 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png?resize=2048,943 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 859px) 100vw, 859px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180749" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> All Raise</p></div></p>
<p>“When it comes to resources and insight for typically underrepresented founders, more is more is more,” she added. Lessons range between three to 60 minutes, and amount to some 15 hours of content.</p>
<p>The structure of All Raise’s master classes looks similar in format to what Y Combinator offers in its free series Startup School, which includes some <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library?query=female%20founder">light content</a> specifically targeted toward female founders. Long-term, it’d be interesting to see how All Raise refreshes material to work more for online learning, as it already has an engaged community that it could easily turn into a living, breathing class that filters through the nonprofit&#8217;s other tools.</p>

<p><strong>Powering the Future Through Transformative Tech:</strong> XTC’s co-founders Young Sohn, Chairman of the Board at HARMAN International, and founding Managing Partner at Walden Catalyst, and Bill Tai, Partner Emeritus at Charles River Ventures jump into the breakthrough tech innovations that are transforming industries to build a radically better world. How can business, government, philanthropy, and the startup community come together to create a better tomorrow? Hear from these industry veterans and thought leaders about how technology can not only shape the future, but also where the biggest opportunities lie, including some exciting news about XTC and the FAO of the United Nations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Cutting Out Carbon Emitters with Bioengineering:</strong> Bioengineering may soon provide compelling, low-carbon alternatives in industries where even the best methods produce significant emissions. By utilizing natural and engineered biological processes, we may soon have low-carbon textiles from Algiknit, lab-grown premium meats from Orbillion and fuels captured from waste emissions via LanzaTech. Leaders from these companies will join our panel to talk about how bioengineering can do its part in the fight against climate change.</p>
<p>The main event is, of course, the pitch competition. More than 3,700 startups applied, and these are the seven finalists who will compete one last time for the title of XTC 2021 champion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft has acquired identity and access management (IAM) startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cloudknox-security-inc">CloudKnox Security</a>, the tech giant&#8217;s fourth <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> acquisition this year.</p>
<p>The deal, the terms of which were not disclosed, is the latest cybersecurity acquisition by Microsoft, which just last week announced that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">it’s buying threat intelligence startup RiskIQ</a>. The firm also recently acquired IoT security startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/microsoft-confirms-acquisition-of-cyberx-to-boost-security-in-its-iot-business/">CyberX</a> and Refirm Labs as it moved to beef up its security portfolio. Security is big business for Microsoft, which made more than $10 billion in security-related revenue in 2020 — a 40% increase from the year prior.</p>
<p>CloudKnox, which was founded in 2015 and emerged from stealth two years later, helps organizations to enforce least-privilege principles to reduce risk and help prevent security breaches.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> The startup had raised $22.8 million prior to the acquisition, with backing from ClearSky, Sorenson Ventures, Dell Technologies Capital, and Foundation Capital. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s activity-based authorization service will equip Azure Active Directory customers with “granular visibility, continuous monitoring and automated remediation for hybrid and multi-cloud permissions,” according to <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/07/21/microsoft-acquires-cloudknox-security-to-offer-unified-privileged-access-and-cloud-entitlement-management/">a blog post</a> by Joy Chik, corporate vice president of identity at Microsoft.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Chik said that while organizations were reaping the benefits of cloud adoption, particularly as they embrace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/tech-companies-are-looking-at-more-flexible-work-models-when-offices-reopen/">flexible working models</a>, they often struggled to assess, prevent and enforce privileged access across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.</p>
<p>“CloudKnox offers complete visibility into privileged access,” Chik said. “It helps organizations right-size permissions and consistently enforce least-privilege principles to reduce risk, and it employs continuous analytics to help prevent security breaches and ensure compliance. This strengthens our comprehensive approach to cloud security.”</p>
<p>In addition to Azure Active Directory, Microsoft also plans to integrate CloudKnox with its other cloud security services including 365 Defender, Azure Defender, and Azure Sentinel.</p>
<p>Commenting on the deal, Balaji Parimi, CloudKnox founder and CEO, said: “By joining Microsoft, we can unlock new synergies and make it easier for our mutual customers to protect their multi-cloud and hybrid environments and strengthen their security posture.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber Freight, the logistics business spun out of Uber in 2018, has acquired Transplace for about $2.25 billion from private equity group TPG Capital, according to regulatory filings. The deal announced Thursday will involve $750 million in Uber stock with the remainder in cash.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Transplace marks a ramping up of Uber Freight&#8217;s business as it aims to carve out market share in its existing markets and an expansion in Mexico. Uber Freight <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">also sees the acquisition as a means to accelerate the company&#8217;s path to profitability and help the segment to break even on an Adjusted EBITDA basis by the end of 2022, according to the company.</span></p>
<p>The union will fold one of the largest managed transportation and logistics networks into Uber Freight&#8217;s platform, which connects truck drivers with shippers that need cargo delivered. Uber Freight&#8217;s brokerage will continue to operate independently from Transplace&#8217;s services, the company said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This is a significant step forward, not just for Uber Freight but for the entire logistics ecosystem,&#8221; Lior Ron, head of Uber Freight, said in a statement. &#8220;This is an opportunity to bring together complementary best-in-class technology solutions and operational excellence from two premier companies to create an industry-first shipper-to-carrier platform that will transform shippers&#8217; entire supply chains, delivering operational resilience and reducing costs at a time when it matters most.&#8221;</p>
<p>Transplace CEO Frank McGuigan said as a result, the combined company expects shippers will see greater efficiency and transparency. &#8220;All in all, we expect to significantly reduce shipper and carrier empty miles to the benefit of highway and road infrastructures and the environment,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Uber Freight launched in 2017. In August 2018, it was spun off into a separate business unit, a move that simultaneously allowed it to gain momentum and burn more cash. After spinning off of Uber, the freight company underwent an expansion. Uber Freight redesigned its app, an improvement that included adding new navigation features to make searching for and filtering loads easier to customize.</p>
<p>The company expanded to Canada and Europe. Uber Freight also established a headquarters in Chicago as part of its parent company&#8217;s broader plan to invest more than $200 million annually in the region, including hiring hundreds of workers. Uber said in September 2019 it would hire 2,000 new employees in the region over the next three years; most would be dedicated to Uber Freight.</p>
<p>Uber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/uber-sells-500m-stake-in-its-freight-business-as-the-ride-hailing-giant-works-to-conserve-cash/">sold a stake</a> in the freight business last year when investor group led by New York-based investment firm Greenbriar Equity Group committed to invest $500 million in a Series A preferred stock financing for the business. The deal valued the unit at $3.3 billion on a post-money basis.</p>
<p>Uber maintained majority ownership in Uber Freight and used the funds gained from Greenbriar to continue to scale its logistics platform, which helps truck drivers connect with shipping companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Conventional wisdom holds that one ought let sleeping does lie. But no one says you&#8217;re barred from tracking them while they do. New York-based smart collar maker Fi announced today that it’s adding sleep to the list of the device’s tracking.</p>
<p>The added feature uses the collar’s on-board motion sensing to monitor your best friend’s sleep during the day and night (and almost certainly leave you jealous about how much shut-eye they’re getting).</p>
<p>The information is presented on a timeline that should look familiar to anyone who has used the human equivalent. It also offers a live check-in to see what the dog is up to during the day while you’re at work (assuming you ever go back to the office).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2180800" style="width: 722px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180800" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2180800" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.49.34-PM.png" alt="" width="712" height="350" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.49.34-PM.png 712w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.49.34-PM.png?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.49.34-PM.png?resize=300,147 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.49.34-PM.png?resize=680,334 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.49.34-PM.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180800" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fi</p></div></p>
<p>The goal here is to offer up some sharable metrics about your pet that might point to underlying health problems, be it too much sleep, not enough or frequent trips to the water bowl in the middle of the night. Sudden changes also present potential red flags for the dog’s health.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to move into holistic health tracking that empowers dog parents to take the best possible care of their pets,” founder and CEO Jonathan Bensamoun said in a release. “If your dog is tired, it can’t tell you, so Fi will. Fi can answer critical questions like, ‘Is my pet sleeping the right way?’ or ‘Did its activity levels decrease lately?’ long before more serious issues have time to develop.”</p>
<p>Fi raised $30 million back in February and is working to grow its reach in the U.S., including a recent distribution deal with mega-online pet supply seller, Chewy.</p>

Facebook is announcing a few minor updates today to its Messenger platform, which make it easier than ever to find the exact emoji you&#8217;re looking for when reacting to a friend&#8217;s message (let&#8217;s be real, there&#8217;s a big difference between the &#8220;crying laughing&#8221; and &#8220;crying&#8221; emoji). This includes a search bar for emoji reactions, and a recently used emojis section. And, if you weren&#8217;t let down by the long-awaited &#8220;Space Jam&#8221; sequel, you can sport your love for hoopster Bugs Bunny with a &#8220;Space Jam 2&#8221; chat theme, available both on Messenger and in Instagram DMs. Don&#8217;t get too excited though &#8212; even though this theme sets a basketball as the chat&#8217;s emoji, the long lost, beloved <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/18/facebook-sneaked-a-seriously-addictive-basketball-game-into-messenger/">basketball mini game</a> has not yet made its triumphant return to the Messenger app.</p>

<p>It may not feel like there&#8217;s room for innovation in, um, the emoji space, but even Twitter has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/twitter-is-exploring-the-use-of-facebook-style-emoji-reactions/">explored the option</a> of allowing people to emoji-react to tweets. And as live audio has become ever present &#8212; from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/clubhouse-invite-open-to-everyone-exits-beta/">Clubhouse</a>, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/twitter-redesigns-its-mobile-app-to-make-spaces-the-center-tab/">Twitter Spaces</a>, to Spotify&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">Greenroom</a> &#8212; why not add audio to emojis?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last week, Messenger debuted Soundmojis, which are what they sound like &#8212; emojis with sounds. On the Messenger app, you can use Soundmojis by clicking the smiley face icon in the chat box, which opens up the expressions menu. When you select the loudspeaker icon, you can select from just under 30 standard emojis, but when you click on them, they play sounds including &#8220;Brooklyn 99&#8221; quotes, Olivia Rodrigo clips, and lines from &#8220;Bridgerton.&#8221; The &#8220;X&#8221; emoji plays &#8220;Oh No&#8221; by Capone, a song that <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/capone-oh-no-tiktok-trend">went viral</a> on TikTok.</p>
<p>According to Facebook Messenger, people send more than 2.4 billion messages with emojis on the platform each day. That&#8217;s great and all, but if we can tap the car emoji to hear sounds from &#8220;Fast &amp; Furious,&#8221; when will we be able to tap the soccer emoji to play &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/15/how-to-play-facebook-messengers-new-super-addictive-and-hidden-soccer-game/">keepie uppie</a>&#8221; again?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Magic, a San Francisco-based startup that builds &#8220;plug and play&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/how-startups-can-go-passwordless-thanks-to-zero-trust/">passwordless</a> authentication technology, has raised $27 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>The round, led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/northzone/">Northzone</a> and with participation from Tiger Global, Volt Capital, Digital Currency Group and CoinFund, comes just over a year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/decentralized-identity-management-platform-magic-launches-from-stealth-with-4m/">Magic launched from stealth</a>, rebranding from its previous name Formatic.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The company, like many others, is on a mission to end traditional password-based authentication. Magic’s flagship SDK, which launched in April 2020, enables developers to implement a variety of passwordless authentication methods with just a few lines of code and integrates with a number of modern frameworks and infrastructures.</p>
<p>Not only does the SDK make it easier for companies and developers to implement passwordless auth methods in their applications, but it could also help to mitigate the expensive fallout that many have to deal with as a result of data breaches.</p>
<p>“This is why the password is so dangerous,&#8221; Sean Li, Magic co-founder and CEO tells TechCrunch. &#8220;It’s like a Jenga tower right now — a hacker breaching your system can download an entire database of encrypted passwords, and then easily crack them. It’s a huge central point of failure.”</p>
<p>The company recently built out its SDK to add support for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/fido-alliance-and-w3c-have-a-plan-to-kill-the-password/">WebAuthn</a>, which means it can support hardware-based authentication keys like Yubico, as well as biometric-based Face ID and fingerprint logins on mobile devices.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“It’s less mainstream right now, but we’re making it super simple for developers,” says Li. “This way we can help promote new technologies, and that’s really good for user security and privacy.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bet that seems to be working: Magic has recorded a 13% month-over-month increase in developer signups, and the number of identities secured is growing at a rate of 6% weekly, according to Magic. It’s also secured a number of big-name customers, from crypto news publisher Decrypt to fundraising platform Fairmint.</p>
<p>Wendy Xiao Schadeck, a partner at Northzone said: “We couldn&#8217;t be more excited to support Sean and the Magic team as they redefine authentication for the internet from the bottom up, solving a core pain point for developers, users, and companies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“It was clear to us that they&#8217;re absolutely loved by their customers because the team is so obsessed with serving every single part of the developer journey across several communities. What&#8217;s potentially even more exciting is what they will be able to do to empower users and decentralize the identity layer of the web.”</p>
<p>The company now plans to continue to scale its platform and expand its team to meet what Magic describes as “soaring” demand. The startup, which currently has 30 employees that work remotely on a full-time basis, expects to at least double its headcount across all core functions, including product, engineering, design, marketing, finance, people, and operations.</p>
<p>It’s also planning to hope to build out the SDK even further; Li says he wants to be able to plug into more kinds of technology, from low-code applications to workflow automations.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The vision is much bigger than that. We want to be the passport of the internet,” Li adds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.indexventures.com/">Index Ventures</a> has closed a trio of new funds: a $900 million early-stage fund, a $2 billion growth-stage fund and a previously announced $200 million seed-stage fund. The close gives Index $3 billion in new capital, its largest tranche yet, to deploy into emerging startups and existing portfolio companies, which include the likes of Plaid, Deliveroo and Revolut, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/revolut-confirms-a-fresh-800m-in-funding-at-a-33b-valuation-to-supercharge-its-financial-services-superapp/">just valued at $33 billion.</a></p>
<p>Index’s new capital comes a little over a year since it closed its last funds, which were a duet of $1.2 billion for growth-stage investments and $800 million for early-stage investments. It also is announced while venture dollars more broadly seem to be growing at an unprecedented rate &#8212; In recent weeks, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/accel-closes-on-3b-across-three-funds/">Accel announced that it has closed $3 billion across three funds, too</a>, and Andreessen Horowitz landed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/andreessen-horowitz-triples-down-on-blockchain-startups-with-massive-2-2-billion-crypto-fund-iii/">$2.2 billion fund dedicated entirely to crypto startups.</a></p>
<p>The influx of money means that check sizes and valuations are growing across the entire ecosystem. Index, for example, said that it has grown its Series A check size from $10 million to $15 million, while it increased its growth check from $35 million to $50 million. Its check size in the United States is about 20% higher compared to its check size in Europe, meaning that the former represents between 55% to 60% of the firm’s total investing dollars.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While Index’s check size is growing slightly bigger to keep up with competition, partner Mark Goldberg said that the firm is staying disciplined so it doesn’t fall prey to FOMO rounds or buzzy valuations.</p>
<p>“There have been situations where two years ago, I would have engaged,” in a competition for a late-stage round, he said. “And now I say that we probably are not going to compete … because at the heart of the matter, I think capital is a commodity.” The partner didn’t point to Accel’s $3 billion close, but instead noted how “Tiger Global and other crossover funds” have created a new capital product, which means that Index’s ability to compete must look different than just offering a ton of money.</p>
<p>“If you’re just looking for capital, we’re probably not going to be the best product for you,” Goldberg added.</p>
<p>Index Partner Martin Mignot thinks that a &#8220;bifurcation is really happening&#8221; in the fundraising market, where some founders are able to raise easily, but many continue to struggle if they&#8217;re not &#8220;at the right sector in the right place at the right time.&#8221; Mignot has been spending time looking at Africa as a potential investment area that continues to be underresourced. He hinted that an official initiative focused on Africa startups may be underway.</p>
<p>The firm said it has &#8220;several initiatives in place related to diversity including increasing the number of individuals on our investment from underrepresented groups and diversifying our investment funnel&#8221; but said that it does not track diversity statistics at a portfolio company level &#8220;yet.&#8221; Index said that its investment team is composed of 38% of individuals who identify as female and 14% of individuals who come from underrepresented groups, although its unclear whether they have check-writing power.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Venture capital is going to get even bigger, faster and more expensive this year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/venture-capital-is-going-to-get-even-bigger-faster-and-more-expensive-this-year/embed/#?secret=pXodu9D8Un" data-secret="pXodu9D8Un" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Index appears to be going through a period of experimentation when it comes to the services offered to portfolio companies. While the firm declined to give too many specifics on upcoming initiatives around diversity or more generally, it did note its growing TikTok presence as part of its strategy.</p>
<p>The Index Ventures TikTok has over 28,000 followers. Its most viewed video is about Costco’s business model, with 4.8 million views followed by an interview clip from Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang, with 315,000 views.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s not something where I think the next deal comes from the TikTok account, but it&#8217;s one of those initiatives where … I think it will pay dividends” in helping Index reach a younger audience that isn’t active on tech Twitter or Clubhouse. Index’s TikTok, led by Rex Woodbury, is reminiscent of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/banana-capitals-fund-1-turner-novak/">how some emerging fund managers</a> are approaching creative deal flow.</p>
<p>The firm is also experimenting with incubating startups in-house, which has historically never been a major focus. <a href="https://twitter.com/Mark_Goldberg_/status/1415715109507190790">A tweet suggests</a> that Index is actively recruiting entrepreneurs to join the incubator, which could be divided thematically. Goldberg declined to give more specifics around how incubation programs are structured and what the terms are, saying that the Index Incubator is not an official product yet.</p>
<p>That said, one can only imagine that a firm freshly capitalized with billions of dollars probably has some money to spare — from incubated projects to those growth-stage companies in need of active investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Obé Fitness’ co-founders/co-CEOs Mark Mullett and Ashley Mills toss around the word “entertrainment” a lot. For the record, it’s not a reference to the Butler County, Ohio-based amusement park that serves as the home of the “world’s largest train display,” but rather one of those industry portmanteaus like <em>infotainment</em> or <em>webinar.</em></p>
<p>Here it’s meant to be a reference to what the New York-based company sees as its principle differentiator from an increasingly crowded market. Mills describes it as “where entertainment and fitness meet. Talent is key to that. Not also being able to cast talent that can deliver a great workout, but they also have that X Factor. They have the ability to reach across the screen and make you feel something at home.”</p>
<p>The company has been building up an audience of influencers as well, including Kelly Ripa, Kate Hudson and Tiffany Haddish, the latter of whom participated in the $15 million Series A the company is announcing today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The capital is really about team growth and awareness in a couple of key business development initiatives,&#8221; says Mullett. &#8220;In the current climate, where everyone is talking about their various home workouts, you definitely need resources to grow. So this round is about getting Obé in front of as many people as possible.”</p>
<p>The round was led by CAVU Venture Partners and features Athleta, Samsung Next, Wheelhouse Entertainment and WW International, Inc., along with previous investors Cassius Ventures, Ludlow Ventures, Harris Blitzer Sports Entertainment and BDMI.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2180364" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180364" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2180364" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180364" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Obé</p></div></p>
<p>It’s a pretty diverse list of parties with a diverse list of interests in the platform &#8212; take Samsung, which currently offers the Obé platform on its smart TVs. Users can also access it on iOS and Android devices and cast it accordingly to their TV sets.</p>
<p>Obé (pronounced “Obey”) bills itself as a “premium” service. At $27, it’s certainly at the higher end, verses offerings like the $10/month Apple Fitness+ or Peleton’s $13 monthly fee. Unlike Peloton, which has proprietary equipment attached, Obé actually skipped the equipment altogether at launch, though it has slowly expanded its offerings to include things like free weights and trampolines for its bounce classes &#8212; equipment that’s a bit more forgiving in smaller spaces.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018, the company saw a large increase in users during the pandemic. While Obé doesn’t disclose subscriber counts, its founders told me the platform’s userbase increased 4x last year.</p>
<p>“We started this company three and a half years ago,” says Mullett. “When COVID hit in March of 2020, our team, our talent, our interface &#8212; everyone was ready to receive the rush of new users who needed to be sated by movement and by someone who could keep them inspired, sane and confident during a difficult time.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The world of venture capital investing is a relatively small one, and family offices and accredited investors are eager to get involved, but find it difficult to access fund managers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world of venture capital investing is a relatively small one, and relationship-based to boot. Family offices and accredited investors are eager to get involved in high-quality funds, but face hurdles like access to fund managers.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://allocate.co/">Allocate</a>. The company, founded by Samir Kaji and Hana Yang in February 2021, is developing an approach to venture capital fund investing that provides a way for investors of any size to participate.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the San Francisco-based company announced it raised $5 million in seed funding from a group of backers including Urban Innovation Fund, Tusk Venture Partners, Basis Set Ventures, Liquid2 Ventures, Fika Ventures, Ulu Ventures and Anthemis Group.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The pair met as Kauffman Fellows, both with backgrounds in financial services. By the time they met, Yang was working in the nonprofit world, and said they began talking about the friction between the nonprofit and venture capital worlds. Then Yang joined Kaji at First Republic Bank to work together and continue the conversation.</p>
<p>Kaji, <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2021/global-asset-management-industry-report">citing a Boston Consulting Group report</a>, estimated there are between 8,000 and 11,000 global family offices and nearly 17 million accredited investors that currently control some $42 trillion in assets.</p>
<p>They saw the issue as it related to supply and demand: On the supply side, there are a finite number of institutional investors, “all with their dance cards full,” Kaji told TechCrunch. Fund managers want to get at that nontraditional endowment money and are looking at family offices, but finding those individuals is a challenge.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the demand side, family offices have trouble accessing venture capital firms — they don’t know where to look to find managers, don’t have time to cultivate those relationships or can’t make the traditional $1 million commitments.</p>
<p>As a result, Kaji and Yang decided to start Allocate as a way to usher in the next era of venture capital by creating a way for retail investors of any size or background to invest in funds and for managers to find family offices.</p>
<p>Allocate&#8217;s platform curates venture fund products for wealth advisors, family offices and qualified individual investors based on their investment objectives, and any pre- and post-investment transactions and reporting activities are completed on the platform.</p>
<p>The company sets up its own feeder vehicles that aggregate investor capital so that there are lower minimum investments and that capital can easily be managed by fund managers. It then charges a fee, on an annual basis, on investments made.</p>
<p>Currently, investors can choose the funds they want to invest in, but Kaji said Allocate will eventually also offer products that will be like funds of funds, where investments go into a pot that will be invested by a fund manager.</p>
<p>The company is pre-revenue and said it will use the new funding to build out its product and make some key hires over the next year as it gears up for a formal software product launch at the end of the year. It is already attracting a waitlist of several hundred fund managers and investors.</p>
<p>“With the market the way it is, the number of accredited investors is expected to grow by 50% by 2025,” Kaji said. “There is a huge opportunity to unlock the market and have people participate.”</p>
<p>Jordan Nof, co-founder and managing partner at Tusk Ventures, agrees. He sees a lot of economic growth taking place outside the public market, and opportunities present themselves for someone to capitalize on.</p>
<p>Due to the access issue between fund managers and potential investors, there are trillions of dollars sitting on the sidelines, he told TechCrunch. With Allocate, Nof saw a way to bridge the two parties with tools for both sides to make sound decisions and further evolve venture capital.</p>
<p>“I have known Samir for quite some time, and he and his team understand this problem set and they have a vision of what the venture capital future looks like,” he added. “This is a cottage industry even though VC is responsible for impacting the largest of technology companies, which have taken VC, yet it is a still super fragmented industry that has no transparency. Allocate is the next transition of a true platform that enables family offices and high-net worth individuals access.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A year and a half after <a href="https://www.currencycloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Currencycloud</a> raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/26/currencycloud-nabs-80m-from-visa-world-bank-group-and-more-for-its-cross-border-payments-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$80 million in a round that included Visa</a>, the London-based developer of APIs that powered remittance and currency exchange services is getting even closer to the financial services giant. Today, <a href="https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/newsroom/press-releases.releaseId.18161.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visa announced</a> that it would acquire CurrencyCloud in a deal valued at $963 million (£700 million).</p>
<p>This price is a very decent leap from that last funding round, when sources told us the startup was valued at around $500 million.</p>
<p>(As Visa already has equity in the company, the amount it will actually pay will be reduced by that amount.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CurrencyCloud has some 500 customers in 180 countries that use its APIs to power multi-currency wallets, currency exchange services, and account management, including some of the biggest startups around such as Monzo, Moneze, Starling, Revolut and Dwolla. These will continue, and on top of that Visa will use the startup&#8217;s technology to bolster its own currency exchange rails to provide a wider set of services to its own customers, which include financial institutions, fintechs and more, as well as to build new services for consumers as well.</p>
<p>“At Currencycloud, we’ve always strived to deliver a better tomorrow for all, from the smallest start-up to the global multi-nationals. Re-imagining how money flows around the global economy just got more exciting as we join Visa,” said Mike Laven, CEO, Currencycloud, in a statement. “The combination of Currencycloud’s fintech expertise and Visa’s network will enable us to deliver greater customer value to the businesses moving money across borders.”</p>
<p>Remittance and currency transfers to be big business in the world of financial services, and that opportunity is growing. Two of the factors driving this are that e-commerce has extended well outside of our national borders, especially in the past 18 months, and so have supply chains. (Visa notes that some 43% of all small businesses globally carried out some form of international trade in 2020.) And with the rise of cloud-based, mobile services to facilitate transactions, consumers are ever more globalised in their outlooks, too.</p>
<p>At the same time, remittances and currency transfers are two areas ripe for disruption, with incumbent services often costly and inefficient. All of this sets the stage for a company like CurrencyCloud, which has built a new implementation of currency transfer that can be embedded into other financial services to help them run more smoothly.</p>
<p>The exit is also a classic example of how larger, incumbent financial powerhouses typically find it harder to innovate and jump into new services, so instead they tap smaller and more agile startups that are taking big bets on technology, and pulling it off, to help propel themselves into the next generation of financial services. Whether Visa will be able to successfully integrate and use CurrencyCloud&#8217;s tech and work with its team are two things that were already tested out: the two were strategic partners prior to this deal.</p>
<p>“The acquisition of Currencycloud is another example of Visa executing on our network of networks strategy to facilitate global money movement,” said<strong> </strong>Colleen Ostrowski, Visa’s Global Treasurer, in a statement. “Consumers and businesses increasingly expect transparency, speed and simplicity when making or receiving international payments. With our acquisition of Currencycloud, we can support our clients and partners to further reduce the pain points of cross-border payments and develop great user experiences for their customers.”<strong> </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://tailorbrands.com/">Tailor Brands</a>, a startup that automates parts of the branding and marketing process for small businesses, announced Thursday it has raised $50 million in Series C funding.</p>
<p>GoDaddy led the round as a strategic partner and was joined by OurCrowd and existing investors Pitango Growth, Mangrove Capital Partners, Armat Group, Disruptive VC and Whip Media founder Richard Rosenblatt. Tailor Brands has now raised a total of $70 million since its inception in 2015.</p>
<p>“GoDaddy is empowering everyday entrepreneurs around the world by providing all of the help and tools to succeed online,” said Andrew Morbitzer, vice president of corporate development at GoDaddy, in a written statement. “We are excited to invest in Tailor Brands — and its team — as we believe in their vision. Their platform truly helps entrepreneurs start their business quickly and easily with AI-powered logo design and branding services.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When Tailor Brands, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/08/tailor-brands-aims-to-bring-small-business-owners-affordable-access-to-professional-design/">launched at TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield in 2014</a>, raised its last round, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/09/tailor-brands-series-b/">$15.5 million Series B</a>, in 2018, the company was focused on AI-driven logo creation.</p>
<p>The company, headquartered in New York and Tel Aviv, is now compiling the components for a one-stop SaaS platform — providing the design, branding and marketing services a small business owner needs to launch and scale operations, and within minutes, Yali Saar, co-founder and CEO of Tailor Brands told TechCrunch.</p>

<p>Over the past year, more users are flocking to Tailor Brands; the company is onboarding some 700,000 new users per month for help in the earliest stages of setting up their business. In fact, the company saw a 27% increase in new business incorporations as the creator and gig economy gained traction in 2020, Saar said.</p>
<p>In addition to the scores of new users, the company crossed 30 million businesses using the platform. At the end of 2019, Tailor Brands started monetizing its offerings and “grew at a staggering rate,” Saar added. The company yielded triple-digit annual growth in revenue.</p>
<p>To support that growth, the new funding will be used on R&amp;D, to double the team and create additional capabilities and functions. There may also be future acquisition opportunities on the table.</p>
<p>Saar said Tailor Brands is at a point where it can begin leveraging the massive amount of data on small businesses it gathers to help them be proactive rather than reactive, turning the platform into a “consultant of sorts” to guide customers through the next steps of their businesses.</p>
<p>“Users are looking for us to provide them with everything, so we are starting to incorporate more products with the goal of creating an ecosystem, like WeChat, where you don’t need to leave the platform at all to manage your business,” Saar said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sorry Mr. Putin, but there’s a race on for Russian and Eastern European founders. And right now, those awful capitalists in the corrupt West are starting to out-gun the opposition! But seriously… only the other day a $100 million fund <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/100-million-leta-capital-wants-to-be-a-friend-to-russia-speaking-founders-everywhere/">aimed at Russian speaking entrepreneurs</a> appeared, and others are proliferating.</p>
<p>Now, London-based <a href="https://www.theuntitled.vc">Untitled Ventures</a> plans to join their fray with a €100 million / $118M for its <em>second</em> fund to invest in “ambitious deep tech startups with eastern European founders.”</p>
<p>Untitled says it is aiming at entrepreneurs who are looking to relocate their business or have already HQ’ed in Western Europe and the USA. That’s alongside all the other existing Western VCs who are &#8211; in my experience &#8211; always ready and willing to listen to Russian and Eastern European founders, who are often known for their technical prowess.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Untitled is going to be aiming at B2B, AI, agritech, medtech, robotics, and data management startups with proven traction emerging from the Baltics, CEE, and CIS, or those already established in Western Europe</p>
<p>LPs in the fund include Vladimir Vedeenev, a founder of Global Network Management&gt;. Untitled also claims to have Google, Telegram Messenger, Facebook, Twitch, DigitalOcean, IP-Only, CenturyLinks, Vodafone and TelecomItaly as partners.</p>
<p>Oskar Stachowiak, Untitled Ventures Managing Partner, said: “With over 10 unicorns, €1Bn venture funding in 2020 alone, and success stories like Veeam, Semrush, and Wrike, startups emerging from the fast-growing regions are the best choice to focus on early-stage investment for us. Thanks to the strong STEM focus in the education system and about one million high-skilled developers, we have an ample opportunity to find and support the rising stars in the region.&#8221;</p>
<p>Konstantin Siniushin, the Untitled Ventures MP said: &#8220;We believe in economic efficiency and at the same time we fulfill a social mission of bringing technological projects with a large scientific component from the economically unstable countries of the former USSR, such as, first of all, Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, but not only in terms of bringing sales to the world market and not only helping them to HQ in Europe so they can get next rounds of investments.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: “We have a great experience accumulated earlier in the first portfolio of the first fund, not just structuring business in such European countries as, for example, Luxembourg, Germany, Great Britain, Portugal, Cyprus and Latvia, but also physically relocating startup teams so that they are perceived already as fully resident in Europe and globally.”</p>
<p>To be fair, it is still harder than it needs to be to create large startups from Eastern Europe, mainly because there is often very little local capital. However, that is changing, with the launch recently of CEE funds such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/vitosha-venture-partners-launches-30m-fund-to-back-bulgarian-related-early-stage-startups/">Vitosha Venture Partners</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/launchub-ventures-heading-towards-a-85m-fund-for-south-eastern-european-startups/">Launchub Ventures</a>, and the breakout hit from Romania that was UIPath.</p>
<p><strong>The Untitled Ventures team:</strong><br />
• Konstantin Siniushin, a serial tech entrepreneur<br />
• Oskar Stachowiak, experienced fund manager<br />
• Mary Glazkova, PR &amp; Comms veteran<br />
• Anton Antich, early stage investor and an ex VP of Veeam, a Swiss cloud data management company<br />
acquired by Insight Venture Partners for $5bln<br />
• Yulia Druzhnikova, experienced in taking tech companies international<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Slack set the standard in many ways for what knowledge workers want and expect out of a workplace collaboration app these days, but a lot has been left on the table when it comes to frontline workers. Today, one of the software companies that has built a popular app for that frontline crowd to become a part of the conversation is announcing a funding round that speaks to the opportunity to do more.</p>
<p><a href="https://yoobic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yoobic</a>, which provides an app for frontline and service workers to manage tasks, communicate with each other and management, and also go through training, development and and other e-learning tasks, has picked up $50 million.</p>
<p>Highland Europe led the round, a Series C, with previous investors Felix Capital, Insight Partners, and a family office advised by BNF Capital Limited also participating. (Felix led Yoobic&#8217;s Series A, while Insight Partners led the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/yoobic-retail-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series B in 2019</a>.) Yoobic is not discussing valuation but from what I understand from a reliable source, it is now between $300 million and $400 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding comes at a time of strong growth for the company.</p>
<p>Yoobic works with some 300 big brands in 80 countries altogether covering a mammoth 335,000 locations in sectors like retail, hospitality, distribution and manufacturing. Its customers include the likes of the Boots pharmacy chain, Carrefour supermarkets, Lancôme, Lacoste, Logitech, Lidl, Peloton, Puma, Vans, VF Corp, Sanofi, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Untuckit, Roots, Canada Goose, Longchamp, Lidl, Zadig &amp; Voltaire, and Athletico.</span></p>
<p>But that is just the tip of the iceberg. It&#8217;s <a href="http://desklessworkforce2018.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> that there are 2.7 billion &#8220;deskless&#8221; (frontline and service) workers globally, accounting for no less than 80% of the world&#8217;s workforce. But here is the shocker: only 1% of IT budgets is currently spent on them. That speaks of huge opportunity for startups to build more here, but only if they (or the workers themselves( can manage to convince those holding the purse strings that it&#8217;s worth the investment.</p>
<p>So to that end, the funding will be used to hire more talent, to expand geographically &#8212; founded in London, the company is now headquartered in New York &#8212; and to expand its product. Specifically, Yoobic plans to build more predictive analytics to improve responsiveness and give more insight to companies about their usage, and to build out more tools to cater to specific verticals in the world of frontline work, such as manufacturing, logistics and transportation, Fabrice Haiat, CEO and co-founder of YOOBIC, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>Yoobic started life several years ago with a focus specifically on retail &#8212; an area that it was concentrating on as recently as its last round in 2019, providing tools to help with merchandizing, communicating about stock between stores and more. While retail is still a sizeable part of its business, Yoobic saw an opening to expand into a wider pool of verticals with frontline and service employees that had many of the same demands as retail.</p>
<p>That turned out to be a fortunate pivot as the pandemic struck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Covid-19 had a big impact on us,&#8221; said Haiat, who co-founded the company with brothers Avi and Gilles. &#8220;The first two months we were in panic mode. But what happened was that businesses realized that frontline employees were critical to the success of their operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since Covid hit last year, he said that activity on the platform rose by 200%, and earlier this year it passed 1 million activities per month on its platform. &#8220;We are growing like crazy,&#8221; Haiat said.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why building for frontline workers is important. Roaming round without a fixed desk, spending more time with customers than looking at a screen or in meetings, and generally having different business priorities and practices are just a few of the reasons why software built for the former doesn&#8217;t necessarily work for the latter.</p>
<p>There have been a number of companies that have aimed to build services to address that gap &#8212; they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/29/ex-yammer-execs-raise-5-5m-for-cotap-a-mobile-messaging-app-aiming-to-be-whatsapp-for-the-workplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stretch back years</a>, in fact. And there have been some interesting moves to consolidate in the market among those building some of the more successful tools for people in the field: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/crew-a-workplace-and-slack-messaging-rival-for-shift-workers-raises-35m-adds-enterprise-version/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crew </a><a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-acquires-crew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently got acquired by Square</a>; <a href="https://www.servicemax.com/press-releases/servicemax-acquires-zinc-to-expand-service-execution-management-offering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ServiceMax acquired Zinc</a>; and Facebook&#8217;s Workplace has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/workplace-facebooks-enterprise-edition-snaps-up-walmart-as-a-customer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been on a march</a> to amass some of the world&#8217;s biggest companies as customers of its own communications platform with a strong play for frontline workers.</p>
<p>Haiat argues that while all of these are fine and well, none of them understand the full scope of the kinds of tools that those in the field really need. That ranges from practical features (such as a way to handle inventory management), through to features that companies would love to have for their employees as long as they can be delivered in an easy way (such as professional development and training). In that context, the basic communications that all of the current crop of apps for frontline workers offer feel like basic tablestakes.</p>
<p>That close understanding of the gap in the market and what is needed to fix it is one reason why the company has seen such strong growth, as well as interest from investors.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to partner with YOOBIC, which, thanks to the highly impressive team led by Fabrice, Avi and Gilles, has clearly established itself as a leader in the digital workplace space with demonstrable market traction and impressive growth.” said Jean Tardy-Joubert, partner at Highland Europe, in a statement. “While companies have historically focused on digital investments for deskbound employees, the world is becoming distributed and decentralized.  We anticipate a seismic shift that will see huge resources, technology, and capital shifted toward frontline teams.” Tardy-Joubert will be joining the YOOBIC Board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the pandemic forcing people online, social media use exploded, for obvious reasons. And with that, the opportunity to reach audiences and push messaging. More brand-oriented platforms such as Sprinkler, Sprout Social, and Hootsuite have obviously risen in use, but so did traffic to Oktopost, a much more B2B-oriented proposition.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013, Oktopost has only ever registered an $800,000 early stage funding, and has run on revenues and profit ever since. Today that changes with a growth funding round of a $20 million minority investment from London-based growth equity firm Expedition Growth Capital.</p>
<p>Oktopost’s schtick is that it is an enterprise-grade platform for B2B marketers to curate content, organize, and manage campaigns for corporate social media accounts, employee advocacy and social selling. It can also handle social listening and analytics. It also boasts native integrations with Adobe’s Marketo, Salesforce’s Pardot, Hubspot; and CRM systems such as Salesforce, and Microsoft Dynamics. Oktopost’s customer include Fujitsu, Mitsubishi Electric, Xerox, SWIFT, ACI Worldwide, ContentSquare, ChargeBee and SUSE.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The above functions have hoved into view with far greater importance as social media users upped their interactions online, and companies needed to, to put it mildly, get their act together asocial media ‘ate the world’ in the last 16 months.</p>
<p>Oktopost says it plans to use the funding to advance its product roadmap, boost customer success, accelerate marketing and sales, and explore strategic acquisitions; and grow its workforce by 50%.<br />
 <br />
Daniel Kushner, co-founder and CEO of Oktopost, said: &#8220;Our mission from day one was to establish the first ever B2B social media marketing platform with the ability to measure and quantify the value of social media in terms of lead generation, pipeline influence, customer acquisition, and ultimately ROI… As siloes breakdown between marketing and sales within B2B companies, and as social selling becomes more widespread, we believe Oktopost is uniquely suited to provide the functionality desired.”<br />
 <br />
Oliver Thomas, Managing Partner at Expedition Growth Capital said: “There are a number of social media tools out there catering for B2C companies but we haven’t seen a platform that is specifically tailored to the B2B journey until Oktopost. The ability to manage, track and analyse social activities is increasingly a must-have for B2B sales and marketing organisations. Daniel and Liad have built the best product in the market to serve this need. They have also built a terrific culture and we’re excited to be part of the journey from here.”</p>
<p>Speaking to Kushner I asked him what effect the pandemic had had on the business.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s gone bananas,” he said “Our focus is 100% on B2B organisations. Our platform is divided into corporate social media, so Twitter, LinkedIn company pages, etc. The second is what we call employee advocacy social, where you want your employees to be a part of the corporate brand, with employees sharing on a personal LinkedIn, Twitter accounts, social messages.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that this ecosystem &#8211; the platform to support both corporate social and employee advocacy &#8211; means they can prove return on investment for customers: &#8220;What are they getting from doing all this social? The platform is designed to provide those kind of metrics to show the real business impact of social, the real impact that it has on the business. And not just fluff metrics that you normally get on social.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India’s trucking system has a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d529d48c-dc1b-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482">big inefficiency problem</a> that continues to drag the economy. BlackBuck, one of the handful of startups that is digitizing the freight and logistics across India, has just attained the unicorn status after securing new funds.</p>
<p>Tribe Capital, IFC Emerging Asia Fund and VEF led the $67 million Series E financing round in the six-year-old startup, valuing it at $1.02 billion (up from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/indias-blackbuck-raises-150-million-to-digitize-freight-and-logistics-across-india/">about $850 million in 2019 Series D round</a>), BlackBuck chief executive Rajesh Yabaji told TechCrunch in an interview earlier this week. BlackBuck is the 16th Indian startup to become a unicorn this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.blackbuck.com">BlackBuck</a> connects businesses with truck owners and freight operators. The startup has developed a simplified app for truck drivers in India, who are typically not very literate, to help them accept work and easily navigate to their destination using Google Maps. On the client side, businesses can fire up a similar app to place orders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>About 700,000 truckers and 1.2 million trucks in India today are connected to the platform, which sees over 15 million transactions each month. &#8220;India&#8217;s truckers did not go truly digital till 2019. Since then, the supply activity has gone up by 20 times,&#8221; said Yabaji.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we started BlackBuck in 2015, only 40% of truck owners had smartphones and for truck drivers, that adoption was just 7%. By 2019, 100% of truck owners and 70% of truck drivers had smartphones,&#8221; he said, attributing this growth to advent of low-cost Android smartphones and access to much more affordable mobile data (thanks to Jio Platforms).</p>
<p>&#8220;On top of this, the government started pushing the digital adoption. There&#8217;s a digital toll system now, and many state governments have made GPS mandatory,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>During this period, BlackBuck, too, has transformed considerably. The platform has moved away from relying on call centres for booking orders to an app-based system. Today, Yabaji said the startup has reduced its reliance on brokers, who help connect them to truckers in smaller regions as more truckers and fleet owners now have smartphones and book directly.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the supply side, the platform was built in a way that it was agnostic to who was ordering. Anyone who has access to capacity in a particular location and at a particular time, has access to the load. On principal, we were okay with it from day 1,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;As we speak today, 95% of the load acceptance happens by small fleet owners who own two to three trucks.&#8221;</p>
<p>For BlackBuck, another challenge has been making inroads with small and medium-sized businesses. The platform&#8217;s biggest customerbase has traditionally comprised of large enterprises. Yabaji said things have changed dramatically as the biggest growth that BlackBuck has seen in recent years has come from SMEs. In total, the startup has over 10,000 customers SME and enterprise customers now including giants such as Hindustan Unilever, Reliance, Coca Cola, Asian Paints, Tata, Vedanta, L&amp;T and Jindal.</p>
<p>One of the biggest successes of BlackBuck in recent years has been the growth of its FASTag offering. (FASTag is an electronic toll collection system in India to make toll payments directly from the prepaid or savings account linked to it or directly to the toll owner.) Yabaji said 35% of India&#8217;s trucking toll spend today happens through BlackBuck.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are the leaders in this category and have built several unique solutions for Indian truckers,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;India&#8217;s supply chain and logistics industry is moving from paper and pencil to digital,&#8221; said Arjun Sethi, cofounder and partner at Tribe Capital, in a statement. &#8220;BlackBuck’s ability to measure output and productivity growth has streamlined logistical challenges for the industry over a short time frame. Its continued high velocity growth promises to bring even greater transformation to the Indian trucking ecosystem.”  (On a side note, Tribe Capital is in talks to back at least two more Indian startups, according to people with knowledge of the matter.)</p>
<p>BlackBuck will deploy the fresh funds to deepen its presence across India and launch several new features on its marketplace, said Yabaji. BlackBuck also has presence in Europe. Yabaji said the startup&#8217;s international play is still in its pilot stage and the large focus currently remains on India.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the midst of the Covid pandemic Blackbuck has scaled its online freight marketplace and fleet management services rapidly. Blackbuck’s contribution to increased transparency and efficiency in the large, fragmented and predominantly unorganized long-haul freight market in India offers the potential for significant developmental impact,&#8221; said Saadia Khairi, fund head at IFC Emerging Asia Fund, in a statement.</p>
<p>The new investment comes at a time when Indian startups are raising record capital and a handful of mature firms are beginning to explore the public markets. BlackBuck is the 16th Indian startup to become a unicorn this year, compared to 11 last year and six in 2019.</p>

<p><a href="https://gudangada.com/en">GudangAda</a>, a Jakarta-based marketplace that brings wholesalers closer to retail stores and other buyers, announced it has closed a Series B of more than $100 million. The company says the round was oversubscribed, passing its initial target of $75 million. The funding was led by Asia Partners and Falcon Edge, with participation from Sequoia Capital India, Alpha JWC and Wavemaker Partners.</p>
<p>This brings GudangAda’s total raised so far to about $135 million. Its last funding was a <a href="https://www.alphajwc.com/en/gudangada-indonesias-largest-fmcg-b2b-marketplace-raises-a-us25-4-mn-series-a/">$25.4 million Series A last year</a>, led by Sequoia Capital India and Alpha JWC.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in January 2019, GudangAda is now used by half a million SMEs and covers 500 cities in Indonesia. Before raising its Series B, it had already grown to $6 billion in net merchandise value on $35 million of funding. Principal manufacturers and distributors on the platform range include food products company Sido Muncul, seasoning maker Sasa and British multinational consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser.</p>
<p>Founder and chief executive officer Stevensang spent more than 25 years in Indonesia’s fast-moving consumer goods and retail industries before starting GudangAda. Over the past 10 years, Stevensang told TechCrunch that logistics costs in Indonesia have increased to among the highest in the world, impacting the whole supply chain, especially SME buyers.</p>
<p>GudangAda helps lower operational costs by connecting principal manufacturers, distributors and retailers, and handling almost all aspects of B2B buying, including deliveries. Its mobile app includes a point-of-sale system and it can also be used to manage orders, track logistics and make payments.</p>

<p>Stevensang said GudangAda focuses on several things to make buying inventory easier for SMEs. One is optimizing inventory turnover to increase working capital for businesses on the platform. The company also provides market research and data for products and gives retailers a large selection of goods. Being connected to multiple suppliers on the same platform also lets small retail stores that sell a large selection of items, but don’t have the buying volume to order directly from distributors, to purchase inventory at competitive costs.</p>
<p>To keep logistics costs down, GudangAda partners with third-party vehicle and warehouse providers to build its coverage throughout Indonesia. For its logistics partners, it provides transportation and warehouse management systems to help them digitize their operations.</p>
<p>In the future, GudangAda plans to partner with banks that will provide working capital for SMEs, enabling them to apply for loans using their data on the platform.</p>
<p>The funding will be used to expand GudangAda’s product categories, which now include fast-moving consumer goods, pharmaceuticals, packaging, homeware and stationery. It also plans to develop AI-based tools that can provide personalized recommendations for merchant customers. For example, during COVID-19, the platform suggested how much disinfectants a store should stock.</p>
<p>In a statement, Falcon Edge co-founder Navroz D. Udwadia said, “GudangAda is definitively the largest SME e-commerce marketplace in Indonesia with best-in-class metrics. Our research and conversations with stakeholders (principals, wholesalers and retailers) has given us confidence on GudangAda’s distinctive ROI and value addition to the entire ecosystem.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="https://aruna.id/">Aruna</a>’s founders first met at university, they wanted to find a way to use their studies in information technology to help family members who were running small fisheries. Indonesia is one of the world’s largest fisheries producers, but the industry is very fragmented. This means fisheries, especially small ones, deal with fluctuations in demand and price instability. Aruna was created to bring them closer to customers like restaurants and exporters, the way <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/farm-to-table/">farm-to-table startups</a> are aggregating the agricultural supply chain.</p>
<p>Aruna announced today it has raised $35 million in Series A funding led by Prosus Ventures and East Ventures Growth Fund, with participation from SIG and returning investors including AC Ventures, MDI and Vertex Ventures. Aruna says this is the largest Series A investment to date in Indonesia’s agritech and maritime sector.</p>
<p>The company works primarily with small fisheries (or ones that have boats with about one to two metric tonnes of capacity) and focuses on sustainability, helping suppliers adhere to the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/oceans/">United Nations Goal 14’s targets.</a> These include preventing overfishing, protecting coastal ecosystems and giving small-scale fisheries access to more resources and markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Aruna was founded in 2016 by Farid Naufal Aslam, Indraka Fadhlillah and Utari Octavianty, who met while studying information technology administration and management at Telkom University. Fadhlillah and Octavianty came from families in the fishing industry, and the three wanted to create something that would solve some of the challenges they faced.</p>
<p>“This was the main idea, but the bigger thing we saw at the time was the advantage of Indonesia’s position as a large agricultural country with big potential in the seafood industry,” Aslam told TechCrunch.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/10/30/new-initiative-to-improve-sustainability-of-indonesia-fisheries">the World Bank</a>, Indonesia is the world’s second largest fisheries producer. The sector creates about $4.1 billion in annual export earnings and supports more than 7 million jobs.</p>
<p>But Aruna’s founding team saw two major problems while analyzing coastal communities. The first one was market access and getting fair prices for seafood. The second was access to working capital.</p>
<p>To solve the first issue, Aruna was built to shorten the supply chain, which Aslam said can have six or seven layers between fisheries and buyers like restaurants, markets or exporters.</p>
<p>Buyers make purchase orders through the platform, which are then distributed to fishery communities that Aruna organizes to focus on particular types of seafood. This helps them predict demand, guarantee return business and prevent overfishing.</p>
<p>Aruna also built a logistics network that includes more than 45 collection sites, or warehouses where seafood is delivered by fisheries for quality checks, processing and packaging. Aruna’s warehouses are a combination of facilities that it owns or runs with partners. Deliveries are performed by third-party logistics providers.</p>
<p>The platform currently has about 20 product categories and will use its funding to expand into more. Its commodities include high-value products like lobster, which are shipped by exporters to markets like Malaysia, Singapore, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>One of Aruna’s main requirements for fisheries on the platform is sticking to its sustainability process. According to the World Bank, one of the biggest issues facing Indonesia fisheries is overfishing, which hurts marine biodiversity. Aruna team members work with fisheries to standardize their equipment so they comply with government regulations and chose locations that are not overfished.</p>
<p>By focusing on a few types of seafood each, fisheries that work with Aruna are better able to ensure the quality and traceability of their products, and manage pricing fluctuations.</p>
<p>The second problem Aruna is working on is lack of access to working capital. To help fisheries get low interest, collateral-free loans for equipment and other things they need for their businesses, Aruna partners with financial institutions and fintech companies. When an Aruna fishery applies for a loan, the platform is able to provide transaction data collected on the platform for credit scoring.</p>
<p>The company also announced today that it has appointed Budiman Goh as its president, and Octavianty as its chief sustainability officer. Its funding will be used to expand to new areas in Indonesia, hiring data analytics and tech development, including IoT devices to help perform quality checks.</p>
<p>Aruna plans to focus on Indonesia for the near future because of the large number of fisheries in the country.</p>
<p>“Currently we have 21,000 fishermen on the platform, yet there are about 2.7 million fishermen in Indonesia, so there is a lot of room to grow,” Aslam said.</p>
<p>In a statement, Sachin Bhanot, Prosus Ventures’ head of Southeast Asia investment said, “Having built a robust supply chain and technology infrastructure steeped with deep industry knowledge and expertise, we believe Aruna is uniquely positioned to service the growing global demand for sustainable fishery product, while supporting the livelihood of local fishermen.”</p>
