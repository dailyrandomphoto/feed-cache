										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://flip.id/">Flip</a></span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, an Indonesia-based fintech startup, announced today it has raised $48 million in a Series B to accelerate its growth. The funding brings Flip’s total capital raised to $65million. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sequoia Capital India, Insight Partners and Insignia Ventures Partners co-led the Series B round. Flip is Insight Partners’ first investment in Indonesia. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The startup plans to use the fresh capital to accelerate its business expansion further, strengthen its operations in Indonesia, advance technology and expand its engineering and product teams. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243939" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“This new funding is a testament to our team’s commitment and persistence. It gives us the resources we need to fuel and accelerate our mission to build innovative solutions that simplify money movement in Indonesia,” said </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arriyan/">Rafi Putra Arriyan</a></span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, co-founder and CEO of Flip. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Arriyan, Luqman Sungkar and Ginanjar Ibnu Solikhin co-founded the company in 2015 while studying at University of Indonesia. They built the Flip platform to find an answer to the problem Arriyan himself experienced as a college student – having to wait for a long time to transfer funds and pay a transfer fee each time to different banks. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In Indonesia, transferring money can be tedious for bank account holders – from funds getting stuck while transferring to lengthy clerical processes and poor product experiences with outdated interfaces and complicated flow. Flip hopes to change that by helping individuals and businesses to eliminate complexity and execute their money transfer at a low cost. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Flip, which intends to be the most customer-centric financial technology company in the world, enables users to do fair financial transactions from anywhere to anyone. The startup obtained a license from Bank Indonesia (BI) in 2016 to provide financial services, including interbank transfers to more than 100 domestic banks, international remittances, e-wallet top-ups, salary transfers and business solution products.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company said the annual volume of money transfer in Indonesia was recorded at a nominal value of more than </span>$2.2 trillion<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in 2020, citing </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://www.bi.go.id/id/statistik/ekonomi-keuangan/spip/Default.aspx">Bank Indonesia&#8217;s data</a></span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Interbank transfer is the most dominant payment method in Indonesia’s fast-growing digital economy. Flip has a massive user base and is growing rapidly with outstanding retention metrics, all of which point to the delightful and seamless product that the company has built… Sequoia Capital India believes that Flip is the most exciting consumer fintech company in Indonesia. The firm is thrilled to be leading the third consecutive round, testament of its high conviction in the company,” said Aakash Kapoor, vice president of Sequoia India. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Flip serves more than seven million users for various kinds of financial transactions from and to different regions in Indonesia and overseas money transfers. More than 340 Indonesian companies and SMEs in travel, hospitality, e-commerce, transportation, education, outsourcing, crowdfunding, business management sectors use Flip’s employee payroll, customer refunds, invoice/ supplier payments, and international transfers. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its users have increased 10x compared to before the pandemic following the increase of technology adoption and mobility restrictions in Indonesia, Arriyan said. During the pandemic, the protocol around mobility restriction in Indonesia resulted in most bank offices closing, requiring people to use technology-based solutions for their financial transactions, he continued. The shift in consumer behavior from visiting bank branches to using digital products increased users, Arriyan added. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Flip is disrupting the existing interbank transfer market and has established itself as a clear leader in the category, with its superior product that allows for seamless payment movement between bank partners,” said Deven Parekh, managing director at Insight Partners.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“As the first institutional investor in Flip, we have witnessed the incredible growth of the product and the execution of the team over the past two years. Flip is now the dominant player in its space, with millions of Indonesians trusting the platform for their day-to-day financial needs,” said Samir Chaibi, principal at Insignia Ventures Partners.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Flip has added over 250 team members to build its financial services for millions of Indonesian people. The company has increased its team size by 140 % over the past months. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world’s largest card company just doubled down on its bid to capture the crypto market. Visa announced today that it has launched a crypto advisory practice for its clients and partners under its Visa Consulting and Analytics (VCA) arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news comes just a few months after Cuy Sheffield, Visa’s head of crypto, </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/a-whole-new-class-of-consumers-is-entering-crypto-space-visa-exec.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared the asset class had become “cool”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a fintech conference last month. The payments behemoth made waves when it bought a CryptoPunk NFT in August this year, but its move to launch a dedicated crypto consultancy shows its attempts to capture crypto market share in a crowded field extend beyond marketing stunts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa’s partnerships with crypto platforms have doubled in the past 18 months, Sheffield told TechCrunch in an interview. Consumers have also spent about $3.5 million dollars using Visa’s crypto-linked card programs, Sheffield said, </span><a href="https://www.bankingdive.com/news/crypto-creeps-checkout-line-marqeta-visa-mastercard-bitpay/609409/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">up from $1 million in July</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244574" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It also announced the results of a new global survey it conducted on consumer attitudes about crypto, which found that 40% of its 6,000+ respondents would be likely to switch primary banks to one that offers crypto products.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa has seen “an incredible amount of inbound calls from hundreds of clients and partners and traditional financial institutions” who are looking to integrate crypto into their offerings, Sheffield said. Visa’s consulting arm has around 700 employees, though the company did not share how many would be affiliated with the crypto practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see Visa well-positioned as a global neutral brand, with deep expertise in crypto, that can help to abstract away some of the complexity of these new technologies and help banks bring it into their core products,” Sheffield said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, Visa invested in blockchain compliance firm TRM Analytics by participating in its $60 million Series B, <a class="c-link" tabindex="-1" href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/07/trm-labs-raises-60m-as-visa-amex-play-catchup-on-crypto-tracking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/07/trm-labs-raises-60m-as-visa-amex-play-catchup-on-crypto-tracking/" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-remove-tab-index="true">announced yesterday</a>. American Express and Citi also participated in the fundraise. Visa is just one of many card incumbents scrambling to make inroads into crypto, which is threatening their fee-dependent business model by replacing them as the new underlying infrastructure for payments.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mastercard, for its part, </span><a href="https://www.bankingdive.com/news/crypto-creeps-checkout-line-marqeta-visa-mastercard-bitpay/609409/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched a crypto rewards program in October this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, using Bakkt as its custodian for digital assets. Visa does not hold crypto in custody directly either, but partners with Anchorage Digital to provide this capability – a company </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/anchorage-cryptocurrency-security/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it first invested in</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019. Visa is building out its crypto API platform on top of Anchorage, enabling other banks to access their custodial services, Sheffield said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheffield anticipates growth in Visa’s crypto-linked debit card programs as well as use cases like central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Although just seven countries have launched CBDCs to date, 87 more are considering them, </span><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to The Atlantic Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa is hoping to capitalize on this interest by helping banks develop CBDC-related products, Sheffield said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time on research on what infrastructure CBDCs would use for consumer experiences, and how consumers would interact with them. We are taking that expertise and the engagements that we&#8217;re having with central banks and helping banks start to think about their role in preparing, as we think there&#8217;ll be a number of countries that end up going down this route,” Sheffield said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Deeproute.ai, an autonomous vehicle startup with offices in Shenzhen and Fremont, California, unveiled an ambitious self-driving solution on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The package, named DeepRoute-Driver 2.0, is a production-ready Level 4 system that costs approximately $10,000. The price tag is incredible given the hardware used: five solid-state lidar sensors, eight cameras, a proprietary computing system, and an optional millimeter-wave radar.</p>
<p>Lidar accounts for roughly half of the total cost, a Deeproute spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;As the whole supply chain is getting more developed and scale[s] up, we can expect the cost can go further down.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244658" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The two-year-old startup is unabashed about going up against its more mature counterparts. As it said in its Wednesday release, &#8220;DeepRoute-Driver 2.0 offers differentiation from existing L4 pioneers like Waymo and Cruise, which boast sophisticated and efficient L4 algorithms but with a hefty price tag, and from advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) such as Tesla, that are affordable but have limited capabilities in terms of fully automated driving.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sensor makers in China have been working to reduce the once exorbitant prices of lidar to make them fit for mass production.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/xpeng-lidar-adas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> DJI-spawned Livox</a> is one, and so is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/innovusion-64-millions-series-b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Temasek-backed Innovusion</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244664" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244664" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2244664" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LiDAR-on-the-Car-Roof.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="551" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LiDAR-on-the-Car-Roof.jpeg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LiDAR-on-the-Car-Roof.jpeg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LiDAR-on-the-Car-Roof.jpeg?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LiDAR-on-the-Car-Roof.jpeg?resize=768,414 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LiDAR-on-the-Car-Roof.jpeg?resize=680,366 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LiDAR-on-the-Car-Roof.jpeg?resize=1536,827 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LiDAR-on-the-Car-Roof.jpeg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244664" class="wp-caption-text">Lidar on the car roof. Photo: Deeproute.ai</p></div></p>
<p>Deeproute&#8217;s L4 solution uses two pieces of lidar from Robosense, which is based in Shenzhen, as its main lidar on the car roof. Three other lidar sensors from Beijing-based Z Vision are located at the front, left and right around the rear wheel, covering the vehicle&#8217;s blind spot. Both Z Vision and Deeproute are backed by Fosun RZ Capital, an affiliate fund of Chinese conglomerate Fosun Group.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The low price of Deeproute&#8217;s L4 tech could mean thin profits for the startup, or, it&#8217;s squeezing the margins of its suppliers, a founder of an autonomous vehicle startup suggested to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>A test drive shows that Deeproute&#8217;s L4 system is able to navigate rush-hour traffic in downtown Shenzhen, performing tasks like flexible lane change, yielding to pedestrians and auto on or off-ramp merging.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QMm8wqDXZW8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Though merely two years old, the team behind Deeproute includes pioneers in China&#8217;s self-driving industry. In 2019, Zhou Guang founded Deeproute after he was forced out of his last company Roadstar.ai amid infighting. At the time, Roadstar had raised at least $140 million from investors and was widely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/18/china-roundup-beijing-is-tearing-down-the-digital-walled-gardens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered a promising player in the autonomous vehicle space</a>.</p>
<p>Investors have been rooting for Zhou&#8217;s new venture. In September, the startup announced a <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/18/china-roundup-beijing-is-tearing-down-the-digital-walled-gardens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$300 million Series B round</a> from Alibaba, Jeneration Capital, Chinese automaker Geely, among others. </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon to see OEMs and carmakers pouring money into AV startups in exchange for future production partnerships. Momenta, for instance, has landed multiple strategic investments from titans like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/momenta-500-million-fundraise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bosch, Toyota and Daimler</a>.</p>
<p>While Deeproute hasn&#8217;t officially secured a customer for its L4 solution, the startup&#8217;s spokesperson said a few &#8220;major automakers&#8221; have taken rides in the cars integrated with the tech and &#8220;they were impressed by the functionality as well as the pricing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very positive on the prospect of signing the contract soon,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better.com CEO Vishal Garg apparently realizes he’s done wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(As if the barrage of negative publicity wasn’t enough evidence of that.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, a letter to current employees was </span><a href="https://nyl.as/t1/306/czkxvedfahuokld7tkw8n3lc9/0/d89395136ee9fee037b10c12db6bd059370499b25335d4397dc6e1e72a7614f5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leaked on Blind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by a verified Better employee. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the letter, Garg apologized for the way he (mis)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">handled the layoff news last week, writing: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I failed to show the appropriate amount of respect and appreciation for the individuals who were affected and for their contributions to Better. I own the decision to do the layoffs, but in communicating it I blundered the execution. In doing so, I embarrassed you.”</span></i></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244583" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some might argue that he also embarrassed himself. Among the affected employees was the company&#8217;s diversity &amp; inclusion team, according to multiple sources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier today, s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ources familiar with internal happenings within the company told TechCrunch the company’s VP of communications, Patrick Lenihan; head of public relations, Tanya Gillogley; and head of marketing, Melanie Hahn, have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/better-coms-pr-comms-marketing-heads-submit-resignations-in-wake-of-layoffs-fiasco/">all submitted their resignations</a>. Insider also reported that </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/better-marketing-communications-pr-executives-resign-after-layoffs-2021-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fallout from the way CEO and co-founder Vishal Garg handled the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/better-com-lays-off-9-of-its-staff/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">layoffs of about 900 people, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">as first reported by TechCrunch, has been widespread, including criticisms of it being handled over Zoom, to charges of insincerity on Garg’s part. Memes about the video have even landed</span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@remotevarun/video/7038608341731691823?_d=secCgwIARCbDRjEFSACKAESPgo8yOfHzjiRpjJv3hz4WmAHudHvVpzYbF51Zj097QoArWW%2BccVDk1cZOkInZt1coACIWB86CNG0htixwjFLGgA%3D&amp;checksum=200c4cfabc0d4cb7b8e458346a1cb0455b2fff0e4da72143d77efd86ad6976b6&amp;clips_cover_ab=v0&amp;enable_clips=1&amp;language=en&amp;preview_pb=0&amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAlWIlQBz17XCQiWoJlnkgC7YoGLcjJPr6xc462GGAGx9glsPA_nDUbvrvwIQi-jAc&amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;share_item_id=7038608341731691823&amp;share_link_id=E7BAAF33-F16E-4EB0-A2EC-3D4772BF4DEB&amp;source=h5_m&amp;timestamp=1638819494&amp;tt_from=sms&amp;u_code=d58dgc109e38ma&amp;user_id=6670236611684384774&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_source=sms&amp;_r=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on TikTok</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as people all over the world trashed Garg’s actions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move last week came after the digital mortgage lender announced it had received a cash infusion of about $750 million as</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/better-com-gets-750m-cash-infusion-in-new-agreement-with-its-spac-backers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an amendment of its SPAC agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with blank check company Aurora Acquisition Corp., and SoftBank, and then promptly laid off about 9% of its 10,000 workforce. The company is expected to go public at a $6.9 billion valuation.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, Bloomberg reported that the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-07/better-com-laid-off-900-workers-over-zoom-day-after-spac-merger-deal-delayed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company is now (unsurprisingly)</a><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;"> pushing back its SPAC, which was originally expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch has reached out to Better.com for comment but has not yet heard back at the time of writing. The employees said to have resigned also have not responded to requests for comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better.com is not the only SoftBank-backed proptech that has seen top executives leave in advance of its public debut. In 2019, Insider also reported more than a dozen of WeWork’s top officials </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-executive-exodus-everyone-who-left-resigned-2019-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">had left the company </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">amid reports of internal complaints and uncertainty surrounding its IPO plans.</span></p>
<p>The question on all of our minds at this point is will investors and board members tolerate this sort of behavior from Garg, or will he be forced out, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/report-weworks-adam-neumann-to-step-down-as-ceo/">Adam Neumann-style</a>?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garg’s reputation as a not very nice person goes back to last year, when </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/11/20/mortgages-fraud-claims-and-dumb-dolphins-a-tangled-past-haunts-bettercom-ceo-vishal-garg/?sh=57eee6f710f4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed the contents of an email to employees from Garg: “HELLO — WAKE UP BETTER TEAM. You are TOO DAMN SLOW. You are a bunch of DUMB DOLPHINS and…DUMB DOLPHINS get caught in nets and eaten by sharks. SO STOP IT. STOP IT. STOP IT RIGHT NOW. YOU ARE EMBARRASSING ME.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That same Forbes article revealed that Garg was the subject of a number of lawsuits from the likes of PIMCO and Goldman Sachs for things like “improper and even fraudulent activity at two prior business ventures, and of misappropriating “tens of millions of dollars.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent dip in refinancings is believed to be a factor in Better.com’s decision to lay off some of its employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April 2020, Better.com said it was “hiring aggressively” as more people were seeking to refinance their homes in the face of historically low mortgage rates. At that time, I had reported for Crunchbase News that an internal memo to employees from Garg revealed that the mortgage lending startup was </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/digital-lending-startup-better-com-hiring-aggressively-as-more-people-refinance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">looking to hire about 1,000 people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020 as a whole “as more and more homeowners come online for their needs.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been five years since the founding of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative&#8217;s Science program (not CZI itself, which is a year older), which has proven to be quite a generous patron of cutting-edge biotech science and research, and far from winding down, the organization is stepping on the gas as good outcomes from its grants and internal work pile up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Working as partners with scientists, patients, and open source communities, we’ve learned so much during these first five years of our science journey about where we can have the best impact in accelerating biomedicine. Now we’re ready to begin our next chapter,&#8221; said Priscilla Chan, co-founder and co-CEO of CZI (with husband Mark Zuckerberg, of course), <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/newsroom/chan-zuckerberg-initiative-announces-10-year-effort-to-develop-science-and-technologies-to-measure-human-biology-in-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a press release</a>.</p>
<p>The organization has funded hundreds of experiments, projects, trials and other essential basic research. While we don&#8217;t always <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/21/chan-zuckerberg-initiative-gives-68m-to-fund-human-cell-atlas/">cover the</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/chan-zuckerberg-initiative-drops-3-8m-on-23-biomedical-open-source-projects/">projects themselves</a>, being rather technical in nature, the value of this focused and highly curated giving is pretty clear. (Though it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/chan-zuckerberg-initiative-faces-racial-discrimination-allegations-from-former-employee/">not without its critics</a>.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244553" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We’ve been astonished by the fact that methods in single-cell biology, microscopy, and artificial intelligence that were considered impossible just five years ago are now routine,&#8221; said CZI&#8217;s head of science, Cori Bargmann. &#8220;This work has yielded great insight and laid the foundation for what we plan to do going forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Initiative has several major announcements to coincide with its anniversary celebrations:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new Chan Zuckerberg Institute for Advanced Biomedical Imaging will push forward in one of CZI&#8217;s favored areas of research. Imaging at a cellular or even molecular level is a constant source of insight for researchers, but it&#8217;s often phenomenally complex and expensive. Much work has been funded by CZI over the years to lower the cost and increase the efficacy of these approaches — and the new Institute will centralize and further accelerate these efforts.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/19/bay-area-coronavirus-testing-chan-zuckerberg-initiative-cz-biohub-ucsf-gavin-newsom/">The CZ Biohub</a> was started as a cross-institutional, cross-discipline platform focused on understanding and modeling the mechanisms behind every disease, with the goal of preventing, curing or managing all of them by the end of the century. Hard to aim higher than that! But it&#8217;s clearly a lot of work, so they&#8217;re extending the current Biohub&#8217;s operations through 2031, and establishing a network of new ones to scale up operations.</li>
<li>A new research institute at Harvard, the Kempner Institute for the Study of Natural and Artificial Intelligence, will focus on understanding and replicating the human mind. The next generation of AI will likely require insights from how our own brains work — and the truth is we&#8217;re kind of in the dark on that part. Maybe they&#8217;ll figure it out here.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t catch the big fifth anniversary symposium summarizing and discussing the last few years of work by CZI and partners, you should be able to catch up when they <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/anniversary-symposium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post the video here</a> later.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Whether you call it sustainability, ESG or climate tech, there is no doubt that doing good while making money has taken the world by storm.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-18/-35-trillion-in-sustainability-funds-does-it-do-any-good?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, global sustainable investment assets grew to $35.3 trillion just last year. That pencils out to about $1 of every $3 managed globally seeking to profit out of “making the world a better place.”</p>
<p>As these dollars flow into venture capital, the world seeks to solve some of the hardest climate-related problems to keep the globe within 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. Investors seem to sense the urgency: Climate tech investment grew at a faster rate than overall VC between 2013 and 2019, according to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/new-report-finds-vc-investment-into-climatetech-growing-five-times-faster-than-overall-vc/">PwC report</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244262" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To clarify, the term “impact investing” is being used here loosely and synonymously with other terms, such as socially responsible investing (SRI) and environmental, social and governance (ESG). In essence, impact is “making the world a better place.”</p>
<p>But therein lies the problem with impact investing: If better is in the eye of the beholder (and it is), then what exactly <em>is</em> better?</p>
<p>After all, Philip Morris <a href="https://www.pmi.com/investor-relations/overview/how-cigarettes-are-made#:~:text=We%20operate%2038%20production%20facilities,700%20billion%20cigarettes%20each%20year." target="_blank" rel="noopener">makes</a> 700 billion cigarettes a year, but it’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-27/philip-morris-eyes-sustainable-debt-in-move-away-from-smoking?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">striving for ESG goals</a> to lure investors. The logic of how escapes me, but you get the point.</p>
<p>Hans Taparia <a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_world_may_be_better_off_without_esg_investing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> this beautifully:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Contrary to what many investors think, most ratings don&#8217;t have anything to do with actual corporate responsibility as it relates to ESG factors. Instead, what they measure is the degree to which a company’s economic value is at risk due to ESG factors. For example, a company could be a significant source of emissions but still get a decent ESG score, if the ratings firm sees the pollutive behavior as being managed well or as non-threatening to the company’s financial value.</p></blockquote>
<p>You get what you measure, and in the world of public equity, measurement can be grossly misleading. Still, retail investors will buy into the fund because of successful “ESG factor” marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Now, there are genuine investment managers out there who are giving their best effort to make the most impact.</p>
<p>To demonstrate impact, these managers adopt a standard measurement framework, such as <a href="https://iris.thegiin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IRIS</a>. But impact measurements are notoriously difficult to apply. They are also extremely difficult to measure, and many are also inherently subjective and more costly to measure compared to the solutions trying to improve them.</p>
<p>Moreover, there may be multiple factors generating a positive outcome, and it is often impossible to discern the specific cause and effect in improving those outcomes. As a result, the manager resorts to the next best thing: They measure actions and implementations. But it is very easy to mistake leading indicators for change.</p>
<p>PlayPumps, a merry-go-round apparatus that pumped underground water the more it spun around from children playing on it, is an <a href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2010/07/01/the-playpump-what-went-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent example</a> of this. The number of installations, percentage of children using the PlayPumps, or liters of water pumped did not necessarily demonstrate whether a community has better access to clean water as a result of the pumps.</p>
<p>Let’s also not forget that these are fund managers and corporate executives who <em>still</em> have to deliver financial performance.</p>
<p>Unlike dollar values, impact measurements are vague and lack true standards, making it more difficult for investors to compare the social impact of an investment portfolio or evaluate relative performance. This also makes tying performance-based pay to impact measurements nearly impossible.</p>
<p>Impact takes time to materialize and is often outside of the fund’s or company’s influence. In the financial world that lives quarter to quarter, maximizing the dollar is always the easier choice to make when a choice must be made.</p>
<p>There is a special place for impact to exist. One where incentives between the managers and companies are aligned, the specific measurements do not matter much, and the time horizon is long enough to make a real difference.</p>
<p>That special place? The early-stage venture asset class.</p>
<p>At Creative Ventures, we use impact as an opportunity lens. We understand that the bigger the impact, the bigger the problem — and likely the bigger the market opportunity and financial return.</p>
<p>Impact is where the problems are. In a world plagued by sophisticated impact measures, our approach imagines a world where an EV costs 20% less and can go 40% farther. A world where we could cure cancer. Where energy consumption is halved in all data centers.</p>
<p>And do we not all agree the world would be a significantly better place if just one of these companies were to succeed?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for December 7, 2021! It’s nearly time to reflect on the year, a period in which so very much changed for the global startup world. One of the most interesting themes? Rising venture investment for African startups. Long ignored by the global investing set, startups from the African continent are having a barnstorming year. Sure, we have data to back up that claim, but with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/equinix-is-acquiring-nigerias-mainone-for-320m-as-it-expands-into-africa/#:~:text=Equinix%20announced%20today%20that%20it,Ivory%20Coast%2C%20for%20%24320%20million.">even more nine-figure deals landing in Africa</a> it’s a market that any technologist now must keep an eye on. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/equinix-is-acquiring-nigerias-mainone-for-320m-as-it-expands-into-africa/#:~:text=Equinix%20announced%20today%20that%20it,Ivory%20Coast%2C%20for%20%24320%20million.">More on the MainOne-Equinix deal here</a>. —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/twitter-acquires-quill-a-would-be-slack-rival-team-will-work-on-dms-as-quill-shuts-down/"><strong>Twitter buys Quill, will work on DMs:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Let’s be clear, Twitter is a fun place to hang out, but its private-messaging service is pretty <em>basic</em>. But there’s good news on the horizon with the social media company buying the business messaging service’s team to work on DMs. Quill will not survive, but it’s hard to compete against Slack.</li>
<li><strong>Meta:</strong> Facebook’s parent company is busy generating headlines this week, with the head of its Messenger service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/metas-messenger-boss-is-leaving-the-company/">leaving the company</a>, adding to a roster of exits in recent months (more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/facebooks-cto-to-step-down-after-13-years-at-the-company/">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/facebook-vr-exec-hugo-barra-is-leaving/">here</a>). And ahead of a congressional hearing, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/instagram-announces-plans-for-parental-controls-and-other-safety-features-ahead-of-congressional-hearing/">Instagram is rolling out parental controls</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/discord-premium-memberships/"><strong>Discord working on paid memberships:</strong></a><strong> </strong>In the larger creator economy, chat service Discord has found an interesting niche. And it’s working to take advantage of the communities that have been built atop its platform, working on a “new way for creators to make money by offering community members access to paid, subscriber-only content,” TechCrunch reports.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>While the year is coming to a close, the IPO cycle is not yet done. We have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/hashicorps-ipo-filing-reveals-a-growing-business-but-at-a-slower-pace/">HashiCorp’s debut on the way</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/nubanks-ipo-filing-gives-us-a-peek-into-neobank-economics/">Nubank in the wings</a>. But don’t forget about IoT shop Samsara, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/samsara-could-become-a-decacorn-in-upcoming-iot-themed-ipo/">which could become a decacorn in its upcoming IPO</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244378" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/therify-hopes-to-build-a-more-diverse-and-inclusive-therapist-network-with-1-3m-seed-round/"><strong>Therify wants to make therapy more accessible:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Finding a therapist is not easy if you’re a cishet man. I can attest to this. But if you are a “person of color or someone with disabilities, there are few or no people sharing your experience available,” TechCrunch notes. Therify just raised $1.3 million to work on the problem.</li>
<li><strong>Jupe is </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/jupe-series-a/"><strong>&#8220;not making … glamping tents for bros at Coachella:&#8221;</strong></a><strong> </strong>So what is the startup building? Housing for the roughly 1.5 billion people — by its count — that lack sufficient shelter. The company just raised $9.5 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/torq-raises-50m-series-b-for-its-no-code-security-automation-platform/"><strong>Torq puts points on the board for the Portland, Oregon, tech scene:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The startup formerly known as StackPulse is building a no-code tool for security workflows. And that effort helped it raise a simply massive $50 million Series B. Yes, the pre-IPO rounds of old are today’s early-stage investments. Get used to it. Regardless, we don’t hear that much from my home state, so it’s nice to see Torq doing well. SentinelOne led the round.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/sendowl-a-platform-for-selling-digital-goods-raises-4-5m-from-defy-vc-and-stripe/"><strong>SendOwl raises to help creators sell digital goods:</strong></a><strong> </strong>No, we’re not talking about NFTs. Instead, SendOwl wants to help “creators and businesses sell digital goods such as e-books, podcasts and online courses.” There is a big market for such content, even if SendOwl is not the only startup that we can name that is working in the space. Defy.vc and Stripe put up the capital for SendOwl’s $4.5 million seed round.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/majority-raises-27m-series-a-six-months-after-its-seed-round-to-expand-mobile-banking-for-migrants/"><strong>Today’s neobank funding round is MAJORITY:</strong></a><strong> </strong>We recently discussed a neobank aimed at SMBs. Today, immigrants. MAJORITY has raised a $27 million Series A for its work, bringing its total capital raised to some $46 million, per TechCrunch reporting. The company now allows folks to sign up sans a Social Security number, which feels notable.</li>
<li><strong>I thought Circle was </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/02/dave-eggers-denies-reading-the-boy-kings/"><strong>a book?</strong></a><strong> Or the </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/circle-is-a-good-example-of-why-spacs-can-be-useful/"><strong>crypto company going public via a SPAC?</strong></a> Turns out it’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/circle-comes-around-again-with-fresh-capital-led-by-tiger-global-for-200m-valuation/"><em>also</em> a startup helping creators build and manage their community</a>. Which seems cool, but we’d politely ask the company to rebrand to avoid us talking in circles on Slack. Regardless, Circle just raised at a $200 million valuation.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/agentsync-raises-75m-for-its-insurance-focused-api-business/"><strong>AgentSync is today’s new unicorn:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Fundraising rocket ship AgentSync announced a $75 million funding round today, pushing its valuation up to the $1.2 billion mark. Working in the insurtech API <em>infra</em> space, AgentSync is proof that there is big money in connecting disparate informational elements of antiquated industries.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/the-every-co-grabs-175m-as-it-cracks-code-on-animal-free-protein-products/"><strong>Honey, you’ve barely touched your brewed protein!</strong></a><strong> </strong>We kid, but if The EVERY Co. has its way, we’ll be eating fermented animal protein equivalents in due time. The company just landed a huge $175 million round to help it bring the future it envisions to life. The startup was previously known as Clara Foods, for reference.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/londons-pento-raises-35m/"><strong>Pento raises pile of capital:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today’s main Tiger round is Pento, a U.K.-based payment automation startup that just raised $35 million. Running payroll is a pain, and even more so for small companies. Pento of course has lots of competition, but certainly doesn’t lack for TAM.</li>
<li>To round out our startup coverage today, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/techcrunch-wants-to-meet-your-startup-at-ces-2022/">TechCrunch wants to meet your startup at CES!</a></li>

<h2>AWS re:Invent 2021 was more incremental than innovative</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2242827" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/03/aws-reinvent-2021-was-more-incremental-than-innovative/"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2242827" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2242827 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-11-30-at-11.34.56-AM.jpg" alt="AWS re:Invent 2021" width="1024" height="609" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-11-30-at-11.34.56-AM.jpg 1834w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-11-30-at-11.34.56-AM.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-11-30-at-11.34.56-AM.jpg?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-11-30-at-11.34.56-AM.jpg?resize=768,456 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-11-30-at-11.34.56-AM.jpg?resize=680,404 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-11-30-at-11.34.56-AM.jpg?resize=1536,913 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-11-30-at-11.34.56-AM.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2242827" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>We&#8217;re used to Amazon making news: It&#8217;s the world&#8217;s third-largest company, and its founder is planning to build his own private space station.</p>
<p>But at last week&#8217;s re:Invent, the annual conference for AWS customers, &#8220;it felt more like Amazon was checking boxes and filling in holes in the product road map,&#8221; writes enterprise reporter Ron Miller.</p>
<p>After going virtual in 2020, this year&#8217;s in-person return to Las Vegas saw updates from incoming CEO Adam Selipsky, CTO Werner Vogels and others, but &#8220;nothing came out of the 2021 re:Invent that felt really cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few highlights: AWS unveiled the Gravitron 3, its latest Arm-based processor, along with re:Post, a managed Q&amp;A service that replaces AWS forums, and Amplify Study, a no-code/low-code service for devs building cloud-connected applications.</p>
<p>But notably, &#8220;this is the first re:Invent in a long time where AWS did not announce a new database,&#8221; said Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research.</p>
<p>Ron&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/03/aws-reinvent-2021-was-more-incremental-than-innovative/">recap of the week&#8217;s announcements</a> — and the lack thereof — points to a company in transition: &#8220;Perhaps Amazon is becoming a bit more like Apple.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/microsoft-seizes-control-of-websites-used-by-china-backed-hackers/">Microsoft takes on Chinese hacking ring:</a> </strong>TechCrunch reports that Redmond-based software giant Microsoft has “seized control of a number of websites that were being used by a Chinese government-backed hacking group to target organizations in 29 countries, including the U.S.” Good news that the company did that, but bad news that it had to.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/google-disrupts-russian-botnet-that-infected-1-million-windows-machines/">Google disrupts Russian botnet:</a> </strong>At some point we’ll get a handle on rampant cybercrime, but today is not that day. Not yet. Progress is being made, however, with U.S. software giant Google taking on a Russian botnet of “technical sophistication,” to quote the firm. Again, good to have this happen, bad that it was a required action.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Twitter:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Twitter-Quill news was only one headline from the social service, with Big Tweet also rolling out the ability for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/twitter-now-lets-all-ios-android-and-web-users-listen-to-recorded-spaces/">all iOS and Android users to listen to recorded Spaces</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/twitter-reported-tweets-analysis/">executing work regarding reported tweets</a> that will not force users to “specify which of Twitter’s policies they believe a tweet is violating.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The rest:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/"><strong>App stores big:</strong></a> You knew that, but the data is actually somewhat staggering even given our expectations. Per Sarah Perez, first-time app installs are expected to reach 143.6 billion this year, with consumer app spending reaching some $133 billion. No wonder Apple is loath to loosen its grip on its own app-related incomes. They are huge.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/netflixs-gaming-service-adds-three-more-titles-globally-on-ios-and-android/"><strong>Netflix gaming is really, actually a thing:</strong></a><strong> </strong>I keep expecting this story to go away, but it’s doing the opposite. Again. TechCrunch noted today that video-streaming service Netflix has added three gaming titles to its larger portfolio. Instead of doing this, frankly, I’d hazard that Netflix would be better served just sponsoring its own League of Legends team, but, hey, that’s just me.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/at-lens-fest-snap-debuts-creations-tools-for-more-sophisticated-augmented-reality-experiences/"><strong>Something something Snap metaverse something something:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, held something called Lens Fest. Yes, this was AR and Spectacles and the like. Our own Lucas Matney has the information you need.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The same day in February 2020 that Credit Karma planned to announce that it had been acquired by Intuit for more than $7 billion, the stock market tanked, spooked by news that a novel virus had the potential to start a pandemic.</p>
<p>“I’m up at 5 o’clock in the morning, the Dow is flashing red … and we’re all like, ‘Are we going to do this?’” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/05/how-credit-karma-acquired-amid-covid-chaos-fared-in-its-first-year-under-intuit/">said Credit Karma CEO Ken Lin</a>.</p>
<p>That deal eventually closed in December 2020, but in the intervening months, the U.S. Department of Justice forced the company to divest its tax business, and credit markets tightened considerably.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244219" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Fintech reporter Ryan Lawler interviewed Lin, Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi, Credit Karma’s chief people officer Colleen McCreary and other executives to learn about how they weathered COVID-19 and divestment while simultaneously crafting a new management structure.</p>
<p>&#8220;What had been a very profitable business for a very long time is all of a sudden very unprofitable, because you can’t pivot on a dime,&#8221; said Lin. &#8220;We had a lot of decisions to make.”</p>

<p>Initially founded to create wireless sensors, IoT platform company Samsara reached a $3.6 billion valuation in 2018, but its latest S-1/A filing could boost that &#8220;from $10.1 billion to $11.6 billion,&#8221; reports Alex Wilhelm in today&#8217;s edition of The Exchange.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, he delved into the company&#8217;s inner workings, but &#8220;today, we’re more interested in the resulting numbers, not how they were achieved.&#8221;</p>

<h2>AWS re:Invent 2021 was more incremental than innovative</h2>

<p>We&#8217;re used to Amazon making news: it&#8217;s the world&#8217;s third-largest company, and its founder is planning to build his own private space station.</p>
<p>But at last week&#8217;s re:Invent, the annual conference for AWS customers, &#8220;it felt more like Amazon was checking boxes and filling in holes in the product road map,&#8221; writes enterprise reporter Ron Miller.</p>
<p>After going virtual in 2020, this year&#8217;s in-person return to Las Vegas saw updates from incoming CEO Adam Selipsky, CTO Werner Vogels and others, but &#8220;nothing came out of the 2021 re:Invent that felt really cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few highlights: AWS unveiled the Gravitron 3, its latest Arm-based processor, along with re:Post, a managed Q&amp;A service that replaces AWS forums, and Amplify Study, a no-code/low-code service for devs building cloud-connected applications.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But notably, &#8220;this is the first re:Invent in a long time where AWS did not announce a new database,&#8221; said Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research.</p>
<p>Ron&#8217;s recap of the week&#8217;s announcements — and the lack thereof — points to a company in transition: &#8220;Perhaps Amazon is becoming a bit more like Apple.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a founder, raising seed money can be the hardest part of the puzzle, and depending on the sector, can take dozens of weeks to accomplish.</p>
<p>A data-driven approach to the process, however, can help founders tackle fundraising efficiently while minimizing headaches, writes Russ Heddleston, CEO of DocSend.</p>
<p>“Having very clear data on where VCs focus their time on pitch decks or in meetings will guide you to deliver a finely tuned pitch to the right investor.”</p>

<p>Last week&#8217;s announcement by LinkedIn that it would start offering its services in Hindi highlights a problem facing startups trying to recruit software developers — many of them don&#8217;t use the platform.</p>
<p>Potential hires who live in emerging markets are less likely to use LinkedIn, but a lot of devs just don&#8217;t take a strong interest in building their brands on social media.</p>
<p>Making an effort to meet developers where they are will help your company as an attractive place to work, writes Sergiu Matei, founder of Index.</p>
<p>In a TechCrunch+ post, he shares three tips you can use to attract engineers in an increasingly competitive market:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open up your content, chats and code</li>
<li>Make EQ, not IQ, your hiring criteria</li>
<li>Say “yes” to more candidates</li>
</ul>

<p>The market is ripe for AI companies to go public, but for SenseTime’s Hong Kong IPO, demand may be less than that of the wider market, writes Alex Wilhelm.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s new IPO target of up to HK$5.99 billion (US$768 million) is a far cry from its previous $2 billion IPO, possibly reflecting the fact that investors aren’t excited about its steadily increasing losses, Alex writes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Amazon&#8217;s cloud arm, AWS, announced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/announcing-second-aws-top-secret-region-extending-support-us-government-classified-missions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new &#8216;top secret&#8217; region</a> this week, designed specifically for the U.S. government. It is Amazon&#8217;s second such region. The company now boasts &#8220;top secret&#8221; regions on the east and west coasts of the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;AWS Top Secret-West is accredited to operate workloads at the Top Secret U.S. security classification level. The new Region adds multiple Availability Zones geographically separated from AWS Top Secret-East,&#8221; Amazon&#8217;s Max Peterson wrote in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/announcing-second-aws-top-secret-region-extending-support-us-government-classified-missions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a company blog post</a> announcing the new region.</p>
<p>The company, which is experiencing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/amazon-web-services-went-down-and-took-a-bunch-of-the-internet-with-it/">an outage today in its East Coast region</a>, recognizes that government clients have different needs. You can&#8217;t put them in a multi-tenant server farm with the rest of humanity. They need isolation and security, and that&#8217;s what the top secret regions have been designed to give them.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244216" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;AWS is committed to helping our customers and partners in the defense, intelligence and national security communities deliver their most critical missions,&#8221; Peterson wrote.</p>
<p>Last year when the company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/microsoft-and-aws-exchange-poisoned-pen-blog-posts-in-latest-pentagon-jedi-contract-spat/">fighting with Microsoft</a> over the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/pentagon-jedi-contract/"> decade-long JEDI cloud contract</a>, it could point to this top secret region as evidence of its capabilities in managing these special requirements. That contract <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nobody-wins-as-dod-finally-pulls-the-plug-on-controversial-10b-jedi-contract/">was eventually scrapped</a>, lost in litigation, and perhaps this is another way to show just how prepared Amazon is to deal with sensitive material like the kind from the DoD in the future.</p>
<p>The new site gives government clients a way to spread out their workloads across geographies, and then within that, choose different availability zones. The zone has been certified by a number of government entities to provide the level of security required by the target customers, including Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Intelligence Community Directive (ICD 503) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better.com continues to find new ways to make itself look bad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, sources familiar with internal happenings within the company told TechCrunch the company’s VP of communications, Patrick Lenihan; head of public relations, Tanya Gillogley; and head of marketing, Melanie Hahn, have all submitted their resignations. Insider also reported the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/better-marketing-communications-pr-executives-resign-after-layoffs-2021-12">news</a> earlier today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fallout from the way CEO and co-founder Vishal Garg handled the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/better-com-lays-off-9-of-its-staff/">layoffs of about 900 people, </a>as first reported by TechCrunch, has been widespread, including criticisms of it being handled over Zoom, to charges of insincerity on Garg’s part. Memes about the video have even landed</span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@remotevarun/video/7038608341731691823?_d=secCgwIARCbDRjEFSACKAESPgo8yOfHzjiRpjJv3hz4WmAHudHvVpzYbF51Zj097QoArWW%2BccVDk1cZOkInZt1coACIWB86CNG0htixwjFLGgA%3D&amp;checksum=200c4cfabc0d4cb7b8e458346a1cb0455b2fff0e4da72143d77efd86ad6976b6&amp;clips_cover_ab=v0&amp;enable_clips=1&amp;language=en&amp;preview_pb=0&amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAlWIlQBz17XCQiWoJlnkgC7YoGLcjJPr6xc462GGAGx9glsPA_nDUbvrvwIQi-jAc&amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;share_item_id=7038608341731691823&amp;share_link_id=E7BAAF33-F16E-4EB0-A2EC-3D4772BF4DEB&amp;source=h5_m&amp;timestamp=1638819494&amp;tt_from=sms&amp;u_code=d58dgc109e38ma&amp;user_id=6670236611684384774&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_source=sms&amp;_r=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on TikTok</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as people all over the world trashed Garg’s actions.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244436" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move last week came after the digital mortgage lender announced it had received a cash infusion of about $750 million as<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/better-com-gets-750m-cash-infusion-in-new-agreement-with-its-spac-backers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> an amendment of its SPAC agreement</a> with blank check company Aurora Acquisition Corp., and SoftBank, and then promptly laid off about 9% of its 10,000 workforce. The company is expected to go public at a $6.9 billion valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garg also confirmed to </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2021/12/03/better-com-ceo-attacks-laid-off-employees-blind-message-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortune</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the company accused</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “at least 250&#8243; terminated staffers of stealing from the company and customers by working just two hours a day. Not long after Garg announced the layoffs, he addressed the company in a livestreamed town hall. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/better-ceo-vishal-garg-explains-layoffs-in-leaked-video-meeting-2021-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="80" data-uri="73d8081c47c7a1554179a4413e829a93">He laid out a vision of what he called &#8220;Better 2.0,&#8221;</a> with a &#8220;leaner, meaner, hungrier workforce,&#8221; according to a leaked recording of the meeting shared with Insider. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch has reached out to Better.com for comment but has not yet heard back at the time of writing. The employees said to have resigned also have not responded to requests for comment.</span></p>
<p>Garg&#8217;s reputation as a not very nice person goes back to last year, when <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/11/20/mortgages-fraud-claims-and-dumb-dolphins-a-tangled-past-haunts-bettercom-ceo-vishal-garg/?sh=57eee6f710f4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes</a> revealed the contents of an email to employees from Garg: “HELLO — WAKE UP BETTER TEAM. You are TOO DAMN SLOW. You are a bunch of DUMB DOLPHINS and…DUMB DOLPHINS get caught in nets and eaten by sharks. SO STOP IT. STOP IT. STOP IT RIGHT NOW. YOU ARE EMBARRASSING ME.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That same Forbes article revealed that Garg was the subject of a number of lawsuits from the likes of PIMCO and Goldman Sachs for things like &#8220;improper and even fraudulent activity at two prior business ventures, and of misappropriating &#8220;tens of millions of dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent dip in refinancings is believed to be a factor in Better.com’s decision to lay off some of its employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April 2020, Better.com said it was “hiring aggressively” as more people were seeking to refinance their homes in the face of historically low mortgage rates. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, I had reported for Crunchbase News that an internal memo to employees from Garg revealed that the mortgage lending startup was <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/digital-lending-startup-better-com-hiring-aggressively-as-more-people-refinance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looking to hire about 1,000 people</a> in 2020 as a whole “as more and more homeowners come online for their needs.”</span></p>
<p>Better.com is not the only SoftBank-backed proptech that has seen top executives leave in advance of its public debut. In 2019, Insider also reported more than a dozen of WeWork&#8217;s top officials <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-executive-exodus-everyone-who-left-resigned-2019-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had left the company </a>amid reports of internal complaints and uncertainty surrounding its IPO plans.</p>
<p><strong>Reporter&#8217;s note:</strong> After we published this story, we learned that Garg had issued an apology to current employees, and that the SPAC will likely be delayed.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meta (formerly Facebook) has found a new way to avoid the app stores&#8217; commissions on in-app purchases with the launch of a new website where people can buy &#8220;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/tools/stars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stars</a>&#8221; &#8212; the virtual items that allow fans to express their support for favorite creators during Facebook videos and livestreams. Typically, Stars are bought as in-app purchases on mobile devices where they&#8217;re subject to a revenue share with the app store platform provider &#8212; meaning, Apple or Google. But when fans purchase Stars via the new Facebook website, they&#8217;ll use Facebook Pay, not Apple or Google&#8217;s payment mechanisms.</p>
<p>This will allow fans to &#8220;get more Star for their money at lower rates,&#8221; notes <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/stars-fest-is-here" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Facebook announcement</a>. That appears to be true for the time being at least, as Facebook is offering &#8220;bonus&#8221; Stars with every purchase. That means, for example, when you spend $9.99 on 530 Stars, you&#8217;ll now get another 420 Stars as a bonus when purchased through the website. Via the Facebook mobile app and in-app purchases, however, you would only get the 530 Stars. (Note: I am referencing the website bonus amounts that appeared when the site is loaded today. The Facebook blog post features a screenshot that shows different bonus amounts. We understand rates are even lower during the month of December for the “Stars Fest” event. Regardless, these bonuses mean you get more Stars for your money via the web.)</p>

<p>There are Bonus Stars available at a variety of increments, with the number of extra Stars increasing alongside your purchase amount. You can purchase as few as 45 Stars (with a bonus of 35 Stars) for $0.99 or as many as 6,400 Stars (with a bonus of 3,600 Stars) for $99.99, according to the website as it appears now. (See above.)</p>
<p>But if the bonuses are removed, there&#8217;s no advantage to using a website over in-app purchases, as the rates appear to otherwise be the same as you&#8217;d otherwise pay.</p>
<p>Once purchased through the Stars Store website, the Stars are deposited into people&#8217;s virtual wallets so they can be distributed to eligible creators during their Facebook Live or on-demand videos. Creators can reward their fans who use Stars however they want &#8212; they may give them a shoutout on the video or some other perk in line with their style and content.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244479" style="width: 418px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244479" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2244479" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/264108882_439708281046369_1735616068564879691_n.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="408" height="768" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244479" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Facebook has found a way to work around the app stores&#8217; revenue share requirements. Last month, Facebook introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/facebook-apple-subscription-fees-custom-links/">custom subscription links for creators</a> on iOS that allow them to accept direct payments, avoiding Apple&#8217;s controversial 30% cut. This system was possible because &#8212; for the time being at least &#8212; Facebook isn&#8217;t taking its own cut of these transactions. That allows Facebook to leverage a currently acceptable means of avoiding commissions as detailed in Apple&#8217;s App Store Guidelines. (Specifically,<a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#acceptable" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> rule 3.2.1</a>, which says individuals may make monetary gifts to other individuals if 100% of the funds go to the receiver of the gift. <a href="https://blog.clubhouse.com/introducing-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clubhouse</a> took advantage of this carve-out as well for its in-app tipping system.)</p>
<p>The ability to buy Stars via the web is another interesting move &#8212; and one that could shift a number of transactions off Facebook&#8217;s mobile app and in-app purchases once fans realize there&#8217;s a way to buy more stars for less money. Apple is supposed to soon allow app developers to point to other means of making purchases outside the app as a result of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/apple-ordered-to-comply-with-courts-decision-in-epic-games-case-over-in-app-payments/">Epic Games ruling</a>, but Apple is currently asking the court to delay when that injunction goes into effect after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/09/technology/apple-epic-games-suit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its first attempt was denied</a>.</p>

<p>Facebook&#8217;s announcement of the Stars Store website was one of many updates it&#8217;s making during its <a href="https://starsfest2021.fnvirtual.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">month-long &#8220;Stars Fest&#8221; taking place in December</a>. The company says it&#8217;s also testing using Stars in more places &#8212; like videos on the News Feed, the Facebook Watch feed, the Gaming tab, and starting next year, Facebook Reels.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also launching something called &#8220;Stars Party,&#8221; which is a new way for fans to send Stars together during livestreams. A countdown timer will appear giving the community five minutes to come together and hit a Stars goal. Creators who complete a Stars Party will receive a $50 bonus for each one from Dec. 22, 2021 through Jan. 3, 2022, Facebook says.</p>
<p>As part of the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/facebook-creator-bonuses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/creators/investing-one-billion-in-the-creator-community&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638992019927000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1N1NcGnH1jBL6PAaDmY0BP">$1 billion creator fund</a>, it&#8217;s also investing in a Stars &#8220;Double bonus,&#8221; which runs through March 31. During this time, Meta will match some creators’ Stars earnings, up to $750 a month. This could allow creators to earn up to $3,750 in bonus payments. However, the program is invite-only. Facebook will also give $3 million in free Stars to people so they can try out the feature during live videos.</p>
<p>Elsewhere during Stars Fest, the company is offering limited-time virtual gifts and badges, special live programming from a variety of creators, financial incentives for creators to go live and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The African tech scene woke up today to exciting news about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/equinix-is-acquiring-nigerias-mainone-for-320m-as-it-expands-into-africa/">landmark acquisition</a> of MainOne, one of the region’s most important and pivotal tech companies in the past decade, by Equinix, a U.S. multinational specializing in internet connection data centers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story of MainOne starts with founder and CEO Funke Opeke moving back to Nigeria after working as an executive at Verizon. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she noticed how poor internet connectivity was in Nigeria, she started Mainstreet Technologies, the company behind the development of the MainOne Cable, to provide network solutions to businesses in Nigeria and West Africa in 2008</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MainOne went live in 2010 as West Africa’s first </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">privately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> owned, open access, undersea high-capacity 7,000-km cable stretching from Portugal to West Africa with landings along Accra, Dakar, Abidjan and Lagos.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244251" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which services businesses in more than 10 African countries, is now an Equinix subsidiary and the acquisition, subject to regulatory approval, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is pegged</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at $320 million. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When completed, it will become the largest acquisition of a tech company in Nigeria and the first landmark deal made by an African woman tech CEO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch had a chat with Opeke and Judith Gardiner, VP Growth and Emerging Markets at Equinix, to discuss the deal and address reports that MainOne </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was bought</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for cheap</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: If you’ve been following the reactions to the news this morning, there are two camps with opinions on the deal. Some think Equinix acquired MainOne at a good price after you ran the company profitably, while others think MainOne was underpriced. There are reports that MainOne has invested up to $400 million in the course of building internet and data infrastructure in West Africa. Do you see why a part of the public is conflicted about MainOne is selling at $320 million?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Funke Opeke:</strong> Interesting question. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Equinix is gaining a competitive, informed price for the shares in MainOne and the shareholders retained a leading investment bank to run a competitive process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we’re very satisfied and pleased with the offer made by Equinix and the value they represented to the shareholders and to the business going forward</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But they were not the only interested party.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, of course, we’ve raised capital through the years, but not all the capital we’ve raised is equity. In fact, MainOne has not raised equity since the initial founding of the company. We have raised debt, we have refinanced debt, we have extended that debt to grow the business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when you look at the sale of shares in MainOne and the value, one, you shouldn’t say &#8220;OK, because MainOne has raised this much capital over the years, then we have to multiply that by a certain amount to achieve the value of the business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other thing, of course, is you have to look at the revenue and profits generated [by] the business, earnings multiples of the business, and I can assure you that the shareholders of MainOne who are selling their shares </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are seasoned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are pleased</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the levels of returns that they are achieving.</span></p>
<p><strong>Would you like to highlight the share of equity and debt you’ve raised throughout the years just for clarification&#8217;s sake?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>FO:</strong> I don’t have those numbers in front of me, and we have raised several rounds of debt or rolled over several rounds of debt. The company to the public domain was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">initially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> capitalized with $120 million in equity and $120 million in debt. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should also note that the investors in MainOne started investing in 2008, and, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obviously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there have been partial distributions to these investors through the tenor of the business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>OK. So you’re saying this wasn’t any forced or distressed sale?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>FO:</strong> Not at all. I mean, we’re doing well, we’re having one of our best years ever. Our businesses growing, responding to the challenges faced in our region. We opened a new data center in Ghana in June of this year, we are expanding our data center facility in Lekki and that will be open in Q1 2022.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are critical to the digital infrastructure of West Africa, no doubt, and we expect that we will continue to grow that as part of the global platform that Equinix brings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a fantastic story that we can grow as part of that global platform and have access to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investment capability, the technology and the solutions they have to offer the global customers who are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wanting to do business in our region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this is no kind of distress sale. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our shareholders who are financial investors have been in the company from the initial investors almost 13 years around 2008 to all the other institutional investors who came in in 2009</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And you would agree with me, but that is an extensive period. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But these are also infrastructure investors who realize that it takes time for the infrastructure to mature and become productive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have seen their investment become productive for them in recent years and this was a good time to exit and they couldn’t hand it off to a better company than Equinix</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our strategies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are aligned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the culture </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is aligned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it’s an exit that the shareholders of MainOne are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proud of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Judith Gardiner:</strong> And I would add to Funke’s point that when we are looking at potential targets to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> put an awful lot of effort into the assessment of the management team, the assets, the strategy that the company has to make sure that it’s going to fit with ours and also plug into our platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for us, MainOne was without a doubt, the best match for us on the market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the other thing is that we see the connectivity, the cable Funke started many years ago from Lagos to Portugal, as a key differentiator</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we’re also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> encouraged by the amount of land that MainOne has for expansion, which is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">incredibly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> crucial to be able to expand in the market and extend our platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>Talking about Equinix and your plans for Africa, we see other global players such as recently Facebook and Google doing stuff with their 2Africa and Equiano subsea cables. Do you see any threat to the work you’ve done at MainOne?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>FO:</strong> Not at all. One of the studies Google did on the impact of their submarine cables that they had built in other parts of the world is actually when they start building in a region, they actually buy more than they’re able to provide themselves</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we see the entrance of global platforms and other players with their own direct investments into our market not a sign of competition but as a sign of the growing size and significance of our market and the need for greater participation by these players</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the inside of the business, these companies are not building enough infrastructure for them not to need to buy from others, not to need to extend the services to different locations, and not need diversity from their networks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So yes, there is more interest in our market because our market has become more significant. Yes, some of the interests and the investments will compete with us. But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it would also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">accelerate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the growth of our market. That means a bigger business opportunity or addressable market for MainOne.</span></p>
<p><strong>How does Equinix see competition playing out with large data centers, such as Amazon in South Africa and Africa Data Centres?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>JG:</strong> Amazon is one of our largest customers. Amazon builds its own data centers, which tend to be for its own use. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Amazon also takes very large space with Equinix around the world for cloud on-ramps for their compute, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for any data that needs to flow around the world, they will tend to use an Equinix or a colocation company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So, yes, they have their own data centers in South Africa. But, I would expect that we’re going to see the global players coming into MainOne now that we are extending our Equinix platform.</span></p>
<p><strong>How does this acquisition bring more business into Nigeria and Africa markets?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>FO:</strong> Just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an extension of what Judith said, global players are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interested in Africa because we’re on the digital map. Now we have more users on the internet, their consumption of digital services and applications is growing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how much of that value chain is being provided from within Africa, and Equinix is coming into Africa to help us deepen the investments to host cloud service providers and enterprises here who want to be a part of this global fabric to enable global business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">clearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in and of itself is a growth strategy that enables us to capture more market share and provide services as companies continue to digitize, as more users continue to get access to broadband services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It enables us to provide more of what they need, which is a growth strategy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it also enables the global service providers as they seek to reach more of the African population to leverage the platforms we have within the region, which we will be growing, including building out the data center in Sagamu, which is more investment, more business, more jobs in Africa to serve the needs of the African digital population and for the rest of the world that wants to engage with Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>JG:</strong> Our acquisitions tend to be demand-driven by our customers, our international customers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this is very much one of those where our customers have been saying to us for quite some time, ‘When do you want to go to West Africa, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need you to go there because we want to extend our own businesses there and we want to do that on your platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.’ </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that is the reason that this is one of the highest value tech IT industry acquisitions this year in West Africa, because it was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an essential part of our new market strategy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>I wouldn’t say just West Africa, it’s probably the whole of Africa. I’m not sure there’s any bigger acquisition made this year. In fact, it’s one of the rare exits to have happened on the continent and the first major one from a female founder. How does it feel to be in both exclusive clubs of founders that have exited their companies in Africa?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>FO:</strong> Well, I am delighted. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a Herculean effort, but not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of myself, but the whole team, my shareholders, the investors who wrote the check, who provided the governance, the environment, the market, the consumers who have embraced the services we have and have walked with us through the years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I’m also gratified that our exit is coming in form of access to a global leader strategic in our space that is coming to the continent for the first time to invest and help us grow the business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we’ll ensure that there’s good alignment so that the company, the team, the investments, the customer base, the product sets can all continue to grow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as a female founder, I hope that to other female founders and to young women who are considering careers in tech or starting a business, this demonstrates to them that [making an exit] </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is indeed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> achievable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is a good example for them and it’s a good motivator. So to that extent, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being a female founder has significance. But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the business, you know, it’s not gender-specific. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a great exit of a great company that a lot of people have worked at to make successful. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to the credit of Equinix that they have identified by and they’ve chosen to take the bold step and come into the continent with us. And we look forward to the continued growth of digital infrastructure in Africa as a result.</span></p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherwilliamwatson/">Chris Watson</a> is the director of the International Development Division at<a href="https://www.premise.com/"> Premise</a> and an evangelist for using data to improve the impact of development programs.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">In 2019, the U.S. Agency for International Development developed the “<a href="https://www.usaid.gov/npi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Partnerships Initiative</a>” (NPI) to build a “safer, healthier and more prosperous” world for people everywhere. NPI simplifies access to USAID resources and makes it easier for partners to bring forward their ideas and innovation.</p>
<p>In simple terms, NPI helps USAID collaborate with local nonprofits on humanitarian work by identifying new partners and sources of funding, streamlining access to resources, promoting local leadership and providing training.</p>
<p>However, the NPI legislation, as it stands, has its limitations. For-profit entities are excluded from receiving NPI funding, and many of the small business set-asides created by Congress have been co-opted by industry insiders and ex-contractors. Additionally, many of the breakthrough innovations that we need in global development have been spearheaded by for-profit entities, including those located in low- and middle-income countries.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244192" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In 2016, Premise had its first opportunity to work with USAID, and it was a proud moment. That year, USAID — through a <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/grandchallenges" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grand Challenge</a> grant — asked us to design tasks for our <a href="https://www.premise.com/contributors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contributors</a> as a way to identify and destroy mosquito breeding sites. More than 7,000 citizens participated in three cities, showing Colombian authorities through mapping where the most high-impact areas were located.</p>
<p>Since then, our platform has been used by over 20 USAID-funded projects to get data-driven answers to their questions about activity design and evaluation. And with the introduction of Unlock Aid — a coalition of innovative organizations uniting to drive structural change in global development, of which <a href="https://www.premise.com/premise-joins-other-innovators-to-form-unlock-aid-disrupting-an-antiquated-international-development-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we are a founding member</a> — we continue to work with USAID to push for legislation like the NPI.</p>
<h2>New Partnerships Initiative legislation</h2>
<p>With the hope of changing the way USAID does business, Senators Tim Kaine and Marco Rubio <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/565271-senators-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-expand-foreign-aid-partnerships" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> the New Partners Initiative (NPI) legislation in July 2021. The bill would authorize $250 million over the course of four years to make it easier for new entities to receive foreign aid funds and implement programs.</p>
<p>The NPI legislation would result in several positive changes. Although NPI was founded in 2019, the 2021 legislation codifies significant funding for new and underutilized partners. It also directs USAID to use solicitations that lower barriers to entry. The legislation also directs USAID to simplify reporting and requires USAID to submit an annual report to Congress detailing how it implemented the NPI program.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlock Aid and Premise support this legislation with the caveat that it should also allow for-profit entities to be “new partners” &#8212; not just nonprofits.</p>
<p>In November, Administrator Samantha Power gave a <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/speeches/nov-4-2021-administrator-samantha-power-new-vision-global-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speech</a> at Georgetown University regarding a new vision for global development that includes for-profit companies:</p>
<blockquote><p>Inclusive of this country&#8217;s diverse talent and dynamic private sector; inclusive of the voices of those whom we are privileged to serve alongside; tackling problems abroad in a way that is responsive to our partners, that will save lives, and that will advance American interests and values.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Disruption in the industry</h2>
<p>It is difficult for tech companies to work with USAID because commercial business models do not fit how USAID operates. The biggest hurdle is that USAID frequently does not consider whether its objectives can be achieved with existing commercial products and services. Each project is custom-built for its objective by an implementing partner that is paid for implementing it, not for results. USAID could increase the scale of its impact if it were to rely more on products and services that have a use outside of just the international development space.</p>
<p>There is precedent for this in other parts of the U.S. government. Palantir and SpaceX went to federal court (and won) over being unlawfully excluded from competing in their respective fields in the government sector.</p>
<p>Both companies made the same argument: The government must consider whether commercially available products can meet their needs before building new custom products and programs.</p>
<p>When SpaceX filed its suit back in 2014, NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/elon-musks-spacex-sues-government-protest-military-launch-monopoly-n89926" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a>, “Musk emphasized that the suit wasn’t asking the federal government to award the launches to SpaceX rather than ULA. ‘We’re just protesting as saying that they should be competed,’ he said.”</p>
<p>Similarly, when Palantir won its lawsuit against the Army, Palantir’s attorney, Hamish Hume, said a judge in the Court of Federal Claims issued an injunction on the procurement, forcing the Army to consider commercial offerings such as the one Palantir would like to offer. The court confirmed the injunction but declined to comment further.</p>
<p>“This is a victory not just for Palantir but for taxpayers and our whole procurement system,” Hume <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/peter-thiels-palantir-scores-a-win-in-fight-for-lucrative-army-contract/2016/10/31/7e0682fa-9f8a-11e6-a44d-cc2898cfab06_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>. He said the decision would have a far-reaching impact that would “make it more appealing for innovators like Palantir to come to Washington and compete for government business.”</p>
<p>Innovators working to advance a free, peaceful and prosperous world are seeking a similar opportunity in the international development space &#8212; a shot at leveraging commercial products and services to increase development impact.</p>
<h2>Thinking beyond the system</h2>
<p>The New Partnerships Initiative can be an innovative avenue for USAID to increase its impact around the world. But the initiative can’t ignore the many opportunities presented by for-profit institutions, not just non-governmental organizations, that are able to bring significant investment to the table. There are far too many innovative solutions that can be scaled for the NPI to keep for-profit companies out of the loop, and we hope that the USAID sees the many possibilities removing this stipulation could allow for.</p>
<p>It rapidly became clear that the only way to change an entire industry, the way SpaceX and Palantir did, is to involve a much more comprehensive range of “stakeholders” in the effort, including governments, NGOs and members of civil society.</p>
<p>If NPI expands to work with tech companies, they can provide USAID with existing tools and solutions. Opening up NPI to for-profit businesses is the first step in doing so.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;We&#8217;re not making fucking glamping tents for bros at Coachella,&#8221; Jeff Wilson, co-founder and CEO at <a href="https://jupe.com/">Jupe</a> is eager to reassure me, as he outlines his vision for the company. &#8220;At this point, food is a distribution problem, clothing is largely solved. There are about 1.5 billion people in the world that still don&#8217;t have adequate shelter. If you&#8217;re going to work on big problems here on earth, that&#8217;s one worth working on.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems like <a href="https://initialized.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Garry Tan from Initialized</a> and the gang over at <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Y Combinator</a> agree &#8212; they just secured a roof over Jupe&#8217;s head for a few months with a $9.5 million injection of cash. The money will be spent on building out the team and continuing its mission of housing the unhoused. To date, the company has received more than 300 preorders, and has started shipping Jupe shelters to a number of locations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jupe’s vision of universal autonomous housing will ultimately allow anyone to live anywhere on the planet, comfortably and with an internet connection via satellite. It’s something the world has been waiting for,&#8221; commented Initialized Capital founder and managing partner, Garry Tan. &#8220;They are building a first-of-its-kind hard tech and software platform for the world.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243826" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Jupe&#8217;s mission sure isn&#8217;t shy, and its founder is a character and a half, but he&#8217;s got the passion and mad scientist vibe to pull it off.</p>
<p>&#8220;I lived in a dumpster for a year, because I wanted to try to live using 1% of the volume, and 1% of the energy used of the average American home,&#8221; Wilson told me in a recent interview, before shifting gears and explaining how he landed with the idea for Jupe: &#8220;I have a PhD in environmental science, and I think climate change plays into what we are doing. We don&#8217;t have to pour any foundations, we aren&#8217;t hooked into the grid or tied to a particular plot of land. Jupe is a step forward in solving the housing crisis that impacts 1.5 billion people annually. Jupe units are 10 times cheaper and faster to deploy than traditional temporary, mobile housing solutions, and ship 15 times more efficiently. On top of that, its unique design provides dignified lodging for everyone &#8212; with an internet connection.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Garry Tan, who led the investment round, coined the term universal autonomous housing. That&#8217;s a really good descriptor of what we are doing here,&#8221; Wilson explains, adding that he currently lives in one of the Jupe units in the middle of Soma in San Francisco &#8220;For right now, it&#8217;s someone that wants to have a very high-design, very comfortable experience in nature, off grid. Longer term as we build out the technology, we will build for people that no longer want to live in the cities, that want to live with a community of folks out on a raw piece of land. From there we expect to widen that time horizon to where people are living in these for weeks, months, ultimately their entire life.&#8221;</p>
<p>The current version of the Jupe shelter, the company&#8217;s founder describes as an MVP. It&#8217;s a sturdy construction with a chassis that houses the core technology of the shelters, with an aluminium exo-skeleton on top. It withstands high winds pretty well, but is primarily aimed at temperate climates, in the high 40°F (5°C) to high 80F (27°C) range.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The next version will have a hard top on it, so you&#8217;ll be able to use it more of a four-season kind of environment,&#8221; says Wilson. &#8220;With our existing structure, we can&#8217;t take heavy snow loads. The ones we had in Colorado, we had to take down in winter. It&#8217;s an evolution, though &#8212; we are a young company. We do have growth ambitions, though. We built our first Jupe in April of 2020, and we already have around $7 million of revenue booked.</p>
<p>The company wasn&#8217;t eager to share its pricing model with us, and Wilson argues that it isn&#8217;t relevant anyway; the company is hoping to build out a network of Jupes and place them on plots of lands. They then rent it out, and split the revenue 50/50.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have no upfront cost, apart from a small licensing fee. We put it on our booking platform, and we hot-swap them out. If the Jupe on your land gets old, we come and replace it, almost like a car trade-in. We bring in the newest technology for you, and take the old one for another use case,&#8221; explains Wilson. &#8220;Just add land, that&#8217;s our slogan.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s biggest challenge right now is to attract the right CTO who can take charge of the technical side of things &#8212; the company is looking for a technical, &#8220;almost founder level CTO&#8221; to help build the future of the technology platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;They just have to be a good fucking human. There are so many assholes out there, and we need someone truly excellent. We&#8217;re probably looking for someone with 15 years experience, who has had exposure both to startups, and managed and grown big teams. Someone who is really strong in the software side, but who has also done a bunch of integration stuff. This is a gadget; a device,&#8221; explains Wilson, &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a hard find, but we&#8217;re going to spend a significant amount of money and equity on this person to get someone who is competitive, and who can help us get to the vision I have.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bold vision &#8212; the company wants to house a hundred million people.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know everyone wants to go to Mars, but let&#8217;s not give up on Earth quite yet,&#8221; Wilson concludes. &#8220;Screw the valuation of the company, this is what I want to do with the rest of my life. I need the best folks in the world who are also good humans. Let&#8217;s work on this cause.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to TechCrunch’s 2021 Holiday Gift Guide! Need help with gift ideas? We’ve got lots of them. Looking for our other guides? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/pages/gift-guide-2021/">Find them here!</a></em></p>
<p class="p3">Buying camping gear is all about making tradeoffs.</p>
<p class="p3">Lightweight backpacking gear may be perfect for trips where you carry everything with you but might not be quite as sturdy as the (generally cheaper) heavier options. Little luxury items can make a trip feel plush, but every dollar spent might make you a bit more wary to drop your pack and go for that lake swim. Like I said, tradeoffs!</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241865" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p class="p3">You don’t need to spend a ton of money for a good setup. While there’s always another top-of-the-line thing to buy, you can take solace in the fact that better camping gear rarely makes for a more fun time in the outdoors.</p>
<p class="p3">I&#8217;ve found that the best camping trips are the ones where you can completely unplug, so this year&#8217;s outdoor/camping guide is leaning heavier toward low-tech gear.</p>
<p class="p3">Your phone is the perfect camping buddy with tunes, maps and details on the nearest place to snag a six-pack, but it’s also a place where distractions abound and it can be hard to let text and emails go unanswered. My best camping memories are from trips where I was fully present in the area and with the people I was there with … so on a more philosophical note, when it’s an option available to you, the best gift you can get yourself is to leave your phone locked away somewhere safe, silenced and out of reach.</p>
<p class="p3">One final note: You can spend a ton of money on high-end “indestructible” gear, but the best way to help your camping equipment last is to take care of it. Clean your gear when you get home from a trip, keep things packed together so you don’t lose any key parts and take care of small problems before they have the chance to turn into bigger issues.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All but one of the items in this list are new compared to the guide that I made last year, but I&#8217;m still a big fan of all of those products too. So <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/gift-guide-camping-and-backpacking-gear-that-the-outdoors-lover-in-your-life-really-wants/">check that list out as well!</a></p>

<p class="p3">Camping trips are known for many things but good hygiene generally isn’t one of them. Truthfully, most toiletries are optional when it comes to sleeping outside for several days but you can never forget the toothbrush.</p>
<p class="p3">I bought this little travel toothbrush a couple years ago and I’ve been a huge fan of it. It integrates a minitube of toothpaste into the handle and has a little cover to keep things sanitary. I was initially concerned that the little toothpaste containers in the handle would be some proprietary DRM-controlled racket but it’s actually really easy to refill the tube with the big tube in your bathroom.</p>

<p class="p3">Opinel knives have a bit of a cult following, and in a world of over engineered $100+ camping knives with tactical grips, these knives are a nice return to simplicity and are a great (and cheap!) addition to a camping kit. There is always a bigger/better knife for the job, but for people in need of something basic that handles all of their cooking needs, this one gets it done.</p>

<p class="p3">Once safety and shelter are accounted for, there is truly nothing more important to camping than camp coffee. The sun is rising and you&#8217;re getting up much earlier than you would in the real world so you’ve got to kill the grogginess and seize the day. I have had a few setups over the years, but after building up a substantial collection of backpacking gear, my recent go-to has been the Jetboil MiniMo and its add-on French press attachment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">The Jetboil is a mainstay for plenty of backpackers because of the design that basically aims to make the most of the least amount of fuel, leading to very speedy boiling times. The MiniMo is nice because the 1-liter pot part of it is fairly shallow and can be used as a bowl to eat out of without any issues. These are all use cases that are somewhat niche to backpackers traveling alone or in pretty small groups but the Jetboil also comes in some larger sizes.</p>

<p class="p3">When you’re backpacking, having an accessible water source is one of the most critical camper needs. When you’re camping at an established site with consistent water supply, one thing you may wish you had is a large container for water so you’re not left venturing back and forth filling up your water bottle or camping pot.</p>
<p class="p3">I bought the GSI Outdoors Folding Water Cube, which is a pretty easy way to store water for filling up water bottles or doing dishes near your camp. This thing clearly is not designed to take a beating, but unlike other options you can pack it down quite a bit. I wouldn&#8217;t expect to get more than a few trips out of it — but if you’re looking for something a bit tougher and have space to spare, a more rigid container like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IW6JS/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B0002IW6JS&amp;linkId=16eaf2dd5940e14ee05edba0a48403ad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one from Reliance</a> might be a better bet.</p>

<p class="p3">This one might be a surprise, but when you find yourself out in the woods with no cell signal, you often also find that you didn’t have quite as much music downloaded onto Spotify as you had thought. Having a dedicated MP3 player in 2021 may seem about as dumb as it gets, but sometime there’s a peace that comes with bringing a single-purpose tool along for the ride and leaving the multipurpose distraction uncharged and unbothered. Better yet, your iPod — unlike your phone — doesn’t have your entire digital footprint on it so it can stay unlocked and accessible to the entire camp to pick tunes.</p>
<p class="p3">You can, of course, use any MP3 player. I have a very strong nostalgic connection to the iPod and its click wheel. If you’re tempted to just reuse your iPod of yesteryear, be sure you check on the health of its battery; it’s probably in dire need of a replacement, which is pretty hard to do on your own. I recommend searching eBay for a nice refurbished option with a brand new battery.</p>
<p class="p3">If you do go this route, make sure you’re prepared for all it entails, namely digging up your old collection of song files and downloading new tracks you might want, as well as ensuring your camp speaker is also AUX cord-ready.</p>

<h2 class="p3">GoPro Hero10 Black</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2242874" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2242874" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2242874" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hero-10.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="498" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hero-10.jpg 1181w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hero-10.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hero-10.jpg?resize=300,220 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hero-10.jpg?resize=768,563 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hero-10.jpg?resize=680,498 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hero-10.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2242874" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> GoPro</p></div></p>
<p class="p3">In the age of smartphones, dedicated cameras are always luxuries built for niche moments and I can say with absolute certainty that a non-trivial percentage of GoPro owners probably don’t need them … but there are certainly moments when their added durability and portability can make for more memorable videos and snippets of an adventure. They&#8217;re also another great way to leave the phone in the car while still being able to capture some memories!</p>
<p class="p3">The latest GoPro Hero10 Black takes 5.3K video with a streamlined waterproof design that is more powerful than ever. If you have money to spend, go for the latest and greatest version; if you know deep down that this is a device you might only use a few times, the company’s last several generations are worthy companions.</p>
<p class="p3"><strong>Price: </strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09CS9X5F5/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B09CS9X5F5&amp;linkId=9aa6360c369366248766f744b649c3e6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$449 from Amazon</a></p>

<p class="p3">I had the Luci solar string lights on my list last year and they’re still one of my favorite things to bust out at the campsite. I am heavily considering buying the multicolor variety of these lights that are an even more festive way to light up your campsite or tent. Like I said last year, the lights make for a good time not a long time, and I had mixed luck with solar charging. You’ll definitely want to recharge them every couple of days, which might make these less ideal for trips where you don’t have a car charger nearby.</p>

<p class="p3">So-called “roto coolers” are all the rage thanks to Yeti. These coolers are machined to have as few seams as possible for cold air to escape from, meaning these products tend to stay cooler, longer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> The downside? If you&#8217;re used to buying whatever cooler Target has on sale, these might be mind-numbingly expensive. RTIC makes some cheaper ones, but they&#8217;re still way pricier than most people probably spent on their last cooler.</span></p>
<p class="p3">A big shortcoming of these coolers is that as the wall thickness is pretty much the same from model to model smaller versions actually have a pretty minuscule amount of usable space on the inside. In those cases you might be better off going with a conventional cooler … or if you&#8217;ve got money to burn for something arguably over-engineered &#8212; opt for a nice soft cooler. I have plenty of friends with the YETI Hopper BackFlip 24 Cooler, which, at $300, is quite expensive but is a high-quality luxury for a thing meant to keep your food and drinks cold.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The app economy will again set new records in 2021. According to a review of the global app ecosystem in 2021 by Sensor Tower, <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/app-revenue-and-downloads-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released today</a>, first-time app installs grew to 143.6 billion during the year, a half percentage point higher than 2020, but consumer spending in apps is up a much larger 19.7% year over year to reach $133 billion. This includes spending on in-app purchases, premium apps and subscriptions across both the Apple App Store and Google Play, but excludes third-party app stores, like those in China.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244363" style="width: 1460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244363" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2244363 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/global-app-spending-2021.png" alt="" width="1450" height="960" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/global-app-spending-2021.png 1450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/global-app-spending-2021.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/global-app-spending-2021.png?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/global-app-spending-2021.png?resize=768,508 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/global-app-spending-2021.png?resize=680,450 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/global-app-spending-2021.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1450px) 100vw, 1450px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244363" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>This growth is nearly in line with the growth seen in 2020 when consumer spending jumped 21% to reach $111.1 billion, Sensor Tower noted.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244213" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That the growth continued along the same lines this year is notable because, of course, 2020 had seen the world grappling with the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic that forced consumers to work from home, shop online, virtually connect with friends, stream more entertainment content and attend classes online, amid other behavioral shifts. These changes had played out in terms of consumer app usage and spending in 2020. Global app revenue <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/global-app-revenue-jumps-to-50b-in-the-first-half-of-2020-in-part-due-to-covid-19-impacts/">had rocketed to $50 billion</a> during the first half of 2020, in part due to how the pandemic was impacting the world of mobile apps, TechCrunch had reported at the time.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244362" style="width: 2910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244362" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2244362 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/top-apps-revenue-2021.png" alt="" width="2900" height="1728" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/top-apps-revenue-2021.png 2900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/top-apps-revenue-2021.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/top-apps-revenue-2021.png?resize=300,179 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/top-apps-revenue-2021.png?resize=768,458 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/top-apps-revenue-2021.png?resize=680,405 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/top-apps-revenue-2021.png?resize=1536,915 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/top-apps-revenue-2021.png?resize=2048,1220 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/top-apps-revenue-2021.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2900px) 100vw, 2900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244362" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>There were some early signals that these pandemic-driven shifts in consumer spending would outlast the COVID-19 government lockdowns seen in 2020 to continue to impact 2021 mobile trends. In the U.S., for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/u-s-iphone-users-spent-average-of-138-on-apps-in-2020-to-grow-to-180-in-2021/">consumer spending on iPhone apps</a> was on track to reach an average of $180 in 2021, up from $136 last year, the firm had also said. It ended up at $165, we&#8217;re told, however. And consumer spending during the first half of 2021 was already hitting new records, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/consumer-spending-on-apps-hit-record-64-9b-in-first-half-of-2021-but-install-growth-slowed-to-1-7/">a global total of $64.9 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Today, Sensor Tower reports the record $133 billion in global spend includes $85.1 billion in App Store spending, up 17.7% year over year from the $72.3 billion spent in 2020. It also includes $47.9 billion in Google Play consumer spend, up 23.5% from the $38.8 billion spent in 2020. The App Store continues to outpace Google Play with around 1.8 times the revenue, which is in line with previous years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Outside of games, the app to pull in the most global revenue in 2021 was TikTok, including its Chinese counterpart, Douyin. Combined, the different iterations of ByteDance&#8217;s short-form video app passed $2 billion in revenue during the first 11 months of 2021 and is on track to reach $2.3 billion by year-end. That will bring its lifetime total to $3.8 billion.</p>
<p>The app also topped App Store&#8217;s charts in terms of global spending, but on Google Play, TikTok was only the No. 4 app by consumer spending. Google&#8217;s own Google One subscription was No. 1. By the end of this year, Google One will reach $1 billion in consumer spending, up 123% from $448.5 million in 2020.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, global app downloads are beginning to plateau. While overall, the figures inched up 0.5% year over year from 142.9 billion in 2020 to 143.6 billion, this was mainly due to growth in Android app downloads on Google Play. Installs there grew 2.6% year over year to reach 111.3 billion, up from 108.5 billion in 2020.</p>
<p>But Apple&#8217;s App Store saw new app installs drop. This year, downloads will have declined 6.1% from 34.4 billion in 2020 to 32.3 billion, Sensor Tower estimates.</p>
<p>TikTok remained the most-downloaded app with 745.9 million global installs, despite a drop from the 980.7 million installs it saw in 2020. (Apple had also recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/apple-announces-the-2021-app-store-award-winners-and-most-downloaded-apps-of-the-year/">confirmed</a> TikTok was the top U.S. download of the year on its Free iPhone Apps chart, for what it&#8217;s worth.) On Google Play, Facebook topped the charts with 500.9 million installs, demonstrating the social networking app&#8217;s ability to gain traction in a number of emerging markets where Android is more popular. But across both app stores, Facebook will see 624.9 million installs in 2021, down 12% year over year from 707.8 million in 2020.</p>

<p>Mobile games continue to pull in the lions&#8217; share of global app revenue, as in previous years. In 2021, mobile game spending will reach $89.6 billion across the App Store and Google Play, up 12.6% year over year from the $79.6 billion spent in 2020.</p>
<p>But in an ongoing trend, gaming&#8217;s slice of the overall pie is shrinking. In 2019, games accounted for 74.1% of all app spending, which dropped to 71.7% in 2020. This year, they&#8217;ve fallen again, representing just 67.4% of all in-app spending. This shift is due to the rise of subscription-based apps outside of games, and this year, particularly the growth in streaming and Entertainment apps, which have financially benefitted from the pandemic.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244359" style="width: 1460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244359" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2244359 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/global-mobile-game-spending-2021.png" alt="" width="1450" height="960" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/global-mobile-game-spending-2021.png 1450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/global-mobile-game-spending-2021.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/global-mobile-game-spending-2021.png?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/global-mobile-game-spending-2021.png?resize=768,508 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/global-mobile-game-spending-2021.png?resize=680,450 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/global-mobile-game-spending-2021.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1450px) 100vw, 1450px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244359" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>On the App Store, games will account for $52.3 billion in consumer spending this year, up 9.9% from 2020. The gaming market on iOS is led by Tencent&#8217;s Honor of Kings, which generated $2.9 billion on iOS, up 16% from the $2.5 billion it saw last year.</p>
<p>On Google Play, the highest-grossing title is again Moon Active&#8217;s Coin Master, up 13% year over year to reach nearly $912 million. Overall, games on Google Play will generate $37.3 billion in global spending, up 16.6% year over year from $32 billion in 2020.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244358" style="width: 2910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244358" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2244358 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/top-mobile-games-revenue-2021.png" alt="" width="2900" height="1728" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/top-mobile-games-revenue-2021.png 2900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/top-mobile-games-revenue-2021.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/top-mobile-games-revenue-2021.png?resize=300,179 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/top-mobile-games-revenue-2021.png?resize=768,458 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/top-mobile-games-revenue-2021.png?resize=680,405 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/top-mobile-games-revenue-2021.png?resize=1536,915 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/top-mobile-games-revenue-2021.png?resize=2048,1220 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/top-mobile-games-revenue-2021.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2900px) 100vw, 2900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244358" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>Game installs, like the rest of mobile app installs, declined year over year on the App Store, going from 10.1 billion in 2020 to 8.6 billion this year. PUBG Mobile, including the Chinese version Game of Peace, grabbed the most downloads (47.5 million). On Google Play, game installs grew 1.3% from 46.1 billion last year to 46.7 billion this year, with Garena Free Fire pulling in the most downloads (218.8 million).</p>
<p>To some extent, this year&#8217;s trends saw a bit of normalization after an unusual burst of activity in 2020. But other trends have remained the same &#8212; like the shrinking slice of consumer spend attributed to games, for instance, or how Android continually beats iOS on downloads but not on revenue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Facebook transitions its corporate branding and organizes around a &#8220;metaverse&#8221; future, a number of high-profile execs have been leaving the company.</p>
<p>Last week, former Messenger boss and current crypto czar David Marcus announced he was leaving at the end of the year. Today, Meta&#8217;s current chief of the Messenger division Stan Chudnovsky announced he will be leaving Meta &#8220;at some point in Q2 of next year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chudnovsky joined Facebook in early 2015 as head of product for Messenger, later becoming chief of the division in mid-2018. Before joining Facebook, Chudnovsky had co-founded the venture firm NFX and had served as PayPal&#8217;s VP of Growth after the company acquired his software startup IronPearl in 2013.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244239" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;I’ve been working nonstop since I was 16, with about two-week breaks between my projects — always either starting companies, starting a venture fund (NFX) or running companies, merging companies, investing in companies or working at companies,&#8221; Chudnovsky said in his Facebook post announcing his plans. &#8220;I have no plans to retire, but I am looking forward to taking a good, many months long break.&#8221;</p>
<p>After Chudnovsky leaves his role, his colleague<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/loredanacrisan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Loredana Crisan</a> will take over. Crisan joined the Messenger team in 2016 and previously led design at Indiegogo.</p>

<p>Here’s a quick peek at some of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#56c4ffdf-04f9-4404-a33a-522de0e81ba5">the speakers</a> and presentations we have scheduled.

Remember, times listed in the agenda will automatically reflect your specific time zone.</p>
<p><strong>Maneuvering Towards Better In-space Propulsion</strong> — What goes up must come down, but we can delay that second part a bit with better propulsion on our satellites and spacecraft. Accion Systems, Phase Four and Morpheus Space are pushing the boundaries of in-space propulsion. Join the leaders of these companies as they discuss the challenges and opportunities in changing how in-space assets move about.</p>
<p><strong>Space Tourism Takes Off</strong> — Blue Origin’s 2021 included its first trips to space for paying passengers, including company founder Jeff Bezos and TV starship captain William Shatner. Ariane Cornell, the company’s director of Astronaut and Orbital Sales will tell us what it’s like to retail those rides.</p>
<p><strong>The Full-service Space Company</strong> — Rocket Lab’s 2021 saw it enter the public markets, announce brand new spacecraft, acquire companies and more. We’ll talk to Peter Beck about what the one-time dedicated launch company is turning into through all this growth and change.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Taking Earth Observation to Enterprise Scale</strong> — We’re not short of eyes in the sky, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy to collect and use the data that Earth observation networks create. Find out how mapping veteran Esri and startups SkyWatch and Wyvern are building out data infrastructure that makes orbital imagery accessible and profitable.</p>
<p><strong>Time-shifting bonus:</strong> No need to worry about schedule conflicts.
