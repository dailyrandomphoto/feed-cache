					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>daily TechCrunch+ column</em></a><em> where it gets its name. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>What a week, y’all. What a week. Somehow the news is still at it, even if we’re an inch away from the back half of December. So much for a holiday slowdown! Up first, some notes on the week’s key news, then we’re talking vector search and some final book recs. Into the breach!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The end of SPACs as we know them:</strong> It’s a gosh darn dumb idea to spend time calling <em>top</em> on any particular market movement &#8212; it’s a great way to look silly in public. Still, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/09/business/trump-spac-stock.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growing smoke</a> surrounding the Trump Media SPAC has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/the-sec-is-curious-about-trumps-spac-deal/">reached smog levels</a> as the BuzzFeed SPAC deal did everything in its power to fail at the finish line, only to limp public and then shed nearly half its value. Top? Top.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto vs. TradFi: </strong>It’s not my place to get in the middle of religious warfare, but the technology market really does need to decide how to fund and build crypto companies. And the answer probably isn’t venture capital? This week we saw the <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/long-time-lyft-cfo-departs-to-become-cfo-at-nft-marketplace-opensea/">OpenSea IPO expectations</a></strong> met not with warmth by its users, but contempt. Going <em>public?</em> Why not issue a token and stay in the crypto space? Well, because a lot of trad money went into OpenSea, and those investors need to pay back <em>their</em> investors in dollars, not digital duckets. How to solve this? Unclear, but I wonder if, long term, we’ll see crypto companies build entirely off traditional finance rails. Why not?</li>
<li><strong>SaaS multiples: </strong>I am sorry that I did not write this up, but we’ve seen one of the <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1469341159034134528" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sharpest negative movements</a></strong> in software valuations in recent memory recently. Sure, prices are still high but not nearly as much as they were. Watch out, overpriced unicorns.</li>
<li><strong>And, finally, Instacart just lost its president: </strong>Mere months after she joined, <strong><a href="https://t.co/mvO5xymHwg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instacart is shedding a high-profile hire</a></strong>. The Exchange wrote a tiny bit about Instacart back in November, noting reports indicating that Instacart’s growth rate has slammed back to Earth after its pandemic bump moderated. The company <em>is</em> still growing, albeit slowly. Slow growth, however, won’t let the company go public at a price that makes sense. So, what’s ahead? We have no idea.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to get coverage for your company. And, vector search.</h2>
<p>One of the best bits of being a reporter in the technology space is spending time with smart people who can explain the future to you. Not in the <em>soon we’ll be in the metaverse</em> sense, but in the <em>here’s a tech that is going to change the way we handle information in the future</em> sense.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246180" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Enter<a href="https://twitter.com/bobvanluijt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Bob van Luijt</a>, CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://www.semi.technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semi Technologies</a>. The startup is building <a href="https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weaviate</a>. Like with a great many startups today, Semi is a for-profit OSS company. More simply, it is building a business atop an open source project, namely Weaviate.</p>
<p>Bob was kind enough to not only spend a few hours talking me through his company, the market for searching unstructured data and how Weaviate works but also to scrape TechCrunch’s 2021 output and put it into a little GUI so that I could play around with it.</p>
<p>This is a great way to get reporters to care about your company, by the way. Not the scraping work; that was an extra kindness &#8212; but to spend a lot of time answering somewhat silly questions with patience, even when the reporter in question has to retread lots of ground.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">A reallllly underrated skill that some founders have is the capability to teach me stuff with patience</p>
<p>writing about a co later this week because the CEO has spent a good bit of time slowly taking me through a bit of tech I had previously never touched/learned about</p>
<p>&mdash; alex (@alex) <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1466091537339666432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Anyway, vector search. What Weaviate allows for is the searching of unstructured data, quickly. Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-lab-vector-search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says that vector search</a> “uses deep learning models to encode data sets into meaningful vector representations, where distance between vectors represent the similarities between items.”</p>
<p>Bob made this a bit simpler with an example. In a traditional database, you might have data indicating that the Statue of Liberty is in New York City and that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris. But to snag those data points, you’d have to search for something precise. With vector search — via Weaviate or a related software product — you can ask the data to show you what the database has about landmarks in France. And get the Eiffel Tower data to arise.</p>
<p>Neat, right? Very. Tinkering with <a href="https://techcrunch.vectors.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the TechCrunch portal that Bob and his team were kind enough to set up</a>, I was most taken with a question that they suggested: “Who writes the TechCrunch newsletter when Alex Wilhelm is out?” Frankly, this is a fun query due to its imprecision. Which TechCrunch newsletter? And what does <em>out</em> mean? Well, the search results managed to find a bit of text from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/tracking-startup-focus-in-the-latest-y-combinator-cohort/">this very column</a> noting that I was taking a day off and that Anna would be handling the newsletter herself.</p>
<p>Very cool. Semi Technologies is a pretty young company, but one that I am keeping tabs on. For a few reasons, first of which being that open source startups are nearly always more interesting than their closed-code brethren. Mostly because founders building with OSS tech tend to have a slightly less hard-grind approach to business, and because I like Bob.</p>
<p>More to come once I can condense my nearly 3,000 words of spaghetti notes from calls with Semi into something a bit more coherent.</p>

<h2>Book Recs</h2>
<p>After spending quite a lot of time this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/gift-guide-the-best-non-business-books-for-2021-recommended-by-vcs/">working on our two-part</a> venture capital book recommendation list, we’re adding some of our own favorites to the mix. Of course, grains of salt as books are as personal as paintings, but we can’t help but share some of the best stuff that we read this year!</p>
<h3>Some of Anna’s favorite 2021 reads:</h3>
<p><strong>Fiction:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Born-be-Mild-Adventures-Anxious/dp/0751574732" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Born to be Mild: Adventures for the Anxious</strong></a><strong>, by Rob Temple</strong></p>
<p>According to my records, this was the first book I read in 2021, but 12 months on, it really stuck with me. You may know its author, Rob Temple, as the man behind the hilarious social media accounts and book series <a href="https://twitter.com/SoVeryBritish" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Very British Problems</a>. But this book is different. It is an account of his struggle with anxiety and of his attempts to get out of his comfort zone. It is touching, highly relatable and often very funny — if you are a Sue Townsend fan like me, there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;ll love this, too.</p>
<p><strong>Nonfiction:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Numbers-Statistics-Knowing/dp/1474619967" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>How to Read Numbers: A Guide to Statistics in the News (and Knowing When to Trust Them)</strong></a><strong>, by David Chivers and Tom Chivers</strong></p>
<p>This is the book I am reading right now, with the caveat that I am not nearly done yet — but this is very promising. It might add fuel to the media backlash, but it has a point: A lot of the numbers we read about in the news need to be taken carefully. Which makes it a great read for journalists and news readers alike. The more expert readers become at reading numbers, the more sophisticated we will be able to get in our analysis.</p>
<h3>Some of Alex’s favorite 2021 reads:</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Salvation-Novel-Sequence-Book-ebook/dp/B07837SGSY/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+Salvation+Sequence&amp;qid=1639162670&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>The Salvation Sequence</strong></a><strong>, by Peter F. Hamilton</strong></p>
<p>The best science fiction doesn’t simply slap spaceships atop the world we live in and call it a day. Indeed, the best science fiction remolds everything, from economics to humanity to science to physics itself. “The Salvation Sequence” is a series of books I read this year that did just that. From economics and dealing with aliens to what it means to truly be human and future politics, it’s all in there. And it’s a hell of a ride. I can’t wait for the next installment to come out so that I can read the whole damn series again.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Memory-Called-Empire-Arkady-Martine-ebook/dp/B07C7BCB88/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=A+Memory+Called+Empire&amp;qid=1639162683&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>A Memory Called Empire</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Desolation-Called-Peace-Teixcalaan-Book-ebook/dp/B07QPJHNSM/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=A+Desolation+Called+Peace&amp;qid=1639162691&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>A Desolation Called Peace</strong></a><strong>, by Arkady Martine</strong></p>
<p>There is more than one way to draw the future. Martine sketches a future where the concept of civilization and barbarism collide with art and empire. And memory. And hidden technologies and war. It’s more than I can truly describe for you in a short blurb, other than to say that what Martine has managed to build inside her sci-fi universe is nearly more art than science. And that’s high, <em>high</em> praise.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Sun-Between-Earth-Book-ebook/dp/B084G9YRK3/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Black+Sun&amp;qid=1639162699&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Black Sun</strong></a><strong>, by Rebecca Roanhorse</strong></p>
<p>Fantasy novels are far too often rip-offs of European feudal history. Oh your duke is being an ass? Better get the serfs to rebel! That sort of thing. And then there’s Black Sun, which takes fantasy in an entirely different direction. Seemingly inspired by South and Central American traditions, it’s a gosh darn rollercoaster of good. A must read.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Last-Graduate-Novel-Scholomance-Book-ebook/dp/B08K7KY8Q7/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+Last+Graduate&amp;qid=1639162706&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-1"><strong>The Last Graduate</strong></a><strong>, by Naomi Novik</strong></p>
<p>Novik is a damn fine writer. “Uprooted” and “Spinning Silver” both kicked ass. But her masterwork, from my perspective, is “A Deadly Education.” It came out back in late 2020. And thus my countdown to its sequel, “The Last Graduate,” started. Rare is it that I count down the days until a book comes out, but here I had no choice. And “The Last Graduate” was superb. If you want to meet a protagonist unlike any you’ve ever read, and enter a world where everything has teeth, read these books. Read them. You will thank yourself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Safety in modern cars is no longer simply a question of engineering. It&#8217;s a technology and design challenge that is dependent on sensors and software and hinges on a user experience that is clear and intuitive for drivers.</p>
<p>So how does Volvo, a company synonymous with safety, convince customers that it&#8217;s innovative, forward thinking and nimble without dropping its core safety message? The stakes: either Volvo keeps up with the speed of change in this brave new world or it risks its reputation as the automaker most identified with safety.</p>
<p>Hints about how Volvo intends to hit that fast-moving, innovative yet safe sweet spot can be found in its approach towards going public — it&#8217;s taking the traditional IPO path — and its future vehicle plans. In contrast, its spin-off sibling Polestar, is going public via a merger with blank check company and has tried to position itself as a nimble leader in tech and design.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246181" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Polestar&#8217;s approach inadvertently helps distinguish Volvo itself as the more cautionary leader in safety. It also sets up Volvo for differentiation, but with access to the latest innovations proved out on Polestar models.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think what we&#8217;re seeing is a transformation of the industry like we did in the mobile industry some time ago, where new capabilities, new possibilities, new sensors are coming in, so I think it&#8217;s a really interesting area,&#8221; said Thomas Stovicek, head of UX for Volvo. &#8220;At the same time, that can provide a lot of complexity for the user, so when we talk about user experience we very often talk about ease of use for a customer and understanding problems when you put it in the environment in a car.&#8221;</p>
<p>But even a brand considered the vanguard for safety can have setbacks. Modern vehicle safety extends beyond the car to the vast amounts of data required to operate these systems. Volvo announced Friday that some of its research and development data was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/volvo-had-some-rd-data-stolen-in-security-breach/">stolen in a security breach</a>. The company was quick to address safety concerns in a statement, &#8220;Volvo does not see, with currently available information, that this has an impact on the safety or security of its customers&#8217; cars or their personal data.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Olaf versus Elsa</h2>
<p>Polestar charts a different course when it defines corporate identity, Volvo is &#8220;safety and autonomy-centric&#8221; whereas Polestar is &#8220;technology and performance centric.&#8221; Volvo is also &#8220;safe and responsible&#8221; and Polestar is &#8220;sustainable and progressive.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Polestar is cool and minimal; being in a Volvo is more like a warm security blanket. To continue on the Scandinavian metaphor, think about the plot of Frozen: Volvo&#8217;s exudes the comforting allure of Olaf while Polestar is ice-queen trailblazer Elsa.</p>
<p>Volvo&#8217;s strategy has been to proceed with caution, which runs counter to how its sister brand Polestar has evolved.</p>
<p>For instance, even though Volvo was involved in the development of the Android Automotive operating system with Google, the Polestar brand introduced the system first, and subsequently earned headlines like &#8220;<a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a37516315/polestar-2-ev-drive/">Polestar Wants to Make Electric Cars in a Way Volvo Can&#8217;t</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polestar as a newcomer, is still relatively small, selling about 10,000 vehicles a year to Volvo&#8217;s half million, and is looking to make a name for itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Polestar is and will be the technology leader for the larger Group, a Polestar spokesperson wrote in an email. &#8220;A good example already in-market is the Google infotainment system: it debuted on Polestar 2 first; Volvo then followed with XC40 Recharge and now XC60. You&#8217;ll see more of that in the coming years as new technologies roll out &#8212; Polestar first, then Volvo.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2239495" style="width: 4042px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2212.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2239495" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2239495 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2212.jpg" alt="2022 Polestar 2 interior google" width="4032" height="3024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2212.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2212.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2212.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2212.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2212.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2212.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2212.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2212.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2239495" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<h2>Lightening the load</h2>
<p>In contrast to Polestar&#8217;s forward thinking message, when it comes to customer-facing tech, Volvo has shifted the in-car experience to less-is-more. That system is also underpinned by the advent of Android Automotive OS.</p>
<p>Volvo wants the system to lighten the cognitive load on the driver, and employs behavioral psychologists on its research team to understand how information varies from person to person.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think at a high level principle, we&#8217;re trying to simplify that complexity and provide that in a way to users,&#8221; says Stovicek. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot more that can be done. Zero collision is something that we&#8217;re striving for and I think that there&#8217;s a lot of interesting things to do with the new capabilities that are coming in the platforms.&#8221;</p>
<p>That means less dinging, buzzing and distracting notifications, unless used to alert the driver of an emergency. A Volvo spokesperson said, &#8220;It is not about hiding features per se, but it&#8217;s about simplifying the user experience and minimizing distractions for the driver.</p>
<p>Volvo Cars designs and develops everything around the person using it &#8212; not around the technology &#8212; and strives for an as intuitive user experience as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>For years, as screens have crept into cars, automakers threw the kitchen sink into their suite of infotainment control. When Volvo first introduced the XC90, it was among the first group of automakers to make the screen standard using the older Sensus OS. The brand is now working to further distill the information it presents to the driver. They&#8217;ve commissioned NVIDIA to collect anonymized safety data on inputs lidar sensors, radar, and cameras that require graphic processing to improve their understanding.</p>

<p>On a recent drive of the Volvo XC60, I noticed that the infotainment screen was both simplified and brighter than the last generation. I also noticed that the wireless charging system didn&#8217;t readily kick in. I had to open the settings in order to activate it. Less choice on the immediate screen is the antithesis of new cars over the past decade.</p>
<p>For decades, Volvo has doubled down on its reputation for making the safest vehicles on the road. When Volvo makes claims about its safety record, it&#8217;s a reputation that&#8217;s been earned through the company&#8217;s breakthrough R&amp;D.</p>
<p>In 1959, it was seatbelts. In 1972, the rear-facing car seat, followed by a booster seat in 1978. Side impact collision protection was introduced in 1994. Collision avoidance and then pedestrian protection followed in 2008. That same year, Volvo set a goal that no one should be seriously injured in their cars. In 2021, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&#8217;s New Car Assessment Program gave 11 Volvo vehicles a top safety rating.</p>
<h2>Hands free</h2>
<p>What carmakers are up against is the desire of their customers to effectively override their onboard system using the least safe aspect of driving: personal smartphones. Volvo is prioritizing ways to keep the devices out of consumers hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Users were using their mobile phone in order to achieve certain functionality that we were not providing in the car and that created an unsafe like environment and we wanted to avoid that,&#8221; said Annika Adolfsson, assistant head of UX &amp; Event at Design Volvo Cars.</p>
<p>This solution was built into the Android Automotive architecture to accommodate third party apps and a platform that would be safe to use while driving.</p>
<p>Volvo worked with the Android, Google Maps, Google Assistant and Google Play Stories teams, and the results show up in a simple, clean experience. &#8220;What is more interesting in the products we have developed is that it&#8217;s a platform that will live for a long time, Adolfsson says.</p>
<p>Volvo is also addressing the future safety by intervening as soon as the driver gets in the vehicle.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have tried to think about how this experience of someone coming into the car for the first time and how can we help them,&#8221; Adolfsson said. &#8220;In our previous cars, you had to go and find the settings.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Safety first</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2246339" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Volvo_S90_Small_Overlap_Crash_Test.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246339" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2246339 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Volvo_S90_Small_Overlap_Crash_Test.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Volvo_S90_Small_Overlap_Crash_Test.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Volvo_S90_Small_Overlap_Crash_Test.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Volvo_S90_Small_Overlap_Crash_Test.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Volvo_S90_Small_Overlap_Crash_Test.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Volvo_S90_Small_Overlap_Crash_Test.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Volvo_S90_Small_Overlap_Crash_Test.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Volvo_S90_Small_Overlap_Crash_Test.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2246339" class="wp-caption-text">Volvo S90 Small Overlap Crash Test <strong>Image credit</strong>: Volvo</p></div></p>
<p>Far too often, examples appear that show safety and technology advancement are not always congruous, especially when human judgment is involved.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where things get sticky. Search &#8220;Tesla and self-driving accident.&#8221; Despite Tesla&#8217;s reputation for taking chances, it hasn&#8217;t dinged the company&#8217;s astronomical value. (It&#8217;s worth adding that Tesla still earns high marks on Model 3 crash safety.)</p>
<p>Tesla and Volvo, like all automakers, are in a sprint to incorporate more ADAS functionality into future products to be on the cutting edge. But the integration of new technology isn&#8217;t always aligned with consumer trust, and a general sense of feeling safe.</p>
<p>Only one in 10 drivers would feel comfortable in a fully autonomous vehicle, according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/widespread-av-adoption-starts-with-driver-assistance-systems-consumers-can-trust/">recent study by AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://group.volvocars.com/company/innovation/autonomous-drive">On its website</a>, Volvo says &#8220;Recent consumer surveys show that Volvo is the car maker most trusted to safely introduce autonomy.&#8221; The company writes that its a few years away from a fully autonomous vehicle.</p>
<p>What Volvo is betting on is that it can convince its customers it can be both early to self-driving systems and safer than ever, all while it also convinces consumers that it can be a premier electric vehicle maker. To get there, it&#8217;s proceeding with caution for good reason.</p>
<p>Of course, this thinking begs the question: why does technology that will ultimately make roads safer have to be called tech first? It&#8217;s an interesting conundrum on what it means to play it safe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Taylor Swift has impeccable timing. First, she released “Red,” an album about heartbreak and hurt, while I was in the thick of high school. My now-retired Tumblr is still thankful. More recently, Swift took on a project to rerecord her earlier albums, reclaiming her music from her old record label &#8212; this time with her own ownership as a key difference. Her first rerecording, of “Fearless” &#8212; annotated with “(Taylor’s Version)” &#8212; came out this year.</p>
<p>Of course, I think there’s a pretty obvious tech angle here. Swift made a statement on artist empowerment and the importance of singer-owned music &#8212; record labels be damned &#8212; the same year that we saw tech defined by the Great Resignation, emerging entrepreneurs and distributed work. Like Swift, I think the tech scene is going through an uncomfortable period of changing their minds, questioning authority and getting closer to self-advocacy as a result.</p>
<p>Looking back, I unlearned a lot about startups this year, especially when it comes to due diligence, formalization and what it means to be contrarian.</p>
<h2>Due diligence is a differentiator</h2>
<p>When Spark Capital decided to “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/">sever all ties</a>” with David Dobrik’s Dispo app weeks after leading a deal in the company, I immediately thought that it would set precedent across the venture capital industry. The move was triggered by a Business Insider investigation that exposed allegations from a woman who said that a member of Dobrik’s Vlog Squad sexually assaulted her.</p>
<p>In some ways, I was right: Unshackled Ventures and Seven Seven Six <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/early-investors-in-dispo-to-donate-any-profits-from-the-photo-sharing-app/">chose to step away</a> from the company as well, donating any profits from their respective investments to organizations focused on survivors of sexual assault. In other ways, I was not. It’s clear that there continues to be a disconnect between <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/27/y-combinator-demo-day-dispo-due-diligence/">what happened with Dispo and the world of fast-moving due diligence.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford plans to increase production of the all-electric Mustang Mach E next year with the goal of tripling its current capacity by 2023 to meet &#8220;incredible demand,&#8221; CEO Jim Farley tweeted late Friday.</p>
<p>This is the first time the automaker has provided specific outlook for the Mustang Mach E.</p>
<p>Ford said in November that it would increase its production capacity of electric vehicles to 600,000 units globally by 2023 — a goal that would be spread across the Mustang Mach E, F-150 Lightning and commercial E-transit vans. If Ford hits that 600,000 figure it would double the number it had expected to produce over the next two years.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246304" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The tweet from Farley reads: &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to produce Mustang Mach Es fast enough to meet the incredible demand, but we are sure going to try. So starting in 2022 we are increasing production and expect to reach 200,000+ units per year for North America and Europe by 2023. That&#8217;s 3X our 2021 output.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ford confirmed to TechCrunch that it will be able to increase production capacity of the Mustang Mach E by building some of the vehicles at its factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico.</p>
<p>The tweet came the same day that <a href="https://www.autonews.com/cars-concepts/ford-delays-explorer-aviator-evs-boost-mustang-mach-e-output" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automotive News reported</a> Ford was delaying the start of production of battery-electric versions of the Explorer and Lincoln Aviator crossovers by about 18 months, according to memos sent to suppliers and viewed by Automotive News. The EV versions of the Explorer and Aviator were supposed to be assembled at its Cuautitlan, Mexico factory.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Ford has previously said it expected sales to be around 50,000 Mustang Mach E vehicles for the first year of production (MY 2021) in North America and Europe. Ford has sold <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/dam/fordmedia/Europe/en/2021/10/Sales/FoE-Q3-2021-salesTables_EU.pdf">15,602 Mach Es</a> in Europe through the end of the third quarter and 24,791 through end of November <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/dam/fordmedia/North%20America/US/2021/12/02/ford-sales-21-november.pdf">in the U.S.</a>, according to the company&#8217;s latest sales data. At 40,393 vehicles to date, the company should hit its 50,000 sales goal.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for December 10, 2021! Yes, it is Friday at last, which means we’re about one week away from news grinding to a halt so that we can all enter nerd hibernation for two weeks. <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1469393611083194371">Not that your humble servant is counting down</a>. Still, we have a really solid mix of tech news today, featuring companies big and small. To work! —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-steps-back-as-employees-detail-how-he-led-by-fear/"><strong>Better.com CEO gets the (partial) boot:</strong></a> It’s rare that a tech exec goes viral. Mark Zuckerberg has managed thanks to some of his more stilted attempts at engaging with regulars. But most tech denizens just aren’t pop culture figures. Until they are, of course. Such is the case with Better.com’s CEO, who went viral — everywhere, including TikTok — for callously firing a bunch of his staff via Zoom. Anyway, it turns out that he’s not a lovely person the rest of the time either and is now stepping back from his company.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/5-things-you-may-have-missed-in-atomicos-2021-europe-report/"><strong>Europe’s tech boom set to continue:</strong></a> The Exchange crew spent a good chunk of this Friday parsing the latest Atomic-Dealroom report on the European startup scene. Our takeaway was that while 2021 was a wildly good year for EU startups, the best could be just ahead, in calendar terms.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/flink-the-berlin-based-instant-grocery-startup-is-now-valued-at-2-85b-after-raising-750m-in-a-round-led-by-doordash/"><strong>Hungry? Just Flink it:</strong></a><strong> </strong>OK so it turns out that turning startup name “Flink” into a verb is a bit awkward, but with the German instant grocery delivery service raising three-quarters of a billion dollars in a single go — pushing its valuation to $2.85 billion — it seems fair to expect that the Berlin-based company wants to reach verb status at least in its home market.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>The 2021 IPO cycle is coming to a close, with just Samsara’s debut yet to come by our reckoning. So <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/nubank-hashicorp-provide-startup-market-with-end-of-year-ipo-wins/">what should we make of HashiCorp’s and Nubank’s pair of public offerings that touched down this week</a>? That the market for both OSS and fintech remains more than attractive enough to defend unicorn valuations.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246208" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/renttherunway-style-uk-fashion-rental-marketplace-hurr-raises-5-4m-round-led-by-octopus/"><strong>HURR wants to iterate on the Rent the Runway model:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Rent the Runway’s IPO showed that the innovative business was struggling to cover its own operating costs. It has since stumbled as a public business. But that’s not stopping HURR, a British comp to the U.S. fashion rental giant. However, as TechCrunch noted in a bulletin regarding the company’s recent $5.4 million seed round, it has a few business model tweaks and additions that could prove material.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/wisdom-seed/"><strong>Wisdom sounds pretty neat:</strong></a> Wisdom is a startup that, per TechCrunch reporting, has built a “social audio app that’s focused on surfacing ‘life advice’ and broadening access to mentorship.” It sounds a bit like the Equity podcast, and by <em>like</em> we mean the <em>complete opposite</em>. Jokes aside, Wisdom just raised $2 million more. It declined to share user numbers, instead offering up the community-adjusted EBITDA of audio startup metrics, namely that “mentors on its platform have shared some 600,000 minutes” of audio. Cool?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/nuvocargo-raises-20-5m-at-a-180m-valuation-to-bolster-trade-between-the-us-and-mexico/"><strong>Startup raises from Tiger, doubles valuation, didn’t even need the cash:</strong></a> I think that we could recycle that teaser line daily in this newsletter and not really ever miss. Still, today’s Tiger round is Nuvocargo, a Latin American logistics startup that is focused on facilitating cross-border trade. Its new $20.5 million round more than doubled its valuation to $180 million, up from $70 million earlier this year. “The company says it still had most of that cash in the bank when Tiger approached it,” TechCrunch notes.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/tiggy-ready-to-take-on-canadian-food-delivery-incumbents-with-15-minute-option/"><strong>Everyone is building dark stores:</strong></a> The dark-store model for building rapid-delivery businesses is more than just a European project. Tiggy, a Canadian startup, just raised a $6.35 million round for its work.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/breakout-ventures-has-a-new-112-5-million-fund-backed-by-tony-fadell-chris-sacca-and-others/"><strong>Breakout Ventures makes it to fund two:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the word from our own Connie Loizos. Fund II from Breakout is a $112.5 million vehicle, including money from the Thiel Foundation, oddly enough. Thiel money recycling in tech has struck us as odd ever since we realized he was <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22332045/peter-thiel-jd-vance-ohio-senate-donation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funding a political candidate busy attacking tech companies</a>.</li>
<li>And in case you need to have a little fun, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/your-local-trucker-is-giving-us-creator-economy-vibes/">here’s a fast-paced Equity episode with Natasha and Mary Ann</a>.</li>

<p>Since the pandemic began, the rules of the game for growth marketing have changed considerably.</p>
<p>Consumers are embracing Apple’s iOS 14.5’s privacy changes, regulators are taking a greater interest in browser cookies, and The Great Resignation are just a few X factors, but there are many others.</p>
<p>“What worked yesterday may not work today and likely won’t work tomorrow,” writes Jonathan Metrick, chief growth officer at Sagard &amp; Portage Ventures, and Simon Lejeune, user acquisition lead at Wealthsimple.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch Experts returns with predictions for 2022, insights on product-led growth and strategies for early-stage startups that hope to expand internationally.</p>
<p>Jonathan Metrick, chief growth officer at Sagard &amp; Portage Ventures, and Simon Lejeune, who leads user acquisition at Wealthsimple, shared three trends that they believe will shape marketing in 2022. With an eye on topics like privacy, growth hacking and influencer marketing, they wrote about the shifts they&#8217;re expecting in the upcoming year.</p>
<p>Kerry Cunningham, senior principal at 6sense, updated a model that he and his former colleagues named the &#8220;Intent Data Framework (IDF).&#8221; Last year, he revised it to include &#8220;Buyer Signals Framework (BSF),&#8221; but she has reworked it again to include product-led growth.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245396" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Marjorie Radlo-Zandi, a seasoned entrepreneur, board member, mentor and angel investor, shared strategies founders can use when expanding internationally. From researching your market to setting goals, she covers it all and provides several examples.</p>
<h2>Software consulting</h2>
<p>(TechCrunch) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/from-ph-d-to-boutique-software-developer-an-interview-with-solweys-andrew-drach/">From Ph.D. to boutique software developer: An interview with Solwey’s Andrew Drach</a>: Anna Heim interviewed Andrew Drach, a software development consultant who was widely recommended by respondents in a recent survey. Drach, who operates Solwey Consulting and Callentis Consulting Group with his wife Monika, spoke about how his academic background informs his work and why he preferred a boutique model when it comes servicing clients,</p>
<blockquote><p>We both had strained experiences working with large agencies and staffing agencies and feeling abandoned or not important enough to have the full attention of the managers or project owners. Furthermore, we both had seen firsthand how terrifyingly crippling waterfall and broken agile could be for the progress of a project. So we set out to build Solwey and Callentis as small-by-design agencies. We directly engage with our clients, and Monika and I take personal responsibility for every single deliverable from our team.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Growth marketing</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/product-led-growth-and-signal-substitution-syndrome-bringing-it-all-together/">(TechCrunch+) Product-led growth and signal substitution syndrome: Bringing it all together:</a> Touching on the importance of product-led growth, Cunningham says traditional means of determining potential buyer interest are notoriously unreliable. Instead of relying on one signal such as a verbal expression of intent, &#8220;the best way to use them is to throw them into the algorithmic blender with all the other signals that are available to identify patterns that can help prioritize sales efforts.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/4-key-strategies-for-succeeding-at-international-expansion/">(TechCrunch+) 4 key strategies for succeeding at international expansion:</a> We&#8217;ll give you part of one key strategy that&#8217;s behind the paywall: &#8220;In order to achieve international growth, you need to plan based on ROI estimates,&#8221; Radlo-Zandi writes. &#8220;Narrow down the markets for the first phase of global growth by determining which is most viable and sizable for what you offer. Assess how easy or difficult it will be to enter a particular market, and whether its size justifies the effort it will take to establish a solid footprint.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/3-disruptive-trends-that-will-shape-marketing-in-2022/">(TechCrunch+) 3 disruptive trends that will shape marketing in 2022:</a> When making predictions for 2022, Metrick and Lejeune looked back at three trends that drove growth in 2021:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less data, more privacy and the return of growth hacking.</li>
<li>TikTok, influencers and the dominance of native creative.</li>
<li>The Great Resignation and the Gettysburg for growth talent.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;This year has firmly illustrated that there will be no return to a predictable past,&#8221; they write. &#8220;2022 will reward marketers who look ahead with agility and are open to combining historical data with experimentation to chart a new path forward.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The fact that the Bay Area's share of startup funding is shrinking shouldn't be cause for alarm — it's good news for the entire country.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Detroit became the center of America&#8217;s automobile industry largely for logistical reasons: its midwestern location, high population density and proximity to raw materials were just a few factors that assured investors it was an optimal spot for building an industrial hub.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley&#8217;s tech ecosystem, on the other hand, was initially seeded by military research and a surge in college admissions after the Second World War that fostered a community of technologists and investors.</p>
<p>But those aren&#8217;t permanent geographic traits like being close to ports or large deposits of iron and copper ore.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246153" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Decades after Palo Alto&#8217;s first garage startup, talent and capital has become more evenly distributed: This year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/silicon-valleys-share-of-us-vc-funding-falls-to-lowest-level-in-more-than-a-decade/">Bay Area startups only attracted 27% of all U.S. seed- and early-stage venture dollars</a>.</p>

<hr />
<p>“It’s been more than 10 years since that percentage fell below 30%,” reports Mary Ann Azevedo, who analyzed “Beyond Silicon Valley,” a report released by investment firm Revolution and PitchBook.</p>
<p>She identified several factors pushing investors in major tech hubs to venture outside their own backyards in search of opportunities. Many readers may be surprised to learn which city is now the top destination for dollars from NYC and SF-based investors.</p>
<p>“This momentum we’re seeing now? You ain’t seen nothing yet,” said Revolution founder and CEO Steve Case.</p>
<p>Some might think &#8220;Silicon Valley’s share of US VC funding falls to lowest level in more than a decade&#8221; is a scary headline, but from my perspective as a resident, it&#8217;s great news. The San Francisco Bay Area has received tremendous benefits from making itself a magnet for technology talent and money, but it&#8217;s also had unintended impacts on the region&#8217;s infrastructure, housing and income inequality.</p>
<p>I mean, we have the best food and weather, but we certainly haven&#8217;t cornered the market on good ideas. If more people are starting up in cities like Cincinnati, Portland and Buffalo, not only will those communities benefit directly, we&#8217;ll also see new products and services that reflect a greater diversity of thought and location.</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading, and I hope you have a great weekend.</p>

<p>A marketer is one of a startup&#8217;s most important first hires, but finding out just who your end users are and what they want from your product is even more important.</p>
<p>“You must first get to know your potential customer and what is going on in their life that will ultimately trigger them into using you,” writes Lucy Heskins, an early-stage startup marketing adviser.</p>
<p>Heskins shares three key questions that will help you better understand target customers, along with recommendations for how to apply the data you&#8217;ll gather in future marketing campaigns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why would a customer subscribe to your product?</li>
<li>What triggers your customer to decide your product is the one?</li>
<li>Who else are you competing against?</li>
</ul>

<p>Investment management is one of a few industries where a manager’s win comes at another’s loss, writes Versatile VC founder David Teten and Katina Stefanova, CIO and CEO of Marto Capital.</p>
<p>“If you eat a great steak dinner, it doesn’t imply that others have to eat hot dogs. In asset management, each new money manager who generates alpha (returns above the passive benchmark performance) does so at the expense of other managers who underperform.”</p>
<p>In the first post in a series that examines investment management, Teten and Stefanova give us a look at the current state of the industry and explain why it is primed for disruption.</p>

<p>In his latest guest post for TechCrunch+, OpenView partner Kyle Poyar explains why usage-based pricing “is a company-wide effort” that “requires ditching the old SaaS metrics playbook.”</p>
<p>It’s no fad: UBP went mainstream because SaaS companies that use it see dramatically higher growth and retention rates.</p>
<p>Citing examples from powerhouses like Twilio, Stripe, AWS and others, Poyar explains how UBP companies “share their customers’ success” and reduce their risk of ending up with a CRM packed “with lots of unprofitable customers.”</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Venture capitalists frequently say that valuing startups is “more art than science.” If that’s true, then it’s absurdist art, because most seed-stage businesses have no value.</p>
<p>In fact, seed-stage startups — companies that have not yet released a product, regardless of how many rounds they’ve raised — are probably worth less than zero using any rational valuation methodology. The only certainty at this stage is that the startup will keep losing more money until a product is released, at which point it’s <em>possible</em> that revenue may be generated. The chances of going out of business are high.</p>
<p>It’s not that much better for early-stage startups, which again, are not defined by rounds like Series A or Series B, but by how much <em>business progress </em>they’ve made. Once a seed-stage company has released a working product, the startup has reduced one of the two major risks facing the business: commercialization. At this stage, now a company must prove the new product or service can be turned into a scalable business.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246103" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Like seed-stage startups, early-stage companies are still very fragile, with little predictability of revenue or cash flows. By definition, once the business has become predictable, the company is in the growth or expansion stage. Without predictability, traditional valuation tools like discounted cash flow (DCF) are nearly useless.</p>
<p>So venture capitalists lie to entrepreneurs and pretend that seed- and early-stage startups have intrinsic value.</p>
<p>Why would investors agree to ascribe value to assets that have no objective current economic value?</p>
<p>I’ve heard many corporate executives ask this exact question, <a href="https://medium.com/touchdownvc/why-corporations-should-invest-in-startups-not-just-buy-them-196299d2438b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wondering whether it wouldn’t be better simply to acquire startups instead of funding them</a>, usually in hopes that rational valuation techniques can be applied.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The best answer, based on my experience as a venture capitalist and entrepreneur for three decades, has nothing to do with valuation methodology and everything to do with teamwork, belief and commitment. Investors <em>must</em> be on the same team as the entrepreneurs they fund. And this means that each party needs an opportunity to win and must demonstrate that they believe in common goals. In venture capital, where <a href="https://medium.com/touchdownvc/grow-to-win-aded51a06526" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investors rely on high growth rates</a>, a “win-win” compensation design is much more important than a “technically correct” valuation.</p>
<p>At the seed stage, where the value is arguably zero, investors would own all of the startup with an investment of any amount. Obviously, no entrepreneur would willingly accept such an arrangement.</p>
<p>Thus, to be fair to the entrepreneur, the lie is born. We pretend the startup has value so that the startup’s team is motivated and everyone involved has a chance to win. The VC also won’t take a majority of the startup in most cases, because a control position means the entrepreneur is “working for” the investors. The philosophy of venture capital is that the entrepreneur runs the business and the investor provides capital and support in exchange for a minority share and a non-operational role.</p>
<p>I learned this from Bill Draper, who was one of the first venture capitalists on the West Coast in the 1960s. He said that in those early days, the goal was just to keep it simple, in contrast to the “financial engineering” that typified growth-stage investing on the East Coast.</p>
<p>His mantra back then was “half for the entrepreneur and half for the investors.” When investors realized that employees need motivation too, this became a third for the entrepreneur, a third for the investors and a third for employees. It’s not dramatically different today.</p>
<p>So if this is true, is there any role for valuation discipline at the seed or early stage?</p>
<p>The answer is yes, because the investor still needs to evaluate the deal as a potential source of return against other alternative investment opportunities, so long as the resulting valuation is fair to the entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>In fact, a good analogy for how this works may come from real estate. Prior to becoming a venture capitalist in 1992, I worked as a real estate appraiser. Appraisers use three main methodologies when valuing a property: intrinsic value, income-producing value and market value.</p>
<p>Intrinsic value is often called “replacement cost” in real estate. It’s what it would cost to buy a similar parcel of land and rebuild the same house from scratch, estimating the cost of labor and materials. In real estate appraising, this method carries almost no weight, just as in venture capital.</p>
<p>The income method in real estate applies to properties that produce predictable cash flow, like apartment buildings or established rental properties. For obvious reasons, this method is impossible to apply to seed- and early-stage startups where there is no profit and nothing is predictable except for expenses. This is why DCF isn’t used to value startups.</p>
<p>The dominant valuation technique used in real estate appraisals is the third methodology, market value. This approach seeks to understand how the market values similar assets, as defined by location, style, square footage and transaction recency. In other words, what have other buyers demonstrated they will pay for similar houses in the same neighborhood during the last six months?</p>
<p>Real estate appraisers use comparable sales to determine an adjusted price per square foot as the principal basis for calculating valuations when applying the market value method.</p>
<p>Venture capitalists do something very similar. There are clear valuation ranges for startups by stage and by round, which represent an established market value. These figures are even published by PitchBook, CB Insights and other organizations that track startup investment activity.</p>
<p>VCs then look for comparable sales in the exit values of startups with similar business models in the same industry, measuring price-to-revenue for M&amp;A and IPOs. We then apply these multiples to projections of future revenues to determine if we can achieve a “risk-adjusted” multiple at today’s market price.</p>
<p>For a venture capitalist, it doesn’t matter if a startup has an intrinsic value of zero today if there’s a reasonable chance to make 10x our money or better. It’s the potential multiple that matters, not whether we can apply traditional finance metrics to a startup.</p>
<p>This is completely different than how valuations are typically calculated when making an acquisition, creating potential confusion for corporate development personnel who’ve added venture capital investing as a new responsibility.</p>
<p>When a corporation makes acquisitions, each transaction must make independent financial sense. Venture capitalists, however, can accept the risk of seed- and early-stage startups — including a rational expectation of experiencing some failures — by taking a portfolio approach. VC investors don’t require a fixed or predictable return but seek a blended return on a pool of capital that is invested in multiple startups. According to PitchBook, the average VC fund has 18.4 portfolio companies and top-quartile performance has generally corresponded to returning approximately 2x aggregate committed capital over the last few decades.</p>
<p>All that’s required to justify a seed- or early-stage investment is to believe that the potential multiple on investment offsets the risk that capital may not be returned. This is based on the premise that the most VCs can lose is 1x their money &#8212; and the most they can make is unlimited. Of course, <a href="https://avc.com/2021/11/seed-rounds-at-100mm-post-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investors need to be rational about whether the potential multiple is realistic and worth the risk</a>, investor Fred Wilson noted.</p>
<p>And this means venture capitalists are free to participate in the fiction about what seed- and early-stage startups are worth today. The real purpose of valuations at this stage is to find a split that is fair and motivational for everyone involved.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Where is Silicon Valley, really?</p>
<p>In 2021, it&#8217;s no longer a Bay Area hub backed by Sand Hill Road investors — it&#8217;s everywhere. The decentralization of capital to emerging ecosystems has done more than empower local entrepreneurs to raise that follow-on round, it&#8217;s also changed our work as journalists.</p>
<p>After Mary Ann published <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/silicon-valleys-share-of-us-vc-funding-falls-to-lowest-level-in-more-than-a-decade/">an exclusive look at how fundraising is moving beyond Silicon Valley</a>, we decided to unpack our views on the trend&#8217;s long-term impact. Mary Ann followed up her reporting with a few thoughts about how the rise of startup hubs across America is hardly new and certainly nothing to be afraid of. Natasha and Alex dug into data-focused reporting, a key plank of the startup journalism game that is evolving as the market matures. What can we say, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/your-local-trucker-is-giving-us-creator-economy-vibes/">the Equity team can&#8217;t stop talking! </a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natasha</a>: Funding data doesn&#8217;t matter the way it used to.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Ann</a>: The decentralization of startups isn&#8217;t new, even if it is accelerating.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a>: The declining impact of aggregated startup funding data is good news.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Natasha: Funding data doesn’t matter the way it used to</h2>
<p>I’m going to go out on a limb here and say that, in a world of fast-moving deals and the end of HQs, startup geography data has never mattered less.</p>
<p>Now that you’re paying attention, I’m going to slightly hedge that and say that this somewhat controversial mindset doesn’t include emerging markets. For the longest time, startup data helped us understand how an entrepreneurial scene was growing. The concentration of capital in late-stage deals, for example, would show that the winners are winning but perhaps at the cost of smaller upstarts. A thriving angel scene would let us know that pre-seed startups are going to enjoy a boost of activation energy.</p>
<p>But what happens when the bounds of traditional geography goes away? You can be a startup based in Boston, but where do the concentration of your employees live? Where do your investors live? You may have answers, but maybe they will only be correct for the month.</p>
<p>Digital nomads aside, my point is that distributed work’s popularization clouds a little bit of our classic &#8220;local startup&#8221; news coverage. Detroit’s scene may be booming, but thanks to a nod from Miami and a wire from Boston. I think this means that our data needs to focus more on networks than ever before, understanding — at an aggregate level — how a startup&#8217;s success has a ripple effect across other communities. In other words, Duolingo&#8217;s public debut may have benefitted Pittsburgh&#8217;s local startup scene, but what if the company&#8217;s growth will now only look international? That&#8217;s a hypothetical, but I think we&#8217;ll need to ask deeper questions of funding data and ground-level wins.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA["In my opinion, the word ‘agile’ has been loosely applied to many different approaches and strategies to manage projects so the discussion of ‘fake’ versus ‘real’ agile is tricky without a specific context or example."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Software consultant Andrew Drach&#8217;s two companies <a href="https://callentis.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Callentis</a> and <a href="https://www.solwey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solwey</a> demonstrate his entrepreneurial skills, but his clients also value his educational background, as we learned through TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey to identify the best software consultants for startups</a>.</p>
<p>Telling us why her company picked Solwey, eDiscovery Assistant&#8217;s Kelly Twigger cited &#8220;Andrew&#8217;s Ph.D. and analytical background related to data,&#8221; as well as the consulting expertise for startups that he provides.</p>
<p>Expertise is only useful when it&#8217;s implemented, though — and Solwey does this too, Twigger said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t just add tasks to a Trello board for them to complete, we discuss the goals, why and how best to achieve them with cost/benefit analysis in mind.&#8221; This point was seconded by other survey respondents, so we reached out to Drach and his team to learn more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245713" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit about your recent background and current companies?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Drach:</strong> I have been doing consulting in engineering and software on and off pretty much ever since I started coding. And after a few years working in academia, I realized that I did not want to go the tenure-track faculty route. I told my wife [Monika Jociunaite] that as much as I was passionate about science, I had decided to leave academia and grow freelance consulting into an agency and that she should join me.</p>
<p>Monika was a perfect co-founder with complementary experience and skill set. Her background includes two master’s degrees — in international business and marketing — and she spent 5+ years working in large international corporations. She was curious to explore a more creative side of marketing as she enjoyed working on UX/UI projects in the past; and I knew firsthand that for the end users, high-quality code without good UX/UI is no different from broken code.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In December of 2016, Monika and I established two sister companies: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/solwey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solwey Consulting</a>, focused on technology strategy and execution, UX/UI design and business intelligence; and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/callentis-cg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Callentis Consulting Group</a>, a research and development business focused on translational research and technology transfer from academia to industry practice.</p>
<p>More specifically, Solwey provides consulting in all stages of software design and development strategy and execution. We work with our clients on architecture and infrastructure design, optimization of UX/UI design and user flows, back-end and front-end software development for web and mobile, and business intelligence/data analytics to enable our clients to rapidly grow and move forward.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose the boutique consultancy model?</strong></p>
<p>We both had strained experiences working with large agencies and staffing agencies and feeling abandoned or not important enough to have the full attention of the managers or project owners. Furthermore, we both had seen firsthand how terrifyingly crippling waterfall and broken agile could be for the progress of a project. So we set out to build Solwey and Callentis as small-by-design agencies. We directly engage with our clients, and Monika and I take personal responsibility for every single deliverable from our team.</p>
<p><strong>How is your team structured?</strong></p>
<p>We wanted to build a virtual-first, remote-first agency from day one. While it seemed unconventional in pre-pandemic days, this allowed us to stay as lean as the best startups out there, while drastically improving our hiring prospects. We have been incredibly lucky with the talent that joined our team and to celebrate several of our employees&#8217; fourth anniversary while being just a five-year-old agency.</p>
<p>Currently, we have eight full-time developers, a DevOps manager and our Chief Operating Officer Nima [Kargah-Ostadi] who has a Ph.D. in engineering with a decade of experience leading engineering and research teams and is a certified Project Management Professional (PMP).</p>
<p><strong>How have you been finding clients?</strong></p>
<p>When we started, I just googled platforms for remote contracts for software developers and registered on a few of them. In a couple of days, we had already got a contract, so we immediately got hooked on the freelancing platforms; Upwork was a primary source of projects because it was so quick to find a contract there. But over time as we grew and increased the rates and team size, Upwork became less of a fit for us. Nowadays, we get referrals from former clients, new contracts from returning clients, quite a few requests from organic and paid search, and listings on B2B platforms like Clutch.</p>
<p>My focus in 2021 has been on diversifying our source of leads and we have been experimenting with many different approaches. So far, the least successful has been hiring business development reps and trying out cold outreach (emails and LinkedIn) but maybe we were just doing it wrong. On the other side of the spectrum, we have had great success establishing partnerships with VC funds and marketing agencies. Other approaches (social media, paid ads, content marketing, networking) also provided interesting results.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best software consultants for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Are startups your main clients, and what do they require? </strong></p>
<p>60% to 70% of our clients are startups or small companies at various stages. We have helped startups at pre-seed stage to create prototypes and guide their technology development plans. At seed stage, we work with them to develop their minimum viable product (MVP), and in subsequent stages, we get to help them with some of their many newly formed initiatives.</p>
<p>Some of these companies approach us before even having a technology team, some are starting to hire and grow their development team, and some have a fully staffed technology team that is swamped with existing work and cannot take on more initiatives.</p>
<p>We always strive to help startups hire and complete their technology team, especially if they have an idea that revolves around technology. In fact, I have served as interim chief technology officer (CTO) for three startups.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you think architecture design advice is important?</strong></p>
<p>Early-stage clients are typically focused on their MVP and launch schedules. Too often, we need to walk this delicate path of helping them move as fast as possible to beat the competition and impress their investors, while at the same time try to stop them from rushing into architectural or strategy decisions that could come back to bite them hard when it is time to enhance some features, add new functionality, iterate or aggressively scale. Meanwhile, we are doing our best to provide guidance, prevent some common issues and explain why early investments in architecture or formal operational processes would help in the near future.</p>
<p>We tend to focus our recommendations on the time span of roughly six to 12 months so that we do not get stuck with premature optimization. A custom-tailored architectural design allows for a more efficient development process, fast iteration and gets to the robust and scalable software solution leaner and with fewer bumps along the way.</p>
<p><strong>What is your billing model? </strong></p>
<p>Monika and I strongly believe that transparency and easy-to-understand billing have helped us a lot in building trust and strong relationships with our clients. We use a project-based billing model with a flat hourly rate.</p>
<p>During the preliminary diagnostic conversations with our prospective clients, we try to understand their priorities and carve out a reasonable scope for projects divided into stepwise phases. Nima and I then put together a Gantt chart to visualize a realistic schedule of tasks and estimate the number of hours it would take to design, develop, test and deploy the anticipated solution given client and resource conditions. The proposed budget is simply this number of hours multiplied by our hourly flat rate, which includes all overhead costs.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your typical timeline?</strong></p>
<p>For a typical startup product that is at initial phases of developing an MVP, we typically recommend two weeks for discovery and requirements gathering, four weeks for UX/UI design along with infrastructure and architecture design, eight weeks for agile development and continuous testing to implement the major functionality and finally two weeks for deploying the MVP solution and last-minute tweaks.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2245725" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2245725" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2245725" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Solweys-timeline.png" alt="Solwey's timeline" width="1024" height="259" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Solweys-timeline.png 2176w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Solweys-timeline.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Solweys-timeline.png?resize=300,76 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Solweys-timeline.png?resize=768,194 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Solweys-timeline.png?resize=680,172 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Solweys-timeline.png?resize=1536,388 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Solweys-timeline.png?resize=2048,518 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Solweys-timeline.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2245725" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Solwey</p></div></p>
<p>We work with our clients to postpone any tasks that were collectively identified as non-blocking or non-critical to keep the MVP lean enough to have a successful launch within such a short timeline. This is because in our experience, four months is long enough time to develop most MVPs and short enough to enable rapid launch and get much needed feedback from users and investors that guarantee the success of the startup in subsequent phases.</p>
<p><strong>Two of your clients mentioned coming to you after not-so-great experiences with other firms. Could you explain what this is like? And do you have any advice for startups wanting to avoid bad experiences?</strong></p>
<p>The very first thing I tell our clients in the diagnostics call, is that sometimes things do not work out, but their negative experience does not mean that working with external teams is always going to fail or that their previous technology partner was unqualified or had bad intentions. I joke sometimes that our team should be called “iteration #3.” A majority of projects that we take over usually went through two iterations: once with an agency outside of the United States, due to cheaper rates, and another time with a junior or midlevel freelancer. And while there is absolutely nothing wrong with either approach, founders tend to underestimate the level of hands-on coordination required to complete the project in those scenarios.</p>
<p>Advice on avoiding a bad experience? Setting clear expectations and communication. Whether a startup is engaged with a staff-augmentation agency, or a temporary hire, or a freelancer, or an agency like us, it all boils down to having clear delineation of tasks and frequent check-ins to ensure that any potential issues surface quickly and the team can pivot quickly. Will there be unexpected issues, delays, complications? Certainly. But it matters how these obstacles are communicated and addressed.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any thoughts on fake agile versus real agile? And why do you believe in the latter?</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion, the word &#8220;agile&#8221; has been loosely applied to many different approaches and strategies to manage projects so the discussion of &#8220;fake&#8221; versus &#8220;real&#8221; agile is tricky without a specific context or example. Through our interactions with different teams, we have encountered cases when the agile process ended up being extremely inefficient for a number of reasons. Sometimes, a manager or team lead would be laser-focused on agile ceremonies designed for large distributed teams while the total team size is just two developers working in the same room. In other cases, the process was set to be so fluid that the priorities would shift several times a day. And sometimes, the team would define weekly or biweekly sprints, but then would have a rigid quarterly plan that looks exactly like a waterfall approach.</p>
<p>To be honest, I am not sure that our process would fall into the strict definition of agile because we adjust it and try to accommodate client preferences to reduce any potential friction. We have several important requirements, including daily check-ins with our designers and developers, weekly sprints with well-defined tasks, regular release schedules, continuous integration flows, striving to have design assets be ready 1-2 sprints ahead of development, etc. But beyond those, we do our best to accommodate and provide recommendations to the client as the process would be quite different for a one-person team versus a late-stage startup with dozens of team members spread across multiple time zones.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Don&#8217;t worry, Y Combinator fans, you&#8217;ll be able to write off this entire opinion piece as the disgruntled musings of &#8220;a failed startup founder who was never able to get into Y Combinator,&#8221; because seen through one lens, that&#8217;s exactly what I am. But, damn it, for a while there, being a Y Combinator company meant something. People who&#8217;d gone through Y Combinator spoke through it in hushed tones, as if God&#8217;s own light had shined upon them, and they had been touched by the wings of an angel.</p>
<p>Truth is, for a lot of companies, being part of Y Combinator was a huge breakthrough, and getting the YC stamp of approval meant something. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The selection criteria were stringent, and whenever there was a YC demo day, the entire startup ecosystem would be wafting themselves with a sense of arousal and excitement. The press would be sharpening its proverbial pencils, and investors would be clamoring for the most promising startups. Both groups did that for the same reason: To make it through the YC selection process and survive it through the end of the program meant that the companies at least reached a basic level of competence. </span></p>
<p>People who don&#8217;t know much about martial arts think that earning a black belt is a big deal. It is &#8212; but in most systems, it shows just that you have basic proficiency, and that you can be trusted to practice with some level of safety and competency. People who understand martial arts understand that the true deep study starts at the black-belt level. In a way, the same was true for Y Combinator: Get accepted and work your way through the program, and you&#8217;ve got your black belt. Congrats, pop some champagne, pat yourself on the back. Now the real work begins.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245960" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>So when Y Combinator&#8217;s new boss Geoff Ralston says <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/y-combinator-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he can see Y Combinator fund 1,000 companies per batch</a> at some point in the none-too-distant future, my read is that the firm is tooling up to change from being a boutique martial arts gym to a mass-market dojo that&#8217;s trying to train a ludicrous number of founders into fighting-fit karate kids. Although, if you remember &#8220;Karate Kid,&#8221; the smaller, scrappier gym was, ultimately, a better place to be.</p>
<p>The move would make a lot of sense for Y Combinator &#8212; if, as Ralston claims, they will be able to keep the quality of founders and the selection criteria at a high level, the firm is effectively creating an index fund of startups. At the stage Y Combinator invests, they can pick up a not-insignificant percentage of the companies for not a lot of money. If 1‰ (that&#8217;s 1 out of a thousand) startups turn into an Airbnb, DoorDash, Coinbase, GitLab, Dropbox, Amplitude, Matterport, PagerDuty, Stripe, Instacart, Cruise, Brex, Reddit, Zapier, Gusto, Flexport, Monzo, Mux or Rippling, it&#8217;s a hell of a business model. That impressive list of startups isn&#8217;t a coincidence; those are all companies you&#8217;ve probably heard of, and all Y Combinator portfolio companies.</p>
<p>The problem isn&#8217;t for the investors; they&#8217;re going to be just fine. The challenge is for the startups. Some will argue that network effects get better when the network gets bigger; and that might be true &#8212; but that is an incredibly hard problem to solve. Not least because the very best founders don&#8217;t have time to actually participate in the network; especially in the early days, they&#8217;re heads down building their startups, not rolling up their sleeves to help other founders.</p>
<p>As a founder, I&#8217;d question whether it&#8217;s worthwhile to be a part of a 1,000-strong cohort. Will the Y Combinator badge of honor help you get a meeting with an investor? Will it help you get bumped to the top of a journalist&#8217;s email inbox? Or will it simply cease to be valuable as a filter to the outside world, and drastically reduce the value of having been a Y Combinator alum in the first place?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>My personal suspicion is that Y Combinator becoming huge(r) is great for YC and its limited partners (i.e. the people investing into YC). For the startups, there&#8217;s a point of diminishing returns. I think that point was a while back when the cohorts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/here-are-all-the-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day-part-1/">ballooned to 377 startups</a> and became completely unwieldy for anyone who was trying to keep an overview of what was happening inside its rapidly expanding walls.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only a question of time before someone starts offering the service and exclusivity of what YC did in the early days &#8212; there are already a few contenders in the running &#8212; and when one of them starts gaining traction and building up a portfolio of its own, YC would be left with an index fund of the also-rans. I would be delighted to be wrong, but it feels like this is the beginning of the end of the Silicon Valley institution.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Electronic interfaces, platforms and marketplaces form a key layer in the digital infrastructure behind e-commerce, serving as gatekeepers between consumers and producers of digital content or digitally sold products.</p>
<p>These gatekeepers offer third-party companies access to a global market by providing their own infrastructure. It is therefore not surprising that their growth is often driven by a strong influx of third-party companies, which can expand internationally with their products and content without having to build their own technological infrastructure.</p>
<p>An increasing number of online retailers use such platforms for their e-commerce businesses, which has made these platforms an integral part of compliance procedures.</p>
<h2>The EU VAT reform</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2021 there was a big change in the European Union’s Value Added Tax (VAT) law, impacting online retailers, marketplaces and their e-commerce businesses across the EU. Since 1993, the VAT law in the European Union concerning cross-border e-commerce was in large part unchanged and was originally introduced for mail order businesses that used catalogues.</p>
<p>But EU member states realized a few years ago that EU VAT law was no longer on track with the developments taking place in the e-commerce ecosystem.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			In the worst case, non-compliance with these regulations will mean that VAT will not have been paid for thousands of transactions.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>This has led to many problems for marketplaces like Amazon, as they have a significant number of third-party merchants based outside the EU. For example, third-party merchants account for about 50%-60% of Amazon Germany&#8217;s revenue, and more than half of these merchants based in China.</p>
<p>The VAT problems that arise from this led to enormous tax losses in the past, because third-party merchants, especially those from China, did not declare the VAT that was actually due in the EU, giving them a huge market advantage over the EU merchants. The EU has recognized this and initiated the VAT reform, which primarily places responsibility on the marketplaces.</p>
<p>The EU VAT e-commerce package, under specific circumstances, can make online sellers and marketplaces liable to pay VAT and leads to certain challenges and risks.</p>
<p>Since July, it has been key for marketplaces to determine the VAT due for every transaction and establish related processes such as VAT rate determination, invoicing, filing and reporting. This is applicable to marketplaces when they are liable to pay tax on transactions by sellers not based in the EU or for distance sales from non-EU countries.</p>
<p>Marketplaces have to be aware of additional indirect tax regulations to avoid massive tax and financial risks. Not adapting to the new regulations can result in paying VAT and interest retrospectively for the sales made on the platform. In Germany, this would mean paying 19% VAT on the net sales, with fines and interest added on top. In countries like Italy, the surcharges can reach up to 240%.</p>
<h2>Broad range of VAT rates across the EU</h2>
<p>It is not only necessary for online merchants to determine the VAT rate for their products, but marketplace operators, being liable for VAT under certain circumstances, also have to ensure the application of the correct VAT rate in every EU member state.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volvo Cars is investigating a cybersecurity breach and theft of a limited amount of the company&#8217;s research and development data. The data breach was reported Friday by the Swedish automaker.</p>
<p>The company said one of its file repositories had been illegally accessed by a third party. Investigations have revealed that a &#8220;limited amount of the company&#8217;s R&amp;D property has been stolen during the intrusion,&#8221; the company said in a statement Friday.</p>
<p>Despite the limited amount, there may be an impact on the company&#8217;s operation, Volvo Cars said. without providing more details on the size of the breach or what was stolen. A Volvo spokesperson also declined to provide more information.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246123" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company is working with an independent third-party researcher to investigate the property theft.</p>
<p>Volvo said it implemented security countermeasures, including steps to prevent further access to its property and notified relevant authorities after it detected the unauthorized access.</p>
<p>It appears that the theft was targeting company R&amp;D data, not customer information. Volvo said it &#8220;does not see, with currently available information, that this has an impact on the safety or security of its customers&#8217; cars or their personal data.&#8221;</p>
<p>The media outlet Inside-it, which was the first to report the breach, found a screenshot on the dark web that showed Volvo&#8217;s data was released on the website of a ransomware gang <a href="https://www.inside-it.ch/de/post/ransomware-bande-meldet-angriff-auf-autohersteller-volvo-20211201">called Snatch</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company&#8217;s six-month investigation of automotive companies found that<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> highly sensitive information was leaked, including trade secrets, personally identifiable information, blueprints of engines and production facilities, confidential agreements, human resources documents and more. The company concluded that the these leaks occurred due to employee internal threats and external security weaknesses across the automotive supply chain.</span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Today’s high-growth technology companies rely on millions of presales professionals, also known as sales engineers and solution consultants, to explain the value of technologies to buyers and customers. Ultimately, the contributions of these trusted technical advisers help close sales.</p>
<p>But while the C-suite acknowledges presales as a necessary supporting function to sales, executives don’t look to presales when they want to yield more growth.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			In each scenario, the incremental revenue impact can be exponential as the number of presales professionals to sales representatives grows.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Instead, the chief revenue officer (CRO), who typically oversees the presales organization, will often try to brute-force growth by adding more sales reps. That’s one way, but there are other approaches, especially in a market where finding talent has its own challenges.</p>
<p>An alternative solution may lie in presales. According to a McKinsey &amp; Company survey, investing in presales can improve conversion rates by five points, raise revenue by 6%-13% and accelerate sales by 10%-20%.</p>
<p>Rather than adding more headcount, the CRO can try something different — the presales force multiplier effect — to boost revenue.</p>
<p>To illustrate this concept, let’s examine three scenarios to quantify the impact of presales on growth.</p>
<h2>Scenario 1: High volume, low contract value</h2>
<p>Revenue models that have a high volume of transactions with corresponding low annual contract values (ACVs), say $10,000 to $50,000, can commonly have a presales-to-sales ratio of 10:1. If each sales representative has an annual quota of $750,000, this implies that one presales professional can have an annual quota influence of $7.5 million across all 10 sales representatives.</p>
<p>If a presales professional&#8217;s productivity were to increase 5% across the $7.5 million top-line influence, it could result in $375,000 ($7.5 million * 5%) incremental revenue without the need for additional headcount.</p>
<h2>Scenario 2: Medium volume, medium contract value</h2>
<p>Envision a model where ACVs could range from $51,000 to $100,000 and the presales-to-sales ratio is 5:1. If each sales representative has an annual quota of $900,000, this implies that one presales professional can have an annual quota influence of $4.5 million across all five sales representatives. If one presales professional&#8217;s productivity were to increase by 10% across the $4.5 million top-line influence, it could result in $450,000 ($4.5 million * 10%) incremental revenue without adding to the headcount.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A number of popular services, including Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/icloud/">iCloud</a>, Twitter, Cloudflare, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/minecraft/">Minecraft</a> and Steam, are reportedly vulnerable to a zero-day exploit affecting a popular Java logging library.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, dubbed &#8220;Log4Shell&#8221; by researchers at LunaSec and credited to Chen Zhaojun of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/alibaba/">Alibaba</a>, has been found in Apache Log4j, an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/open-source/">open source</a> logging utility that&#8217;s used in a huge number of apps, websites and services. Log4Shell was first discovered in Microsoft-owned Minecraft, though LunaSec warns that “many, many services” are vulnerable to this exploit due to Log4j’s “ubiquitous” presence in almost all major Java-based enterprise apps and servers. In a <a href="https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>, the cybersecurity company warned that anybody using Apache Struts is &#8220;likely vulnerable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Companies with servers <a href="https://github.com/YfryTchsGD/Log4jAttackSurface" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to be vulnerable to Log4Shell attack so far include Apple, Amazon, Cloudflare, Twitter, Steam, Baidu, NetEase, Tencent and Elastic, though there are likely hundreds if not thousands of other organizations affected. In a statement given to TechCrunch, Cloudflare said it has updated systems to prevent attacks, adding that it saw no evidence of exploitation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246069" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Robert Joyce, the director of Cybersecurity at the NSA, <a href="https://twitter.com/NSA_CSDirector/status/1469305071116636167" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed that GHIDRA,</a> a free and open source reverse engineering tool developed by the agency, is also affected: “The Log4j vulnerability is a significant threat for exploitation due to the widespread inclusion in software frameworks, even NSA’s GHIDRA,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cert.govt.nz/it-specialists/advisories/log4j-rce-0-day-actively-exploited/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer Emergency Response Team</a> (CERT) for New Zealand, <a href="https://twitter.com/DTCERT/status/1469258597930614787" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s CERT</a>, and the <a href="https://twitter.com/_mattata/status/1469144854672379905" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greynoise</a> web monitoring service have all warned that attackers are actively looking for servers vulnerable to Log4Shell attacks. According to the latter, According to the latter, around 100 distinct hosts <a href="https://twitter.com/GreyNoiseIO/status/1469326260803416073" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are scanning</a> the internet for ways to exploit Log4j vulnerability.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Kayla Underkoffler, a senior security technologist at HackerOne, tells TechCrunch that this zero-day highlights the “threat that open source software presents as a growing portion of the world’s critical supply chain attack surfaces.”</p>
<p>“Open source software is behind nearly all modern digital infrastructure, with the average application using 528 different open source components,” Underkoffler said. “The majority of high-risk open source vulnerabilities discovered in 2020 have also existed in code for more than two years and most organizations lack direct control over open source software within supply chains to easily fix these weaknesses. Securing this often poorly funded software is imperative for any organization that relies on it.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Apache Software Foundation has released an emergency security update today to patch the zero-day vulnerability in Log4j, along with mitigation steps for those unable to update immediately. Game developer Mojang Studios has also released an emergency Minecraft security update to address the bug.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Europe, long viewed as a relative backwater to the U.S. startup market, has been on a tear in recent quarters and years. Akin to many startup markets around the world, Europe has seen its venture capital totals rise, its unicorn ranks swell, and even a few major public exits.</p>
<p>How hot is the market for European startups this year? This <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/flink-the-berlin-based-instant-grocery-startup-is-now-valued-at-2-85b-after-raising-750m-in-a-round-led-by-doordash/">morning, TechCrunch reported</a> that Flink raised $750 million. The “Berlin-based startup that sells food and other essentials at supermarket prices and aims to deliver them in under 10 minutes,” as we described it, is now worth $2.85 billion. And unless you are very familiar with the instant grocery market, we doubt that you were too aware of Flink.</p>
<p>The European startup market is now sufficiently robust and varied that it’s easy to lose track of its unicorns.</p>

So, instead of snagging just high-level numbers that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/european-tech-booms-but-southern-europe-and-founder-diversity-still-lagging/">paint a more general picture</a>, we’re teasing out a few things that you might have missed in your own read. If you care about the state and the health of the European startup market, this is for you.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll take a look at exit volumes and what we can infer for 2022, how talent issues aren’t landing equally around the continent, why there’s good <em>and</em> bad news for gender diversity in Europe, how pension fund money is still on the sidelines, and which collections of former employees are founding the most companies.</p>
<p>Sounds good? Let’s rock.</p>
<h2>Good news for 2022 European exits</h2>
<p>European technology M&amp;A is having a good year. The Atomico/Dealroom report details that the total value of tech M&amp;A in Europe through the third quarter of 2021 has crossed the $100 billion mark. For reference, that figure was below $10 billion in Q2 2019, Q3 2019, Q4 2019 and Q2 2020.</p>
<p>But not every tech exit fits into the venture capital model. Venture-backed exits for European tech companies are a smaller figure, but one that is still rising. Per the same data set, in the first three quarters of 2021, VC-backed tech M&amp;A worked out to $54.9 billion. That’s a hair more than the full-year 2020 number of $54.8 billion. Throw in Q4’s numbers, and not only will 2021 be a record year for VC tech exits – this data doesn’t include IPOs, mind – it will be one by a comfortable margin.</p>
<p>But all that’s the past. We care more about the future. And that’s where the data set pushed our eyebrows higher. Atomico wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the third quarter alone, the aggregated value of tech M&amp;A activity exceeded $45B, making it the largest Q3 on record. At time of publication, preliminary numbers for Q4 imply at least another $50B in aggregate value.</p></blockquote>
<p>If those numbers hold up, we could see roughly 50% of the 2020 total European M&amp;A in Q4 2021 <em>alone</em>. That, and incremental gains from quarter to quarter, implies that Europe is starting 2022 on its strongest non-IPO exit footing in history. Bullish!</p>
<h2>The UK’s talent issues are notable, worsening</h2>
<p>Remember Brexit? If you don’t live in the U.K., the political and economic decoupling of the island from the continent may have receded into the back of your mind. It’s an SEP to some degree: <em>someone else’s problem</em>. But while we may think about it a bit less, U.K.-based startups have not forgotten.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wisdom-audio-community/id1576484544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisdom</a>, a social audio app that&#8217;s focused on surfacing &#8220;life advice&#8221; and broadening access to mentorship &#8212; and whose iOS app launch we covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/wisdom-is-a-social-audio-app-for-opening-access-to-mentorship/">back in October</a> &#8212; has nabbed $2 million in seed funding off the back of early traction.</p>
<p>The seed is led by First Round Capital, with participation from a number of business angels.</p>
<p>The U.K.-based startup is not disclosing how many users its twist on social audio has attracted so far &#8212; but says mentors on its platform have shared some 600,000 minutes of &#8220;insights and guidance&#8221; to date; while this audio has generated 2.3 million minutes of listening (or, well, playback) in the eight weeks since the app&#8217;s official launch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246037" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Its approach to social audio combines a one-to-one &#8220;conversational&#8221; structure, centered on advice and mentorship, with the reach of a broadcast platform. (For more details on the platform see our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/wisdom-is-a-social-audio-app-for-opening-access-to-mentorship/">coverage of its launch</a>.)</p>
<p>Per Wisdom, the platform&#8217;s approach is proving popular with podcasters.</p>
<p>Other popular topics at this early stage include mindfulness and social media.</p>
<p>While &#8212; on the influencer/mentor side &#8212; it names the likes of musician Kenny G, Buffy the Vampire Slayer actor “Spike” James Marsters and baseball Hall of Famer Andre Dawson as among its early contributors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Commenting on the seed raise in a statement, First Round Capital said: “We believe social audio is in its infancy, and it has been great to join Dayo [Akinrinade, Wisdom&#8217;s founder and CEO] and witness firsthand her vision for Wisdom. Wisdom taps into some important trends, from social audio to algorithm-friendly design &#8212; all while reflecting just how powerful and impactful communities that feature a range of voices can be &#8212; helping to give diverse and overlooked people access to high quality mentorship.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So far, only the &#8216;cocktail-party format&#8217; of Clubhouse has gained widespread traction, but we think ultimately that format will be one of a number of interesting social audio formats,&#8221; the VC firm added. &#8220;Wisdom’s format with intimate 1:1 conversations broadcast to many listeners and its timer to keep the conversation moving make it stand out within the social audio category. It’s great to be able to announce our investment in Social Audio Inc. and its Wisdom app, and we’re looking forward to seeing just how far this app with its unique format and its laudable mission will go.”</p>
<p>Akinrinade attributed &#8220;early success&#8221; to &#8220;our incredible, helpful community of mentors&#8221;, adding in a statement: &#8220;The funding and expertise of our new investors will enable us to nurture and grow this extraordinary community.”</p>
<p>The startup said the seed funding will be used to build out a roadmap of features &#8212; including features focused on boosting community engagement.</p>
<p>It also has an Android app in the works (slated for early 2022) and said its to-do list includes launching direct messages; enhancing its AI algorithms doing search and discovery; and building monetization for mentors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce in Africa is growing fast and its potential remains enormous as more people get connected to the internet. Across sub-Saharan Africa 303 million people, about 28% of the population, are connected to the mobile internet, according to the 2021 GSMA mobile economy</span><a href="https://data.gsmaintelligence.com/research/research/research-2021/the-mobile-economy-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and this number is expected to rise to 40% in three years’ time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As the number of those connected to the internet grows, and shoppers increasingly opt to buy goods online, e-commerce platforms are set to experience a spike in the number of orders made and the value of goods bought &#8212; as happened recently with <a href="https://www.jumia.co.ke/sp-about_new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jumia.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (SEC)</span><a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001558370-21-016571/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made by the pan-African e-commerce platform on Tuesday shows that the value of goods sold on its platform over the Black Friday season grew by 30 percentage points this year to reach $150 million. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246005" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Friday sales on Jumia started in 2012 and run from the first Friday of November to the end of the month. Orders made during that period rose by 39 percentage points to reach 4.3 million as the number of Jumia merchants also increased by 11 percentage points to 46,000. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/jumia-posts-revenue-and-order-gains-but-compounding-losses-drag-its-stock-lower/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also recorded 40 million unique visitors, a 27 percentage points increase over that period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As reported recently, the most</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/consumables-dominate-jumias-sales-as-buyer-habits-change/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">popular products on the site were consumables</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> followed by beauty and fashion items. This comes after the e-commerce platform launched more dark stores to expand its grocery category &#8212; which as per the</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/jumia-posts-revenue-and-order-gains-but-compounding-losses-drag-its-stock-lower/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Q3 results</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seem to be paying off, yet profitability for the NYSE-listed firm remains elusive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our consumers are increasingly turning to Jumia for their everyday needs with the top three fastest growing physical goods categories in volume terms being fast moving consumer goods (&#8216;FMCG&#8217;), followed by beauty and fashion,” said Jumia on the SEC filing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a past interview with TechCrunch, Jumia attributed the shift in shopping habits to the stay-at-home restrictions that fueled the need for online shopping as well as the youthful population that is quick to adopt new trends and the increasing smartphone and internet penetration across the continent. Smartphones contribute the most (75%) traffic to the e-commerce site, meaning that as more people get connected, online shoppers are set to increase. Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya account for most of the online sales on Jumia.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Packages handled by Jumia Logistics, its delivery business over the Black Friday season, reached 5.3 million, which Jumia said was “more than double the average monthly package volume in the first 10 months of 2021.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia is currently the biggest e-commerce platform in Africa, leading hundreds of others, including Nigeria’s Marketplace Africa and South Africa’s Souq, and bidorbuy. The e-commerce platform is available in 11 markets across Africa, including Algeria, Senegal, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Uganda and Morocco. </span></p>

		<div class="contributor-byline__bio">
		Mark Sullivan was a federal law enforcement agent for nearly 35 years and the director of the U.S. Secret Service from 2006 to 2013.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Cybercriminals are getting more and more adept at exploiting the latest trend or issue of high public interest to spread malware and steal personal data from unsuspecting users.</p>
<p>Whether it’s an app related to your favorite TV show, government health updates about COVID or tracking missed package deliveries, the result is too often the same: infected devices leading to fraud or outright theft.</p>
<p>Basic cybersecurity hygiene is the key to protecting your devices against the most common types of malware, but we also need security built into technology to prevent these sophisticated cyberattacks.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245654" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Secret Service is certainly best known for protecting the president. But its other primary mission is to safeguard the nation’s financial infrastructure and payment systems to preserve the integrity of the economy from a wide range of financial and electronic crimes, including U.S. counterfeit currency, bank and financial institution fraud, illicit financing operations, identity theft, access device fraud and cybercrimes.</p>
<p>With the prevalence of mobile devices in today’s world, that means that, as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recommends, “users should avoid — and enterprises should prohibit on their devices — sideloading of apps and the use of unauthorized app stores.”</p>
<p>The pandemic has been a boon to cybercriminals, taking “advantage of an opportunity to profit from our dependence on technology to go on an<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> internet crime spree</a>,” said Paul Abbate, deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p>The FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center registered<a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-the-internet-crime-complaint-center-2020-internet-crime-report-including-covid-19-scam-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 791,790 complaints in 2020</a>, nearly double the previous year’s total and the largest year-over-year increase ever recorded. One particularly insidious example was text messages that encouraged users to download an app to make vaccine appointments but then sent malware to every device in that user&#8217;s contacts that could steal personal data or banking information.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Earlier this year, the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) alerted the public to a new form of malware that induced a user to click on a link to track a supposedly missed package delivery, a common occurrence during the pandemic. The link downloaded a malware app, called FluBot, which could then compromise a user’s bank and other financial account details. Cybersecurity researchers discovered “the volume of malicious [FluBot] SMS messages can number in the<a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/flubot-android-malware-spreading-rapidly-through-europe-may-hit-us-soon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> tens of thousands per hour</a>.” Hackers are even capitalizing on the popularity of the hit television show “Squid Game” with a<a href="https://nypost.com/2021/10/25/beware-the-squid-game-app-installing-malware-onto-peoples-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> new wave of cybercrimes</a> targeting mobile devices using malware hidden in apps related to the show.</p>
<p>Mobile devices are now the primary access point for the internet, with <a href="https://www.perficient.com/insights/research-hub/mobile-vs-desktop-usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">61% of all website visits</a> in the United States in 2020 coming on mobile devices, cementing the trend that only became the majority in 2019. This is reflected in the increased targeting of mobile devices with cyberattacks, with complaints of phishing and smishing attacks &#8212; emails or SMS text messages with malicious links &#8212; to the FBI<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> more than doubling in 2020</a>, rising from 114,702 in 2019 to 241,342 last year.</p>
<p>As we enter the holiday shopping season, during which one survey indicates that <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/ecommerce/2021/11/mobile-commerce-holiday-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 55% of shoppers</a> will make at least one purchase with a mobile device, it is essential that device owners take precautions to protect themselves from attacks.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/avoiding-banking-malware">NCSC recommends</a> that users follow basic protections, like frequently backing up their devices, using virus detection software and only installing “new apps onto your device from the app store your manufacturer recommends.” That guidance mirrors that from the DHS, which also included recommendations that operating systems, apps and other software should be updated regularly and that users and enterprises adopt multifactor authentication.</p>
<p>Simple cyber hygiene recommendations form a layered defense against attacks, dramatically reducing the threat of unauthorized access to mobile devices. Yet as critical and effective as these user actions are, cybercriminals utilize sophisticated techniques that exploit human psychology and behaviors to deceive users and penetrate devices.</p>
<p>These kinds of attacks, called social engineering attacks, utilize human interactions and social skills to trick users into allowing attackers access to their devices or systems, sometimes even getting users to disable optional security protections. Attacks like FluBot, fake vaccination sites and malicious “Squid Game” apps are all examples of social engineering.</p>
<p>According to DHS’ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, mobile device owners may be more vulnerable to social engineering attacks through text messages because mobile devices’ “integration of email, voice, text messages and web browser functionality<a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> increases the likelihood</a> that users will fall victim to engineered malicious activity.”</p>
<p>The White House’s Cybersecurity Summit earlier this year identified ways beyond cyber hygiene to protect against unauthorized access: “We need to transition to where technology is built securely by default. … We need to know we’re buying secure tech,” a senior White House official <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/08/25/background-press-call-by-senior-administration-officials-on-the-presidents-upcoming-cybersecurity-meeting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>.</p>
<p>Secure-by-design mobile devices would build cyber hygiene protections into the device, removing human psychology from the security equation. Just as seat belts and air bags started as options for car buyers, they are now mandatory safety equipment in all cars.</p>
<p>Basic cyber hygiene protections like multifactor authentication or prohibitions on downloading apps from outside official app stores can be built into systems by design. Mobile devices with these kinds of protections baked in from the start would not be nearly as vulnerable to social engineering attacks even if the device owner was, like most people, interested in a hit television show or worried about a pandemic.</p>
<p>The public should follow the basic cyber hygiene recommendations of our cybersecurity agencies. But we also need to short-circuit sophisticated social engineering attacks and build high-security protections into the design of our technology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spain&#8217;s government has agreed on the details of a draft startup law &#8212; passing the baton to the parliament to debate and potentially amend the plan ahead of a vote to turn it into actual law.</p>
<p>The Council of Ministers <a href="https://portal.mineco.gob.es/en-us/comunicacion/Pages/211210_agenda.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> adoption of the draft text today which it said contains important measures to cut red tape and remove bureaucratic obstacles for founding and investing in startups in Spain.</p>
<p>The package also targets reforms at stock options and access to visas in a bid to make the country a more attractive place for entrepreneurs and digital talent.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245970" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In a <a href="https://portal.mineco.gob.es/en-us/comunicacion/Pages/211210_agenda.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a>, Spain&#8217;s government said the package of incentives includes what it touted as &#8220;the EU’s most beneficial treatment of returns on stock options&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ministers have agreed to raise the tax exemption on stock option income from €12,000 to €50,000 per year.</p>
<p>The draft also stipulates that taxation is delayed until the date of settlement &#8212; either when the stocks are sold or if the company goes public.</p>
<p>Other notable tax measures include a reduction in Corporate Tax and Non-Resident Income Tax (which drops from 25% to 15%) for four years &#8212; which aims to tackle a major barrier, given startups typically aren&#8217;t focused on booking revenue in their early years (yet, under the current rules, are expected to pay the same rate of tax as more established businesses).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The maximum deductible amount for investments in new or recently created companies is also raised (from €60,000 to €100,000 per year), while the deduction rate goes from 30% to 50% and the period for considering a company &#8220;recently created&#8221; is extended, per the draft adopted by ministers.</p>
<p>The reform also looks set to tackle another key complaint of local founders: The cost and bureaucracy of setting up a startup in Spain &#8212; which has led some founders to establish their business elsewhere in Europe even if they subsequently build their product out of offices in the country.</p>
<p>Under the draft law, ministers say the procedures for setting up a company will be &#8220;streamlined&#8221; into a single step and can be completed online without needing to pay a notary or registry expenses.</p>
<p>Startups will also be able to use an online portal to make business declarations and access benefits, per the release.</p>
<p>Olivier Plante, co-founder of a local keyboard startup, ThingThing &#8212; which develops <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/fleksy-raises-series-a-to-expand-its-keyboard-sdk-biz-after-10x-growth/">Fleksy</a> (a keyboard SDK business) out of offices in Spain &#8212; said he felt forced to incorporate his startup in the U.K. back in 2015 &#8212; because of relative costs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were like three years not making a dime,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;First months we needed a lot of money to get started, registry, stocks, banks, notary (they are parasites tbh)&#8230;etc. That&#8217;s why we founded the company in the U.K. &#8212; it costs us 70 GBP instead of ~5K EUR in Spain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Plante welcomed the reform package &#8212; saying that for him the two most important components are simplifying set-up for startups and the reduction in corporate tax rates in the early years.</p>
<p>The current approach is essentially &#8220;killing entrepreneurial spirit from day 1&#8221;, per Plante, or else limiting the pool of possible founders to those who are in a position to save enough money to get going. &#8220;Often, the real entrepreneurs have less means,&#8221; he noted, adding: &#8220;And Spain doesn&#8217;t enable the poor to become rich at the source.&#8221;</p>
<p>A local startup association, <a href="https://asociacionstartups.es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">startups asociación españa</a>, also welcomed the adoption of the draft text by the Council of Ministers &#8212; although it said it&#8217;s still waiting to see all the details of the full text once that&#8217;s published.</p>
<p>It also said it&#8217;s hoping the parliament will go even further in improving the proposal &#8212; suggesting it should further increase the number of years for a business to be deemed a startup; and &#8212; potentially (assuming the draft has not done so) &#8212; make changes to limiting requirements (such as a startup needing to have 60% of staff in Spain to qualify; or revenue of (only) up to €5 million).</p>
<p>The association was most fulsome in its praise of the planned boost to tax deduction for startup investors &#8212; dubbing that &#8220;excellent news that puts us on an equal footing with others successful ecosystems&#8221;.</p>
<p>The reform package contains a number of other measures to incentivize entrepreneurialism &#8212; such as entrepreneurs who are simultaneously working as employees at another job no longer being required to contribute twice to the Social Security system (which disincentives bootstrapping); and plans for establishing sandboxes or trial licences in regulated sectors to foster the development of novel services and MVPs.</p>
<p>Although it remains to be seen how the parliament may amend specific details.</p>
<p>In terms of time frame, a government source told TechCrunch it believes the law will be approved in the first half of 2022 &#8212; however, they noted that the deadline allows until the end of the year.</p>
<p>On the funding front, Spain&#8217;s government has an investment target of up to €4 billion to direct toward fostering startup growth &#8212; including drawing on European Union coronavirus recovery funding.</p>
