					<description><![CDATA[Going public will enable Brivo to go after more M&#038;A opportunities.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Smart building technology company Brivo reached an agreement to go public via special purpose acquisition with Crown PropTech Acquisitions. The SPAC deal values Brivo at $808 million.</p>
<p>Once the merger closes in early 2022, the combined company will operate as Brivo and is expected to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “BRVS.”</p>
<p>Steve Van Till, founder and CEO of Brivo, will lead the combined company. Brivo was founded in 1999 and sells SaaS building access management services and connected devices to enterprise and property owners.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232497" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Van Till told TechCrunch that the proptech boom has accelerated adoption of cloud-based technologies in the industry over the past five years. That has driven the company to be able to tout itself as “the single largest access control system in the world,” working with over 44,5000 customer accounts across over 300 million square feet of commercial property in 42 countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Brivo had been looking at both SPAC and IPO, and once it was in the private equity markets, “the SPAC offers came rolling in,” Van Till said.</p>
<p>He noted that the SPAC option yielded the company larger amounts of capital and was the more attractive option for what the company wanted to do in the long term, which included M&amp;A opportunities. The company has already been dabbling in M&amp;A, having acquired Parakeet, a keyless entry system company, in March 2020.</p>
<p>“The SPAC also gives us more access to capital, and from a customer perspective, more visibility,” Van Till said. “One of the markets we are moving into is the enterprise market, and we are dealing with other public companies as customers. Being a public company will enable them to see us as a peer.”</p>
<p>The SPAC company, Crown PropTech Acquisitions, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210211005947/en/Crown-PropTech-Acquisitions-Announces-Closing-of-276-Million-Initial-Public-Offering-Including-Full-Exercise-by-Underwriters-to-Purchase-Additional-Shares">raised $276 million in a February IPO</a>. It is led by Richard Chera, chairman and CEO.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for November 10, 2021! I spent the bulk of today on a train being whisked up the Eastern Seaboard back home, which meant that I was reading novels instead of tech news. And that means I am also catching up today. Thank gosh TechCrunch wrote a zillion stories for us both. We have work to do! — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/electric-automaker-rivian-largest-ipo-2021/"><strong>Rivian’s IPO revs Wall Street:</strong></a> The public-market debut of electric vehicle company Rivian stormed to a per-share price north of $100 today after pricing its shares at $78. TechCrunch reports that the company’s valuation makes it worth more than GM or Ford, storied automakers with global footprints, and, well, revenues. Something that Rivian has not that much of. The return of high-risk IPOs is really, truly here.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/expensify-david-barrett-ipo-day/">Expensify’s CEO talks public debut:</a> </strong>TechCrunch caught up with Expensify founder and CEO David Barrett today to discuss his company’s public offering. We wanted to know why he chose a traditional IPO and just how big his company’s market is (Airbase and others are waging war on one another to snag share). More on the company’s economics <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/inside-expensifys-ipo-filing/">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/crypto-volatility-continues-to-flummox-wall-street/">Public investors struggle to grok crypto:</a> </strong>Shares of Coinbase are lower today in the wake of its Q3 earnings report. Despite warning investors that its trading incomes would drop in the period, Wall Street was still let down by its numbers. In short, public-market investors appear to be struggling to properly estimate how well crypto-focused companies will perform quarter to quarter.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Our own <a href="https://twitter.com/bheater">Brian Heater</a> is a busy man. He’s busy getting his robotics-focused newsletter ready for launch — it’s called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/actuator/">Actuator</a> and you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">sign up here</a> for free. And he wrote a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1/">huge feature for the site on Bowery</a>, which plays in the vertical farming space. So, we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/vertically-farmed-wasabi-arugula-isnt-a-hypothetical/">had him on the Equity podcast</a> to chat farming that is more tall than broad.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232425" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/new-venture-fund-aims-to-become-the-investment-and-innovation-arm-of-the-autism-community/">Meet the Autism Impact Fund:</a> </strong>A new venture capital fund wants to “revolutionize the status quo for diagnosing, treating and living with autism” through investing. It wants to put capital to work in products and companies that may have a positive impact on the larger autism community. Which sounds pretty cool.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/subscription-carbon-offsetting-platform-ecologi-hits-8m-total-raised-includes-general-catalyst/"><strong>Now you can subscribe to trees:</strong></a><strong> </strong>No, this is not a cannabis joke. A startup called Ecologi is building a subscription service that lets consumers pay regular fees to help plant lots of trees. Trees consume carbon, of course, changing the global climate balance. It just raised $5.75 million. Trees as a service! TaaS!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/momentum-announces-5m-seed-to-automate-sales-tasks-in-slack/"><strong>There’s still white space in sales tooling:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the lesson I am taking away from Momentum’s $5 million seed round. The company is building a Slack integration that wants to bring the sales processes closer to other parts of an org. Which is ambitious, given that a CRM giant now <em>owns </em>Slack.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/cacheflow-drops-stealth-tag-raises-6m-to-simplify-the-saas-buying-experience/"><strong>Cacheflow leaves stealth, announces $6M round:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The SaaS buying experience is old-fashioned, Cacheflow reckons, giving it a shot at shaking up how customers pay for software. The startup, announcing itself to the world for the first time today, is offering a way for software companies to get paid all at once, while allowing customers to pay ratably.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/controlup-nabs-100m-to-monitor-and-improve-desktop-computing-performance-across-disparate-work-environments/"><strong>Mega-round #1:</strong></a> ControlUp has raised a $100 million round to continue scaling its IT-focused service that helps improve desktop performance.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/workato-storms-to-a-5-7b-valuation-after-raising-200m-for-its-enterprise-automation-platform/">Mega-round #2:</a> </strong>Workato has raised $200 million to help enterprise customers automate more of their regular work. The company is now worth $5.7 billion.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/daily-grabs-another-40m-so-developers-can-add-video-audio-features-to-any-product/"><strong>Daily raises $40M for its video-focused software:</strong></a><strong> </strong>I recall <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/daily-co-raises-4-6m-video-chat-api-service/">when Daily raised a $4.6 million seed round</a>. That was back in May 2020. Now the company is flush with a new eight-figure round that our own Christine Hall notes will help the company continue to build and sell its API-delivered video embed service.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/moov-an-online-marketplace-for-used-manufacturing-equipment-raises-41m-from-tiger-global-and-others/"><strong>Tiger likes Moov’s moves:</strong></a><strong> </strong>So it put a $41 million Series A into the company. What does Moov do? It has built a marketplace for used manufacturing equipment. Given the role that used IRL tooling is playing in the global chip shortage, the company could be onto something major.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/digital-restaurant-startup-zak-orders-up-new-capital-on-mission-to-be-toast-of-latam/"><strong>Latin American Toast is big business:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Not the burned bread, but the Toast model. Toast, a U.S. software and hardware and payments company, has soared in value in recent quarters. Zak wants to bring a similar business to Latin America. And it has raised $15 million to do so.</li>
<li>To close out our startup coverage, TechCrunch wrote about how <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/how-african-refugees-used-bitcoin-to-build-their-own-grassroots-economy/">the eruption of a volcano in the Democratic Republic of the Congo led to the displaced using bitcoin to rebuild their lives</a>.</strong> It’s a story worth reading.</li>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/airbnb-ceo-brian-chesky-discusses-the-future-of-work-and-the-one-thing-hed-do-over/">In an expansive interview,</a> Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky and TechCrunch Managing Editor Jordan Crook looked back at how the travel company has adapted since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Their chat covered topics as far afield as Airbnb&#8217;s &#8220;work anywhere&#8221; policy, how it&#8217;s addressing liability issues for hosts and his biggest regret from the COVID-19 era:</p>
<blockquote><p>I overrode the host cancellation policy and refunded more than a billion dollars of guest bookings. I think it was the right thing to do. But I did it unilaterally, without consulting the hosts. They got really pissed off and it broke some trust with some of our host community.</p></blockquote>

<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/youtube-is-removing-the-dislike-count-on-all-videos-across-its-platform/">YouTube gives bad vibes the boot:</a> </strong>Alphabet’s video giant YouTube is pulling dislike counts from view across its service. The goal is to prevent abuse, which makes some sense. It’s a bummer that humans are such regular jerks that this is a needed product move, but here we are.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/twitter-is-building-a-crypto-team/"><strong>Twitter is building a crypto team:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Given how much Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey loves bitcoin — over and above other blockchains, which is a subject for another day — it is not a surprise that his social media company is building a crypto team. Twitter has previously tinkered with NFTs and crypto tipping.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/instagram-tests-take-a-break-reminders-on-an-opt-in-basis/"><strong>Instagram wants to help you use it less:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Users of the Meta-owned social service can now enable reminders to stop scrolling after a set time period.

That’s why companies like Jamf are in business. But now Apple is rolling out “the beta of a device management solution called Apple Business Essentials aimed squarely at businesses with less than 500 employees.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/google-fails-to-overturn-eus-e2-42bn-shopping-antitrust-decision/"><strong>Google fails to get rid of huge EU settlement:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The U.S. search giant’s challenge to a huge fine stemming from a 2017 case with the European Union over its shopping product has largely failed.</li>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Zero-party data has very quickly become the biggest buzzword in marketing and digital advertising. Unlike third-party data, which is collected by aggregators and ad platforms through third-party cookies and unsavory tracking techniques, <a href="https://www.octaneai.com/blog/the-complete-guide-to-zero-party-data-marketing-for-ecommerce-merchants">zero-party data</a> is collected voluntarily and directly from customers.</p>
<p>Think of the kind of things you’d tell a store associate helping you find the right gifts to purchase for your family — size, style, skin concerns, gender, budget, taste profile, eating habits, what type of pet they have, etc. That’s zero-party data.</p>
<p>Zero-party data marketing started when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/the-downfall-of-ad-tech-means-the-trust-economy-is-here/">the scrutiny on ad tracking ramped up</a>, but became a necessity with iOS 14.5. With the vast majority of users opting out of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">data tracking on iOS</a>, marketers need new sources of data to power their campaigns and replace the data they currently borrow from tracking cookies — which will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/is-google-about-to-delay-its-depreciation-of-tracking-cookies/">also go away in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>This is especially true as more consumers <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210602005287/en/Personalize-or-Perish-New-Data-from-Twilio-Segment-Shows-Customer-Loyalty-Hinges-on-Personalized-Experiences">demand personalized experiences</a> from the places they shop. Implemented correctly, zero-party data marketing allows you to treat every customer as an individual, personalize their experience with your brand and build real relationships.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>While a lot of articles have discussed the importance of zero-party data, very few have gone into how to collect this valuable data and properly leverage it for better conversions, loyalty and customer satisfaction. That’s why I decided to write this piece. Think of it as a miniguide on how to begin your journey as a zero-party data marketer.</p>
<p>Let’s start with some of the most important tools for zero-party data collection.</p>
<h2>Quizzes and recommendations are the backbone of zero-party data</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2232097" style="width: 1112px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232097" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2232097 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tc-diagram1-zpd.png" alt="An example of a quiz to help customers buy a product" width="1102" height="278" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tc-diagram1-zpd.png 1102w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tc-diagram1-zpd.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tc-diagram1-zpd.png?resize=300,76 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tc-diagram1-zpd.png?resize=768,194 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tc-diagram1-zpd.png?resize=680,172 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tc-diagram1-zpd.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1102px) 100vw, 1102px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232097" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Octane AI</p></div></p>
<p>When you hear &#8220;quiz,&#8221; you might be tempted to think of a BuzzFeed-style personality assessment, but in reality, they are the fundamental way we figure out what products we want to buy and what package to get.</p>
<p>Think about entering a cosmetics store. You know you need some collection of skincare products, but you don’t know which routine to follow or all the possible options for each part of the routine. A store associate does, however, and they usually help you find the right skincare routine and products based on a series of questions they ask about your skin’s condition, concerns, allergies and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Priti Choksi, partner at Norwest Venture Partners, has a portfolio that includes Bright, Lumosity, Citcon, UPSIDE Foods and Birdies. But before she ever entered the world of VC, she was an operator at companies like Facebook and Google. She managed business development teams and ran M&amp;A and has vast experience in the world of growing and scaling companies.</p>
<p>So, it should go without saying, we&#8217;re absolutely amped to have Choksi join us on <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-live-with-norwest-venture-partners-and-birdies?utm_source=TC%20Post&amp;utm_campaign=post" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 17 at 12 pm PT/3 pm ET for an episode of TechCrunch Live</a>. Choksi will be joined by founder Bianca Gates of <a href="https://birdies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Birdies</a>.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Live is all about helping founders build better venture-backed businesses. The first step in that, usually, is getting some funding. We&#8217;ll talk to Choksi and Gates about how they first met, what drew Choksi to invest in Birdies, and how they&#8217;ve worked together since. We&#8217;ll also take a look through Birdies&#8217; early pitch deck and hear what really sang for NVP and other investors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232075" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Founders, this is a great opportunity to learn what makes VCs tick and refine your fundraising process accordingly.</p>
<p>This episode of TechCrunch Live will also feature the TCL Pitch-off, where founders in the audience can come on our virtual stage and pitch their products to our esteemed guests, who will give their live feedback.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Live is accessible to anyone who is available on Wednesdays at noon PT/3 pm ET, but the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-live/">full library of on-demand TechCrunch Live content</a> is reserved exclusively for TechCrunch+ members.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blackshark.ai, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/meet-the-startup-that-helped-microsoft-build-the-world-of-flight-simulator/">the Austrian startup</a> behind the digital globe you fly over in Microsoft&#8217;s Flight Simulator, has raised a $20M round A to develop and scale its replica-Earth tech. The potential applications for a planetary &#8220;digital twin&#8221; are many and various, and the company has a head start even on mapping giants like Google.</p>
<p>The world got a glimpse of a fully traversable and remarkably (if not 100%) accurate globe in Flight Simulator last year; we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/microsofts-new-flight-simulator-is-a-beautiful-work-in-progress/">called a &#8220;technical marvel&#8221;</a> and later went into detail about how it was created, and by whom.</p>
<p>Blackshark.ai was spun out of gaming studio Bongfish with the intention, founder and CEO Michael Putz told me, of taking their world building technology beyond game environments. The basis of their technique is turning widely available 2D imagery into accurate 3D representations with machine learning, a bit of smart guesswork, and a lot of computing power.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231468" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The details are here, but essentially the blackshark.ai system has a canny understanding of what different buildings look like from above, even in sub-optimal lighting and incomplete imagery. The machine learning system they&#8217;ve built can extrapolate from imperfect outlines by considering the neighborhood (residential vs commercial), roof type (slanted vs flat), and other factors like the presence of air conditioning units and so on. Using all this it creates a plausible 3D reconstruction of the building.</p>
<p>The hard part, of course, isn&#8217;t how to do that <em>once</em> but how to do it <em>a billion times on a regular basis</em>, in order to create an up-to-date 3D representation of every building on the planet. As Putz explained: &#8220;Even if you could afford to buy all the computing power for this, building the backend to serve it is hard! This was a real world issue we had to deal with.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q7DADSF9--0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Their solution, as is often necessary for AI-powered services, was to optimize. Putz said that the process of calculating the 3D model for every building on the planet originally took about a month of computation, but now can be done in about 3 days, an acceleration of about 300x.</p>
<p>Having this ability to update regularly based on new imagery from satellites is crucial to their business proposition, Putz explained. A lot of 3D map data, like what you see in Google and Apple&#8217;s maps, is based on photogrammetry, aerial photography combining multiple aerial images and comparing parallax data (like our eyes do) to determine size and depth. This produces great data&#8230; for when the photo is taken.</p>
<p>If you want your 3D map to represent what a block in Chicago looked like <em>last week</em>, not two years ago, and you want to provide that level of recency to as much of the globe as possible, the only option these days is satellite imagery. But that also necessitates the aforementioned 2D-to-3D method.</p>

<p>Putz noted that although the blackshark.ai 3D map and those from Google and Apple have superficial similarities, they&#8217;re not really competitors. All provide a realistic &#8220;canvas,&#8221; but they differ greatly in intention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google Maps is the canvas for local businesses,&#8221; he said, and what&#8217;s important to both the company and its users is locations, reviews, directions, things like that. &#8220;For us, say for flooding, a climate change use case, we provide the 3D data for say, Seattle, and others who specialize in water physics and fluid simulation can use the real world as a canvas to draw on. Our goal is to become a searchable surface of the planet.&#8221;</p>

<p>What&#8217;s the total flat rooftop area available in this neighborhood of San Diego? What regional airports have an open 4,000-square-meter space? How do wildfire risk areas overlap with updated wind models? It&#8217;s not hard to come up with ways this could be helpful.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is one of those ideas where the more you think about it, the more use cases come up,&#8221; Putz said. &#8220;There&#8217;s obviously government applications, disaster relief , smart cities, autonomous industries — driving and flying. All these industries need synthetic environments. This wasn&#8217;t just like, &#8216;hey we want to do this,&#8217; it was needed. And this 2D-3D thing is the only way to solve this massive problem.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The $20M round was led by M12 (Microsoft&#8217;s venture fund) and Point72 Ventures. Putz was excited to have a few familiar faces advising board: Google Earth co-founder Brian McClendon, former CEO of Airbus Dirk Hoke, and Qasar Younis, former Y Combinator COO and now CEO of Applied Intuition. (These folks are <em>advising</em>, not <em>joining</em> the board, as this paragraph mistakenly had earlier.)</p>
<p>Scaling is more a matter of going to market rather than building out the product; while of course more engineers and researchers will be hired, the company needs to go from &#8220;clever startup&#8221; to &#8220;global provider of 3D synthetic Earths&#8221; in a hurry or it may find some other clever startup eating its lunch. So a sales and support team will be built out, along with &#8220;the remaining pieces of a hyperscaling company,&#8221; Putz said.</p>
<p>Beyond the more obvious use cases he listed, there&#8217;s a possibility of — you knew it was coming — <em>metaverse</em> applications. In this case however it&#8217;s less hot air and more the idea that if any interesting AR/VR/etc applications, from games to travel guides, wanted to base their virtual experience in a recently rendered version of Earth, they can. Not only that, but worlds beyond our own can be generated by the same method, so if you wanted to scramble the layout of the planet and make a  new one (and who could blame you?) you could do so by the end of the week. Doesn&#8217;t that sound nice?</p>
<p>Once the new funding gets put to use, expect to see &#8220;powered by Blackshark.ai&#8221; or the like on a new generation of ever more detailed simulations of the complex markets and processes taking place on the surface of our planet.</p>

<div class="p-rich_text_section"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Ample’s concept is relatively straightforward: instead of an EV pulling up to a charging station to get more power, the company proposes outfitting vehicles with Ample’s modular battery packs, which can be swapped out at dedicated stations.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Earlier this year, Ample landed a partnership with Uber to use the company&#8217;s battery swapping stations at a few locations in the Bay Area. Both companies have agreed to extend their partnership to Europe, where Uber aims to electrify half the rides that are booked across seven European capitals – London, Amsterdam, Brussels, Berlin, Paris, Madrid and Lisbon – by 2025.</p>
<p>Ample cofounder John de Souza told TechCrunch in a statement that the funding will go toward scaling operations. &#8220;In order to deploy tens of thousands of vehicles in the near future, we will need to expand our production, deployment, and support functions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Geographically we will be expanding into Europe next year. The need for scale is being driven both by the market demand and also by the urgency of moving to EVs that was clearly highlighted at COP26.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232101" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ample also scored <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/ev-battery-swapping-startup-ample-charges-up-operations-in-japan-nyc/">a partnership with Sally</a>, an EV rental company based in New York City, to deploy the startup’s swapping service across San Francisco, NYC, Los Angeles and Chicago.</p>
<p>Taken together, the two initial partnerships – Uber and Sally – reflect the startup’s focus on fleet companies, for whom time spent recharging an EV battery is time wasted. Ample sees battery swapping as a good solution for individual consumers as well, especially those like apartment-dwellers who may not have reliable access to overnight charging, the company has told TechCrunch in the past.</p>

<h2>Sight Tech Global December 1</h2>
<p><strong>Designing for Everyone: Accessibility and Machine Learning at Apple<br />
</strong>Apple’s iPhone and VoiceOver are among the greatest breakthroughs ever for accessibility, but Apple never rests on its laurels. The next wave of innovation will involve what’s known as “machine learning” (a subset of artificial intelligence), which uses data from sensors on the phone and elsewhere to help make sense of the world around us. The implications for accessibility are just starting to emerge.</p>

<p><strong>Seeing AI: What Happens When You Combine Computer Vision, Lidar and Audio AR?<br />
</strong>The latest features in Microsoft’s Seeing AI app enable the app to recognize things in the world and place them in 3D space. Items are literally  announced from their position in the room; in other words, the word “chair” seems to emanate from the chair itself. Users can place virtual audio beacons on objects to track the location of the door, for example, and use the haptic proximity sensor to feel the outline of the room.</p>
<p>All of this is made possible by combining the latest advances in AR, computer vision and the iPhone 12 Pro’s lidar sensor. And that’s only the start.</p>

<p><strong>W3C ARIA-AT: Screen readers, Interoperability and a New Era of Web Accessibility<br />
</strong>Who knew that screen readers, unlike Web browsers, are not interoperable. Web site developers don’t worry about whether their code will work on Safari, Chrome or any other browser, but if they take accessibility seriously they have to test for JAWS, VoiceOver, NVDA and the rest. That’s about to change, thanks to the W3C ARIA-AT project.</p>
<p>(This session will be followed December 2 by a live breakout session with King and Fairchild, as well as several other members of the W3C ARIA-AT team.)</p>

<p><strong>The “Holy Braille”: The Development of a New Tactile Display Combining Braille and Graphics in One Experience<br />
</strong>Today, instant access to the written word in braille is much less available to someone who is blind than the printed word is for someone who is sighted. Tools such as single line refreshable braille displays have been available for years, but a single line at a time gives the user a very limited reading experience. This limitation is especially felt when users are reading lengthy documents or when they encounter content such as charts and graphs in a textbook. The American Printing House for the Blind (APH) and HumanWare have teamed to develop a device capable of rendering multiple lines of braille and tactile graphics on the same tactile surface. Currently referred to as the Dynamic Tactile Device (DTD), this tool aims to provide blind users with a multi-line book reader, tactile graphics viewer and so much more.</p>
<p>(This session will be followed by a live breakout Q&amp;A session with Greg Stilson, head of APH’s Global Technology Innovation team, and HumanWare’s Andrew Flattres, Braille Product Manager.)</p>

<p><strong>Indoor Navigation: Can Inertial Navigation, Computer Vision and Other New Technologies Work Where GPS Can’t?<br />
</strong>Thanks to mobile phones, GPS and navigation apps, people who are blind or visually impaired can get around outdoors independently. Navigating indoors is another matter.</p>
<p>For starters, GPS IS often not available indoors. Then there are the challenges of knowing where the door is, finding the stairs or avoiding the couch someone moved. Combining on-phone and in-cloud technologies like inertial navigation, audio AR, lidar and computer vision may be the foundation for a solution, if product developers can map indoor spaces, provide indoor positioning and deliver an accessible user interface.</p>

<p><strong>Why Amazon’s Vision Includes Talking Less to Alexa<br />
</strong>As homes become increasingly more technology-driven, inputs from multiple sources — teachable AI, multimodal understanding, sensors, computer vision and more — will create a truly ambient, surround experience. Already, one in every five Alexa smart home interactions is initiated by Alexa without any spoken command. As Alexa develops an understanding of us and our home well enough to predict our needs and act on our behalf in meaningful ways, what are the implications for accessibility?</p>

<p><strong>Inventors Invent: Three New Takes on Assistive Technology<br />
</strong>Inventors have long been inspired to apply their genius to helping blind people. Think of innovators like Mike Shebanek (VoiceOver, Apple) or Jim Fruchterman (Bookshare, Benetech), to name just two. Today, innovators have a nearly miraculous array of affordable technologies to work with, including lidar, computer vision, high-speed data networks and more. As a result, innovation is moving ahead at a dizzying pace. In this session, we will talk to three product innovators on the forefront of turning those core technologies into remarkable new tools for people who are blind or visually impaired.</p>

<p><strong>Product Accessibility: How Do You Get it Right? And How Do You Know When You Have?<br />
</strong>Accessibility awareness is on the rise, but even teams with the best of intentions can flounder when it comes to finding the right approaches. One key is to work closely with the appropriate communities of users to get feedback and understand needs. The result is not trade-offs but a better product for everyone. In this session, we’ll hear from experts on the frontline of accessibility in product development.</p>

<p><strong>For Most Mobile Phone Users, Accessibility Is Spelled Android<br />
</strong>Nearly three-quarters of mobile phone users in the world use phones built on Google’s Android operating system, not Apple’s iOS on the iPhone. For people who are blind or have low vision, the key app is Google’s Lookout, which draws on the vast resources of Google’s AI infrastructure, including its computer vision database and Google maps. How is Google approaching the huge accessibility opportunity Lookout represents?</p>

<p><strong>Getting around: Autonomous Vehicles, Ridesharing and Those Last Few Feet<br />
</strong>Summoning a ride from a smart phone is a dream come true for many, but when you have difficulty finding that ride, even when it’s a few feet away, the experience can be a nightmare, not to mention dangerous. How are rideshare and autonomous taxi companies working to make those last few feet from rider to car safer and better for blind and low-vision riders?</p>

					<description><![CDATA["I think what is really driving this, honestly, is just liquidity for our early shareholders. We haven't raised money in so long that our VCs basically just need liquidity."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After spending more than a decade building out its expense management platform, Expensify went public today, listing on the Nasdaq under the ticker “EXFY.” Early returns have been positive, as the company revised its original listing price up &#8212; and still saw its shares rise 40% on its first day of trading.</p>
<p>We’ve written a fair amount about Expensify already, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1/">deep dive from my colleague Anna Heim</a> that follows it from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/">the company’s foundation</a> all the way up through its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/expensify-ec1-business/">continued focus on product-led growth</a>. Meanwhile, Alex Wilhelm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/inside-expensifys-ipo-filing/">took a peek into the company’s S-1</a> when it filed to go public last month.</p>
<p>Today, though, I got the chance to catch up with Expensify founder and CEO David Barrett to discuss why the company decided to go public now, why it chose a traditional listing as opposed to a SPAC or direct listing and how it sees the expense management category shaping up as corporate travel begins to pick up post-COVID and a group of startups like Ramp and Brex seek to offer spend management solutions based on their own corporate card programs.</p>
<p>Below, Barrett explains why he believes Expensify’s listing is the “most pro-employee IPO ever,” how expense management &#8212; particularly SMB expense management &#8212; is a trillion-dollar opportunity and why he doesn’t see the likes of Brex as competition.</p>
<p><em>The transcript of this conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: Congratulations on this milestone. But the obvious question is, why was now the right time to take the company public? Was it the company readiness? Market multiples? A frothy IPO market? </strong></p>
<p>David Barrett: We often get this question, and I think our attitude is much more like, “Why not?” We&#8217;re not optimizing for a single transaction, and we could wait a month, a year, or 10 years and will be the same company. But we would rather have liquidity along that path.</p>
<p>I think what is really driving this, honestly, is just liquidity for our early shareholders. We haven&#8217;t raised money in so long that our VCs basically just need liquidity. I could wait another year and get an even more insane return, but I&#8217;ve already banked such a gigantic return I just kind of need to give it back.</p>
<p>Because we&#8217;re a very profitable company, we actually did a leveraged buyout of Redpoint. So one of our earliest VCs, we actually gave them liquidity just off our balance sheet. That was great, but at some point, you know, we&#8217;re profitable, but not so profitable that we can buy out our investors to like hundreds of millions of dollars a year. We can&#8217;t get that level of liquidity.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			There&#8217;s really no difference between expense management, invoicing, bill pay, payroll, corporate card, procurements, consumer money transmission … They&#8217;re all a list of expenses that you give to someone and they pay in return.							<cite>David Barrett</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>It really came down to &#8212; there&#8217;s no future where we don&#8217;t end up going public at some point. So then it&#8217;s no longer <em>if</em> we should go public, it&#8217;s really about <em>when</em>.</p>
<p>Well then, why not now? We&#8217;re clearly at a point where we can be a public company. We meet all the requirements. And honestly, as a profitable company, I&#8217;m very excited for the enhanced access to debt options that you get as a public company.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Congress is making its biggest push ever to stop drunk driving with President Biden&#8217;s huge infrastructure bill. As we previously reported, one of the provisions included <a href="https://www.engadget.com/infrastructure-bill-drunk-driving-technology-173739727.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">a mandate for anti-drunk driving technology</a> in new cars. Now, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-faces-fresh-challenges-infrastructure-050328752.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act has passed Congress</a> with the measure intact, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/11/10/drunk-driving-car-technology-infrastructure-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><em>Autoblog (AP) reports</em></a>, and it&#8217;s expected to be signed by the President soon. As part of the legislation, carmakers will have to include technology to detect and stop drunk drivers by as early as 2026.</p>
<p>First, though, the Department of Transportation will have to determine the best solution to curtail intoxicated drunk driving. Specifically, the bill requires something that will “passively monitor the performance of a driver of a motor vehicle to accurately identify whether that driver may be impaired.” That sounds similar to infrared camera solutions already used today by GM, Nissan and others, Sam Abuelsamid, principal mobility analyst for Guidehouse <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/honda/insight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">Insights</a>, tells the <em>AP</em>. It goes without saying that we&#8217;d need something more advanced than breathalyzers, which are already used as a punishment for convicted drunken drivers.</p>
<p>Around 10,000 people die every year in the US from drunk driving accidents, the <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drunk-driving#:~:text=Driving%20after%20drinking%20is%20deadly.&amp;text=In%20fact%2C%20on%20average%20over,the%20United%20States%20in%202019." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">NHTSA says</a>. Now that we have smarter sensors and plenty of camera technology to monitor driver behavior, it makes sense to explore solutions that could help prevent those sorts of accidents. Within a decade, it should feel as commonplace as seatbelts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232388" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The infrastructure bill also includes other safety measures, like rear seat reminders that could notify parents about children left in carseats. Additionally, Congress will also require automatic emergency braking and lane departure warnings, features that many new cars already offer. It&#8217;s unclear when true self-driving cars will be a reality, but until then, at least human drivers can look forward to more ways to prevent accidents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Department of Justice is suing ride-hailing giant Uber over claims that the company discriminates against passengers with disabilities, in violation of the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p>The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on Wednesday, alleged that Uber’s practice of imposing “wait time” fees on passengers with disabilities constituted discrimination, as those passengers may need more time to board the vehicle due to that disability. Uber launched its wait time policy in April 2016, charging fees from two minutes after the Uber vehicle arrives at the designated pickup location.</p>
<p>Uber does not give discretion to drivers to waive or otherwise alter wait time fees, which are calculated automatically in the app.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232335" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The DOJ said Uber failed to give those passengers adequate boarding time or provide equitable fares, in violation of the ADA. Mobility aids that need to be broken down, like wheelchairs and walkers, or myriad other reasons, could mean that a disabled passenger requires more than two minutes to board a vehicle, the suit says.</p>
<p>The complaint described the experiences of two specific passengers, referred to only as, “Passenger A” and “Passenger B.” Passenger A, a 52-year-old woman who has quadriplegia and uses a manual wheelchair, took at least five minutes on average to board vehicles she booked using Uber. She was charged a wait time fee for each ride she took, but due to limited other transportation options, she continued using Uber each day. She attempted to request a refund and was denied.</p>
<p>Passenger B, a 34-year-old man with cerebral palsy, also uses a manual wheelchair and was also charged a wait time fee for nearly every ride through the app. Uber initially refunded the fees, but later told him that he had reached “the maximum amount of refunds.”</p>
<p>“Similar to Passengers A and B, other individuals with disabilities throughout the country have likewise been discriminated against by Uber by being charged wait time fees because of their disabilities,” the suit says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The ADA is a landmark piece of legislation enacted by Congress in 1990. While Uber is a private company, the DOJ says the ADA has authority to address discrimination in transportation services provided by private entities.</p>
<p>“As Uber and other similar providers have gained popularity over traditional taxi services as the primary option for on-demand transportation, Uber plays an important role in ensuring independence for countless people with disabilities who choose to – or simply must – rely on its services to travel,” the lawsuit says.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Uber for comment and will update the story if the company responds.</p>
<p>The case number is 3:21-cv-08735.</p>

<p>Just two days after SpaceX safely returned four astronauts from the International Space Station, it’s sending another quartet to orbit. Check out the launch live on the video above – SpaceX will start providing coverage from 4:45 PM EDT, with liftoff scheduled for 9:03 PM EDT. You can also watch a livestream of the launch on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&amp;ab_channel=NASA">NASA TV Youtube channel</a>.</p>
<p>The launch, called Crew-3, was originally scheduled to take-off on the auspicious date of Halloween, but it encountered a series of delays, first due to adverse weather and then a “minor medical issue” involving one of the crew members. (NASA did not provide any further details on the issue, only specifying that it was not not an emergency nor related to COVID-19.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232297" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But now the launch is back on track. The foursome – NASA’s Raja Chari, Tom Marshburn, Kayla Barron, and the European Space Agency’s Matthias Maurer – will be ferried to the ISS in a SpaceX Dragon capsule they&#8217;ve dubbed &#8220;Endurance,&#8221; aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. It will be the first time in space for Maurer, Barron, and Chari, and the third mission for Maurer. They’re scheduled to spend the next six months on the station, where they’ll join just one NASA astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts.</p>
<p>Crew-3 is part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, a partnership between the agency and private industry to develop and use human space transportation vehicles. SpaceX began providing transportation services to and from the ISS under the CCP in 2020, under a $3.1 billion contract for six missions. Boeing was awarded a $4.8 billion contract under the program for its Starliner capsule, which has faced a series of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/nasa-and-boeing-confirm-starliner-wont-fly-until-first-half-of-2022-as-valve-investigation-continues/">technical snafus</a> that will likely keep it grounded until the first half of next year.</p>
<p>Liftoff will take place from launchpad 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, with the astronauts scheduled to arrive on the ISS by Thursday evening. Should weather conditions prove unfavorable for launch, SpaceX will have another opportunity 24 hours later.</p>
<p>Following stage separation, the Falcon 9 booster is anticipated to land autonomously on the “A Shortfall of Gravitas” barge stationed off the Florida coast.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It takes such a galactic amount of time, effort and expense to build a successful space startup, that you might find it difficult to justify carving out two days to attend <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=generaladmission&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=xonaspace&amp;display=">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> on December 14 – 15.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing. This event places you and your startup in the orbital path of the most influential people in the space ecosystem. The check-writers, the potential partners and customers that are essential for your ultimate success — all of them focused on pushing the boundaries of the space economy.</p>
<p>We can lather-rinse-and-repeat that fact from here to Alpha Centauri and back, but it might be more helpful to hear a testimonial from one of your own.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230631" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>But first:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=generaladmission&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=xonaspace&amp;display=TRUE">Buy your pass today</a>, and you’ll save $100 with the general admission price.</p>
<p>Now, let’s hear more about why one space CEO says attending TC Sessions: Space 2021 is an excellent use of your time, energy and budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/brian-manning-d115">Brian Manning</a>, the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/xona-space-systems">Xona Space Systems</a>, an early-stage startup focused on precision LEO satellite navigation services, attended TC Sessions: Space 2020, our inaugural space conference. Here’s what he had to say about the overall experience.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Why did you decide to attend and exhibit at TC Sessions: Space 2020?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> Our company was very new at that point, and our main goal was to gain exposure and to make connections. We also believed the event speakers and presentations would bring a great crowd of both potential investors and customers. We were excited about exhibiting and pitching.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How did that pitching opportunity come about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> We were one of 10 startups chosen by Starburst Aerospace — a global space accelerator — to participate in a pitch-off called Pitch Me to the Moon. It was a great opportunity to pitch live to a panel of high-profile judges from across the industry. We won the pitch-off and, along with terrific exposure, we received a strategy session with Starburst, free tickets to Disrupt 2021 and a podcast interview.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Can you talk a bit about your networking experience? </strong></p>
<p><strong>BM: </strong>Last year everything went into virtual mode, which made 2020 interesting for events. The conference went well, and TechCrunch handled the setup and all the networking breaks cleanly. Networking virtually is always a challenge, but we did have several useful, spontaneous conversations.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What, if anything, came as a result of attending TC Sessions: Space 2020?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> The event directly led to conversations with several potential high-value customers. A few of them came from unexpected areas, which pleasantly surprised us. In the past year, we’ve run into quite a few people who mentioned they remembered us from the TechCrunch event. Overall, we received great exposure that was very relevant to our company.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=generaladmission&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=xonaspace&amp;display=">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> takes place on December 14-15. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=generaladmission&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=xonaspace&amp;display=TRUE">Buy your pass</a> (or passes) and expose your startup to an astronomic dose of out-of-this-world opportunity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remember when Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/twitter-is-making-nfts-now-apparently/">dropped NFTs</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/twitter-accelerates-again-with-bitcoin-tips-nfts-recorded-spaces-creator-fund-and-more/">enabled Bitcoin tips</a>? Given that founder and CEO Jack Dorsey&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/jack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter bio</a> is literally just &#8220;#bitcoin,&#8221; it&#8217;s not surprising that Twitter is interested in cryptocurrency and other decentralized technologies. Today, Twitter said that it&#8217;s formally launching a crypto team, which will aim to be &#8220;a center of excellence for all things blockchain and web3,&#8221; the company told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>To start, this team will explore crypto payments (Bitcoin tips, crypto payments for Ticketed Spaces), opportunities for creator monetization (NFT tooling) and decentralizing social media (part of the general movement toward Web3). According to a Twitter thread from Tess Rinearson, the engineer tapped to lead the team, Twitter Crypto wants to &#8220;help push the boundaries of what&#8217;s possible with identity, community, ownership and more.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">As I build out the team, we’ll be working to figure out what crypto can do for Twitter, as well as what Twitter can do for crypto. Twitter truly “gets” crypto (hello bitcoin tipping &amp; NFTs!) but there’s so much more to explore here.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232198" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&mdash; Tess Rinearson (@_tessr) <a href="https://twitter.com/_tessr/status/1458466778871472134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Though crypto payments and <a href="https://twitter.com/EthanSutin/status/1453815677345689602?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1453815677345689602%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.socialmediatoday.com%2Fnews%2Ftwitter-previews-coming-nft-display-options-for-profile-images%2F609123%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT galleries</a> are the lowest hanging fruit in the short term, this move marks a broader push by Twitter toward decentralizing social media, which would allow networks to run independently on the blockchain, rather than on servers hosted by businesses, like Amazon Web Services (AWS). The idea is that these decentralized networks will give individual users more say over their data and privacy. Still, some researchers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/">worry about</a> how these decentralized systems would reckon with questions of content moderation, especially as it pertains to extremist political content.</p>
<p>Twitter Crypto will work closely with a nascent Twitter-sponsored initiative called <a href="https://blueskyweb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bluesky</a>, which aims to build an “open decentralized standard for social media.&#8221; In the same way that no one bank controls cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, there would be no one social network that would control the bluesky protocol, even though its development is driven by Twitter.</p>
<p>Twitter isn&#8217;t the only major social platform exploring blockchain technology. Just this week, Discord&#8217;s founder and CEO Jason Citron implied in a tweet that Discord is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/discord-nfts-metamask-crypto/">working on an integration</a> with MetaMask, a popular crypto wallet service. Meanwhile, Reddit is <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/reddit/jobs/3454478" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiring engineers</a> for an NFT platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram head Adam Mosseri <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1458468539812044803" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today the company has begun testing a new feature this week called &#8220;Take a Break,&#8221; which will allow users to remind themselves to take a break from using the app after either 10, 20 or 30 minutes, depending on their preferences. As an opt-in feature, however, the reminders may have a limited impact, as users would have to be motivated to set up the new control for themselves.</p>
<p>The company had previously said it was looking into &#8220;Take a Break&#8221; reminders. Mosseri, for instance, mentioned the coming addition when <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1442461241289555977" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commenting</a> on Instagram&#8217;s plans to pause its plans to build a version of its service for younger users, Instagram for Kids. He referenced Instagram&#8217;s plans to build in &#8220;nudges&#8221; and &#8220;reminders,&#8221; like &#8220;Take a Break,&#8221; as an example of how Instagram was addressing issues related to its product&#8217;s impact on users&#8217; mental health.</p>
<p>Meta&#8217;s (previously, Facebook&#8217;s) Global Head of Security Antigone Davis also referenced Instagram&#8217;s  &#8220;Take a Break&#8221; reminders when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/">the company was grilled in a Senate hearing</a> over teen mental health back in September. He said the idea with the feature was to encourage users to stop looking at the app after they had been browsing for too long, and cited it as one of the many ways the company was working to improve the experiences of young people using its platform.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232240" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But similar to Instagram&#8217;s experiment with removing Like counts from posts, which it also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/facebook-and-instagram-will-now-allow-users-to-hide-like-counts-on-posts/">ultimately decided to make an opt-in feature</a>, these new &#8220;break&#8221; reminders won&#8217;t likely impact platform usage, as they&#8217;re not being made the default experience. In addition, it&#8217;s unclear if users will adopt the feature, given that iOS and Android&#8217;s built-in screen time controls already allow device owners to set limits on the time spent in mobile apps either on an individual basis or by category, like &#8220;social.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instagram, in other words, appears to want credit for building mental health features without actually going so far as to make any universal changes that would impact its app usage.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>This is not the first time Instagram has pulled such a stunt. In 2018, Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/facebook-and-instagram-your-activity-time/">rolled out</a> a &#8220;You&#8217;re All Caught Up&#8221; notice that appeared when you reached the end of all the new content from the past two days on your Instagram Feed. But last year, Instagram regressed and decided to use the space below the &#8220;You&#8217;re All Caught Up&#8221; notice <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/instagram-finds-new-ad-space-at-the-end-of-your-feed-with-launch-of-suggested-posts-feature/">to push suggested posts and ads</a> in an attempt to keep users engaged even after they had reached a stopping point.</p>
<p>If Instagram was serious about addressing mental health, it could designate a time to show users a reminder within its app, and <em>then</em> offer controls that would allow users to turn it off or adjust the duration. Its competitor TikTok already does this by inserting videos into users&#8217; For You feeds that suggest it&#8217;s time to take a break after the user has been scrolling for too long. TikTok <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/features/tiktok-tips-telling-users-log-off-get-outdoors-sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also leverages influencers</a> with millions of followers to issue these warnings, which can be more effective than just a pop-up notification.</p>
<p>Mosseri says the new &#8220;Take a Break&#8221; reminders are launching this week as a test with a limited number of users, for the time being, but the company expects to roll out the feature publicly in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The euphoria around Rivian kicked into overdrive Wednesday as it debuted as a publicly traded company, with an opening share price of $106.75.</p>
<p>If that sticks, it would give Rivian an implied valuation of $90 billion. The opening trade was nearly 37% higher than its listed IPO price of $78. That absolute eye-popping number makes Rivian one of the largest IPOs in U.S. history and puts its market cap above GM as well as one of its backers, Ford (GM&#8217;s market cap is $86.31 billion; Ford&#8217;s is $78.2 billion).</p>
<p>That share price continued to rise after it began trading around 1 pm ET, hitting as high as $119 a share before falling to about $112.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232202" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The historic size of the Rivian IPO is not lost on founder and CEO RJ Scaringe. However, and perhaps as expected, he is bullish on the future of EVs, noting in a recent interview that the 90 to 100 million vehicles sold each year will transition to electric in the next 10 to 20 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, the way investors look at the space is really valuing what the future looks like,&#8221; Scaringe said. &#8220;In not too much time, 100% of the business will be electric.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while Rivian is very early in terms of its vehicles and launch, Scaringe said investors see and are valuing the company based on its future potential as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they&#8217;re evaluating us purely on our P&amp;L (profit/loss) today, I think they&#8217;d be missing the point of the company; they&#8217;re, of course looking at what they think the company is capable of achieving over time,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What Rivian is capable of achieving has yet to be proven; investors, customers and industry observers will learn that soon enough. However, its future plans are certainly ambitious and extend far beyond the first two consumer vehicles — the R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV — and its partnership with Amazon to produce 100,000 electric commercial delivery vans by 2024. Patent documents as well as Scaringe&#8217;s own comments to TechCrunch show that Rivian plans to launch a range of consumer and commercial products.</p>
<p>Investors may also be betting that Rivian&#8217;s push to become vertically integrated — in the long term it even plans to develop its own battery cell — will make the company a technology leader.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really critical to control and vertically integrate what we would think of as the core technology stack — so all the electronics in the vehicle, the full software stack, the propulsion layer in the vehicle,&#8221; Scaringe said. &#8220;I would say among all those things, the most important is actually software and electronics.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Wild IPO ride</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s been a wild ride since Rivian made its IPO filing public last month (it filed confidentially for the IPO in August). That filing &#8212; a detailed snapshot of Rivian&#8217;s financial standing, risks and opportunities &#8212; shows a company burning through cash as it takes on the capital-intensive task of designing, developing, producing and then selling electric vehicles.</p>
<p>The company planned to offer 135 million shares at a price between $57 and $62. Underwriters also had an option to buy up to 20.25 million additional shares.</p>
<p>To say that investor demand has been frenetic is perhaps the understatement of 2021. Rivian not only upped its targeted share price twice, finally listing its initial public offering at $78 a share, it also added more and offered 153 million shares of common stock, according to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521324915/d439957ds1mef.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regulatory filing</a> was posted late Tuesday evening. Rivian also gave underwriters an option to buy another 22.95 million shares, a higher number than previously expected.</p>
<p>The size of the IPO also benefits some of its biggest backers. Amazon holds a 20% stake and Ford has a 12% stake in Rivian.</p>
<p>The run up in Rivian&#8217;s stock is notable for a number of reasons. For instance, it is now valued more than established automakers that produce and sell millions of vehicles every year.</p>
<p>In contrast, the revenues are light and the expenses are high over at Rivian.</p>
<p>The company has hired thousands of employees over several facilities, including its factory in Normal, Illinois. The company now employs more than 9,000 people, Scaringe told TechCrunch in an interview Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>Scaringe&#8217;s obsession with vertical integration has also pushed up R&amp;D costs. (The company spent $766 million on R&amp;D in 2020. In the first half of 2021, the company spent $683 million on R&amp;D.)</p>
<p>As a result, net losses have expanded as it prepared for production of the R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV. The company posted a net loss of $994 million in the first half of 2021 alone, far more than double its $377 million net loss the company posted in the same period of 2020.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, revenues are trickling in as deliveries of its R1T to customers, which began last month, begin to ramp up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab is hoping to advance its reusability program one step forward tonight, when it will attempt to recover the booster from its Electron rocket for the third time.</p>
<p>The “Love at First Insight” mission is set to take off at 11:25 PM EST from the company’s launch facility on New Zealand’s Mahia Peninsula. <a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/live-stream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can watch the launch live on Rocket Lab’s website here</a>.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab has successfully recovered the first-stage booster twice before, the only other company besides SpaceX to do so. The first recovery took place <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/complete-success-rocket-labs-booster-recovery-is-a-big-step-towards-reusability/">November 2020</a> and then again in May 2021, though that latter mission resulted in a complete loss of payload (more on that below). Both boosters made a splashdown via parachute, and if all goes to plan, the booster tonight will too. But this recovery attempt has an added twist: this time, a helicopter will be hovering nearby to track and observe the booster as it makes its descent.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232210" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The addition of the helicopter is significant; it means Rocket Lab is getting closer to attempting its ultimate plan for reusability: using a parachute to slow the velocity of the booster enough that the helicopter can capture it in mid-air. While the helicopter won’t be attempting a mid-air capture tonight, it will be performing requisite tests to ensure the concept of operations is viable in the future.</p>
<p>“We’ve perfected Electron’s controlled descent, demonstrated flawless parachute deployment, and successfully plucked stages from the ocean. Now we’re gearing up for the next stage – preparing to use a helicopter to catch a rocket as it descends to Earth from space,” CEO Peter Beck said in a statement. “It’s ambitious, but with each recovery mission we’ve iterated and refined the hardware and processes to make the impossible ordinary.”</p>
<p>The primary goal of the mission will be to send two BlackSky Earth imaging satellites to orbit, part of a rapid five-launch agreement for BlackSky between Rocket Lab and launch services provider Spaceflight Inc. The satellites were originally scheduled to go up in August, part of a launch schedule that included two other dedicated missions, but those were delayed due to lockdown restrictions caused by a small outbreak of coronavirus in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Operations have experienced disruptions due to some of the most restrictive COVID-19 measures globally, including current stay-at-home orders which prevent launch operations from taking place,” CEO Peter Beck told investors during <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/rocket-labs-order-backlog-tops-141m-as-the-company-inks-five-launch-deal-with-kineis/">a third-quarter earnings call</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The two BlackSky satellites will join seven others already in orbit, part of the geospatial intelligence company’s larger plans to grow its constellation to 14 satellites by the end of this year. Earlier this year, two BlackSky satellites <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/rocket-labs-20th-electron-launch-ends-in-failure-with-the-loss-of-its-payload/">were lost due to a significant anomaly</a> that occurred shortly after the Electron’s second-stage ignited.</p>
<p>This is Rocket Lab’s twenty-second Electron launch and the fifth mission this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">People subscribe to music, so why wouldn’t they subscribe to carbon offsetting to alleviate their conscience about the climate crisis? That’s partly the thinking behind U.K. startup <a href="https://ecologi.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ecologi</a>, which uses the funds to plant 1 million trees every 10 days in places like Africa and Latin America, as well as doing things like protecting peatlands in Indonesia. By doing this it reduces your carbon footprint by buying carbon offsets tailored to what you consume.</p>
<p>In April, Ecologi closed a seed investment round of $5.75 million (£4.05 million) at a pre-money valuation of £16.5 million from lead investor General Catalyst, with and Entrée Capital.</p>
<p>The subscription service &#8212; used by 35,000 individuals and businesses &#8212; allows members to “<a href="https://ecologi.com/elliot?treeId=60bcf53a4dd2669e3bd5750f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grow their own forest</a>” with at least 12 trees a month and offset their carbon footprint by funding a wide range of the carbon-reducing projects.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232195" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Launching in 2019 and bootstrapped until now, the company also puts all receipts, certificates, board minutes and financial statements all up on their <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dACvzjE5nBE1cKZBAhYzsUa7rIiLJqCWXVgY4bNS8_Q/edit#gid=1742437033" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public ledger</a>.</p>
<p>It’s now hit a pre-money valuation of £75 million after exceeding its £2 million crowdfunding target on the U.K.’s Crowdcube platform. The money will be used for product development, growing its team and expanding in the U.S. and EU. It&#8217;s also now awaiting B-Corp certification.</p>
<p>In early 2022 the company also plans to launch <a href="https://ecologi.com/business/ecologi-zero" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ecologi Zero</a>, its real-time carbon footprinting software for businesses.</p>
<p>This would compete with other carbon footprinting SaaS startups such as Normative, Spherics, Plan A and others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ecologi claims to have grown by more than 650% in nine months, and increased its impact through carbon reductions by 330% in the last year. In January 2021, turnover was at £3.0 million ARR (annual recurring revenue), but the company projects it will end the year with £8.5 million ARR.</p>
<p>In total, the company claims to have planted over 25 million trees and offset 1.2 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. The majority of these trees were planted across Madagascar, Mozambique, Nicaragua, the United States, Australia, the U.K. and Kenya. Projects the company supported in the quarter included protecting peatlands in Indonesia and producing energy from landfill gas in Turkey and from waste rice husks in India.</p>
<p>Elliot Coad, CEO and co-founder, commented: “Community ownership is at the heart of what we do, and has been the driving force behind our growth over the last two years, so we felt it was only fitting that we offered our loyal subscribers the chance to own a stake in Ecologi. Since GC’s investment in April this year, we have spent the last three months turning down VC money in favour of a community based crowdfund.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Toronto Transit Commission has confirmed that the personal information of tens of thousands of employees may have been compromised as a result of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> attack on its systems last month.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>The agency added that while there is “no evidence” that any of the information has been misused, it is notifying those individuals affected and will provide them with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/credit-monitoring/">credit monitoring</a> and identity theft protection.

<p>The ransomware attack on October 29 resulted in problems with vehicle tracking and &#8220;next bus&#8221; systems, and the loss of the online Wheel-Trans booking system, said TTC chief executive Rick Leary. He added that the incident resulted in &#8220;a number of the TTC’s servers being encrypted and locked,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While most customer-facing systems have been restored already, the TTC’s internal email system remains offline.</p>
<p>“On behalf of the entire organization, I want to express my deep regret that this has occurred to everyone who may be impacted,” said Leary.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“It is not lost on me that organizations like ours are entrusted with significant amounts of personal information and it is essential that we do our best to protect it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the coming weeks, we will continue rebuilding the remaining impacted servers and internal services, like re-establishing external e-mail capabilities. But in truth, and based on the experiences of other organizations, this could take some time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leary added the fact there have been nearly 700 similar cybersecurity attacks involving public and private sectors groups in Canada. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">On October 30, the day before TCC&#8217;s ransomware attack, a separate cyberattack <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/health-services-it-outage-update-nov-1-1.6232426" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck</a> Newfoundland and Labrador&#8217;s health system data centres. In <a href="https://www.gov.nl.ca/releases/2021/exec/1109n07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a> released this week, the provincial government said “it has been determined that some personal information and personal health information was accessed from the systems.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube today announced its decision to make the &#8220;dislike&#8221; count on videos private across its platform. The decision is likely to be controversial given the extent that it impacts the public&#8217;s visibility into a video&#8217;s reception. But YouTube believes the change will better protect its creators from harassment and reduce the threat of what it calls &#8220;dislike attacks&#8221; &#8212; essentially, when a group teams up to drive up the number of dislikes a video receives.</p>
<p>The company says that while dislike counts won&#8217;t be visible to the public, it&#8217;s not removing the dislike button itself. Users can still click the thumbs down button on videos to signal their dislike to creators privately. Meanwhile, creators will be able to track their dislikes in YouTube Studio alongside other analytics about their video&#8217;s performance, if they choose.</p>
<p>The change follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/youtube-tests-hiding-dislike-counts-on-videos/">an experiment YouTube ran earlier this year</a> whose goal was to determine if these sorts of changes would reduce dislike attacks and creator harassment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232098" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At the time, YouTube explained that public dislike counts can affect creators&#8217; well-being and may motivate targeted campaigns to add dislikes to videos. While that&#8217;s true, dislikes can also serve as a signal to others when videos are clickbait, spam or misleading, which can be useful.</p>
<p>YouTube said it had also heard from smaller creators and others who were just getting started on the platform that they felt they were being unfairly targeted by dislike attacks. The experiment confirmed this was true &#8212; creators with smaller channels were targeted with dislike attacks more than larger creators were.</p>
<p>YouTube declined to share the specific details or the data collected through those experiments when TechCrunch asked, however. But it said it ran its tests for &#8220;multiple months&#8221; and conducted &#8220;in-depth analysis of the impact&#8221; as to how the changes affected both users and creators alike.</p>
<p>The company had experimented with different designs for removing the dislike counts, including one where the word &#8220;Dislike&#8221; appeared underneath the thumbs down button instead of the number of dislikes. This is the design the company has now settled on, which is less of a disruptive change to the row of engagement buttons beneath a video.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2232172" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232172" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2232172" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/youtube-dislike.png?w=340" alt="" width="340" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/youtube-dislike.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/youtube-dislike.png?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/youtube-dislike.png?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/youtube-dislike.png?resize=340,680 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/youtube-dislike.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232172" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</em></p></div></p>
<p>The company would not be the first major platform to experiment with the idea of reducing the public visibility of signals that convey user sentiment. For similar mental health-related reasons, Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/instagram-private-like-counts/">a couple of years ago</a> began tests to hide its Like counts globally. It believed the focus on achieving Likes could be detrimental to its community and may make creators less comfortable expressing themselves on the platform. Ultimately, though, neither Facebook nor Instagram could fully commit to a decision and instead put <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/facebook-and-instagram-will-now-allow-users-to-hide-like-counts-on-posts/">the power to hide Likes back under users&#8217; control</a> &#8212; a move that effectively kept the status quo intact.</p>
<p>YouTube&#8217;s changes to the &#8220;dislike&#8221; count are being introduced at a time when there&#8217;s been a public reckoning over big tech and its impact on mental health, particularly when it comes to minors. Companies have been rethinking how their systems are designed to target and influence their user base, as well as what sort of changes they can make ahead of coming regulations. In a number of markets, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/">lawmakers</a> have been dragging in tech execs to hearings &#8212; YouTube included &#8212; and are crafting legislation aimed at reigning in some of tech&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/why-facebooks-angry-emoji-should-interest-the-us-sec/">more</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/the-fda-should-regulate-instagrams-algorithm-as-a-drug/">problematic elements</a>. Mental health is only one area of regulatory interest, though, along with ad targeting, privacy, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/leak-shows-facebooks-business-model-needs-regulating-says-mep/">algorithmic boosting</a> of misinformation and more.</p>
<p>In YouTube&#8217;s case, the company has attempted to get ahead of some of the required changes by implementing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/google-to-introduce-increased-protections-for-minors-on-its-platform-including-search-youtube-and-more/">increased protections and privacy features</a> for users ages 13 to 17 while also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/youtube-warns-creators-it-will-start-to-demonetize-low-quality-kids-videos-next-month/">decreasing the monetization potential</a> for &#8220;unhealthy&#8221; kids&#8217; content. But the larger shift in the market is also pushing companies to consider the other areas of their platforms that are potentially toxic to broad groups of people.</p>
<p>That said, YouTube told TechCrunch today&#8217;s removal of the dislike count is not being guided by any regulatory changes, but rather its support for creators.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are proactively making this change because YouTube has a responsibility to protect creators, especially smaller creators, from harassment and dislike attacks,&#8221; a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The company, of course, is also rolling this out when the battle for creator talent is becoming hugely competitive among tech giants. Today&#8217;s social platforms are establishing funds to retain their top creators amid increased competition, particularly from the growing threat of TikTok. YouTube this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/youtube-announces-a-100m-fund-to-reward-top-youtube-shorts-creators-over-2021-2022/">announced a $100 million creator fund</a> to jumpstart its short-form video platform, for example. And, over the past year or so, it&#8217;s introduced several new <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/make-youtube-more-inclusive-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/make-youtube-more-inclusive-platform/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1636565624705000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3628II0au1cO-CTWEfIMN7">features</a> and <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-update-to-our-harassment-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-update-to-our-harassment-policy/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1636565624705000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1l6b58XGAH7ZhyGkzzxhB7">policies</a> aimed at improving the creator experience.</p>
<p>The changes to the dislike count will roll out globally across YouTube&#8217;s platform starting today, including all devices and the web.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The sales process can be chaotic, with data flowing in from a variety of sources and a number of people involved. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">Salesforce bought Slack</a> for more than $27 billion last year because it recognized it could be the glue that holds this together. <a href="https://momentum.io/">Momentum</a>, an early-stage startup, wants to build on that relationship by being the automated collaboration layer between sales and the rest of the organization.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced a $5 million seed round led by Basis Set Ventures with participation from Inovia Capital, Leadout Capital, South Park Commons and a group of industry angels.</p>
<p>Momentum CEO and co-founder Santiago Suarez Ordoñez said the company originally wanted to build a deal room on top of Slack, but when Salesforce took that route in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/after-spending-28b-salesforce-announces-first-direct-integrations-with-slack/">its first round of Slack integrations</a> in August, the company decided to attack a different problem.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232111" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s interesting, and I think this is what ultimately differentiates us from what Salesforce could put together, is as we went down that path of deal rooms and collaboration and we delivered value there, we started realizing that collaboration and sales can be so much more,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He said the founders recognized that salespeople need to connect not only to Slack and Salesforce &#8212; they need to connect with tools like Google Calendar, Asana and Jira, and automate follow-ups from a single place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Momentum ended up turning into a platform that allowed those people to streamline that process. Instead of going into Jira and knowing [how to] file a ticket for my security team, I just go to Momentum and raise my hand and I say &#8216;I need a security review,&#8217; and Momentum has codified the process of finding where to go, creating the ticket, sharing all the context about the deal in that ticket for the rep, and the rep doesn&#8217;t have to do anything at that point,&#8221; Suarez Ordoñez explained.</p>
<p>He said that while they still have the deal-room functionality along with this task-driven capability, the plan is to build on that to create a complete platform of similar automated workflows inside Slack, such as getting approval for a discount rate or asking for engineering support for a sale.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company just hired its 14th employee since closing the seed round in August. The company has a diverse founding team that includes Suarez Ordoñez&#8217;s wife &#8212; COO Ashley Wilson &#8212; and CTO Moiz Virani. The company said it takes building a diverse team extremely seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;We actually have a mandate from the top to drive diversity and inclusion,&#8221; Suarez Ordoñez said. &#8220;In fact, one of our investors made it a term in their investment and it ended up being what made us go in with them and make room for them in our round as an investor.&#8221; He added that half the board is female at this early stage and that two of the three investor partners in the round are women.</p>
<p>They launched the company last year amid the heart of the pandemic. &#8220;One of the craziest things about it is that we already had half a dozen employees and customers and we had raised millions of dollars and 99% of that work had happened sitting at the kitchen table in my house, which was quite a wild realization of what happened,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company is now operating at least part of the time out of shared spaces, but he said that being together makes it feel more real to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that it wasn&#8217;t real half a year ago, [but the fact that] we couldn&#8217;t be together was just just a weird artifact of how the world was working,&#8221; he said.</p>
