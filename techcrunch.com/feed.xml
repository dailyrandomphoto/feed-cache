										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy now, pay later (BNPL) offerings have existed for a long time, but increased in popularity as the pandemic made more people shop online and conserve cash</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though BNPL has taken off in most parts of the world, it’s yet to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pick up steam in Africa. But in countries such as South Africa and Egypt, there is a newfound surge in demand for such services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the latest development, <a href="https://sympl.ai/">Sympl</a>, an Egyptian fintech founded only five months ago, announced today that it has picked up $6 million in seed funding following a soft launch in October</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245234" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beco Capital led the five-month-old startup’s seed round, while A15 and Global Ventures participated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-el-shabrawy-el-feky-4071739">Mohamed El-Feky</a>, <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/yasmine-mohamed-henna-9ab474113">Yasmine Henna</a>, and <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/karim-tawfik-a8a3aa45">Karim Tawfik</a> started Sympl in August this year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We all joined forces to establish Sympl because we all share the vision that there is a huge opportunity for the buy now, pay later here in Egypt, given its very populous market,” founder and CEO El-Feky told TechCrunch on a call.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a consumer </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> driven market where we have a lot of accessibility to consumer products and services, online or offline.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s a little twist to Sympl’s offerings which the founders made in a bid to localize its product for the Egyptian market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the CEO’s words, Sympl operates a save your money, pay later model rather than the normal buy now, pay later model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sympl says it targets over 50 million debit and credit cardholders in the country. And like any BNPL service, the company wants to incentivize a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of this demographic at checkout, in-store or online.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With no pre-registration required and payment plans approved at checkout, Sympl allows merchants to sell </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to consumers on short-term, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interest-free (zero-interest) payment plans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A typical BNPL model involves a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> split into </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> equal payments. The first payment, usually 25% of the total </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at checkout, while the rest </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are paid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in three installments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sympl operates a different method the company says will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">help its customers save better while making purchases</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The platform is an evolution of customers’ checkout experience. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than promoting purchasing, it gives customers more choices at the checkout and promotes customer saving, flexible cash flow management, and a better matching of income and expenditure, without compromising their lifestyle,” the company said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When customers check out from one of Sympl’s merchants, the company acknowledges the funds in the customers’ bank accounts and charges them an upfront fixed fee of 100 Egyptian pounds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The fee covers the future collection of repayments and remains the same irrespective of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Sympl offers customers the option to use a zero-interest pay later plan. The rest of the payments can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between three to five installments. The company said that the plans</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">cater to different segments of customers’ employment status &#8212; gig workers, freelancers, self-employed and regular employees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the saving that we do to the customer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So instead of spending all your money right now on a single transaction, you can walk out of the store having the product and having your money in your pocket while paying it on three to five equal payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It can be on a monthly, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bi-weekly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or weekly basis,” said the CEO. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sympl’s launch in October was strategic. For a week, it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exclusively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> partnered with Tradeline, the largest reseller of the iPhone 13 in Egypt, so customers could only buy the phone online or offline via Sympl</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During our launch, we were lucky enough because Mohamed and I had a lot of partners who worked with us at valU (the consumer fintech where both worked before Sympl). And because of our success back then, they came to us as merchants and wanted to partner with us at Sympl,” said COO Henna.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They like the platform because they think it’s unique because, for the first time in Egypt, we’re offering debit or pay later options for the debit card population in Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sympl has onboarded up to 240 merchants with products in electronics, fashion, appliances, furniture, travel, healthcare, jewellery and education, the company said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It plans to reach 1,000 stores by mid next year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henna also mentioned that Sympl is growing 25% week-on-week </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the number of transactions made on the platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sympl will use the investment to e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">xpand its merchant network, build technical upgrades and enhancements, hire more talent and expand its footprint across Egypt to cover all 27 governorates in the country (it’s currently in two)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">El-Feky said when the company raises its next round of investment, expansion outside Egypt will be on the cards. The most likely destination? Saudi Arabia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is one of the most vibrant markets and populous markets and has similar demographics and consumer behaviour. So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this would be our first regional step out of Egypt.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.collective.work">Collective</a>, a French startup that wants to redefine what it means to work as a freelancer in development, product design, digital marketing, data strategy and more. The company has built a platform so that multiple freelancers can team up and work together on the same project.</p>
<p>The trick is that those teams remain independent freelancers. They’re not working for the same company, they’re just working on the same project. Everyone then gets their cut of the invoice when the job is done.</p>
<p>Originally backed by startup studio <a href="https://www.efounders.com">eFounders</a>, Collective has raised an $8 million seed round led by <a href="https://www.blossomcap.com">Blossom Capital</a>. Many business angels are also investing in the startup. Some freelancers who use Collective for their freelancing jobs have also invested in Collective — they’re putting their money where their mouth is.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244249" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Platforms for freelancers aren’t new. Many developers based in France are probably already familiar with <a href="https://www.malt.fr">Malt</a> or <a href="https://www.comet.co">Comet</a>. But Collective doesn’t want to go head to head with these marketplaces. Instead, Collective only accepts teams of freelancers — it can be a squad, a studio, a flash team, a community…</p>
<p>“We are creating the first SaaS platform dedicated to independent collectives,” co-founder and CEO Jean de Rauglaudre told me. He listed the advantages of a collective versus a more traditional development agency company.</p>
<p>According to him, a team of freelancers is usually cheaper than an agency because there are some fixed costs with the agency. While this is true, freelancers still have to pay for health insurance, pension contributions, etc. Essentially, it’s a more individualistic way of thinking about a group of colleagues as collectives don’t share the same benefits.</p>
<p>But if you’re okay with that, there are some more obvious advantages with collectives. For instance, participating in a collective is a more flexible way of working as you can still work on your own projects on the side. You can also choose to participate in multiple collectives at once.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup offers you some much needed tools. For instance, if you choose to manage your collective on the platform, you can create a single invoice and send it to your customer. The customer only has to pay the invoice once. Collective takes care of splitting payments and topping up individual accounts.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, Collective uses a special status called ‘portage administratif’. With this trick, Collective can legally issue invoices and represent teams. On the other side, freelancers can choose their own incorporation status.</p>
<p>In addition to administrative stuff, Collective also wants to provide some marketing tools. For instance, the company wants to develop a lightweight content platform so that each Collective can create their own branding, showcase their portfolio of work and more.</p>
<p>The startup takes a small cut on bills. If clients come from Collective directly, the company then asks for a bigger cut. And it seems to be working well as hundreds of companies have worked with a collective already.</p>
<p>Figuring out the governance system of those collectives is also going to be interesting. Unlike traditional private companies, nobody “owns” the collective, which means that everybody has a say when it comes to choosing the next job or the remuneration system.</p>
<p>Many DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) rely on tokens on a blockchain to make important decisions. With Collective, there’s no blockchain involved. And the startup proves that you don’t always need a blockchain to reach a consensus.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Razorpay is making it more convenient for users to pay businesses with a faster checkout option as the leading Indian payments infrastructure giant pushes to win a bigger slice of the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>The new feature, called Magic Checkout, saves shopper’s information &#8212; password, card details, addresses &#8212; during their first purchase and prefills those when they transact with the same business or any other that also uses Razorpay to process its payments, the startup said.</p>
<p>Magic Checkout &#8212; which is similar to offerings provided by Bolt and Fast in the U.S. &#8212; is Razorpay’s attempt to help merchants ward off the 70% drop off they typically see during the last step of the transaction process, the startup said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245303" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The feature supports all payment methods including cash on delivery and requires minimal integration on the business’s end, the startup said. “With this unique checkout experience, shoppers can now checkout 50% faster while retailers can expect a 20% increase in conversions which means 20% more revenue for a business,” it said.</p>
<p>Magic Checkout is one of a series of announcements Razorpay, which counts Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Y Combinator and Salesforce <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/salesforce-backs-indian-payments-startup-razorpay/">among its backers</a>, made at its annual event called FTX on Thursday. The startup, founded nearly seven years ago by Harshil Mathur and Shashank Kumar, said it has registered over 300% growth for the second consecutive year.</p>
<p>As of early December, the startup had processed over $60 billion in transactions for its customers, up from the $50 billion goal it had set out for itself last December, it said. The startup, which has amassed over 8 million clients, said it is now aiming to process $90 billion in transactions by the end of next year.</p>
<p>Razorpay has established itself as the dominant payments infrastructure firm in India, where it competes with PayU and Cashfree. Stripe, the global payments giant, has also been operational in India for several years, though it has yet to make inroads in the country. Two of its key executives, including the head of Stripe in India, left earlier this year to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/24/stripe-backs-india-cleartax-in-75-million-funding/">start their own cross-border payments startup</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Of the 42 Indian startups that have become unicorns this year, 33 of them use Razorpay,” said Mathur in an interview with TechCrunch. “We keep saying, our growth happens with the growth of the ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Razorpay additionally introduced a new feature called RazorpayX Tax Payment Suite for its neobanking customers today that will serve as a single portal for tax disbursements. The feature allows businesses to import all their filings from other sources to help them save time. “Tax and Compliance are two of the most feared words for any business in India,” said Kumar.</p>
<p>“It is a one-stop platform for all tax payments needs of small businesses, be it TDS, GST, TCS or Advance Tax. Further, the RazorpayX dashboard provides businesses a single, transparent view of all disbursals for seamless collaboration between finance teams, external accountants, and business owners,” he said.</p>
<p>And last, Razorpay said it is also giving back to the community. It’s launched RIZE, a launchpad for the first-time entrepreneurs to help them with scores of crucial early-stage startup problems such as incorporating the firm and filing the first payroll, and guidance on securing loan and equity investments, Kumar said.</p>
<p>Razorpay is not taking any equity or charging any fee for the incubation program, which is attempting to create a community to help early-stage founders connect and engage with late-stage founders and other mentors.</p>
<p>For Rize, the startup said it has partnered with over 50 product companies including AWS, Freshworks, WeWork, Zoho, Shiprocket, WebEngage and others to create the comprehensive toolkit, along with benefits worth $500,000 on Razorpay and its partner products at no charge.</p>
<p>“India is not like the U.S. You don’t get funding based on an idea. For funding, you need traction and that part is complicated. So we want to help startups solve that,” said Mathur.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.klarna.com">Klarna</a> is launching a desktop browser extension that provides many of the features that you can find in the company’s mobile app — but on your computer. In addition to the ability to manage your Klarna payments, the extension automatically applies coupon codes when you’re on a checkout page.</p>
<p>Klarna has acquired <a href="https://www.joinpiggy.com">Piggy</a> for the automatic couponing feature. Piggy originally built a browser extension that surfaces coupons and cashback offers when you purchase something — FinanceFWD first <a href="https://financefwd.com/de/klarna-kauft-piggy/">reported</a> the acquisition and Klarna isn’t disclosing the terms of the deal.</p>
<p>This is an interesting move from Klarna as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/paypal-to-acquire-shopping-and-rewards-platform-honey-for-4-billion/">PayPal acquired Honey</a> for $4 billion. Honey has also built a browser extension that helps you apply coupon codes on the checkout page. In other words, PayPal and Klarna are competing to build the dominant shopping browser extension.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242351" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Existing Piggy users will migrate to the new Klarna extension. They can choose to migrate their existing Piggy data or start from scratch with a new Klarna account. Overall, 70 employees were working for Piggy and the startup had 1.2 million users before the acquisition. They are joining Klarna and are now working on integrating Piggy’s couponing features with the rest of Klarna’s product offering.</p>
<p>In addition to the coupon aggregation feature, users can also accumulate cashback or gift cards depending on the country. Users in the U.S. and Germany will be able to get rewards in the form of cashback while users in the U.K. and France will receive gift cards.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2242368" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2242368" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Klarna-Web-Browser-Extension-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" class="size-full wp-image-2242368" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Klarna-Web-Browser-Extension-1.jpg 2055w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Klarna-Web-Browser-Extension-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Klarna-Web-Browser-Extension-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Klarna-Web-Browser-Extension-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Klarna-Web-Browser-Extension-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Klarna-Web-Browser-Extension-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Klarna-Web-Browser-Extension-1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Klarna-Web-Browser-Extension-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2242368" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Klarna</p>
<p>But Klarna’s new extension isn’t just a Honey-like extension. It’s also a way to buy now and pay later (BNPL) with Klarna — the startup is better known for its installment payment product after all. Right now, there are different ways to take advantage of Klarna’s ability to spread the cost of an expensive purchase.</p>
<p>If you’re on an online store with a Klarna button on the checkout page, you can log in with your Klarna account and choose to pay later — users can also use their Klarna account to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/klarna-offers-pay-now-option-in-u-s-klarna-card-coming-soon/">pay now</a>.</p>
<p>Klarna also offers BNPL options for in-store purchases. In some markets, Klarna also offers a card that lets you pay up to 30 days later. It works both online and in-store.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But what if you want to buy now and pay later on an online store that doesn’t natively support Klarna? You can open Klarna’s mobile app and generate a one-time card on the checkout page. It works like a regular Visa card, but it’ll charge your card over multiple installments.</p>
<p>Klarna’s new extension lets you generate one-time cards from your desktop browser. You can then copy and paste the card details in the payment field when you’re ready to pay.</p>
<p>The mobile app and browser extension should remain in sync. For instance, you can save an item from your computer and track it from the Klarna mobile app. Right now, the extension works in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.</p>
<p>The company plans to launch an extension for Firefox and Safari as well. Users in the U.S., the U.K., Germany and France can download the extension. It’ll be rolled out in more countries later.</p>
<p>With this new product, Klarna shows once again that it wants to build a consumer product and not just a B2B payment business. PayPal has been the clear leader in the digital wallet space. So it’s going to be interesting to see whether Klarna can challenge PayPal and become a habit for consumers when they’re paying online.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Danish startup <a href="https://www.pleo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pleo</a>, a developer of expense management tools aimed at SMBs to let them issue company cards and better manage how employees spend money, has picked up a large tranche of funding to help it double down on its business at a time of strong growth.</p>
<p>The company has raised $200 million, money that Jeppe Rindom, Pleo&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, said it will be using in areas like M&amp;A, picking up the pace on expanding to new countries, bringing more functionality into its core product, and generally expanding its presence as a key enabler of &#8220;the future of work&#8221; &#8212; a massive theme at the moment in the world of business, given the changes so many were compelled to make in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>(The news, in fact, is coinciding with Pleo holding &#8220;Forward,&#8221; a virtual conference on that very topic.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245181" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Indeed, while some areas of company spend like business travel and entertainment (eg, business lunches) have all but stopped for many, the actual need for companies to better manage how and where money is spent by employees is in reality greater than ever before, given the distributed way that many of us are working today.</p>
<p>&#8220;The relevance of tooling to allow workforces to work in smooth ways while being distributed is very high right now,&#8221; Rindom said in an interview. &#8220;You may not be going out as much, but distributed workers need access to funds for a piece of software, or a subscription, or something else. Previously it’s been easy to, say, borrow a card from manager or the finance team to handle this. But you can’t do that anymore. Our product has become increasingly relevant for that reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>New investor Coatue Management is leading this funding, with strong participation from Alkeon Capital. Previous backers Bain Capital Ventures, Thrive Capital, Creandum, Kinnevik, Founders, Stripes and Seedcamp also participated.</p>
<p>Notably, the cash injection is coming just six months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/pleo-raises-150m-at-a-1-7b-valuation-for-its-new-approach-to-managing-expenses-for-smbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pleo raised $150 million</a>.  At the time, that round in July was the largest-ever Series C for a Danish startup. This latest funding is actually an extension of that round, bringing the total for the Series C to $350 million. The valuation in the mean time has also shot up: six months ago, Pleo was valued at $1.7 billion; now it is $4.7 billion, making it one of the more valuable fintech startups in Europe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The reason for the fast funding &#8212; which started as an unsolicited offer, Rindom said &#8212; is due to a few different reasons.</p>
<p>First, there is Pleo&#8217;s growth. The company now has over 20,000 customers &#8212; up by more than 3,000 in the last six months, and currently averaging 1,000 new customers per month &#8212; in the six countries where it is now live: Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Spain, Ireland and the UK. The plan is next to open up for business in 14 more countries, starting with Austria, and followed by Finland, the Netherlands, France and Portugal up next; and to ramp up hiring beyond the 400 that currently work for Pleo.</p>
<p>&#8220;We already had very ambitious plans, to bring Pleo to all of Europe in the next one and a half years,&#8221; Rindom said. The company aims to have 1 million users by 2025.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The second reason is the company&#8217;s relevance to how people are working today, and the fact that the businesses that Pleo is targeting &#8212; as small as just a few employees, and most recently up to about 5,000, still &#8220;medium&#8221; in the world of enterprise &#8212; have never really had great products to address expenses needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Indeed many companies building products like these have mainly focused on large enterprises as customers. (That is changing fast, though: another big player in the same space as Pleo, Soldo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/soldo-raises-180m-for-its-expense-management-platform-for-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $180 million</a> this year, too.) Pleo&#8217;s tools today include card issuing, invoice payments, and out of pocket expenses, integrating all of this with existing accounting packages to help money management run more smoothly. <a href="https://www.pleo.io/en/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pricing</a> starts at a free and limited tier for the smallest customers up to five users, working up to £10 per person per month for bigger customers, as well packages designed for the largest users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The third reason for Pleo&#8217;s raise right now is one of venture money at the moment. VCs, working hard to deploy massive funds, are continuing to hunt very aggressively for the best opportunities in the market. Their focus is not just to fund companies just as activity is picking up, but to back those that have demonstrated good growth during even the leaner periods. </span></p>
<p>“We were impressed by how Pleo has already redefined the way that over 20,000 companies think about managing their expenses, saving them time and lowering costs while increasing transparency,&#8221; said Michael B. Gilroy, general partner of Coatue Management, in a statement. &#8220;We are proud to partner closely with Jeppe and the rest of the team to help drive their next phase of growth – as they continue to extend across Europe and work to transform how spend management works within businesses.”</p>
<p>“Europe is emerging as an important technology hub in both the public and private markets, as evidenced by the increase in venture capital activity across the continent,&#8221; added Deepak Ravichandran, general partner of Alkeon Capital. &#8220;Pleo is building the leading B2B spend management platform in Europe, driven by a best-in-class user experience and rapid product innovation. We look forward to working with Jeppe and the team as the business continues to accelerate and grow.”</p>
<p>&#8220;In July, we recognized that the future of work must empower employees with the tools they need to be effective, productive, and successful. Pleo understands this critical shift for modern companies toward employee centricity—providing workers with a fun-to-use spend management app that automatically tracks their corporate spending and generates expense reports, paired with the powerful tools businesses need to create full visibility and management of every penny spent,&#8221; added Bain partner Keri Gohman.&#8221;With this extension to the Series C, Pleo is in an even stronger position &#8211; they’re undeniably the dominant player in small business spend management, an $80B+ opportunity in Europe alone, and will only grow more essential to businesses as the company expands into bill payments in the near future.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Robotic Research, a self-driving technology company that has spent the last two decades developing on and off-road autonomous vehicles for the Department of Defense, raised a $228 million Series A round. The company will use the investment, which was led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Enlightenment Capital, to build out the commercial side of its  business.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Crescent Cove Advisors, Henry Crown and Company and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/luminar-volvo-subsidiary-partner-to-sell-automated-driving-systems-to-automakers/">Luminar</a>, a lidar company, also participated in the investment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">RR.AI, as the company has branded its commercial arm, currently has its vehicle-agnostic autonomy kits, called AutoDrive, in about 150 heavy-duty transit buses, Class 8 trucks and yard trucks operating on roads across the United States, Canada, Australia, Europe and Saudi Arabia, according to Alberto Lacaze, CEO of Robotic Research. Now, it&#8217;s just a matter of scaling.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245206" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Robotic Research has historically automated trucks for the U.S. army and navy, operating in areas that aren&#8217;t mapped and don&#8217;t have GPS, good communications or lined roads. The company&#8217;s autonomy stack also adds on sensors that commercial autonomous vehicles usually don&#8217;t use, such as stereo and structure for motion, a range imaging technique for estimating 3D structures from 2D image sequences, says Lacaze. As a result, RR thinks it has a leg up on competition that&#8217;s still afraid to operate self-driving trucks on roads with inclement weather.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Most people think robotics is some magic piece of software,&#8221; Lacaze told TechCrunch. &#8220;The reality is that robotics is more like a stamp collection. You have to collect all these different edge cases where you need to be able to run on slippery roads and with dust and without being able to see the lines and so forth. We have collected lots and lots of stamps. To a certain degree, a common day for a military application is the edge case for a commercial application.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">RR.AI has already deployed its technology broadly, so this funding is specifically geared towards expanding and industrializing commercial applications, says Lacaze.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Last year, <a href="https://www.roboticresearch.com/rr-to-make-transportation-history-ctfastrak/">Robotic Research won a contract with the Connecticut Department of Transportation</a> that would see three 40-foot electric buses automated and running on the CTfastrak corridor. The plan would be to scale that to an automated bus rapid transit line, bus platooning and precision docking. The buses operate at Level 4 capabilities, says Lacaze, but they will have human operators on board for safety. (<a href="https://www.sae.org/news/press-room/2018/12/sae-international-releases-updated-visual-chart-for-its-%E2%80%9Clevels-of-driving-automation%E2%80%9D-standard-for-self-driving-vehicles">SAE</a> defines Level 4 autonomy as a system that does not require a human to intervene but can only operate under specific conditions.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p id="speakable-summary">On the trucking side, RR.AI is working with sawmills in Canada to move logs, and says it will have a big U.S.-related announcement coming soon. The company will also be announcing an agriculture partnership in the coming months.</p>
<p>RR.AI&#8217;s go-to-market strategy is to focus on the &#8220;low hanging fruits,&#8221; says Lacaze, or the areas where there are few regulations or easy regulations to work around.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very interested in working in areas where we can produce with the sensors at the cost they are now, and where we can generate profit,&#8221; said Lacaze, noting that sensors needed for self-driving operations like cameras, lidar and radar are still very expensive, so it makes sense to put them on larger, heavy-duty, longer-lasting vehicles so the cost of the sensors can amortize over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are probably the only company in autonomy that has been profitable since inception. And the reason we were able to do that is we have concentrated on smaller markets but in the meantime, they have provided revenue right now. We don&#8217;t have to wait until 2025 to deploy trucks, and that allows us to grow faster and collect miles faster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Operating in robotaxis in the future is not out of the question for RR.AI, says Lacaze. The company&#8217;s strategy is to wait for the regulatory environment to improve and the cost of sensors to decrease before pivoting into new verticals. But as RR.AI attempts to scale in its comfort industries, it might find that there simply aren&#8217;t enough vehicles on the market to work with.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are kind of dependent on the vehicle manufacturer&#8217;s to produce since we don&#8217;t produce our own vehicles,&#8221; said Lacaze. &#8220;We are very carefully turning every stone over to find vehicles that are available in areas where it makes sense from a regulatory standpoint to deploy right now.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Andrew Chen has long been a student, and teacher, of how startups engage their users while managing to amass a slew of new ones.</p>
<p>Today, he espouses his learnings &#8212; as a founder and a former Uber exec who led the company&#8217;s &#8220;rider growth&#8221; product teams for several years &#8212; to his portfolio companies as a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz. Among these is All Day Kitchens, Clubhouse, Substack and Snackpass.</p>
<p>But to share those lessons more broadly, Chen, who has always been a <a href="https://andrewchen.com/">prolific</a> writer, has also published a brand-new book by HarperCollins titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cold-Start-Problem-Andrew-Chen/dp/0062969749#customerReviews"><em>The Cold Start: How to Start and Scale Network Effects</em></a>, in which he walks readers through interviews with 30 world-class teams and founders, including from Twitch, Airbnb, and Slack, to paint a picture of what it takes to turn a startup into a massive brand &#8212; then keep people coming back for more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245212" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We talked with Chen earlier today about the book, including how web3 projects fit, or don&#8217;t, into the mold of earlier startups. Excerpts from our chat follow, edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: </strong><strong>You surface a lot of anecdotes about overcoming so-called cold starts, including during the earliest days of Tinder. I wasn&#8217;t aware of that story beforehand. Can you walk us through what happened?</strong></p>
<p>The [first version] of the app was very good. It had swiping, it had profile photos, it had all the features that you&#8217;d want. But [after] [Tinder&#8217;s founders] invited a bunch of their friends just manually, these friends were just not sticking. There just weren&#8217;t enough profiles. So how do you get hundreds of people that are all desirable to want to use the app at the same time?</p>
<p>The way they did it was they went to the USC campus, which was nearby, they decided that they were going to sponsor a birthday party for one of the folks in the sorority system there. [The idea was to] throw this big party, invite hundreds of people. And they had bouncers in front of the party, so that you had to download Tinder in order to [gain entry]. And people went and it was a cool party, and the next day, they opened up the app, and they were like, &#8216;Wow, these are all these people that I did not get a chance to talk to.&#8217;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sean [Rad] really attributes those 500 people with helping him take over the USC campus [a formula that Tinder then used to make inroads at other schools].</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">You talk in the book about the importance of these &#8216;atomic networks.&#8217; In the case of Tinder, it sounds like it was 500 people. How does a founder figure out what size this needs to be? Is there a formula?</strong></p>
<p>I think one part of [the answer] is just reasoning conceptually and thinking about: is this a 2-person thing, a 10-person thing or a 100-plus-person thing that you need to build? You tend to be able to do this a lot more easily once you have a lot of data. When you read about these threshold points, like Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;7 friends in 10 days&#8221; or the idea that Airbnb thought they needed 300 listings of which 100 were reviewed, what [both were] really doing is picking that point on the curve where there&#8217;s a little kink that tells you that &#8216;Okay, at this point, this is when the product is starting to get really valuable.&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>Are there best practices for building that core audience?</strong></p>
<p>The thing we&#8217;re seeing across every single new category of products s that you need to be creative and inventive and not just replicate what&#8217;s already been done in the past. Otherwise, it gets it gets old. The first click-through rates on banner ads were actually over 70%, and these days, they&#8217;re well under 1%.</p>
<p>You also need to do something that matches with the value proposition and the type of product you&#8217;re building. If you are building something for social networks, then colleges and high schools are a great place to go. If you&#8217;re building something for workplace collaboration, you probably go to startups and small teams instead of larger companies. If you&#8217;re building something in web3, you have to go to the Discord servers and subreddits and talk to the the Twitter influencers who are at the heart of web3 in order to get it off the ground.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clubhouse closes an undisclosed $4B valuation Series C round, as tech giants&#8217; clones circle&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse/embed/#?secret=fY8yMxlEZA" data-secret="fY8yMxlEZA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Regarding Clubhouse specifically, it did not depend in any way on college students discovering the platform to thrive, at least initially. Is that correct?</strong></p>
<p>I think I was user 104, and when we led the Series A investment and I joined the board, the company actually only had 500 daily active users, so it was very small. The early atomic network of Clubhouse was really [founder] Paul [Davison] and Paul&#8217;s friends in the San Francisco Bay Area, and we started to see amazing retention. The amount of time that [these individuals] spent listening in the app was over an hour-and-a-half per session, which is just incredible.</p>
<p>In some of the later rounds, where we actually doubled down and tripled down on the company, some of the analyses [tied to] [Clubhouse-provided] data, not just for the U.S. but data specifically for Sweden and specifically for Nigeria and some other smaller countries. What we were looking for is the networks built in some of these other countries and whether the retention rates and engagement were as good as in some of the more mature markets. What we saw was that the data was fantastic. It showed that you could take the Clubhouse network, decompose it into a network of smaller networks, and these looked like multiple atomic networks. That helped us really build the conviction to continue to support the company and continue to invest more.</p>
<p><strong>How do you advise founders when it comes to adding features that keep people coming back and could you speak specifically to Clubhouse&#8217;s plans?</strong></p>
<p>Going back to the college audience, I remember when Facebook first came out, and everyone was like, Why do I need a Facebook account? Or people think, Why do I need a Twitter account? It&#8217;s only when the network around someone &#8212; their friends, their family, the content creators they&#8217;re interested in &#8212; actually arrives that platforms become really sticky. And I think that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to see with products like Clubhouse and like Substack.</p>
<p>Right now, if you&#8217;re in the media industry, if you&#8217;re in politics, if you&#8217;re in tech, you&#8217;re very excited about what Substack does, but if you&#8217;re outside those interest areas, you don&#8217;t get it yet. But they&#8217;re doing so much around chefs and cooking. They&#8217;re doing a ton around comics right now and graphic novels. And they&#8217;re going to light up, vertical by vertical, all these different categories. And it&#8217;s going to become way more interesting as you go. Clubhouse is doing very much the same thing. I think they&#8217;re very interested in sports right now. They&#8217;re very interested in, and always have been, news and politics. As each of these verticals are built out, [both platforms] will become more powerful and more compelling to a wider number of people.</p>
<p><strong>What impact do you think web3 will have on building networks?</strong></p>
<p>Web3 has network effects built into its core, so I think it&#8217;s going to educate a whole new generation of founders about what it takes to start a network effect. What do I mean by that? Bitcoin is valuable because other folks think that Bitcoin is valuable. And even if you were to fork the source code and you were to fork the blockchain and you were to run your own version of a Bitcoin, it just wouldn&#8217;t have the same dynamics or value. You need more people to believe in it. The same is true of Bored Ape and CryptoPunks; they&#8217;re valuable because other people think they&#8217;re valuable.</p>
<p>Because there are network effects built at the core [of web3], it also means you also have a cold start problem, because if you create a whole new drop of 10,000 NFTs, you need to figure out: are you going to go to the right Discord servers and getting the right community excited about these? If you don&#8217;t, you can push the NFTs out there and no one&#8217;s going to buy them. So there is a cold start problem at the heart of many of the web3 ideas out there, and I certainly look forward to the update that&#8217;ll have to write in five years that replaces all the case studies like Tinder and Dropbox and Slack with all their web3 versions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Kenyan fintech <a href="https://kwara.com/products">Kwara</a> was launched in 2019 to help credit unions (savings and credit cooperatives societies, SACCOs) in the East African country shift to digital platforms by providing them with its proprietary Back-end-as-a-service (BaaS) software.</p>
<p>The startup’s trajectory has been steep, as its clientele shot up from two to 50 in just over two years. This is as it became clearer to the country’s cooperative credit-unions that they needed more technology to remain competitive.</p>
<p>Kwara is now moving a step further to build the next-generation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/neobank-hatch-series-b/">neobank</a> that will give credit-union members access to instant loans and third-party services such as insurance, as the start-up moves to offer end-to-end solutions to its clients.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245090" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup has raised $4 million in a seed round to build a neobank app that will enable individuals to sign-up with their preferred credit unions to access various financial services.</p>
<p>“We want to make credit unions as efficient as they can be by giving their members the kind of neobank experiences they wish to have,” Kwara co-founder and CEO, Cynthia Wandia told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>This is expected to open up new borderless avenues for the lending institutions to sign up new members and help credit-unions shift away from tedious paper-based systems and the need for elaborate brick-and-mortar branches. Members using the app, which is set for launch mid next year, will be able to track their personal financial flows from the app too.</p>
<p>The beta version of the app has been tested for feasibility, with an uptake of between 60% and 90%, Kwara co-founder and COO, David Hwan said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The app gives power to the members, who have the ability to view and download their financial statements, apply for loans and make repayments. By giving power to the members, we are extending the freedom that credit unions need to focus on their core business or more value-added tasks,” said Hwan.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2245287" style="width: 1743px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2245287" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2245287 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kwara-Neobank.png" alt="" width="1733" height="976" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kwara-Neobank.png 1733w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kwara-Neobank.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kwara-Neobank.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kwara-Neobank.png?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kwara-Neobank.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kwara-Neobank.png?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kwara-Neobank.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1733px) 100vw, 1733px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2245287" class="wp-caption-text">Kwara is building a neobank for credit unions.</p></div></p>
<p>Kwara said that its existing clients have experienced a membership growth of over 19% year on year, three times the global average, as the loan base of credit unions using its technologies went up 46%, about five times the national average. On its platform, Kwara supported $40 million in transactions between credit unions and their members.</p>
<p>Credit unions leveraging technology also boast member confidence and trust, which, in turn, yield new sign-ups. Wandia said that Kwara is helping them to run a modern banking business since with the right support they are banks waiting to happen.</p>
<p>“Right from the start, we decided to give our clients something that they could use to become a bank.”</p>
<p>“I think that&#8217;s made a big difference in a short amount of time in terms of building up the credibility on the product side because we were able to come to the table with a product that just out of the gate could run a bank, which is unusual, because normally that type of stuff is completely out of their price range,” she said.</p>
<p>Kwara has over the last year entered South Africa and Philippines, as the demand for its services grew beyond Kenya. It hopes to triple the number of credit unions using its software to 150 by the end of 2022. The startup currently serves 60,000 Sacco members but is also looking to cross the 100,000 mark by the end of next year. The startup’s goal is to serve 1 billion people by 2030.</p>
<p>Wandia said that from the onset, it was clear that Kwara would expand beyond Kenya as they quickly discovered that most credit unions, especially those in emerging markets, had not caught the wave of technology.</p>
<p>Kwara has also started forging alliances with companies, to offer third party services on its app. The startup recently partnered with Lami Technologies, a Kenyan-based digital insurance company, to make accessible a wide range of insurance products including health, property, business and life covers on the app. This is as the startup continues to perfect its app in readiness for a full launch next year.</p>
<p>The seed round was led by Breega VC firm, with participation of SoftBank Vision Fund Emerge, Finca Ventures, New General Market Partners, Globivest and Do Good Invest. Other investors include Rabacap, Launch Africa, Norrsken Impact Accelerator, Future Africa, Samurai Incubate, DOB Equity and fintech angels.</p>
<p>“Over the years, we’ve seen an increasing interest in how to build wealth through community, as well as a shift in consumer preferences towards digital-first banking. Kwara’s unique approach is a catalyst for a new way of retail banking through digital-first credit unions,” said Breega’s founding partner, Ben Marrel.</p>
<p>Credit unions are usually formed by people with a common interest or members of an industry, like farmers or teachers, who buy shares in the institution, save money and take loans. They are popular in Kenya owing to their low-interest rate loans and ease in accessing credit when compared to conventional banks. About 175 credit unions are licensed in Kenya to serve nearly 4.1 million members countrywide &#8212; a vast majority remain unlicensed.</p>
<p>According to Kenya’s monetary authority, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), the total assets of licensed credit unions grew 13.5% last year to reach $5.6 billion. Member deposits and the appetite for loans also continued to grow but they also became vulnerable to cyber attacks due to their weak technology. The regulator recommended that they shift to better technologies to protect member deposits, solutions that Kwara is now providing.</p>
<p>“We are building the infrastructure and rails for the credit unions and their members to connect to everything that&#8217;s already out there,” Hwan said.</p>

The new funding brings its total raised so far to $10.5 million.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Upmesh will use the pre-Series A funding to expand its regional presence in Southeast Asia and launch its first Instagram live selling app and backend automation features like logistics automation. It also plans to double down on its live commerce products. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Since its seed round, Upmesh has nearly doubled its online merchants in less than three months with a growing merchant base by 30% month on month. In October, Upmesh was used by almost 300 live commerce merchants in Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines, with an annualized gross merchandise value of $40 million.  </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245161" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Upmesh’s tool helps merchants grow sales through analytics to identify their best-selling product items and patterns in buying behaviors. Its tool also provides e-commerce functions that automatically capture orders made in livestream comments and send a checkout link to buyers. At the same time, sellers go live on social media platforms like Facebook Live and Instagram Live.   </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Upmesh competes with e-Commerce platforms like Shopee and Lazada and SaaS tools, including Shopline, but the company offers live commerce on social media that attract more buyers and audience and provide automation to help customers grow their business, said Wong Zi Yang, CEO and co-founder of Upmesh.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Upmesh users range from mom-and-pop street shops selling on live streams to supplement foot traffic to specialized live commerce sellers moving thousands of stock-keeping units (SKUs). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Live commerce is transforming eCommerce and shaping the buying behavior of the digital consumer in Southeast Asia. While Upmesh provides a full technology and service stack to enable live commerce, it is even more critical to enabling small and medium sellers at scale. Small and medium sellers from the fastest-growing segment in eCommerce and their needs are largely unmet. Upmesh is focused on meeting their needs,” said Kuo-Yi Lim, co-founder and managing partner of Monk&#8217;s Hill Ventures. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We are glad to join forces with Monk’s Hill Ventures in our mission to transform eCommerce. We are united in our shared belief that community is the next frontier for eCommerce, and live commerce is the ideal medium for bringing community and commerce together,” said Wong. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian ride-hailing giant Ola has raised $139 million at a valuation of about $7.3 billion, it said in a filing, ahead of its plans to file for an initial public offering early next year.</p>
<p>Mumbai-headquartered financial giant Edelweiss led the new investment tranche. IIFL, Siddhant Partners, Tejal Merchantile, Hero Enterprise also poured money, Bangalore-headquartered Ola said in the filing, which was <a href="https://entrackr.com/2021/12/ola-valuation-crosses-7-3-bn-completes-geospoc-acquisition-for-3-5-mn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first reported</a> by Indian news outlet Entrackr.</p>
<p>The new investment comes five months after SoftBank-backed Ola <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/temasek-and-warburg-pincus-invest-500-million-in-ola/">raised $500 million in a round</a>, one of the largest in the internet consumer segment in India, led by Temasek and Warburg Pincus. Ola co-founder and chief executive Bhavish Aggarwal had also invested in that round, the firm said at the time.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245196" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ola &#8212; which operates in India as well as Australia, the U.K. and New Zealand and has over a million drivers on its platform &#8212; said at the time that its ride-hailing business had rebounded after New Delhi eased restrictions in the country.</p>
<p>Separately, Ola Electric has raised $52.7 million in a round led by Temasek, the firm said in a filing. This investment comes two months after Ola Electric, which spun out of Ola in 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/ola-electric-raises-200-million-at-3-billion-valuation/">raised $200 million at a $3 billion valuation</a> in a round led by Alpha Wave Global (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/falcon-edge-closes-first-tranche-of-10b-fund-rebrands-as-alpha-wave-global/">formerly known as Falcon Edge Capital</a>). Aggarwal also spearheads Ola Electric.</p>
<p>The firm, which unveiled its electric scooters in August, has delayed the delivery of the vehicle several times citing chip shortage. Furthermore, Bangalore-headquartered mobility startup Bounce this month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/bounce-infinity-e1-launch/">launched its own electric scooter</a> that is more affordable than Ola Electric’s offerings.</p>
<p>But the issues don’t stop there. Both Ola and Ola Electric have seen several key executive departures in recent months as a result of what Indian outlet Morning Context reported as <a href="https://themorningcontext.com/internet/bhavish-aggarwal-is-choking-ola" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toxic work culture and distrustful chief executive</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/byjus-geogebra-austria/">Byju’s buys Austrian edtech startup GeoGebra:</a> </strong>Indian edtech giant Byju’s is once again buying a smaller company, this time GeoGebra, or what TechCrunch described as an “interactive and collaborative mathematics learning tool.” We reported the purchase price as around the $100 million mark.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-apologizes-to-current-employees-for-blundering-the-execution-of-mass-layoffs/">That awful CEO is sorry about how he fired you:</a> </strong>By now you have seen the video of Better.com CEO Vishal Garg firing a big chunk of his staff in a stilted video call, despite having pulled forward hundreds of millions of dollars from a future fundraise to finance his company’s operations. He went viral, amazingly, with TikToks cropping up mocking his pretty sucky way of firing a bunch of folks before the holidays. Now he’s apologizing. Surely he will shape up now and stop committing such epic gaffes. We’re certain.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/synthesia-raises-50m-to-leverage-synthetic-avatars-for-corporate-training-and-more/"><strong>Synthesia’s bet on corporate avatars:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Jordan Crook wrote up a $50 million round for a startup betting on synthetic avatars and the work of turning PowerPoints into videos. It’s one of those ideas that if it takes off, will appear obvious in hindsight. Today, the future is less certain. Still, when it comes to doing something fresh, Synthesia is a good example of how startups can tinker with the digital world and perhaps write a new path forward for businesses more generally.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we get into a chunk of the day’s incremental startup news, Ron Miller <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/as-corporate-venture-accelerates-twilio-jumps-into-the-fray/">wrote up Twilio’s new corporate venture capital fund</a>. CVC is not a new idea, but it has seen its activity soar in recent quarters. Companies like Coinbase are rewriting the rulebook on how to invest from the corporate perspective. So, it’s not a <em>huge </em>shock to see Twilio jump into the game.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/black-ops-ventures-launches-to-invest-in-black-founders/">And speaking of new venture funds:</a> </strong>TechCrunch has a brief look today at Black Ops Ventures, a new $13 million fund built to invest in Black founders. While some progress has been made in terms of investing more frequently — more equitably, really — into Black-founded startups, the venture capital market remains markedly imbalanced. Here’s one step toward a more fair future.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/developer-productivity-startup-gadget-raises-8-5m-led-by-sequoia-and-bessemer/"><strong>Gadget raises $8.5M from blue-chip backers:</strong></a> Bessemer and Sequoia have teamed up to put $8.5 million into Canada-based Gadget, which builds software for developers. Per TechCrunch, the startup “bundles the tools, libraries, APIs and best practices needed by developers into a single experience.” DevOps is a huge industry, frankly, so this round is not a shock to our sensibilities.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/chainguard-seed-software-supply-chain-security/"><strong>Software supply chains need protection as well:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Never before have we spent so much time as a society discussing supply chains. I bet you know where more ports are than ever before. But <em>physical</em> supply chains are hardly the only type out there, it turns out. Chainguard just raised $5 million to help protect <em>software</em> supply chains, an important project given how some cyberattacks are targeting software dependencies to carry out impressive hacks.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/candela-hydrofoiling-electric-boats-24m-investment/"><strong>Electric boats?</strong></a><strong> </strong>Boats may be the plaything of the wealthy, but they are also a pretty good way to pollute the planet. Candela wants to fix the latter half of the preceding sentence with electric boats and just raised $24 million for its business.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/afero-raises-50m-series-c-for-its-security-focused-iot-platform/"><strong>Afero raises $50 million for its IoT platform:</strong></a> The IoT hype has died down, and from its ashes a number of companies are doing rather well. Samsara is going public next week — more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/samsara-could-become-a-decacorn-in-upcoming-iot-themed-ipo/">here</a>, if you’d like — and security-focused IoT platform Afero just put together eight figures of capital to scale its own service.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/nigerias-digital-payroll-platform-bento-expands-to-kenya-rwanda-and-ghana-to-enter-six-other-african-markets-in-2022/"><strong>Bento targets Kenyan, Rwandan, Ghanan markets:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Bento is a Nigeria-based “digital payroll and human resource management platform,” TechCrunch reports. Just don’t expect it to stay within its national borders — the startup has eyes on six new markets in the next year. Payroll and HR software, of course, are big the world around, so it’s not a surprise to see Bento scaling well in the African market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/lydia-grabs-another-100-million-for-its-european-financial-super-app/"><strong>Lydia adds crypto to its platform, then $100M to its accounts:</strong></a> TechCrunch noted when Lydia, an aspiring European financial super app, added both equity and crypto trading to its service. Today, the company announced a fresh $100 million funding round. The company is a reminder that France’s startup scene is not one that you should ignore.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/accounts-payable-automation-startup-tipalti-raises-270m-quadruples-valuation-to-8-3b/">Tipalti now worth $8.3B:</a> </strong>While midmarket accounts payable automation may not be the Most Fascinating Topic in the world, that fact doesn’t stop it from being lucrative. As Bill.com has built a huge business helping SMBs with the financial back office, Tipalti wants to help businesses one level larger. It just socked away $270 million at a new $8.3 billion valuation. The company was worth just $2.2 billion last October when it raised $150 million.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bay Area&#8217;s share of U.S. VC funding falls to lowest level in more than a decade</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven years ago, San Francisco Bay Area startups attracted more than 40% of all U.S. seed- and early-stage venture dollars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But according to &#8220;Beyond Silicon Valley,&#8221; a report released today by investment firm Revolution and PitchBook, that percentage fell to 27% this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s been more than 10 years since that percentage fell below 30%,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/silicon-valleys-share-of-us-vc-funding-falls-to-lowest-level-in-more-than-a-decade/">reports Mary Ann Azevedo, who interviewed Case and studied the report&#8217;s findings.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She identified several factors that are pushing investors in major tech hubs to venture outside their own backyards in search of opportunities. Many readers will be surprised to learn which city is now the top destination for dollars from NYC and SF-based investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This momentum we&#8217;re seeing now? You ain&#8217;t seen nothing yet,&#8221; said Case.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Niantic announced a Pokémon GO feature today that will incentivize users to conduct more AR scans of landmarks in their neighborhood. This user-generated data will help Niantic build its &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/niantic-raises-300m-at-a-9b-valuation-to-build-the-real-world-metaverse/">real-world metaverse</a>,&#8221; which will be powered largely by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/niantic-reveals-its-vision-for-a-real-world-metaverse-releases-lightship-ar-developer-kit/">Lightship</a>, its free AR Development Kit (ARDK).</p>
<p>In Pokémon GO, users visit PokéStops, which represent real-world places &#8212; these can be anything from a mundane mailbox, to a major historic site, to a cool statue that you never noticed in your neighborhood. Pokémon GO&#8217;s landmark database has gotten much bigger over time, but it was already pretty huge at launch — thanks largely to data submitted by players of Ingress, the game Niantic built back when it was a tiny side-project inside of Google.</p>
<p>To <a href="https://niantic.helpshift.com/a/pokemon-go/?p=web&amp;s=top-articles&amp;f=scanning-a-pokestop&amp;l=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conduct an AR scan</a> of a PokéStop, you tap a scan button and are then prompted to walk slowly around the area while your camera captures data about your physical, real-world surroundings. Players have the option to wait until later (perhaps when they&#8217;re connected to Wi-Fi) to send Niantic their scan. These scans help build out a 3D world map for Niantic&#8217;s games, as well as those developed through the ARDK.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245103" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>You&#8217;ve been <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/armapping-researchtask/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">able to scan</a> PokéStops and Gyms within the game for a while now, but there&#8217;s been little incentive for players to do so. Now scanning a PokéStop will cause it to &#8220;<a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/power-up-pokestop-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">power-up</a>,&#8221; yielding better in-game rewards for any player who visits the stop before said power-up wears off. Spinning a PokéStop always gives players items to help them catch Pokémon, but a powered-up Stop will give them even more.</p>
<p>PokéStops will have three visually distinct levels: they reach level one at five scans, level two at 10 scans and level three at 25 scans. The higher the level, the longer the power-up will last, and the more items it will reward. For Niantic, meanwhile, more scans = higher fidelity data.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scanning new places will help create exciting new AR experiences for Trainers worldwide, and long term will help create a Real-World Metaverse, where people can explore the world overlaid with digital creations,&#8221; the company said in an announcement.</p>
<p>While all players will be able to spin a powered-up Stop, they&#8217;ll have to reach level 20 before they can scan a landmark themselves — a way, perhaps, of avoiding spam uploads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri testified before Congress for the first time Wednesday, defending the app’s impacts on teens and its aspirations to bring younger children formally into the fold.</p>
<p>In September, leaked documents from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen painted a picture of a company that knows it takes a toll on the mental health of some of its most vulnerable users.</p>
<p>“Thirty-two percent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse,” researchers said in an internal presentation, reported by The Wall Street Journal. Internal research also found that within a group of teen Instagram users who said they experienced suicidal thoughts, 13% of British users and 6% of American users connected their desire to commit suicide to Instagram.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245121" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company now known as Meta conducted that research internally and it was only brought to light through a revelatory series of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports in The Wall Street Journal</a>. The leaked documents came up repeatedly in Wednesday&#8217;s hearing, with lawmakers on the Senate&#8217;s consumer protection subcommittee citing the revelations and pressing unsuccessfully for access to more of Instagram&#8217;s internal findings on its impacts on kids and teens.</p>
<h3>Disturbing findings</h3>
<p>In his opening statement, subcommittee chair Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said that just prior to the hearing, his staff again made a test to explore dangerous content on Instagram and easily found algorithmic recommendations serving dangerous content. &#8220;&#8230;Within an hour, all of our recommendations promoted pro anorexia and eating disorder content.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ranking member Marsha Blackburn&#8217;s own office also made a test account for a teen and noted that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/head-of-instagram-adam-mosseri-says-teen-accounts-created-on-the-web-dont-default-to-private/">defaulted to &#8220;public&#8221; rather than private</a>, as Instagram says that accounts for users under 16 do. Mosseri admitted that Instagram failed to enable the safety step for accounts create on the web.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri says teen accounts created on the web don&#8217;t default to private&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/head-of-instagram-adam-mosseri-says-teen-accounts-created-on-the-web-dont-default-to-private/embed/#?secret=QDplk1KCPn" data-secret="QDplk1KCPn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;This is now the fourth time in the past two years that we have spoken with someone from Meta and I feel like the conversation repeats itself ad nauseam,&#8221; Blackburn (R-TN) said during opening statements. &#8220;Nothing changes — nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the hearing, Mosseri followed Meta’s approach to recent damning reporting, dismissing some of the findings outright — even intuitive ones. In response to a question on concerns about Instagram&#8217;s addictive nature — a phenomenon that most Instagram users could attest to — Mosseri asserted that “Respectfully, I don&#8217;t believe that research suggests that our products are addictive.”</p>
<p>Prior to Mosseri’s testimony, Facebook’s Global Head of Safety Antigone Davis <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/">appeared before the Senate subcommittee</a> to address teen safety concerns. “We have put in place multiple protections to create safe and age-appropriate experiences for people between the ages of 13 and 17,” Davis argued, defending the company&#8217;s efforts.</p>
<p>Meta doubled down, defending its practices in light of the reports and Haugen’s subsequent testimony to U.S. lawmakers. The company argued that the precautions it takes on Instagram are adequate and that the research was taken out of context. “It is simply not accurate that this research demonstrates Instagram is ‘toxic’ for teen girls,” Facebook Head of Research Pratiti Raychoudhury wrote in a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post slamming The Wall Street Journal’s reporting</a>.</p>
<p>In late September, facing the firestorm of criticism, Mosseri announced that Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/instagram-puts-kids-version-on-ice-after-critical-backlash/">would pause its plans to develop Instagram Kids</a>, a version of the app specifically for children under 13. The company faces ongoing criticism from the mental health community and lawmakers in the U.S. and abroad who believe that Instagram is not a responsible custodian for the well-being of children and teens.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Instagram puts kids version &#8216;on ice&#8217; after critical backlash&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/instagram-puts-kids-version-on-ice-after-critical-backlash/embed/#?secret=bURsBgPSGN" data-secret="bURsBgPSGN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the hearing, Mosseri repeated the company’s argument that kids are already using the platform in spite of its age requirements and building a kid-specific app would create a layer of safety that doesn’t currently exist. “We know that 10- to 12-year-olds are online&#8230; we know that they want to be on platforms like Instagram,” Mosseri said. “And Instagram quite frankly wasn&#8217;t designed for them.”</p>
<h3>Meta still wants to regulate itself</h3>
<p>Mosseri also used the hearing to propose a new &#8220;industry body&#8221; that would create tech-wise best practices on issues like age verification, parental controls and product design for kids and teens. Mosseri also took the notable step of stating that Instagram would be willing to follow rules from this theoretical pseudo-regulatory agency in order to &#8220;earn some of our Section 230 protections.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blumenthal slammed Mosseri&#8217;s proposal for self regulation, pressing the Instagram head on what enforcement would look like in that scenario. Mosseri wasn&#8217;t eager to agree with Blumenthal&#8217;s suggestion that the U.S. Attorney General should be able to oversee enforcement if tech companies failed to meet their own standards. &#8220;Self policing based on trust is no longer a viable solution,&#8221; Blumenthal said, concluding the hearing.</p>
<p>Policy leads from YouTube, Snap and TikTok testified before Congress in October on the same issues, largely spending their time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-snap-youtube-hearing-congress/">contrasting their own policies</a> on kids and teens to those of rival Facebook. “Being different from Facebook is not a defense,” Blumenthal said during that hearing. “That bar is in the gutter. It’s not a defense to say that you are different.”</p>
<p>Last month, Instagram began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/instagram-tests-take-a-break-reminders-on-an-opt-in-basis/">testing an opt-in feature</a> called “Take a Break” that would remind users to take up to a 30 minute break from the famously addictive app, if enabled. A day prior to Mosseri’s testimony,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/instagram-announces-plans-for-parental-controls-and-other-safety-features-ahead-of-congressional-hearing/"> that feature launched</a> alongside the announcement that Instagram would roll out its first set of parental controls in March of 2022. Those controls will allow parents to monitor and limit time spent on the app but fall short of the powerful controls <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/tiktok-expands-parental-controls-to-include-search-commenting-and-account-privacy/">offered by rivals like TikTok</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is bringing back a chronological feed, according to statements made by Instagram head Adam Mosseri during <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/head-of-instagram-adam-mosseri-will-testify-before-the-senate-on-teen-mental-heath/">his testimony</a> today before a <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate panel</a> over the harms to young people using the app. Mosseri was asked if he believed consumers should be able to use the Instagram app without &#8220;being manipulated by algorithms,&#8221; and the executive said he would support giving people the option to have a chronological feed. He then added that the company was developing that option now, in fact.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe in more transparency and accountability and we believe in more control. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re currently working on a version of a chronological feed that we hope to launch next year,&#8221; said Mosseri.</p>
<p>Pressed for more details on the company&#8217;s plans on this front, Mosseri noted that Instagram has been for a few years experimenting with different ways to offer users more control over their experience. One idea it tested publicly was called &#8220;Favorites,&#8221; which allowed users to pick a subset of people whose accounts they wanted to see at the top of their feeds. The other idea the company had been working on is a chronological version of Instagram, Mosseri said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245109" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;I wish I had a specific month to tell you right now, but right now we&#8217;re targeting the first quarter of next year,&#8221; Mosseri noted as to when the chronological option would be introduced to the public.</p>
<p>Instagram&#8217;s switch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/15/filteredgram/">to an algorithmic feed back in 2016</a> was a decision that had been fraught with controversy. Although filtered feeds were becoming the norm across social media at the time, as they improved engagement metrics, many users were unhappy with the changes. Instagram even went so far as to agree to add more recent posts to its algorithmic feed<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/22/instagram-recent/"> due to the user backlash</a> in subsequent years after the new feed&#8217;s launch.</p>
<p>In 2020, the company had been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/instagram-latest-posts/">spotted building an internal prototype</a> of a &#8220;Latest Posts&#8221; feature that would allow users to get caught up on recent updates through a special section in the app, but it was not a full-fledged return to a reverse-chronological feed &#8212; like the one Facebook offers today as a News Feed option. The feature also never rolled out publicly to Instagram&#8217;s global user base.</p>
<p>Now, under oath, Mosseri is promising that users may actually get a chronological feed option once again. But it&#8217;s highly unlikely that Instagram would make this a default setting or even an obvious choice, given the benefits that an algorithmic feed brings in terms of keeping users engaged with the app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Crowdfunding platform Kickstarter is making a big bet on the blockchain, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/articles/the-future-of-crowdfunding-creative-projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcing</a> plans to create an open source protocol &#8220;that will essentially create a decentralized version of Kickstarter’s core functionality.&#8221; The company says the goal is for multiple platforms to embrace the protocol, including, eventually, Kickstarter.com.</p>
<p>Kickstarter is launching a new organization called Kickstarter PBC, which will begin development of the protocol. Kickstarter is funding the project, appointing an initial board for the organization and committing to be one of the first platforms on the protocol, though no specific timelines were offered for when such a transition might take place. The company also announced that they&#8217;re establishing an &#8220;independent governance lab,&#8221; which will publish research and engage with the community on the topic of protocol governance.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting path for Kickstarter, which already shares some philosophical DNA with blockchain products allowing consumers to support projects and build up a community around them while taking a stake in the success of those products. While the &#8220;stake&#8221; in Kickstarter&#8217;s model has been a completed physical or digital product, newer blockchain crowdfunding platforms are upending that model by giving users tokens tied to the projects which can accrue in value as the product matures. Some of these efforts are questionably legal, but there are endless ways to obfuscate what exactly is being bought and sold by users.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245083" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For the time being it seems Kickstarter is aiming to proceed slowly in terms of how the protocol will impact the user experience. &#8220;As a user, the Kickstarter experience you’re familiar with will stay the same. You won’t &#8216;see&#8217; the protocol, but you will benefit from its improvements,&#8221; a blog post from the company reads.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While web3 technologies have driven major excitement among technologists and amateur and professional investors alike, plenty of mainstream users still have hangups with the technology due to controversy around energy usage of some of the more popular networks, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Kickstarter is aiming to sidestep these concerns by placing their new vertical on the Celo blockchain, which uses a less energy-intensive consensus mechanism that the team behind it bills as &#8220;carbon negative.&#8221; </span>Other than highlighting that the protocol will leverage Celo, Kickstarter didn&#8217;t offer too many specifics about how it envisions Kickstarter PBC&#8217;s work developing in the near or far term.</p>
<p>Kickstarter isn&#8217;t the only &#8220;traditional&#8221; tech giant looking to develop an open source protocol that their own platform will eventually adopt; Twitter has been working on bluesky, an effort to develop a decentralized social media protocol.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/head-of-instagram-adam-mosseri-will-testify-before-the-senate-on-teen-mental-heath/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">testifying before the Senate</a> today about the impact of Instagram on teens&#8217; mental health. His first appearance before the Senate, this is just one of several hearings that have taken place ever since whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked documents from Facebook &#8212; now Meta &#8212; showing that the company knew it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/seeking-to-respin-instagrams-toxicity-for-teens-facebook-publishes-annotated-slide-decks/">harming teen girls</a>.</p>
<p>In July, Instagram gestured toward teen user safety by implementing a policy that made all accounts from users under 16 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">private by default</a>. But Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) said at the hearing that just yesterday, her team made an account for a 15-year-old, which didn&#8217;t default to private. She asked Mosseri directly why this happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">It</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">turns</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">out</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">that</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">we</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">default</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">those</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">under</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">the</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">age</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">of</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">16</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">to</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">private</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">accounts</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">for</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">the</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">vast</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">majority</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">of</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">accounts,</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">which</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">are</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">created</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">on</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">Android</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">and</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">iOS,&#8221; Mosseri said. &#8220;We have missed that on the web and we will correct that quickly.&#8221;</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245051" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Failing to uniformly implement the feature is a significant oversight for a company keen to look proactive on protecting its youngest users, particularly because the loophole remained open for months undetected.</p>
<p>Facing legislative pressure, Instagram continues to add more safety features like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/instagram-tests-take-a-break-reminders-on-an-opt-in-basis/">&#8220;Take a Break&#8221;</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/instagram-announces-plans-for-parental-controls-and-other-safety-features-ahead-of-congressional-hearing/">parental controls</a>, which will roll out in 2022. Following the whistleblower leaks, Mosseri paused the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/instagram-puts-kids-version-on-ice-after-critical-backlash/">development of Instagram Kids</a>, a product designed for users younger than 13.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple will not have to implement changes to its in-app purchase system and App Store guidelines as ordered by the judge&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">ruling in its court battle</a> with Epic Games. While Apple largely won that case, as the court ruled, Apple was not acting as a monopolist &#8212; the company had been ordered to stop preventing app developers from adding links that pointed users to other means of paying for their in-app purchases outside the App Store. Both Apple and Epic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-appeals-last-weeks-ruling-in-antitrust-battle-with-apple/">appealed</a> the original ruling &#8212; Epic because it was not successful with its larger claims, and Apple because it disagreed with this aspect of the ruling over in-app purchases. Apple originally had until December 9 to update its App Store policies, but had asked the court for a stay on the injunction regarding the changes to its in-app purchasing guidelines until the appeal was decided.</p>
<p>The appeals court has now granted Apple more time before the injunction goes into effect. That means developers will have to continue to use the existing in-app purchase system Apple provides. They won&#8217;t be allowed to link to or steer users to their own websites for payments from inside their apps.</p>
<p>In a document filed today in the U.S. Court of Appels for the Ninth Circuit (see below), the court decided Apple had demonstrated &#8220;at minimum, that its appeal raises serious questions on the merits of the district court&#8217;s determination that Epic Games Inc. failed to show Apple&#8217;s conduct violated any antitrust laws but did show that the same conduct violated California&#8217;s Unfair Competition Law.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245052" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The court additionally ruled that Apple has made a &#8220;sufficient showing of irreparable harm,&#8221; and so it granted Apple&#8217;s motion to stay part of the permanent injunction.</p>
<p>The stay will remain in effect until the appeals case is heard, the filing said.</p>
<p>Apple had tried before to argue its case for a stay and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/apple-ordered-to-comply-with-courts-decision-in-epic-games-case-over-in-app-payments/">the court denied the motion</a>. Its latest attempt was granted, after it changed tactics, arguing, among other things, that <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-threatens-commissions-on-in-app-purchases-outside-the-app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it would have to come up with</a> a whole new system to commission purchases that took place outside the App Store.</p>
<p>Epic Games declined to comment on the court&#8217;s decision.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>An Apple spokesperson, however, shared the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re constantly evolving the App Store to help create an even better experience for our users and the incredibly talented community of iOS developers. Our concern is that these changes would have created new privacy and security risks, and disrupted the user experience customers love about the App Store. We want to thank the court for granting this stay while the appeals process continues.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The venture capital market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">is on a tear</a>, pumping capital into a host of startups around the world. It&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/equity-tuesday-everyone-is-raising-money-at-the-same-time/">generally considered</a> a great time to raise capital and build a technology-centered, disruptive business.</p>
<p>For some, that is. While the venture capital boom of the last few years has helped a great number of founders, the capital is not landing equally. Women remain underinvested in, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/female-founders-are-making-a-buzzing-venture-backed-comeback/">despite some recent gains</a>. Black founders are raising more capital than ever, but still <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/something-ventured-funding-to-black-startup-founders-quadrupled-in-past-year-but-remains-elusive/">just a fraction of a fraction</a> of what others have managed in recent years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.blackopsvc.com/">Black Ops Ventures</a> wants to shake up the norm and invest in Black founders as its focus.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244345" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TechCrunch caught wind of Black Ops&#8217; founding and recent first close thanks to our familiarity with one of its partners, <a href="https://twitter.com/motownini">James Norman</a>. He&#8217;s the founder <a href="https://www.pilot.ly/">of Pilot.ly</a>, a technology platform built to collect audience insights regarding video content, and a partner at <a href="https://www.transparentcollective.com/#/">the Transparent Collective</a>.</p>
<p>The Black Ops team, apart from Norman, includes managing partner <a href="https://twitter.com/hautrepreneur">Heather Hiles</a> (Udemy, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation), partner<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanartgreen/"> Sean Green</a> (<a href="https://arternal.com/">ARTERNAL</a>), and principal <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ebony-peay-ramirez-b8578119/">Ebony Peay Ramirez</a> (Oculus, <a href="https://plum20.com/">Plum2.0</a>).</p>
<p>The first Black Ops fund is worth $13 million to date, though we expect that number to rise after it completes a second close. The group&#8217;s first capital pool <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/black-ops-ventures-launches-new-seed-fund-to-invest-in-outstanding-black-tech-founders-301436281.html">was sourced</a> from corporations (Northwestern Mutual, Bank of America) and well-known technology denizens, including Drew Houston and Ben Horowitz.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with Norman about the fund, curious about its general strategy. Per the founding member, Black Ops will invest at the seed stage, writing checks into rounds worth a few million dollars. The group&#8217;s intention, according to Norman, is to lead seed rounds, solving an issue that he&#8217;s seen with Black founders, namely that they wind up with interest from investors but no venture group willing to take point on their round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Black Ops intends to solve that by leading, allowing other capital pools to play catch-up with their own checkbooks.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s investments may also help overlooked founders hire folks that fall outside the networks of some more established venture capital groups. &#8220;If I went and raised a big round from some top-tier VC, do you think that those people can help me hire other people of color?&#8221; Norman asked TechCrunch rhetorically before supplying his own answer: No.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to build team [and] culture and scale a company in a way that&#8217;s sustainable over time and that fits the founder&#8217;s vision,&#8221; he said, adding that &#8220;the pieces of the [startup] puzzle that we&#8217;re gonna bring together are not available to Black founders anywhere else.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thesis at Black Ops &#8212; investing in Black founders &#8212; is pretty darn smart. There&#8217;s essentially infinite competition for white male founders coming out of a handful of U.S. schools. That dynamic leads to silly pricing at times, with investors competing with one another to get their capital into &#8220;hot&#8221; startups. Black founders rarely find themselves in a similar situation. That means that Black Ops will be investing in deals that, I presume, will both prove accretive for Black founders generally and lucrative for the firm itself.</p>
<p>Norman touched on this, saying that &#8220;nobody we ever pitched this [idea to] has ever heard the story that we pitched. We really detailed why this group of people is the biggest arbitrage opportunity to tech. [To] not invest in these people is crazy because you&#8217;re missing out on all the money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black Ops itself won&#8217;t be able to create parity in the venture capital world for Black founders, but it can make a dent in a problem that &#8212; despite all their wealth and putative brilliance &#8212; many venture groups have failed to tackle in any meaningful capacity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2014, more than 40% of U.S. seed- and early-stage venture dollars went to Bay Area startups.</p>
<p>But that was a long time ago.</p>
<p>In recent years, Bay Area startups have accounted for a smaller percentage of U.S. VC investment, according to <a href="https://revolution.com/beyond-silicon-valley-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Beyond Silicon Valley,&#8221;</a> a new report co-produced by venture firm Revolution and PitchBook. So far in 2021, only about 27% of U.S. VC dollars have gone to Bay Area startups. It&#8217;s been more than 10 years since that percentage fell below 30%, the study said, despite the fact that the country is on track to see record amounts of venture funding overall this year. We dug into the report and talked to Revolution CEO and Chairman Steve Case about the findings.</p>

<p>Case is the founder of the Revolution trio of funds (including the Rise of the Rest Seed Fund), which focus exclusively on investing outside of Silicon Valley. Since launching the platform in 2014, Case and his teams have invested in 194 companies across 89 cities.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Not only is 2021 a record year for dollars raised, it&#8217;s panning out to be a record year for Bay Area- and NYC-based VCs who are investing in startups outside their regions. As recently as 2017, more than 50% of early-stage Bay Area dollars were received by Bay Area startups. Today, that percentage is 37%, according to the Revolution/PitchBook report.</span></p>
<p>In each of the past two years, at least $11 billion of Bay Area capital has been invested outside the three major ecosystems. A decade ago, that figure was under $3 billion.</p>
<p>“When we look at the industries of the future, and the companies of the future, they&#8217;re going to be dispersed around the country and around the world and if all you&#8217;re doing is investing in your own backyard, you&#8217;re going to miss out on all the opportunities to invest in some of the iconic companies of the future,” Case told TechCrunch.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Peer-to-peer trading, face to face, eye to eye — it&#8217;s the way deals had been done for millennia, before distance and lack of trust forced us to use go-betweens such as banks and brokers to transact.</p>
<p>Now decentralized finance (DeFi) has taken us back to an over-collateralized future. We can transact peer to peer not only remotely but also trustlessly by interacting with a smart contract. This innovation has set the foundation for a financial renaissance that goes far beyond just replacing intermediaries.</p>
<p>Until recently, regulators have largely ignored this emerging parallel financial system. But with former blockchain professor Gary Gensler as chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, D.C. has woken up. The question is: How can authorities enforce regulations that don&#8217;t rely on the presence of intermediaries? And how will the regulation protect users and the market?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244794" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Decentralization &gt; deterritorialization</h2>
<p>DeFi protocols might appear out of regulatory reach. Copies of blockchain transaction history are stored in nodes all over the world, ready to reappear like the many-headed hydra if one should be compromised.</p>
<p>Yet history provides lessons of how regulators might think they can address DeFi.</p>
<p>Historically, regulators have only held purview over legal entities within their jurisdiction. This changed with the extraterritorial Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) of 2010, which saw U.S. authorities regulating beyond their currency and U.S. persons across the world and coordinating with other jurisdictions by signing intergovernmental agreements (IGAs) for enforcement.</p>
<p>The EU followed a similar approach with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018, writing regulations from their ivory tower to control the data of Europeans wherever they are in the world — though it remains unclear how authorities can enforce against organizations outside the EU.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Looking ahead, we could see regulators rely on similar extraterritorial methods in an attempt to reach into cyberspace and enforce regulation in DeFi.</p>
<h2>Choke points and on-ramps</h2>
<p>Even with extraterritorial enforcement, however, regulators would still need to identify choke points that could be used to control otherwise decentralized protocols.</p>
<p>These points of centralization already appear to be on the radar of regulators. As Gensler <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptos-defi-projects-arent-immune-to-regulation-secs-gensler-says-11629365401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remarked</a>: DeFi can be a misnomer, with platforms often being &#8220;decentralized in some aspects but highly centralized in other aspects.”</p>
<p>Individual protocols with known developers, or those controlled by corporate token holders, might be pressured to get changes pushed to the protocol. And for protocols that are as decentralized as they claim — run by distributed anonymous communities — regulators could make interaction with the protocol illegal. Or, more likely perhaps, stymie the flow of funds by targeting on-ramps or marking certain protocols as toxic.</p>
<p>These on-ramps could be fiat-to-crypto exchanges or stablecoins that could be forced to incorporate due diligence and know-your-client procedures to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism (AML/CFT) efforts, etc. To be effective, these future controls will need to be built with DeFi in mind. This could see the sanction list published as a Chainlink lookup or a free API call from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) or Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) directly.</p>
<p>At the same time, individual protocols seeking to integrate with the real economy are likely to make trade-offs that work in favor of regulators.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://aave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aave</a>&#8216;s know-your-client versions of liquidity pools are providing limited DeFi access to institutions by using on-ramps to KYC participants. They are able to mitigate risk by relying on organizations like Chainalysis to analyze blockchains for know-your-transaction (KYT), though this comes at the cost of depth of liquidity, and doesn&#8217;t grow the pie for all participants.</p>
<p>Other promising solutions include smart wrapping contracts that allow verified entities to deposit funds and automatically mint &#8220;fully compliant assets&#8221; that can be used in any DeFi protocol without having to KYC each time.</p>
<p>On the flip side, protocols may further decentralize; as we’ve seen recently, MakerDAO shut down legal entities and relies solely on the DAO. But while these fully decentralized protocols may remain out of reach of regulators, they could also be divorced from the real economy to an extent.</p>
<p>With these scenarios in mind, the question becomes not <em>how to enforce regulation </em>but what outcome the <em>regulations should be aiming to achieve</em>.</p>
<h2>How should DeFi be regulated?</h2>
<p>As to what changes should be pushed to protocol level, we now stand at a crossroads.</p>
<p>There is opportunity for the appropriate level of regulation to give DeFi enough breathing space to make a difference: boosting transparency, increasing financial inclusion and enabling credit to 8 billion people that will see the world take a tremendous jump toward prosperity.</p>
<p>Yet there is also potential for overreach that would stifle innovation and growth and have unintended consequences. Unfortunately, we seem to be well down this path already.</p>
<p>What is needed is the realization that DeFi shares many of the same goals as financial regulators: overhauling inflexible processes and delivering wider access, cheaper prices and more stability — all while ensuring these benefits are widely shared with all participants in the market.</p>
<p>For example, access to liquidity has long been a central concern not only for cryptocurrency and blockchain projects, but for financial markets in general. As per the Bank of England&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2019/andrew-hauser-panellist-at-trade-tech-fx-europe-barcelona" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Run Lola Run</a> speech of 2019, there is evidence that those that are further from liquidity get a worse and worse deal.</p>
<p>DeFi has the potential to create fairer, more transparent and more liquid markets through completely new mechanisms, helping everyone to reduce fraud and front-running, resolving fragmentation and creating markets that are efficient, resilient, fair and equally accessible to all — not just participants that have the right connections.</p>
<p>Defining the right regulation could make or break DeFi, and there are big questions to be answered: How do we establish wallet scores? How do we build in decentralized identifiers (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">W3C DIDs</a>)? And how can we ensure that any controls don&#8217;t work against financial inclusion?</p>
<p>Given such an opportunity to rebuild finance from the ground up, we need to be bold: Set clear objectives and create regulation that smooths the path to get to the new financial world — without simply settling for a faster version of what we have today.</p>
