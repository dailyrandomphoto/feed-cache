										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is seeking Indian antitrust watchdog&#8217;s approval to buy Catamaran Ventures’ stake in Prione, which operates one of the largest sellers on the e-commerce platform, months after the two firms said they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/amazons-top-indian-seller-cloudtail-to-cease-operations-after-may-2022/">won’t renew their joint venture</a> after May next year.</p>
<p>The announcement comes as a surprise as Catamaran owns 76% stake in Prione. Amazon earlier held 49% stake in the company, but diluted it down to 24% to comply with the local laws that prohibit e-commerce firms from having a direct or indirect ownership in businesses that sell on their marketplaces.</p>
<p>In a joint statement Wednesday, the two firms said they are complying with the applicable laws “including all assets and liabilities” to close the deal and have sought the regulatory approval. Amazon has reached out to the Indian watchdog Competition Commission of India for the approval, a person familiar with the matter said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250597" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Billionaire N.R. Narayana Murthy’s Catamaran and Amazon launched the joint venture in the country in 2014. The joint venture restructured its ownership in 2019 following India’s regulatory changes. In August this year, the two said they were ending the relationship.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Who owns Cloudtail? Was it used to sidestep Indian laws.<br />media rarely investigated.<br />What makes us think that the same people are not at it even now?</p>
<p>&mdash; IQ wala Anand Lunia (@anandlunia) <a href="https://twitter.com/anandlunia/status/1424740069793959938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 9, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>That announcement came after news agency Reuters reported, citing Amazon documents, that the American e-commerce firms had given preferential treatment for years to a small group of sellers including Cloudtail and had used them to bypass Indian laws. The Competition Commission of India, separately, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/india-orders-investigation-into-alleged-anti-competitive-practices-by-amazon-and-walmarts-flipkart/">ordered an investigation</a> into Amazon and Flipkart last year for allegedly promoting select sellers (those in which they own a stake) on their e-commerce platforms and using business practices that stifle competition. The two firms made an unsuccessful attempt to dismiss the investigation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The businesses of the joint venture shall continue under the leadership of the current management and on receipt of regulatory approvals, the board of Prione and Cloudtail will take steps to complete the transaction in compliance with applicable laws,” the joint statement from Amazon and Catamaran said today.</p>
<p>Cloudtail is one of the largest sellers on Amazon in India. It has enabled over 300,000 sellers and entrepreneurs to go online and provided 4 million merchants with digital payment capabilities, the two firms said earlier this year.</p>
<p>Long-standing laws in India have restricted Amazon and other e-commerce firms from holding inventory or selling items directly to consumers. To bypass this, firms have operated through a maze of joint ventures with local companies that operate as inventory-holding firms.</p>
<p>India got around to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/27/amazon-walmart-india-e-commerce-restrictions/">fixing this loophole</a> in late 2018 in a move that was widely seen as the biggest blowback to the American firm in the country at the time. Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart scrambled to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/01/amazon-flipkart-india-law/">delist hundreds of thousands of items</a> from their stores and made their investments in affiliated firms way more indirect.</p>
<p>In June this year, India <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/india-proposes-tougher-e-commerce-rules-following-widespread-cheating-and-unfair-trade-by-amazon-and-flipkart/">proposed even tougher e-commerce rules</a> that, among other things, prohibit Amazon, Flipkart and other e-commerce players from running their in-house / private labels. The new proposal asks e-commerce firms to ensure that none of their related and associated parties are listed on their platforms as sellers for selling to customers directly. (New Delhi has yet to follow up on the new rules.)</p>
<p>Amazon has stakes in a few more third-party sellers, including Appario Retail, which is its joint venture with Patni Group.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European startup and venture capital data company <a href="https://dealroom.co/">Dealroom</a> has raised a €6 million Series A, it told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s new capital comes nearly two years after it <a href="https://tech.eu/brief/dealroom-raises-2-75-million-to-continue-scaling-across-europe/">raised €2.75 million in early 2020</a>. Its database competes with a number of rivals in North America, including <a href="https://pitchbook.com/">PitchBook</a>, <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/">CB Insights</a>, and my former employer <a href="http://crunchbase.com">Crunchbase</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.beringea.com/">Beringea</a> led the Series A, which also saw participation from <a href="https://www.knight.capital/">Knight Venture Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/shoe-investments/about/">Shoe Investments</a>, firms that previously invested in the company. To better understand the round, TechCrunch put a number of questions to Dealroom founder and CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/yoramdw">Yoram Wijngaarde</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250283" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Dealroom&#8217;s business</h2>
<p>The startup collects data on private-market companies through public scraping and partnerships. Then, the resulting data is cleaned and run through the company&#8217;s software to &#8220;uncover actionable predictions,&#8221; as <a href="https://dealroom.co/about">Dealroom puts it</a>.</p>
<p>So Dealroom is three linked parts: data collection, cleaning and synthesis.</p>
<p>You can see why it might want more capital to handle the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">sheer influx of funding events that are swamping the globe</a>. Indeed, companies like Dealroom should be enjoying something akin to boom times themselves. Their core market remit, the private corporate landscape, is expanding quickly, and many participants in the startup game are flush. So, Dealroom has lots of work to do &#8212; and lots of folks to sell it to.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s business makes money in a few ways, including providing an API for both business and government customers and selling access to its platform on a SaaS basis. The company also does customer research. Per Wijngaarde, it has 50 government API customers that make up &#8220;about a third of [Dealroom] revenues.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More generally, the company&#8217;s &#8220;revenue mix is roughly equally three parts between investors, B2B companies and governments,&#8221; according to the CEO. So, there isn&#8217;t a single leg on Dealroom&#8217;s revenue stool; three different groups are buying what it has on offer.</p>
<p>Returning to our point about it feeling like a strong moment for Dealroom and its global rivals &#8212; <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccaszkutak/2021/12/07/known-for-its-startup-data-crunchbases-software-business-is-quietly-making-millions/?ss=venture-capital&amp;sh=253824983941">Crunchbase says that it will reach roughly $38 million ARR this year</a> &#8212; the fact that governments are such a large portion of Dealroom&#8217;s revenue feels notable, and bullish. Governments are paying attention to the startup game as it spreads more evenly around the world, and are willing to spend to better understand their local market and, we presume, those around them.</p>
<p>On the capital front, TechCrunch asked Wijngaarde why his company raised just €6 million. In today&#8217;s market, that&#8217;s a modest round!</p>
<p>The CEO said Dealroom &#8220;sized&#8221; its new round around both &#8220;business needs&#8221; and the fact that it &#8220;didn’t want to get too far ahead of [itself] based on the availability of capital.&#8221; The founder added that Dealroom is also &#8220;fortunate to have strong growing revenue, coupled with healthy capital efficiency,&#8221; two things that would lower a near-term need for more capital, and therefore dilution.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s next?</h2>
<p>Dealroom, Crunchbase and others in the data game are pretty good about data &#8212; having data, collecting data, you get the picture. What Dealroom wants to do with its data in the future is tinker with it more intelligently. When asked what&#8217;s ahead for his company, Wijngaarde said that it is &#8220;focused on expanding the predictive power of the platform, to help our clients discover promising companies at an ever earlier stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>If it can manage that, the company can add a zero to its pricing page, at least for investors. Mattermark, another company that I worked for, wanted to build something similar. It&#8217;s a big, hard problem, and one that will require oceans of accurate, to-the-minute data.</p>
<p>Before we go on too long, TechCrunch wanted to better understand a particular mechanic in the data collection business. So, we asked Dealroom if it counts data collection and curation as a cost of revenue or a marketing operating cost. Here&#8217;s what Wijngaarde wrote back:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We count data collection in part as cost of revenues and in part as product development in [operating expenses]. We also do a lot of human-led research, which is counted as cost of revenue, but also could be seen as cost of marketing, as this results in a lot of content marketing.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The answer is both, it turns out. I want to better understand that mix, and I am sure that we&#8217;ll get a better understanding when one of the companies in the private market data business files to go public.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">So your friend/sibling/neighbor just had a baby, or is having a baby soon. Huzzah!</p>
<p>Now you&#8217;re trying to figure out what to get them for the holidays&#8230; and, well, it can get a bit overwhelming. There&#8217;s <em>so</em> much stuff for babies and new parents, all marketed in a way that makes it all seem <em>absolutely crucial</em>. It is, of course, mostly not.</p>
<p>For this gift guide, I tried to focus on stuff that is truly useful, doesn&#8217;t exist solely to freak new parents out and is tough enough to last multiple years/kids.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250515" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Step one? Ask the parents what they need — everyone&#8217;s situation is different, and they&#8217;ll absolutely know best. If they&#8217;re running short on ideas, though, here are some things they&#8217;ll probably really appreciate.</p>

<h2>AirTags</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2142252" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2142252" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2142252" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0849.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0849.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0849.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0849.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0849.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0849.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0849.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0849.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0849.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2142252" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Matthew Panzarino</p></div></p>
<p>When you&#8217;ve suddenly got this precious thing in your life requiring 99.9% of your brain bandwidth, it can be hard to remember where <em>anything else</em> is. Particularly on the go, when — especially for those first few months — you&#8217;re probably toting around about 3x the amount of stuff as you were pre-kid. Your wallet&#8230; did you drop it, or just leave it at home? Did the diaper bag fall out of the bottom of the stroller, or is it back in the car? Wait, where did I even park the car?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple&#8217;s AirTags are only a few months old and didn&#8217;t exist when we first had our kid, but oh how I wish they did. These little puck-shaped discs can be tucked anywhere, allowing you to track an item&#8217;s (read: bags/strollers/etc., not the baby&#8217;s) location anywhere there&#8217;s an iPhone nearby — <em>any</em> iPhone, not just yours. The battery lasts a surprisingly long time and is easily user replaceable, and you can make an AirTag beep if you need help triangulating exactly where something is in the house.</p>
<p>One catch: These things are only for iOS users.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-airtag/airtag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 for $30, or 4 for $100</a></p>
<h2>Snoo</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_1761116" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1761116" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1761116" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/snoo.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="471" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/snoo.png 1520w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/snoo.png?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/snoo.png?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/snoo.png?resize=768,532 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/snoo.png?resize=680,471 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/snoo.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1761116" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snoo</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a $1,600 robo bassinet that detects when baby is crying and tries to automatically rock/shush them back to sleep.</p>
<p>Does that sound a little ridiculous? I agree! But it also <em>rules</em>, and I&#8217;m convinced it&#8217;s a big part of why my kid, now 3, is still a really, <em>really</em> good sleeper. It also helps you track your baby&#8217;s wake/sleep patterns, and uses special &#8220;Snoo Sacks&#8221; to ensure baby stays on their back while they sleep (as is <a href="https://safetosleep.nichd.nih.gov/research/science/backsleeping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommended by the NIH.</a>)</p>
<p>The Snoo will only work until a baby is about six months old — but it&#8217;s very, very easy to pass on to another kid. We split the purchase with friends because their kid would outgrow it right as ours needed it; it&#8217;s since been handed down <em>four more times</em>, with minimal maintenance required beyond a deep cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong><a href="https://www.happiestbaby.com/products/snoo-smart-bassinet" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $1,600 from HappiestBaby</a>. There&#8217;s also a <a href="https://www.happiestbaby.com/products/snoo-rental" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rental option</a> that works out to around $700 for that six months of use.</p>
<h2>Keekaroo Peanut</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_1761111" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1761111" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1761111" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/keekaroo.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="309" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/keekaroo.png 1856w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/keekaroo.png?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/keekaroo.png?resize=300,136 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/keekaroo.png?resize=768,349 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/keekaroo.png?resize=680,309 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/keekaroo.png?resize=1536,698 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/keekaroo.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1761111" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Keekaroo</p></div></p>
<p>I fully did not understand why we&#8217;d spend $130 on a changing pad. A zillion diaper changes later&#8230; I get it. The Peanut is designed to keep baby from rolling off the table during a diaper change (though, of course, you still need to stay close), is <em>way</em> more comfy for baby than a hard wooden table and is, crucially, super stain resistant. When my kid finally did manage to stain it permanently (beets, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw2WsXIgO6A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it&#8217;s always beets</a>) the company had a replacement shipped out immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.buybuybaby.com/store/product/keekaroo-reg-peanut-changer/3272011?skuId=46261380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$130 from buybuyBaby</a></p>

<p>The downside of the Peanut? It&#8217;s not portable. Babies poop a lot, and they don&#8217;t care if there&#8217;s a convenient changing table nearby.</p>
<p>Skip Hop&#8217;s Pronto portable changing station folds up into a tiny little package, is super easy to keep clean, and has a storage pouch big enough for a backup diaper or two and a slim box of wipes. This thing saved the day more times than I can count, and it&#8217;s the first thing I check for when someone sends us their baby registry.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JT1Q3CV/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B09JT1Q3CV&amp;linkId=22c2f081ee25cbdf473568bea8374a2c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$28 from Amazon</a></p>
<h2>A really, really good phone case</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2250517" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2250517" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2250517" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Otterbox.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="250" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Otterbox.jpg 781w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Otterbox.jpg?resize=150,55 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Otterbox.jpg?resize=300,110 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Otterbox.jpg?resize=768,282 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Otterbox.jpg?resize=680,250 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Otterbox.jpg?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2250517" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Otterbox</p></div></p>
<p>Phones light up and make fun noises. Babies like things that light up and make fun noises. Babies also like to throw things.</p>
<p>Add those things together and you&#8217;ve got the recipe for a broken phone screen. If your new parent friend is the type that likes to forego the case in favor of a slim device, maaaaaybe try to convince them to pop a case on for at least a year or two. Otterbox&#8217;s commuter case saved our phones probably a dozen times, and is relatively slim for the amount of protection it provides.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong><a href="https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/commuter-series" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$40 from Otterbox</a></p>
<h2>Ubbi Diaper Pail</h2>

<p>Ubbi&#8217;s steel diaper pail does a damned good job of keeping the stink locked in, while a simple safety system keeps curious little ones out. It uses standard trashbags, instead of expensive bespoke &#8220;cartridges&#8221; or whatever. While our kid is potty trained now, this thing still hangs around his room as a way over-qualified trash can. It&#8217;s also had about a thousand toy trucks hurled at it from across the room and somehow still looks brand new.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00821FLT4/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00821FLT4&amp;linkId=0c3a26597300cf49ab61553cb7184673" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$70 from Amazon</a></p>
<h2>Hue bulbs</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2077777" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077777" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2077777" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hue.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="340" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hue.jpg 878w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hue.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hue.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hue.jpg?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hue.jpg?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hue.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077777" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Philips</p></div></p>
<p>As I noted in our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/gift-guide-10-really-good-gadgets-that-cost-less-than-100/">under-$100 gift guide</a>, smart light bulbs are slowly taking over my house. Nothing did a better job of convincing me to go all in on smart bulbs than having a kid.</p>
<p>Waking up every two hours and the light switch is across the room? Smart bulbs! Want red lighting instead of blue/white for those 2 AM wake-ups, so as to maybe not screw up everyone&#8217;s circadian rhythms? Smart bulbs! Working on teaching a toddler to stay in bed and want a &#8220;stoplight&#8221; that goes from red to green when it&#8217;s okay to get up? Smart bulbs!</p>
<p>There are lots of great smart bulb options out there, but I&#8217;m a big fan of the Philips Hue line. It&#8217;s not the cheapest option, but the interface is great, it works with your various Alexa/Google/Homekit ecosystems and I&#8217;ve had literally zero issues with them after years of use.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QWB3H1Q/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07QWB3H1Q&amp;linkId=feaab8aa9b0dce6d2cd4fc71c52cbc05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$30-$50 each on Amazon</a>, depending on quantity</p>
<h2>Smart Speakers</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1814552" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/google-home-mini-2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/google-home-mini-2.jpg 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/google-home-mini-2.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/google-home-mini-2.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/google-home-mini-2.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/google-home-mini-2.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/google-home-mini-2.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Pairing well with the smart bulbs, but also good for plenty of their own reasons, are smart speakers.</p>
<p>When my son was tiny and spent more time in my arms than not, I&#8217;d use my voice to start up songs without having to fiddle with my phone. We use it to control those aforementioned smart bulbs, and for white noise (&#8220;Hey Google, play rain sounds&#8221;) when he&#8217;s having a tough time sleeping. He recently figured out how to ask Google to make fart sounds, which consistently makes him laugh so hard he falls over.</p>
<p>Amazon/Google/Apple all have their own contenders that each have their pros/cons, so the best one is really whichever one is built for the ecosystem your friend uses most — Echo for Amazon, Nest Mini or Nest Hub for Google or Homepod for Apple.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>Varies, but generally $25-100. Nest Mini, pictured above, is <a href="https://store.google.com/us/magazine/compare_nest_speakers_displays?hl=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$25 from Google</a></p>
<h2>Collapsible Radio Flyer Wagon</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2250520" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2250520" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2250520" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Radio-Flyer.jpg?w=550" alt="" width="550" height="514" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Radio-Flyer.jpg 550w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Radio-Flyer.jpg?resize=150,140 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Radio-Flyer.jpg?resize=300,280 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Radio-Flyer.jpg?resize=50,47 50w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2250520" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Radio Flyer</p></div></p>
<p>Someone bought us one of these for his first birthday, and I honestly can&#8217;t believe how much use it&#8217;s gotten. When he was still in a stroller, we&#8217;d use it to lug everything out onto the beach. Now that he&#8217;s far too big for a stroller, he&#8217;ll gladly hop in this for long rides around the neighborhood or trips to the zoo.</p>
<p>It folds up enough to fit in the trunk, and two zipper pulls convert it into a bench for snack time anywhere. Radio Flyer&#8217;s warranty is also pretty great; when I busted one of the wheels at no one&#8217;s fault but my own, they had a new one out to me within days.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Varies <a href="https://www.radioflyer.com/shop/cat/wagons.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">based on options</a>, but we use the $200 push/pull model pictured above</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Chicco Caddy Hook On Chair</h2>

<p>Most restaurants have one or two high chairs. Sometimes more than one or two babies show up. Or they only have one highchair and it has no buckles and wobbles when you look at it funny.</p>
<p>We bought one of these in a pinch while visiting friends, and it traveled with us for ages thereafter. Unfold it, clamp it in place, twist the locks, and bam — anywhere you&#8217;ve got an appropriately sturdy table (be sure to read the instructions, there), you&#8217;ve got a highchair. Done? Unclamp, fold it up, toss it in the trunk. Got a messy eater? The cover slips off easily and washes up well. My kid has outgrown it now, but it still gets regular use when our friends bring their littlest ones over.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for December 21, 2021. This is my final Daily Crunch with you for the year. So, let me just say thanks for reading since I took over writing the newsy bits of this newsletter. It could have gone horribly, frankly, given how much folks hate change in their inboxes. But, with open rates at an all-time high, y&#8217;all have welcomed the New Daily Crunch Crew with open arms, and we’re grateful. Here’s to an even better 2022 — and more jokes. —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<p>P.S. You should follow <a href="https://twitter.com/mirandahalpern">Miranda</a> (Experts), <a href="https://twitter.com/yourprotagonist">Walter</a> (TC+), <a href="https://twitter.com/anniesnders">Annie</a> (editing) and Richard (editing) as they make this newsletter sing.

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/bitcoin-is-religion-web3-is-greed/"><strong>Bitcoin is religion; web3 is greed:</strong></a><strong> </strong>After Jack Dorsey kicked up a firestorm by inveighing against web3 and the current wave of crypto projects, TechCrunch dug into the debate because how could we not. Whether you are a bitcoin maximalist or a big NFT stan, we have something that will annoy you!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/eu-clears-microsoft-nuance/"><strong>EU clears the Microsoft-Nuance deal:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The $19.7 billion deal in which the Redmond tech giant will buy the medical transcription company has a green light from the European market. See, not <em>all</em> major tech deals are getting cut down to the nubbin with regulatory concerns and then canceled!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/via-files-confidentially-to-go-public/"><strong>Via shuttles toward the public markets:</strong></a> Public transit software and shuttle company Via is going public in early 2022. The company announced today that it has filed privately for its IPO. We’ll know a lot more when we actually get the S-1 document, but the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/a-few-questions-about-the-impending-reddit-ipo/">joins Reddit</a> on our list of public debuts that we anticipate in Q1 of next year.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>But wait, there’s <em>even more</em> public market news! Yes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/snapdeal-ipo/">Snapdeal filed to go public</a>, and our own <a href="https://twitter.com/refsrc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manish Singh</a> (follow him; he’s amazing!) has the details. SoftBank is a backer of the New Delhi-based startup. Per its prospectus, the company anticipates raising around $165 million in its public-market debut. Recall that Snapdeal “once competed with Amazon and Flipkart in India [but] has lost considerable market share in recent years,” we wrote.</p>
<p>And speaking of companies going public, remember the Better.com fiasco in which the company’s CEO went viral for firing a bunch of staff on Zoom? And then a bunch of whacko stuff from the company came out? Well, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/how-does-former-better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-still-have-a-job/">we’re curious why Vishal Garg still has a job</a>, so we did a little digging. There’s more to come on this story.</p>
<p><strong>Next, a few new funds:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/array-ventures-raises-56m-to-back-tech-heavy-enterprise-software/">Array Ventures raises $56M to back really hard enterprise tech:</a> </strong>Shruti Gandhi’s fund intends to invest its new capital pool on 30 startups “working on technical, back-bone enterprise tech.” Given the fund size and number of checks, we’re talking very early money in the case of Array.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/calibrate-ventures-raises-97m-for-second-fund-targeting-ai-automation/">Targeting AI automation, Calibrate Ventures raises $97M:</a> </strong>With 25% more capital than in its first fund, Calibrate has reloaded its wallet. The firm previously invested in Built Robotics, Embodied, FarmWise, Soft Robotics, Talage and TruckLabs, TechCrunch reports.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/venture-firm-chapter-one-focused-on-all-things-web3-draws-backing-from-big-name-vc-firms/">Chapter One raises capital to invest in web3:</a> </strong>Don’t tell Jack, but there’s even more money on tap for web3 projects. The $40 million fund will be joined by a $20 million “opportunity” fund, provided that that latter vehicle closes on target. Notably, Chapter One’s Jeff Morris Jr. is a solo investor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And a few rapid-fire pieces of startup news:</strong></p>

<h2>Demand Curve: How Ahrefs’ homepage educates prospects to purchase</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year’s Essential implosion marked one of the most high-profile consumer electronics startup failures in recent memory. Launched in 2017 with $330 million, a killer pedigree and some truly grand ambitions, the company sputtered through a combination of industry issues, disappointment and troubling allegations against founder Andy Rubin.</p>
<p>The brand was eventually purchased by Carl Pei for his new company. But the executive eventually bucked the name in favor of &#8220;Nothing.&#8221; “[B]efore we were called Nothing, ‘Essential’ was one of the names we were brainstorming, internally,” he told me earlier this year “So that’s why we’ve acquired the trademark. We don’t have any plans to do anything with Essential.”</p>
<p>Something far closer to a spiritual successor arrives in the form of OSOM. The company, founded by ex-Essential employees, has had a smattering of press coverage over the past several months, but has largely kept quiet. Today, however, the Cupertino, California-based firm <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/osom-ov1-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed what many long suspected:</a> OSOM (pronounced “awesome”) is working on a phone.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250521" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Its planned OV1 device is, at least aesthetically, very clearly the work of the same team that gave the world the Essential PH1. But rather than features like modularity, the product is designed with one core thing in mind: Privacy. Specifically, it’s designed to give users greater control over data privacy.</p>
<p>Beyond that, details are scarce, ahead of its planned MWC 2022 launch. We sat down with co-founder and CEO Jason Keats for more information on OSOM and its upcoming handset.</p>
<p><strong>TC: We’re about two months out from the announcement?</strong></p>
<p>JK: Yeah, we’re a couple of months out from sharing the fine details. We’re planning the give the full announcement at MWC, and then shipping summer 2022. Right now we’re ready to announce that we are building a phone. People are really excited. We wanted to give our fans something this year, and we’re coming in under the wire.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>What constitutes a fan at this point, given that the company has been under lock and key?</strong></p>
<p>It’s been really surprising. Essential fans were very, very supportive early on, and they’ve continued to be supportive and excited about what we’re building for the future. I think we’re going to pick up quite a few traditional Android fans. Right now there aren’t a lot of flagship phones outside of Pixel that are vanilla Android. We’re going to continue that, and we’ve already built and are continuing to refine some privacy-centric software.</p>
<p><strong>How many of the existing team have come over from Essential?</strong></p>
<p>When we built PH1 at Essential, we were maybe 30 people total. We have maybe 15 people from that team. It’s really the core group of people; design, engineer, product design and software engineering.</p>
<p><strong>How large is the team in total?</strong></p>
<p>Around 30 people […] We’re more than two-thirds engineering.</p>
<p><strong>How did you begin the process of building up one company from, effectively, the ashes of another?</strong></p>
<p>For all of the shortcomings and incidences that happened at Essential, one thing that I will praise [Rubin] forever for is his ability to recruit. He brought on some incredible talent. When he told me that the company was going under, I said, what I am going to do next? I don’t want to work for Google or Apple or go to Amazon, but there’s this incredible team there that has built stuff and worked together so closely. It’s been through the trenches together[…]</p>
<p>We realized that probably the biggest issue [with Essential] was a lack of focus. We realized we needed to have a purpose. What are we trying to solve for? It became obvious to us that privacy really wasn’t being addressed coherently, particularly in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Does the world need another phone company?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, absolutely I think they do. One that’s actually focused on protecting privacy. And there’s a big reason for that. If we were just a software company building privacy software, we could trhow it on the Play Store, people could install it, whatever. But if it’s just an app sitting on someone’s phone, it’s easily bypassed, it’s easily turned off, because it’s not built into the system. It’s not integrated into the device. That’s what we’re doing. Because we’re an OEM, because we have access to Qualcomm’s TrustZone, because we have access to the system software, we can build some real privacy-centric software that the user can use or not use, if they chose. But it’s all about giving them a choice.</p>
<p><strong>How difficult will it be to get someone to jump over to this phone with privacy as a main selling point?</strong></p>
<p>In the U.S., I’m not trying to go after Apple users. We’re going after Android users. And in that scenario, there isn’t a tremendous amount of brand loyalty within the Android space. People are willing to take a lot more shots. For privacy, we’ve already lined up quite a few partners that have shared some high-level demgraphic data about who is using their software or hardware for privacy. The numbers are astonishing to us. They really indicate that there is a demand for privacy and that people are currently spending their money today on privacy.</p>
<p><strong>What’s a realistic expectation in terms of units? You’re casting a wide net [to the U.S., Canada and throughout Europe]. It seems ultimately the Essential numbers weren’t what people were hoping for.</strong></p>
<p>It’s funny. When we started Essential, the goal was 100,000 units in the first year. We sold just shy of 300,000 units to end users the first year. The biggest issue is because [Rubin] raised so much money, the expectation was to ship two million units. When you go into expecting 100,000 units and sell 300,000 units, that’s a huge success. It all depends on what metric you’re using. For [OSOM], I would be absolutely thrilled with 200,000 units in the first year. We would be here for a very, very long time.</p>
<p><strong>Were the external expectations so intense as to cause things to fall apart [at Essential]?</strong></p>
<p>I can fill up a book on what went wrong. And there were a bunch of little things.</p>
<p><strong>Give me the CliffsNotes.</strong></p>
<p>Some decisions made at the very top were counterintuitive to us being successful.</p>
<p><strong>On the note of capital, it was reported that the company raised $5.6 million. What has the fundraising been so far.</strong></p>
<p>So, we secured $20 million. Some of it investor, and a chunk of it was pre-order from a channel partner. We’ve already got orders that are close to the number that we can support in the first year. We did have the bulk of our investors come from myself and my co-founder Wolfgang and our external VCs were all primarily Canadian companies.</p>
<p><strong>Has there been a Series A on top of the initial seed funding?</strong></p>
<p>We are currently in the middle of a Series A.</p>
<p><strong>Was Playground involved?</strong></p>
<p>No. We had a nice long chat with them. The team over there &#8212; Bruce, Matt and Peter &#8212; are still very good friends. I still use them as sounding boards for ideas.</p>
<p><strong>When was the company officially launched?</strong></p>
<p>The articles of incorporation were officially filed on 4 20 2020.</p>
<p><strong>The name is pronounced “awesome?” Which was first, the name or the acronym?</strong></p>
<p>Twenty minutes after [Rubin] told me that Essential was going under, I&#8217;m like, “Alright, I&#8217;m gonna do my own thing.” I hate stuff that’s super overt. I hate all the wires and plugs and this and that all over your house, and it drives me nuts. And I had this idea for a different product, which we may or may not eventually build. It has nothing to do with the phone, but just some crazy idea. But the idea was out of sight, out of mind. I think what the people, what the average consumer really pictures when we talk about the future technology in Star Trek, and the sense of speaking and something answers out of the ether. It’s not a thing sitting on my desk that has a cable that&#8217;s nine feet long, but it&#8217;s only eight inches from the wall. The idea was this thing that comes out of ether, and the idea was &#8220;out of sight out of mind. Oh, OSOM, we&#8217;ll just call it awesome.&#8221; I registered it from the hotel in Hong Kong.</p>
<p><strong>Any of those initial ideas being applied here? Obviously, privacy is the thing.</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s certainly the mentality, because of the way we&#8217;re building our software. The idea is that, again, it maintains an out of sight, out of mind; you should just trust that your devices are keeping you safe when you want to be safe.</p>
<p><strong>For the time being it&#8217;s an American company?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We’re a Delaware C Corp. Like every other tech company, probably all registered at the exact same address.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve talked to the Canadian government about incentives&#8230; but you&#8217;re going to continue to be headquartered in Cupertino?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, that&#8217;s up in the air. OSOM Products, the U.S. company, will continue to exist. But we may move our headquarters up to Canada.</p>
<p><strong>What are the common threads between Essential and OSOM? Philosophical? Aesthetic?</strong></p>
<p>Aesthetically, 100%. Even though it&#8217;s the same designer, Dave Evans and myself doing the industrial design, we didn&#8217;t really think about it as an obvious successor to the PH1, until we had the first prototype it was like, “this was clearly designed by the same team”. Both in a material standpoint and an appearance standpoint it&#8217;s a continuation of the same crew. Our software team, particularly when it comes to Android and security updates, the team that was responsible for the super, super-fast updates at Essential are here at OSOM.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s talk about advertising. How will you differentiate the brand from 800 other phone makers?</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to give anything away, because I&#8217;m super excited about it. I will put it this way: When we show the broader team the campaign ideas and the first drafts, people who have been at Essential from the very beginning, they’re like, &#8220;why didn&#8217;t we do that before?&#8221; We have to spend on marketing to differentiate. A big chunk of that money that we raised is going towards marketing.</p>
<p><strong>What can we expect on the spec-side?</strong></p>
<p>This is a flagship device, both in terms of hardware and software.</p>
<p><strong>Is it difficult keeping the price down for a first piece of hardware?</strong></p>
<p>Not really. The team that I brought over from Essential, when it comes to supply chain, is some of the best in the world. Our partners have been astonishingly supportive. We&#8217;ve gotten some amazing rates. Literally going into a couple of meetings like, &#8220;I just want the same price to give Apple and Google.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>So, comparably priced with other flagships.</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re gonna be well under $1,000.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Union&#8217;s competition regulator has given the all-clear to Microsoft&#8217;s $19.7 billion purchase of transcription tech firm Nuance, which was announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>The EU <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_7067" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said today</a> it has concluded there are no competition concerns for the region if the acquisition goes ahead, clearing it without conditions.</p>
<p>The deal was notified to the Commission&#8217;s regulators on November 16.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250340" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Microsoft is acquiring Nuance Communications for $19.7B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/embed/#?secret=84TmvMnhDe" data-secret="84TmvMnhDe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While Microsoft-Nuance has gotten a green light from the bloc, the U.K.&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority has<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/cma-microsoft-nuance/"> just opened its own preliminary investigation</a> &#8212; so some regional scrutiny continues.</p>
<p>On the EU side, the Commission&#8217;s investigation looked at horizontal overlaps between Nuance and Microsoft in the markets for transcription software &#8212; finding the two provide very different products (out-of-the-box software for end-users versus APIs targeted at devs wanting to add speech recognition tech to their apps, respectively).</p>
<p>It also determined that the combined entity will continue to face &#8220;strong&#8221; competition from other players.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The EU looked at the vertical link between Microsoft&#8217;s cloud computing services and Nuance&#8217;s downstream transcription software for healthcare, too &#8212; but found competing transcription service providers in the sector do not depend on Microsoft for cloud computing.</p>
<p>Nor are these type of transcription service providers particularly key users of cloud computing, per the Commission.</p>
<p>Its investigation considered conglomerate links between Nuance&#8217;s software (which is only available for Windows) and a number of Microsoft products as well &#8212; but took the view that the combined entity would not have the ability and/or incentive to foreclose competitors in the markets for (healthcare) transcription software; enterprise communication services; CRM software; productivity software; and PC operating systems.</p>
<p>And, there again, the EU decided the combined entity will still face strong competition.</p>
<p>Perhaps most interestingly, the Commission looked at the use of data transcribed by Nuance&#8217;s software.</p>
<p>This is interesting because healthcare data is highly sensitive and Microsoft &#8212; while not a massive player in adtech &#8212; does have ambitions to grow that side of its business. Just today it <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/att-sells-adtech-firm-xandr-to-microsoft-2021-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the purchase of adtech firm Xandr (formerly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/25/att-appnexus/">AppNexus</a>), from AT&amp;T, to beef up its digital advertising biz, for example.</p>
<p>Add to that, in recent days, Oracle &#8212; a tech giant with an already massive digital marketing biz &#8212; has signalled its own grand designs on health &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/oracle-snags-cerner-in-28b-mega-deal-to-make-a-big-move-into-healthcare/">announcing the acquisition of Cerner</a>, a U.S. provider of electronic health record (EHR) systems.</p>
<p>And, well, the prospect of adtech companies harvesting health data makes plenty of people <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/europe-urged-to-block-google-fitbit-ahead-of-major-digital-policy-overhaul/">queasy about privacy</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="3jbWQ27awe"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/oracle-joins-microsoft-in-spending-big-to-dominate-healthcare-vertical/">Oracle joins Microsoft in spending big to dominate healthcare vertical</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Nonetheless, the Commission&#8217;s assessment of the data side of the Microsoft-Nuance gave it a clean bill of health &#8212; owing to existing &#8220;contractual restrictions&#8221; and regional data protection regulations.</p>
<p>While this analysis is largely coming from a competition perspective, it&#8217;s notable that data protection got (another) shout-out in an EU antitrust assessment. (The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-is-now-investigating-googles-adtech-over-antitrust-concerns/">earlier instance</a> relates to the EU&#8217;s [ongoing] scrutiny of Google&#8217;s adtech; which followed much criticism from privacy advocates after the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/europe-clears-google-fitbit-with-a-ten-year-ban-on-using-health-data-for-ads/">Commission cleared Google&#8217;s purchase of Fitbit last year</a>, albeit &#8212; in that case &#8212; with conditions that included limits on Google using Fitbit health data for ads.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The Commission concluded that Nuance can use this data only to provide its services,&#8221; the EU writes in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_7067" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> on the clearance of Microsoft-Nuance. &#8220;It is not used by any other company and cannot be used for any other purpose due to contractual restrictions and data protection legislation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s antitrust division also concluded that access to Nuance&#8217;s data will not provide Microsoft with an advantage that would enable it to shut out competing healthcare software providers &#8212; given &#8220;important transcribed information is typically stored in third-party applications like electronic health record (EHR) systems that combine data from several sources, as opposed to Nuance&#8217;s fragmented speech data&#8221;.</p>
<p>That tidbit raises questions about whether Oracle&#8217;s acquisition of Cerner, a provider of EHR systems, may face more probing questions from EU competition regulators &#8212; if/when they come to consider that Big Tech healthcare sector deal.</p>
<p>Although Cerner&#8217;s relative lack of regional customers &#8212; it <a href="https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/finance-revenue-cycle/health-it-market/news/21124817/cerner-sells-off-some-of-its-european-portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold off some of its European portfolio last year</a> &#8212; may serve to reduce or limit the scope of any EU concerns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On-demand shuttle service and software company <a href="https://ridewithvia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Via</a> has confidentially filed to go public, the company <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/via-announces-confidential-submission-of-draft-registration-statement-related-to-proposed-public-offering-301449178.html?tc=eml_cleartime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in a statement.</a> The company has not yet determined how many shares will be offered or what the price range for the proposed offering will look like, as is typical for this sort of release.</p>
<p>Via follows Reddit in filing privately for a public listing before the end-of-year market freeze. Both companies should debut in early 2022</p>
<p>Why file now given the impending holiday period? Via has posted impressive results in recent quarters, so getting its ducks in a row – shuttles in a line? – for an early-early IPO is far from aggressive. It’s reasonable, frankly, given that tech valuations are still strong despite recent declines. And companies that can go public may want to take advantage of the IPO window while it’s open.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250384" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/via-transportation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Per Crunchbase,</a> Via has raised $777.1 million in known funding to date, from investors including Macquarie Capital, Mori Building, Shell, 83North, Broadscale Group, Ervington Investments, Hearst Ventures, Planven Ventures, Pitango and RiverPark Ventures.</p>
<p>Last month Via announced a $130 million round that pushed the on-demand shuttle and software company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/via-raises-130m-to-expand-on-demand-shuttle-software-business/">to a $3.3 billion valuation</a>. We suppose that that was a pre-IPO round, in retrospect. The capital event came on the heels of TransitTech, Via’s software platform, doubling year over year to exceed an annual run rate of $100 million.</p>
<p>More simply, Via has reached the threshold of IPO scale in revenue terms, not taking into account other possible income streams at the company. So its IPO timing once again makes sense.</p>
<p>Past the software revenue result, after originally taking five years to land its first city partnership, the company today has over 500 partners, including Los Angeles Metro, Jersey City and Miami.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Life has not proved pothole free for Via. The company saw mixed demand for its business amidst the pandemic. While ridership <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/on-demand-shuttle-startup-via-hits-2-25-billion-valuation-on-latest-funding-round-led-by-exor/">initially dropped due to the disease</a>, cities focused more on emergency services &#8212; helping generate demand for Via’s software platform. From a business perspective, that’s good news considering the stickiness of a city contract.</p>
<p>Via has beefed up its operations over the past few years, perhaps hinting at plans to make a pitch for a public debut. In March, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/via-buys-mapping-startup-remix-for-100-million/">the company bought Remix</a>, which created software for cities to use for transportation planning and street design, for $100 million. It also acquired<a href="https://www.fleetonomy.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Fleetonomy.</a></p>
<p>Via won’t be the only mobility startup racing toward a 2022 public debut. This month, Voi Scooters <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/2250109/">raised a $115 million Series D in preparation for an IPO</a> and Kakao Mobility picked up a $4.2 billion valuation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/kakao-mobility-picks-up-additional-55m-funding-at-over-4-2b-valuation/">ahead of its rumored listing. </a></p>
<p>TechCrunch has a series of questions for the filing, once we get our hands on it. For example, we’re curious whether the company is able to generate traditional SaaS gross margins while selling to governments. And how long are its sales cycles? Even more, how deeply penetrated is its core market? And where did all that capital raised get spent? Will I see it in investing cash flow or operating losses?</p>
<p>All told, the 2022 IPO cycle is shaping up to start off with a number of very, <em>very </em>interesting debuts.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[With everything that has gone down at Better.com over the past 18 months, many of us are scratching our heads in wonder that CEO Vishal Garg remains employed.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With everything that has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/better-com-lays-off-9-of-its-staff/">gone down at Better.com</a> over the past 18 months, many of us are scratching our heads in wonder that CEO Vishal Garg remains employed.</p>
<p>On December 10, employees of the digital mortgage lender were notified via email by the Better board of directors that Garg would be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-steps-back-as-employees-detail-how-he-led-by-fear/">taking time off,</a> effective immediately, after the “very regrettable events over the last week.”</p>
<p>The move came, according to an employee who wished not to be named, after the digital mortgage company hired a crisis firm earlier that week. For those of us <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-apologizes-to-current-employees-for-blundering-the-execution-of-mass-layoffs/">following the drama</a>, it was not a surprise.</p>
<p>But what <em>is</em> a shock is that Garg has not been asked to step down altogether. Some surmised that he had super-voting shares and thus could vote to keep himself in the role of CEO despite what others voted. But after digging into the <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-326251/#rom154116_38" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S-4 filed by Better.com’s SPAC partner, Aurora Acquisition Corp.,</a> in November, we realized that is not the case.</p>
<p>According to the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, “entities affiliated with the Better Founder and CEO, Mr. Vishal Garg, will beneficially own approximately 17.5% of our outstanding common stock as a whole, but will control approximately 22.7% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock.”</p>
<p>To ensure that we were not undercounting his voting power, we also examined the shares that Garg has from unexercised options. Counting those, and taking into account different voting rights attached to various share classes, it does not appear that the erstwhile CEO has the ability to block his removal due to complete voting control.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">What does an investment management firm look like when it&#8217;s redesigned based on first principles and based on the true &#8220;jobs to be done&#8221; of an investment manager?</p>
<p>“Even millennial-friendly platforms like Betterment, RobinHood and Wealthfront are only approaching their businesses one-dimensionally,&#8221; said Suzanne Ley, formerly head of financial institutions at Westpac.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to focus on how China is leading the way with its complete reinvention of how we think about money and investing.</p>
<p>For example, in just four years Alibaba&#8217;s Yu&#8217;e Bao fund grew to be the largest in the world. The walls between shopping, banking, investing and social networking are quickly evaporating.</p>
<p>The only name I can think of in the U.S. that comes close is SoFi — a full-service lending, money management and social networking platform is where we are headed.”</p>

<h2>Using technology to re-balance value to investors</h2>
<p>Internally, money managers are investing in artificial intelligence and big data capabilities as well as a more seamless integration of front and back-office processes. Externally, leaders are building mobile and tablet apps and expanding their use of social media.</p>
<p>In the future, innovative models, especially in the retail space, will integrate investing with elements of social media, interactive gaming and education. For institutional investors, technology will enable more proactive, fully customizable risk management and governance. Firms like D.E. Shaw, Two Sigma and Renaissance Technologies have validated this quant model in the public markets. We now see firms like Versatile VC, Signalfire and GV using technology to produce better returns in the private markets.</p>
<h2>Create and sustain trust through transparency</h2>
<p>As opacity recedes, money holders will see who has been working with their best interest at heart. We foresee reduced interest in the black box hedge fund model.</p>
<p>According to Amanda Tepper, CEO of Chestnut Advisory Group, investors are increasingly demanding clear, concise and consistent communication from their asset managers. In a recent Chestnut investor survey, 92% of respondents said they view investor communication as integral to an asset manager’s mission. In addition to investor demands, money managers must comply with an increasing array of regulatory requirements.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://twitter.com/atShruti" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shruti Gandhi</a> wants to clear up a misconception in first-check fundraising: Every founder doesn’t need their early-stage investors to be a shoulder for them, they just need their investor to understand their business in a way that others don’t. Most of the entrepreneurs in her portfolio for<a href="http://array.vc/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Array Ventures</a>, a fund she started five years ago to back enterprise companies, are repeat founders with nearly a decade of experience in the field.</p>
<p>“The things we invest in require a lot of industry experience and customer experience,” she said. “And you don&#8217;t just pick that up overnight as a college drop out &#8212; the kinds of things we invest in are not something that you dream up after one year of work experience.” Candidness in mind, Gandhi just landed tens of millions to invest into what she calls the “hard enterprise space.”</p>
<p>Array Ventures’ new $56.1 million fund, closed last week, plans to invest in 30 startups working on technical, back-bone enterprise tech. Since its debut fund, Array Ventures has grown its check size from $150,000 to now $1.2 million to $1.5 million. Gandhi says that the firm will now target 15% ownership in each of its deals, up from 10% from its second fund.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250354" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“While most firms claim they invested in enterprise tech, they focus on mostly bottom-up SaaS companies especially at the first-check stage,” Gandhi said. “Very few firms are actually technical enough to invest in the back-bone enterprise tech for the new era of companies.” It’s not to say that Array doesn’t back vertical SaaS products (it does), but it looks for companies with “highly differentiated” back-bone fundamentals.</p>
<p>But what does that actually mean? Gandhi puts it like this: Everything you see today on the front-end needs a stronger backing technology that can handle big data, make [users] more secure and move to the cloud.” Array thus invests in startups working beyond the application layer, focusing on security, data and cloud infrastructure. Think Snowflake, Okta, Twilio and Databricks, not Dropbox or Salesforce.</p>
<p>This newer tech stack has resulted in Array pouring money into startups working on issues like automated threat detection and response, data orchestration and media discovery with licensing.</p>
<p>The impact of Gandhi’s focus strikes differently considering that just 1.9% of venture investment goes to female enterprise founders, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/work-bench-report-finds-just-1-9-of-venture-investment-going-to-female-enterprise-founders/">according to a Work-Bench report. </a>More than one-third of Array’s portfolio is led by female founders. The investor says that her portfolio offers a contrast to some of the biases that women in tech often receive.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“When a woman is starting a company, people assume that they’re going to be starting a consumer company &#8212; it’s the bias we have in the market,” she said. “And the same holds true toward me, running an enterprise fund.”</p>
<p>While Gandhi’s less buzzy niche may mean that she can’t grab deal flow from today’s top accelerators, the hard enterprise community appears to be well connected. Over half of her portfolio founders have invested across all of her funds, including MozartData’s Peter Fishman, Placer.ai’s Noam Ben-Zvi, Catch&amp;Release’s Analisa Goodin and Hermis’ Madhu Mathihalli and Mohan Gummalam.</p>
<p>Other limited partners in Array Ventures include Data Robot’s Dan Wright, Drift’s Elias Torres, Polygon’s Jaynti Kanani, Vanderbilt University, MPowered Capital and NSV Wolf.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite billions in VC investment, many web3 crypto platforms are still pretty hostile places for users new to the crypto world.</p>
<p>Case in point, today Justin Kan&#8217;s NFT platform <a href="https://www.fractal.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fractal</a> suffered a security breach when a scammer hacked the announcement bot for the startup&#8217;s Discord which sent out a fraudulent link to the platform&#8217;s more than 100,000 users, urging them to pay up for a new NFT. The message promised users access to 3,333 commemorative NFTs designed to celebrate the platform&#8217;s success, but the link was faked with a URL for <a href="https://www.fractal.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fractal.is</a> that swapped an &#8220;i&#8221; for the &#8220;l&#8221;, taking users to a minting site where funds were taken and they earned nothing in return.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Well, <a href="https://twitter.com/justinkan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@justinkan</a>&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/fractalwagmi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@fractalwagmi</a> is going well&#8230; </p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250319" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Their actual Discord Bot was hacked encouraging people to mint 3333 NFTs for 1 Solana (worth $177 each). </p>
<p>But the link is to Fractai, not Fractal&#8230; 3294 just lost nearly $600,000 combined. <a href="https://t.co/mnSaa0wOnp">pic.twitter.com/mnSaa0wOnp</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>All said, it looks like the scammer actually made off with about $150K. The hack took place before the startup ever even launched its platform, which was scheduled to debut this week. The startup, which is backed by Kan&#8217;s GOAT Capital fund, has already pledged to pay back users, <a href="https://twitter.com/fractalwagmi/status/1473332788686376961?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeting</a> that &#8220;<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">If you lost your </span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Sol</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> &#8211; we will reimburse you. We will announce further updates soon.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These attacks aren&#8217;t particularly unusual, incidentally; another Solana-based project called Monkey Kingdom <a href="https://twitter.com/MonkeyKingdom_/status/1473338274366525443?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was hacked</a> just hours earlier for more than $1.3 million worth of the cryptocurrency. Both attacks taking place over Discord suggests that the chat platform also has some work to do when it comes to authenticating users.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update: </strong>In a <a href="https://fractal.medium.com/dear-fractal-community-70173e8a5ea7">Medium post</a> Tuesday afternoon, Fractal confirmed that 373 users fell victim to the scam, but noted that they will be fully compensated by the platform in the next few days. Grape Protocol, a Solana-based tools platform confirmed that one of its admins was hacked which was likely used to exploit both Fractal and Monkey Kingdom today.</em></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>The hackers are using an exploit involving Discord webhooks</p>
<p>Everyone should check their webhooks immediately</p>
<p>We&#39;ll update as we learn more <a href="https://t.co/4iGskOnwmw">pic.twitter.com/4iGskOnwmw</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Fractal seemed to be aware that such an attack, which has already plagued a host of other NFT-centric Discord projects, was possible, if not likely. On Friday, the team set up an &#8220;anti-scam&#8221; channel in their Discord for users to flag bad actors, with a team member noting that Fractal &#8220;will NEVER ask for you to send funds to any address, and there&#8217;s NO google form to fill out,&#8221; and furthermore that users should &#8220;double check spelling of any links you see.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Fractal&#8217;s team seemed to be looking to coach their users in the right direction, the broader issue is that the underlying incentive structure of the NFT market tends to discourage users from engaging skeptically because drops sell out so quickly and there&#8217;s a culture of seizing on any and every opportunity, which can be dangerous for less seasoned crypto buyers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A security researcher found a Bluetooth vulnerability in a popular at-home COVID-19 test allowing him to modify its results.</p>
<p>F-Secure researcher Ken Gannon identified the since-fixed flaw in the Ellume COVID-19 Home Test, a self-administered antigen test that individuals can use to check to see if they have been infected with the virus. Rather than submitting a sample to a testing facility, the sample is tested using a Bluetooth analyzer, which then reports the result to the user and health authorities via Ellume’s mobile app.</p>
<p>Gannon found, however, that the built-in Bluetooth analyzer could be tricked to allow a user to falsify a certifiable result before the Ellume app processes the data.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250293" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To carry out the hack, Gannon used a rooted Android device to analyze the data the test was sending to the app. He then identified two types of Bluetooth traffic that were most likely in charge of telling the mobile app if the user was COVID positive or negative, before writing two scripts that were able to successfully change a negative result into a positive one.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2250314" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2250314" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2250314 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/test-picture-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="292" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/test-picture-1.jpg 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/test-picture-1.jpg?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/test-picture-1.jpg?resize=300,146 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/test-picture-1.jpg?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2250314" class="wp-caption-text">The faked results from the Ellume at-home COVID-19 test. (<strong>Image Credis:</strong> F-Secure)</p></div></p>
<p>Gannon says that when he received an email with his results from Ellume, it incorrectly showed he had tested positive. To complete the proof-of-concept, F-Secure also successfully obtained a certified copy of the faked COVID-19 test results from Azova, a telehealth provider that Ellume partners with for certifying at-home COVID-19 tests for travel or going into work.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://labs.f-secure.com/blog/faking-a-positive-covid-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gannon’s writeup</a> only includes changing negative results to positive ones, he says that the process &#8220;works both ways.” He also said that, before it was patched, “someone with the proper motivation and technical skills could’ve used these flaws to ensure they, or someone they’re working with, gets a negative result every time they’re tested.” In theory, a fake certification could be submitted to meet U.S. re-entry requirements.</p>
<p>In response to F-Secure’s findings, Ellume says it has updated its system to detect and prevent the transmission of falsified results.</p>
<p>“We will also deliver a verification portal to allow authorities &#8212; including health departments, employers, schools, event organizers and others &#8212; to verify the authenticity of the Ellume COVID-19 Home Test,” said Alan Fox, Ellume&#8217;s head of Information Systems. “Ellume is confident in the reliability of our ECHT test result, and we would like to thank F-Secure for bringing this issue to our attention and for the work they do every day to protect consumers, businesses and organizations around the globe.”</p>

But Patreon, founded in 2013, has been around since before words like &#8220;influencer&#8221; were in our vocabulary — back when &#8220;Tik Tok&#8221; was a Kesha song, rather than the social platform that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/twitter-is-the-latest-platform-to-test-a-tiktok-copycat-feature/">everyone</a> is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/spotify-tests-a-tiktok-like-vertical-video-feed-in-its-app/">trying</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/netflix-launches-fast-laughs-a-tiktok-like-feed-of-funny-videos/">emulate</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/patreon-triples-valuation-to-4-billion/">tripling its valuation</a> to $4 billion earlier this year, Patreon is at a crossroads. Will it continue to be the company to beat when it comes to building for creators? At the same time, can Patreon stay ahead of its competition while making creators feel that the product is looking out for their best interests?</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not going to be one of those companies that defined the first eight years, but not the next eight years [of the creator economy],&#8221; Patreon Chief Product Officer Julian Gutman told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249936" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Speaking with TechCrunch about the platform&#8217;s plans for 2022, Gutman said that Patreon hopes to stay ahead of the curve by aggressively hiring, especially in product and engineering. Gutman himself only <a href="https://blog.patreon.com/product-leader-at-instagram-joins-patreon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined Patreon</a> in January, bouncing over from Instagram, where he was head of Product for Instagram&#8217;s home feed experience. In August, Patreon also hired Senior VP of Engineering <a href="https://blog.patreon.com/patreon-welcomes-former-googler-utkarsh-srivastava-as-senior-vp-of-engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Utkarsh Srivastava</a>, who formerly led teams at Google and Twitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve hired 60 folks across product, engineering and design in the last quarter, and kind of expect that pace of hiring to continue into the next year,&#8221; Gutman said. &#8220;We have folks joining from Instagram, Uber and Square, and all these companies that I would say are like the first generation of the creator economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patreon isn&#8217;t a new company, but Gutman thinks that since its mission from the get-go has been to help creative people make money, it&#8217;s better prepared to lead in this supposed &#8220;second generation&#8221; than social media platforms like his former employer Instagram. Regardless, social platforms are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/snap-paid-250-million-to-creators-on-its-tiktok-clone-this-year/">investing heavily</a> in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/instagram-bonuses-reels-tiktok/">direct-to-creator payments</a>. But Patreon&#8217;s model enables sustainable, monthly creator payouts, as opposed to one-time <a href="https://about.instagram.com/features/reels/reels-surprise?gk_enable=about_ig_reels_contest_launch_holdout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprise bonuses</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JwirUE3hNz"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/12/patreon-business/">The business of Patreon</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The business of Patreon&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/12/patreon-business/embed/#?secret=JwirUE3hNz" data-secret="JwirUE3hNz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Patreon has 400 employees now, but Gutman said the company hopes to end next year with closer to 1,000 employees. Within product, engineering and design specifically, Patreon hopes to scale from 150 employees (including 60 recent hires) to 400 in 2022.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a reflection of what we want to build, and the pace and the quality at which we want to build it,&#8221; Gutman said. &#8220;We&#8217;re really excited for potential creators right now, and we want to just be giving them as many tools as possible as quickly as possible to help them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patreon has already teased some of the <a href="https://next.patreon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">projects it&#8217;s working on</a> for 2022, including a native video platform (so exclusive video content can live on-platform, not in an unlisted YouTube link), an improved posting experience with more formatting options, different ways of organizing content on a Patreon page, more data and analytics, a cleaner app design, simpler playback experiences for multimedia and more. The platform is even planning to revamp its <a href="https://blog.patreon.com/thoughts-on-improving-patron-billing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billing system</a>, which Patreon says has been &#8220;a source of confusion and frustration&#8221; for many of its creators.</p>
<p>But another big question for Patreon is whether it will bring crypto technology to the platform. Earlier this fall, Gutman, along with founder and CEO Jack Conte, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/patreon-confirms-its-exploring-crypto-as-a-way-for-creators-to-make-money/">confirmed</a> that Patreon is exploring crypto as a way for creators to make money. Patreon floated the idea of crypto creator coins in its fall Creator Policy Engagement Program update, but at a subsequent livestream, creators expressed concerns about how Patreon dabbling in crypto could impact their relationships with their patrons.</p>
<p>The actions that Patreon takes as a company impact the livelihoods of the creators making a living on their platform. Some creators on that livestream worried that if Patreon launched creator coins, their crypto-averse patrons might unsubscribe, even if they themselves weren&#8217;t using those tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some really interesting fundamental pieces of [crypto] technology that are actually quite aligned with our mission and what everyone&#8217;s wanted for the creator economy for a long time — rights ownership, independence, owning your content, owning your business, owning your audience, decentralization, all these themes,&#8221; Gutman told TechCrunch. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re ready to jump on any particular application or bandwagon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patreon does not have a dedicated team working on crypto, though there are some people in the company who are passionate about crypto and formed what Gutman called &#8220;an internal pod in their spare time.&#8221; He said that early next year, Patreon might consider building a small team of a few people dedicated to investigating how the company could possibly leverage crypto to support creators.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not, &#8216;hey, let&#8217;s go build an NFT platform right now,&#8217; but you know, a couple of folks that are focused on this full time,&#8221; Gutman said. &#8220;And by the way, they might conclude, &#8216;Hey, you know what, there&#8217;s nothing for us to build here right now,&#8217; which is a totally fine, reasonable conclusion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patreon isn&#8217;t taking the question of whether or not to dip its toes into crypto lightly. The choice could divide its community and force creators to act as spokespeople for the company&#8217;s decisions, which can alienate individual creators&#8217; patrons.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Kickstarter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/kickstarter-plans-to-move-its-crowdfunding-platform-to-the-blockchain/">announced</a> it would move its crowdfunding platform to the blockchain, sparking <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/18/web3-kickstarter-and-discord-face-backlash-over-moves-into-crypto.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backlash</a> from users, especially those who have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/the-debate-about-cryptocurrency-and-energy-consumption/">environmental concerns</a> about some blockchain technology. Meanwhile, in November, Discord CEO Jason Citron <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/discord-nfts-metamask-crypto/">tweeted</a> an image of the crypto wallet MetaMask integrated into the chat platform&#8217;s interface. But even crypto-savvy users worried that linking crypto wallets with Discord accounts could make it easier to carry out fraud and scams on the platform. After some users urged each other to cancel their paid Discord Nitro subscriptions in protest of the company&#8217;s perceived movements toward crypto, Citron put out a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/discord-nfts-crypto-jason-citron/">statement</a> saying that Discord doesn&#8217;t have plans to pursue the technology at this time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think one other important thing for us is over the next few years, we want to provide a toolset that creators can piece together differently,&#8221; Gutman said. &#8220;So we might have a crypto part of the toolset if we think there&#8217;s something there that creators might choose to use.&#8221;</p>
<p>But more immediately, Gutman emphasized that community will be a focus for Patreon in 2022.</p>
<p>&#8220;When people think creators, they think content. But so much of what creators do is community today,&#8221; Gutman said. &#8220;They really are these community leaders. They help communities come together around a shared topic of interest or a shared passion, and I think it&#8217;s a really undervalued part of what creators offer the world, particularly in this day and age.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right now, a popular perk for creators to offer their fans is access to private, patron-only Discord servers. Gutman said that Patreon wants to create on-platform products for building community in addition to its suite of integrations with platforms like Discord.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are creator-first, so if creators want to use an integration and they prefer an integration, we&#8217;re really excited by that,&#8221; Gutman said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not so much an on-platform versus off-platform type of battle, but we are really excited to look at building more first-party community tools, and one of the things we&#8217;re excited about is where content meets community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Changes at a company like Patreon can be anxiety-inducing for creators who rely on the platform for their livelihood. In the new year, Patreon plans to conduct a creator census to maintain a direct line of communication with the people who stand to be most affected by big shifts in the company&#8217;s product plans.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Billions of dollars, dozens of deals and one legal battle: The year in eVTOL was an unforgettable one, with developers picking up the pace even as the larger aviation sector was busy slowly recovering from the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Below, we catch up with leading analysts and investors to identify the top trends that shaped eVTOL this year &#8212; and will likely continue to reverberate in the years to come.</p>
<h2>Did someone say SPAC?</h2>
<p>Archer Aviation. Joby Aviation. Lilium. Vertical Aerospace. What do these companies have in common, besides the fact that they’re each developing eVTOL aircraft? They all announced or completed mergers with blank-check firms this year, in an absolutely mind-blowing injection of capital into this once nascent &#8212; even far-fetched &#8212; technology.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244974" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If 2021 should be remembered for anything in the world of eVTOL, it’s principally the massive amount of money that has gone into the sector. Three SPAC deals alone &#8212; that of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/joby-aviation-makes-its-public-trading-debut-on-the-nyse/">Joby</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/archer-lands-1-1b-order-from-united-airlines-and-a-spac-deal/">Archer</a> and German developer Lilium &#8212; raised more than $2.5 billion combined in gross proceeds, with Joby’s proceeds constituting nearly half that figure, at $1.1 billion. EVTOL aircraft are not the only mobility technology to have flocked to SPACs as a financial vehicle to take them to public markets, but the sheer number of deals is certainly one of the standout trends of this year.</p>
<p>“What&#8217;s different with the eVTOL industry today and where they were, let&#8217;s say a year ago, is access to capital,” Kristine Liwag, senior aerospace and defense analyst at Morgan Stanley, explained.</p>
<p>This outsized influx of cash means these companies now have a meaningful amount of capital to take them through the long and thorough process of certifying their aircraft with the Federal Aviation Administration, a necessary prerequisite to launching commercial operations. Whether it will be enough is another matter, and is dependent on each company&#8217;s progress and cost efficiency.</p>
<p>The high cost of commercializing the technology likely drove the SPAC trend. Aviation is a capital-intensive business, and many believe that it could cost as much as $1 billion to take an eVTOL from design through manufacturing and certification.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Definitely the standout for me was the fact that a number of leading startups have found a way to get a budget that is capable of getting an aircraft towards full certification,” David Wyatt, technology analyst at IDTechEx, said. “It feels like a big step has been jumped there in terms of the likelihood of getting more of these test aircraft into the air, from a prototype phase into something that is much more of a concrete eVTOL functional aircraft.”</p>
<p>Even beyond SPACs, there has been plenty of venture funding into eVTOL companies. 2021 also saw massive funding rounds, including Beta Technologies’ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/beta-technologies-adds-368-million-in-series-a-funding-for-its-electric-aviation-ecosystem/">$368 million Series A</a> and Xpeng-backed HT Aero’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/xpeng-backed-urban-air-mobility-company-ht-aero-raises-500m/">$500 million Series A</a>.</p>
<p>“2021 has been the year where we&#8217;re not asking anymore the question of, can it be certified?” Sergio Cecutta, founder and partner at SMG Consulting, said. “Now the question we&#8217;re asking is, when will it be certified? We&#8217;re beyond, ‘Will these things ever fly? Are they certifiable?’ Yes, they are. Now we need to roll up our sleeves and do it.”</p>
<h2>Movement on the ground</h2>
<p>Air taxi developers aren’t just focused on their aircraft. In order to make the market for electric aviation a reality, they’ll need a whole lot more: ground infrastructure, like vertiports or specialized areas in airports, plus charging points capable of getting enough juice to their vehicles.</p>
<p>There’s still a <em>lot </em>of work to be done in this area, but 2021 saw eVTOL operators make notable strides toward at least starting to establish infrastructure required for commercial operations by mid-decade. This includes a partnership between Lilium and ABB E-mobility to supply charging infrastructure for the Lilium Jet; separate partnerships between Joby and Archer with parking garage owner REEF Technology; and a partnership between Vertical and Heathrow Airport to explore how eVTOL could fit into the airport’s operations.</p>
<p>Archer, Joby and Volocopter are also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/how-los-angeles-is-preparing-for-the-air-taxi-takeoff/">collaborating with Urban Movement Labs</a> in Los Angeles to explore how the city can integrate urban air mobility into existing infrastructure and transportation networks.</p>
<p>“I know that airports are starting to really heavily think about this,” JetBlue Technology Ventures President Amy Burr said. “Anybody who&#8217;s doing any infrastructure project at an airport is thinking about whether or not they need to put in a vertiport.”</p>
<h2>(Contingent) orders</h2>
<p>Finally, in 2021 we saw an increase of orders for eVTOL aircraft &#8212; starting, of course, with news from United that it had placed a $1 billion order with Archer Aviation. That was followed by a cascade of orders for aircraft from Embraer-backed air taxi developer Eve Urban Air Mobility, an order from UPS for Beta Technologies and conditional preorders topping 1,350 aircraft from Vertical Aerospace.</p>
<p>It’s important to be clear that none of these orders are firm, which makes sense because the commercial product doesn’t exist yet. Orders are contingent upon completion of development, certification and likely other performance milestones.</p>
<p>Yet, even if it should be a tempered signal for any individual company, it’s still a promising sign for the industry, Wyatt said.</p>
<p>“I think it&#8217;s promising in that obviously there is a market for these aircrafts […] It certainly gives the confidence that if these aircraft are given their flight certification, are able to fly, then there will be considerable interest from the market for these aircraft.”</p>
<h2>Auto gets involved</h2>
<p>The final notable trend of 2021 is the increased activity from legacy automakers. While startups might&#8217;ve grabbed the most headlines, these older and more established companies have also started to notice the promise of electric aviation. (Notably, established aerospace companies, like Boeing and Airbus, have maintained a more established interest in eVTOL &#8212; Boeing through its joint venture with Kitty Hawk/Wisk Aero; and Airbus with its CityAirbus NextGen eVTOL concept.)</p>
<p>Amongst automakers, Hyundai is one such example. While the company unveiled an eVTOL concept design at CES in 2020, this year it officially spun out its urban air mobility business, calling it Supernal. Honda also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/honda-motor-co-announces-plans-for-evtol-avatar-robots-and-space-technologies/">confirmed plans to develop</a> a hybrid eVTOL &#8212; notable because the company said it would be one piece of a &#8220;mobility ecosystem&#8221; that includes connected apps and Honda vehicles. Then, of course, there&#8217;s Chinese automaker Xpeng Motors, which announced at the end of October that its urban air mobility subsidiary HT Aero had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/xpeng-backed-urban-air-mobility-company-ht-aero-raises-500m/">raised $500 million</a> to deliver on an eVTOL car concept.</p>
<p>These efforts are worth paying attention to, because these major automakers have both the capital and the manufacturing infrastructure to make moves on eVTOL project. That&#8217;s no assurance of success, of course, and these larger companies may not face the same pressures (and motivations) as a startup, but it&#8217;s definitely something to keep watch of looking to the future.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Crypto companies may be choosing to avoid marginalized communities rather than devising strategic ways to include them.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The United States’ <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-imposes-sanctions-people-iran-syria-uganda-citing-rights-abuses-2021-12-07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial sanctions</a> against countries like Iran create a messy regulatory environment where cryptocurrency startups have to pick their battles carefully. So far, the battles these companies aren&#8217;t picking are having real effects on users and can sometimes directly contradict the company’s alleged decentralization philosophy.</p>
<p>“Something will come down on someone. We just don’t know where or when these regulations will be tested,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/florio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Larry Florio</a>, general counsel at <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/08/31/investing-in-syndicate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syndicate</a>, a company focused on enabling “decentralized autonomous organizations” (DAOs) for tech-savvy collectives.</p>
<p>For a previous example, the crypto custody startup BitGo was <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/20201230_bitgo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">penalized in 2020</a> by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) for failing “to implement controls designed to prevent” interacting with users from sanctioned jurisdictions. Basically, BitGo is almost like a crypto bank; it helps store clients’ assets in secure vaults. And the legal penalty came when some of those clients may have received cryptocurrency from individuals in sanctioned jurisdictions. OFAC showed this is not allowed under U.S. sanctions. Along those same lines, the crypto exchange <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/11/15/binance-warns-iranian-traders-to-withdraw-crypto-amid-sanctions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> has been known to routinely deactivate accounts owned by Iranians and Cubans.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248864" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That’s supposedly why the ConsenSys Academy, one of the industry’s leading Ethereum-centric educational organizations, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/24/consensys-suddenly-bars-iranian-students-from-ethereum-coding-class/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banned roughly 50 Iranian students</a> from its online platform in November 2021, claiming a “recent review of our records shows that you indicated that you are located in a country that we are prohibited from providing goods or services to under U.S. law.”</p>
<p>This compliance review raises questions since the program was free, with no transactions involved, and Coogan Brennan, head of developer relations at ConsenSys Academy, gave an interview to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/consensys-grants-help-iranian-women-130000273.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoinDesk in February 2021</a> about these Iranian students and the challenges they faced. Former program participant Salman Sadeghi told TechCrunch that “Iranians are treated like second-class citizens in web3.”</p>
<p>“They knew that we were from Iran from the very beginning,” Sadeghi said. “I think sanctions harm innocent people as you see, not the government. It’s not fair…<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/28/inside-irans-onslaught-on-bitcoin-mining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum mining</a> is still popular in Iran. But it’s <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/27/iranian-general-advocates-crypto-use-for-skirting-sanctions-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the government</a>, mostly, that mines cryptocurrency.”</p>
<p>Yet another thwarted student, who goes by @Alireza__28, said that he had already quit his job in Tehran to study at the academy and that getting kicked out of the program without a completion certificate, after months of participation, ruined his career plans.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“It was really humiliating,” he said. “There are many remote blockchain job opportunities that pay with crypto. It doesn&#8217;t matter where you are living. Another hope that I had was getting a job offer with a visa sponsorship [to leave Iran]. And the other big hope I had was to make a decentralized app from here, myself.”</p>
<p>It’s also unclear if the sanctions actually apply to this educational program at all. The <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/06/04/coursera-restores-access-iranian-students" target="_blank" rel="noopener">educational platform Coursera </a>does allow Iranian students with direct permission from the U.S. government. According to Michael Mosier, the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/05/27/fincens-new-head-says-controversial-trump-era-crypto-proposal-is-still-pending/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former acting director</a> of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Biden administration is trying to thaw relations with Iran. As such, OFAC might have granted ConsenSys permission to serve this population. For an example from a different sanctioned country, last year OFAC <a href="https://twitter.com/M_Mosier_/status/1447341598392606726?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved</a> a humanitarian<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/us-government-enlists-usdc-global-193616264.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> stablecoin distribution campaign</a> in <a href="https://www.circle.com/blog/circle-partners-with-bolivarian-republic-of-venezuela-and-airtm-to-deliver-aid-to-venezuelans-using-usdc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Venezuela</a>.</p>
<p>“The big takeaway from the ConsenSys stuff is that it’s worth talking to experienced lawyers in the OFAC space,” Mosier said. “I find it hard to believe that ConsenSys can’t do this. There’s a lot of times when people self-select out of something rather than deal with the risk.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, Florio countered that it is hard to fault companies taking a conservative approach to such sanctions.</p>
<p>“Sometimes even just trying to seek a waiver could raise your profile and attract more regulatory scrutiny,” Florio said. “A lot of the way that the industry works these days is don’t ask, don’t tell.”</p>
<p>There may still be hope for Iranian Ethereum fans. ConsenSys global PR lead Elo Gimenez told TechCrunch his company is “fully dedicated to our mission of building the digital economy of tomorrow, which includes exploring ways that we can lawfully share and educate around the world, including in jurisdictions where international engagement can be challenging.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, it’s still commonplace for Iranians to use centralized NFT platforms and tools provided by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin’s portfolio companies like <a href="https://decrypt.co/66541/ethereum-gitcoin-raises-11-million-spins-out-consensys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gitcoin</a> or MetaMask, usually in combination with a VPN service to mask their location. The crowdfunding platform Gitcoin, for example, is a crowdfunding platform that hosted a <a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/2215/solidity-development-course-by-women-in-blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign</a> for Persian-speaking students that was active from March until <a href="https://twitter.com/annbrody7/status/1468737168294256644?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December</a> 2021.<em> </em></p>
<p>Gitcoin COO Kyle Weiss told TechCrunch that, as of December 8, 2021, his fundraising platform is now “marking this grant as inactive out of an abundance of caution to ensure compliance with U.S. law.”</p>
<p>However, Mary Beth Buchanan, the former general counsel for the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken who previously worked for the Department of Justice, where she contributed to the Sentencing Guidelines for Business Organizations, told TechCrunch she doesn’t agree that companies like Gitcoin and ConsenSys Academy need to automatically ban users from sanctioned countries.</p>
<p>“It’s quite possible the activity they wanted to engage in might even be exempt from sanctions. It may be that the company didn’t ask the right questions,” Buchanan said. “Lots of activities are completely exempt from the sanctions regime and others can be granted a general license. You can also apply to OFAC on a case-by-case basis to ask if what you’re doing is okay.… there are phone numbers so that even average people can call OFAC and talk through whether an activity is exempt from sanctions.”</p>
<p>In short, crypto companies may be choosing to avoid marginalized communities rather than devising strategic ways to include them. Buchanan said, especially in cases that involve art or education, it’s far less expensive to be compliant than most business owners might expect. In the meantime, some people from Iran, <a href="https://twitter.com/sobradob/status/1466112990261002241" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cuba</a> and other sanctioned countries feel the crypto industry operates with a de facto caste system. Needing to hide one&#8217;s identity in order to participate in online communities is not the same thing as the community being borderless or inclusive.</p>
<p>“Yes, we can develop our own user interfaces and web3 websites,” said Aysha Amin, one of the women involved with the shuttered Gitcoin campaign, describing the esoteric concept that people refer to as web3 or “the metaverse” when describing Ethereum projects and altcoin competitors like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/solana-a-blockchain-platform-followed-by-top-crypto-investors-says-its-a-lot-faster-than-ethereum/">Solana</a>. “This kind of isolation does not seem good.”</p>
<p>Beyond Gitcoin, Amin said she’s currently participating in an <a href="https://twitter.com/0xrajeev/status/1416793642182737920" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum Foundation-supported</a> educational program, called Secureum, while also working for a Tehran-based tech company. Like many Iranians cited in this piece, she is a MetaMask user who intends to continue working in the space despite discriminatory bans on any specific platform.</p>
<p>“We started this [Farsi-language group for blockchain enthusiasts] group after finishing [another] ConsenSys blockchain developer bootcamp,” Amin said. “As long as I have my own private key, I’m not worried. MetaMask saves my info locally.”</p>
<p>For a little background, the Iranian group she’s a part of includes members that met in Japan at the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/10/devcon-shows-ethereums-world-computer-is-a-movement-not-a-product/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DevCon</a> Ethereum conference in 2019. Amin joined this subgroup of five Iranian women in 2021. Their U.S.-based partner in the Gitcoin campaign, Thessy Mehrain, described the Gitcoin campaign:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have worked with Consensys Academy on diversity initiatives. As part of that, I was offered scholarships for minority communities, which I in turn extended to <a href="https://coiniran.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoinIran</a>, an Amsterdam-based organization that has the goal to educate about web3. I met them [CoinIran bloggers] at the Ethereum conference in Osaka. In 2020, a group of female developers took part in the Solidity bootcamp… a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/WomeninBlockchainCommunity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Women in Blockchain</a> chapter was formed in Tehran, the same as we have globally in NYC, Boston, Brisbane, Lagos and elsewhere… They are run locally, entirely independently to educate about the tech and its opportunities.</p></blockquote>
<p>All things considered, it appears these initiatives are more focused on education than strictly on financial transactions.</p>
<p>“Education helps an individual make informed decisions for themselves and also contribute to the progress of the society and nation,” Mehrain said. “These women are members of the global society and should be empowered by education to meaningfully contribute.”</p>
<p>And it also appears that the recent Gitcoin ban is an outlier among the global initiatives funded by Ethereum co-founders like Vitalik Buterin, founder of the Ethereum Foundation, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2018/12/05/cryptopia-in-crisis-billionaire-joe-lubins-ethereum-experiment-is-a-mess-how-long-will-he-prop-it-up/?sh=7c51977c2f0a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lubin</a>, the leading <a href="https://decrypt.co/66541/ethereum-gitcoin-raises-11-million-spins-out-consensys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investor</a> behind ConsenSys. This is partially because, as Florio pointed out, it’s impossible to discriminate across the entire metaverse.</p>
<p>“I don’t see sovereign nations giving up their foreign policy arsenal… yet it&#8217;s unenforceable to say that Iranians can’t participate in anything without applying some type of firewall to the entire country of Iran. I don’t even think the technology exists to do something like that type of internet blockade,” Florio said. “Imposing sanction laws is going to be difficult and require creative interpretations&#8230;I don’t know how the enforcement will come there or if they’ll take into account there are no known methods of fully complying in this context.”</p>
<p>For now, some crypto companies prefer to ban Iranians and other people from sanctioned jurisdictions, rather than seek a compliant legal strategy for including them.</p>
<p>“We don’t have full access all the time. It’s easy to exclude or ban us in web3,” Amin said. “Here in Iran, people who work with blockchain technology, miners, traders, developers, always worry about their access to web3. And we definitely feel this ‘second class citizens’ treatment.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With traction metrics that would make any startup CFO foam at the mouth, TikTok influencer marketing platform <a href="https://www.ubiquitousinfluence.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubiquitous</a> is making a big splash in the chaotic market of influencer marketing. It&#8217;s one of the fastest-growing segments of advertising and marketing, but one that brings some unique challenges; working with influencers directly is labor-intensive, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/early-stage-brands-should-also-unlock-the-power-of-influencers/">results don&#8217;t lie</a>, and many brands are finding it&#8217;s worth the hassle.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen a bunch of activity in this space recently, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/productwind-raises-1-67m-to-connect-your-brand-with-hundreds-of-influencers/">$2 million ProductWind</a> round, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/kenyas-aifluence-closes-1m-for-its-ai-powered-influencer-marketing-platform/">Alfluence&#8217;s $1 million</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/cross-selling-startup-carro-secures-20m-to-connect-brands-with-each-other-influencers/">Carro&#8217;s $20 million</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/influencer-marketing/">many more</a>. The reason Ubiquitous&#8217; platform caught my eye is that it raised a $5 million round led by <a href="https://uncorkcapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uncork</a> in its largest seed investment to date (with additional funding from <a href="https://100thieves.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 Thieves</a> and <a href="https://www.startingline.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starting Line VC</a>), and the company has seen some stunning growth. The company launched just six months ago, has already booked $6 million of sales and is claiming astonishing conversion rates across the board, with 250 brands already using the platform, and corraling more than 1,000 influencers onto its platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was head of growth and then VP of Marketing for a company called <a href="https://www.getbellhops.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bellhop</a>. In that role, I came across this opportunity because I tried to put a test budget into TikTok influencers. We tried to find an agency or a platform or anything that specializes in this. We were looking at it for a week, but we concluded there wasn&#8217;t one. Like even when we&#8217;re talking to the <a href="https://www.viralnation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viral Nations</a> of the world, and all our traditional providers. They&#8217;re not taking this seriously. They&#8217;re not really investing in the space to be able to get us the data that we need,&#8221; Alex Elsea, co-founder at Ubiquitous, said as he outlined the history of the company. &#8220;That was final straw for me as a marketing leader. I&#8217;ve never had a good experience with an influencer marketing provider. And so we set out to create the company that was missing in the market.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248056" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Running influencer campaigns in-house is tremendously work intensive; if you want to put $100,000 into a test campaign, you&#8217;re looking at 20-40 creators on the various platforms. That means you&#8217;re trying to find contact details for 100, negotiate with 50-60, sign agreements with 30 or so. Managing briefs, signing off on creative, handling negotiations and payments and contracts &#8212; it becomes an administrative nightmare very fast, and you&#8217;re often working with a number of creators who don&#8217;t have a slick process set up for how to handle this. In other words; you&#8217;re hiring amateurs for contract work, which is hard at the best of times.</p>
<p>&#8220;The moment it all clicked was in a meeting with myself and my marketing leadership team. I found myself wondering, &#8216;how is anyone doing this? How is anyone able to actually execute at this scale?&#8217; At the same time, the quotes and the rates that we got back from the TikTok influencers was astounding. They were a fourth of what we were paying on Instagram, and the engagement rates were four to six times higher. It was the best data I had ever seen &#8212; but it was so much work to make it happen that it just didn&#8217;t scale,&#8221; explains Elsea. &#8220;And so there was this meeting, we looked at each other, we were like, are we missing something? Or is this the best opportunity we&#8217;ve ever seen?&#8221;</p>
<p>Long story short, Elsea and his founding team had stumbled into a huge opportunity in a brand new market &#8212; influencer marketing has been happening for a while, but rarely at scale, and TikTok had a different approach than Instagram, which meant that the dynamics of running influencer campaigns suddenly started to make a lot more sense.</p>
<p>&#8220;And every brand is going through the same thing &#8212; so there is a huge need, and you need some tech to automate it, because otherwise, you need a massive team in order to deploy that budget on an influencer-by-influencer basis, using phone calls, text messages and emails. Our platform helps with that,&#8221; explains Elsea.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is essentially a marketplace with an agency component: Ubiquitous helps marketing managers put together an influencer strategy, select the best influencers to work with, and then execute the whole campaign, end-to-end. The business model is clever, too, getting two bites of the apple for every transaction. The company charges its advertisers a platform fee, but it also charges a percentage of the money it pays out to its influencers. The company&#8217;s founders declined to specify exactly what its cut is on either side of the transaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been doing it for about a year, with about a year and a half of testing. We officially launched April 1st, and we found product-market fit on the brand side and on the creator side. Since our launch, we went from zero to a $5 million revenue run rate, and in less than five months, it just took off,&#8221; explains Elsea. &#8220;To date, in reality, what VCs have been willing to fund has moved this industry the wrong way. It&#8217;s pushed it towards a SaaS model where you&#8217;re taking the humans out of the equation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ubiquitous decided that if campaigns are five-, six- and seven-figure sums, it wasn&#8217;t enough to sell the brands a SaaS package, give them a log-in and say &#8220;good luck, folks,&#8221; and instead built up a fully functional platform to take care of all aspects of the influencer marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>With the funds raised, the company has ambitious plans. The company admits that what it has built so far is a bit basic, but claims it is head and shoulders above what the competition is offering. To get further ahead, the company is scaling out an engineering and product team and is adding a number of tools that serve the creators.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a deep passion for taking care of these creators. The whole industry is kind of designed to take advantage of the influencers. We want to fix that. We&#8217;ve been able to build a creator network of this size this quickly by building a brand that actually puts them first and takes care of them,&#8221; explains Elsea. &#8220;Instead of only bringing them deals, the creator-facing app is going to be the hub of their entire careers. We are talking about rolling out creator-facing insurance, accounting services and much more.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">To create successful growth strategies, relevant marketing campaigns and products that deliver real value to your customers, you must first <em>understand</em> your customers. Doing that requires studying them, talking to them and building target personas to help you make them real to your team. Developing your customer profile is an integral piece of positioning your brand and an indispensable section of your brand book.</p>
<p>Many founders broaden their total addressable market (TAM) to make the numbers on fundraising decks seem more exciting, but effective customer targeting requires you to surgically narrow to a specific customer profile — right down to a name, an age and even a face. Once you’ve identified your customer, it’s critically important to articulate the demographic <em>and</em> ethnographic elements that define them. Demographic information (such as location, gender, marital status) isn’t nearly enough, and to understand the customer, you must also understand relevant ethnographic elements like their lifestyles and motivations.</p>
<p>Here’s how:</p>
<p>Pull a list of your most dedicated users for each metric that matters to your company, such as highest LTV, most frequent user, highest number of purchases or even highest referring customer. Your goal is to generate a list of customers, and the exact number may vary depending on the stage of your company. For a seed company, I’d recommend pulling a list of 15-25 customers. If you’re pre-launch and don’t have customers just yet, you can build a list of your desired users using external data from third-party apps and Google.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			By clearly articulating the preferences, pain points and motivations of your ideal customers, you’ll be able to approach messaging in an informed and strategic manner. 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Create a spreadsheet that includes at a minimum the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique customer ID</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Career/profession</li>
<li>Referral source</li>
<li>Marital status</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Purchasing behavior (defining first purchase, second purchase, third purchase, etc.) and/or engagement behavior (first, interaction, second interaction and so on.)</li>
<li>LTV</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the above parameters include both internal and external data, you’ll have to use third-party tools or even do some cyber-sleuthing (you’ll be surprised how much you can learn with a Google search). Leverage your own database for usage behavior and customer journey, but put in the elbow grease necessary to understand more about each customer.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What matters here is that Jack Dorsey, a well-known proponent of the original cryptocurrency bitcoin, isn't big on web3 projects.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s my last day of work for the year, so we&#8217;re going to have some fun. Obviously, we&#8217;re talking crypto this morning.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jack">Jack Dorsey</a>, former Twitter CEO and present CEO of Block, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/square-is-changing-its-name-to-block/">company formerly known as Square</a>, stirred the crypto pot recently, making explicit his preferences in the larger blockchain landscape by taking swipes at decentralized internet projects that don&#8217;t fall under Bitcoin&#8217;s aegis.</p>

<p>To avoid being accused of misinterpreting Jack, here are his key statements, starting with <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473139010197508098">the genesis tweet</a> of the conversation:</p>

<p>And a few hours after Jack&#8217;s tweet, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1473165434518224896">Elon Musk joined in the fun</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2250258" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-21-at-8.32.15-AM.png?w=550" alt="" width="550" height="252" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-21-at-8.32.15-AM.png 550w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-21-at-8.32.15-AM.png?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-21-at-8.32.15-AM.png?resize=300,137 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-21-at-8.32.15-AM.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></p>
<p>There are several different things being said here, and a few of the tweets could use a bit of explaining if you don&#8217;t live on Twitter. The Exchange has your back:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On who &#8220;owns&#8221; web3:</strong> Jack argues that regular users aren&#8217;t owners of web3 projects. Instead, the CEO claims that venture capitalists and, in turn, their investors are. Even more, Jack doesn&#8217;t expect this dynamic to change; instead, he anticipates that centralized capital pools backing a plethora of crypto projects will maintain quite a lot of control thanks to venture incentives.</li>
<li><strong>On being critical of web3: </strong>After being criticized for &#8220;stifling&#8221; web3 work, Jack dismissed the complaint and said that &#8220;critiques&#8221; can help folks choose to work on more fulfilling projects.</li>
<li><strong>On who will own web3:</strong> Elon Musk jumped into the fun to ask where web3 is, as he is struggling to find it. Jack then subtweets a16z, the venture capital firm, as the nexus point for web3 project funding, and therefore control.</li>
</ul>
<p>What matters in the above is that Jack, a well-known proponent of the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, isn&#8217;t big on web3 projects.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s notable that these two characters popped up to argue against the flood of greed that&#8217;s cropped up in the decentralized economy over the last few years, with every traditional pile of money wanting to get in on putative web3 returns.</p>
<h2>Who owns what?</h2>
<p>The core of Jack&#8217;s complaint is that leading web3 corporations are owned by venture capitalists, and therefore will have to live with venture incentives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Venture incentives,&#8221; of course, is a polite way of saying <em>running a company in such a manner that venture capitalists and their backers make lots of money. </em></p>
<p>The complaint is pretty true. Venture capitalists invested <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/venture-funds-poured-over-6-5-billion-into-crypto-in-q3-2021/">more than $6 billion</a> into crypto projects in Q3 2021 alone. That should give you an idea of the scale of the crypto world being purchased by traditional, private-market investors at the moment. More simply, pension funds own a lot of the crypto economy.</p>
<p>Jack&#8217;s diss about venture capitalists and web3 didn&#8217;t stop there. Not only did Jack say that web3 projects have a weakness in their core thanks to the economic bargains their progenitors have made with external capital, but also that they are <em>centralized. </em></p>
<p>Aside from calling someone a &#8220;nocoiner&#8221; who is going to, alternatively, &#8220;stay poor&#8221; or &#8220;ngmi,&#8221; saying that a crypto project is centralized is perhaps the rudest possible comment.</p>
<p>Is Jack wrong? No, he is not.</p>
<p>It is true that venture players are flooding the zone in web3 with cash and assistance because they think it will make them money. This leads to quite a lot of centralization. For example, I find it blisteringly funny that a16z is an investor in both Coinbase and OpenSea. And that Coinbase intends to get in on the NFT game. You know, the thing that OpenSea currently rules.</p>
<p>Even more, projects like <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/solana-generates-1-billion-in-returns-for-early-backers">Solana sold a bunch of their tokens for a song to venture investors</a>, effectively handing out upside that is forever frozen in already swollen accounts. Centralization? Of ownership <em>and</em> returns, in that case.</p>
<p>Centralization is antithetical to the original, somewhat punk Bitcoin ethos. Web3 advocates, as far as I can tell it, are perfectly content with using external funds to power their new token-based projects as a way to accelerate the future they see coming. Fiat as crutch, I suppose.</p>
<p>But Bitcoin didn&#8217;t need to raise three venture rounds in a year to grow. It just nailed an idea that <em>still </em>resonates. Something to think about.</p>
<p>Now we get to a very large <em>yeah, but</em>.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin is religion; web3 is greed</h2>
<p>While it&#8217;s nice to agree with someone on a crypto viewpoint, I don&#8217;t agree with Jack on everything.</p>
<p>For example, I don&#8217;t agree that Bitcoin is not centralized. It is to a degree that I don&#8217;t think that many people really grok. A new study found this week that &#8220;approximately 0.01% of Bitcoin holders control 27% of the 19 million Bitcoin that are now in circulation,&#8221; <a href="https://www.baystreet.ca/cryptonews/148/Bitcoin-Ownership-Increasingly-Concentrated-In-a-Few-Hands-Study">per Baystreet</a>.</p>
<p>This is why, when I consider the two warring religious camps in the crypto world &#8212; the Bitcoin maximalists who think that the original crypto project is a decentralized Jesus and the web3 &#8220;gm&#8221; crew &#8212; it&#8217;s clear that they are rather different.</p>
<p>Bitcoin maxis are <em>religious</em> in their belief that the OG crypto nailed it, and successive projects are bunk. And web3 is <em>greed</em>, a way to financialize everything online in a manner that allows traditional investors to own toll booths and tax collectors throughout the decentralized landscape.</p>
<p>So while I am more than content to nod along to Jack stirring the web3 pot, I don&#8217;t agree with his general philosophy. Still, Jack managed to point out that a bunch of naked wannabe emperors are, in fact, <em>au naturel</em>. And that&#8217;s a good way to kick off the day.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.getampla.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ampla Technologies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that provides financing to small-to-medium sized consumer-facing businesses, announced today it has raised $40 million in a Series A round of funding co-led by VMG Partners and Forerunner Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backer Core Innovation Capital also put money in the round. Shortly before and separately from the equity investment, Ampla has also secured $250 million in a debt facility so that it can continue financing brands. The capital infusions bring the New York-based startup’s total funding to $50 million in equity and $330 million in debt financing since its 2019 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are a number of startups out there funding SMBs and e-commerce businesses, Ampla claims that its differentiator is that it provides businesses with a line of credit that includes “omnichannel” revenue streams in underwriting. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s goal is to give founders access to more capital at lower cost, according to Ampla CEO and founder Anthony Santomo. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250198" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ampla’s flagship product, for example, aims to provide (even pre-revenue) businesses with working capital so they can do things like purchase inventory and spend on marketing. Ampla currently works with SMBs in the consumer brand industry across both e-commerce and retail channels. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its “proprietary” data-driven underwriting tool takes the entire business into account</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and provides “fully transparent” interest rates with no hidden fees and larger credit limits, according to Santomo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike raising venture money, the working capital is non-dilutive. Indeed, a number of startups providing alternative financing have emerged in recent years, including </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/clearbanc-unicorn-clearco/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearco </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/settle-raises-15m-from-kleiner-perkins-to-give-e-commerce-companies-more-working-capital/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Settle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ampla goes a step further, Santomo added, by providing adjacent financial tools designed “to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">help emerging companies grow more efficiently.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has more than 200 customers, including Partake Foods, Bev, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good Planet Foods and Serenity Kids. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 30% of Ampla’s customer base so far is made up of businesses founded by people of color and over 40% by females, its execs claim.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the company declined to reveal hard revenue figures, it did say that its monthly transaction volume has grown over 300% in the last 12 months. Its headcount has quadrupled to 40 during that same time frame</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ampla plans to use its new capital to, naturally, do more hiring </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">across product, technology, sales and operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Growing our team will allow us to launch new products and iterate on existing products faster,” Santomo told TechCrunch. “All products are driven by customer feedback and demand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic created a shift in e-commerce adoption. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the pandemic hit, “Ampla quickly realized that large increases in e-commerce sales were coming across the majority of its customer base,” Santomo said. “These large increases in e-commerce sales created a universal demand for a commercial-grade working capital solution.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jason Bornstein, principal at Forerunner Ventures, led acquisition and demand planning at Bonobos (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an e-commerce-driven apparel subsidiary of Walmart) in its early days that ended up raising over $100 million in funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, he recalls, “it was never easier to build a brand online, but it was challenging to build a business online.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But over the last decade, a playbook for how to launch a digital brand has developed. The enablement layer of products and services has matured, and there’s now a vibrant ecosystem of digital brands,” he wrote via email. “When it comes to financing, however, the choices aren’t at all clear-cut. While select brands may continue to take equity and venture debt through the VC ecosystem, most brands do not have access to appropriate capital to scale. Brands deserve a financial platform that appreciates and understands their business model, capital needs, and ambitions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Forerunner became known in the market as an early supporter of digital brands, Bornstein points out that the firm has “always” believed that stores and wholesale will continue to play a meaningful role in a brand’s sales strategy and presence in the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ampla shares this belief and uniquely considers omnichannel revenue when underwriting a business,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooke Kiley, partner at VMG Catalyst, noted that VMG has a long history of investing in consumer products and has seen firsthand that there’s a lack of viable working capital options for emerging brands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The existing alternatives leave entrepreneurs confused and frustrated. With Ampla, what you see is what you get,” she wrote via email. “There are no hidden fees or intentionally confusing structure. Your business is evaluated as a whole – not just one individual revenue channel – and provided with flexible terms that are designed with the customer in mind.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.airtable.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airtable</a> today announced that it quietly acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/4-million-richer-walrus-ai-has-a-pitch-for-companies-looking-for-qa-testing-tools/">Walrus.ai</a>, a no-code software testing platform, earlier this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Acquired&#8221; may be overstating things a bit, though. Best I can tell, Walrus.ai&#8217;s homepage became unavailable a few months ago and Airtable tells me it has no plans to use any of the service&#8217;s technology. &#8220;Acqui-hire&#8221; may be a better description, but neither Airtable&#8217;s Chief Product Officer Peter Deng nor Walrus co-founder Scott White was quite ready to use this term.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, at the end of the day, you want to work on things that align with the vision and the arc of what you&#8217;re trying to accomplish,&#8221; White told me.&#8221; Airtable is the natural evolution or the opportunity to fulfill the vision of what you set out to accomplish on a grander scale. And so I think of it as an evolution of what we&#8217;re working on, to be able to take that to the next level. I think it was an awesome opportunity.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249697" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>White and his co-founders Jake Marsh and Akshay Nathan will join the company, with White becoming the product lead for solutions at Airtable, Nathan an engineering manager in the company&#8217;s enterprise organization and Marsh joining as a software engineer. Only the co-founders are joining the company. Walrus.ai had previously raised $4 million is seed funding from investors like Homebrew, Felicis Ventures and Leadout Capital.</p>
<p>The two companies argue that their overall vision was very much aligned. While the Walrus team aimed to make building end-to-end software tests easier by helping users write their tests in plain English, Airtable wants to turn all of its users into app developers.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;$4 million richer, Walrus.ai has a pitch for companies looking for QA-testing tools&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/4-million-richer-walrus-ai-has-a-pitch-for-companies-looking-for-qa-testing-tools/embed/#?secret=qHPebLCk3n" data-secret="qHPebLCk3n" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Democratizing software creation &#8212; really kind of making it easy to build software, it all started there,&#8221; said Deng when I asked him how this deal came about. &#8220;I got introduced to Scott and the Walrus team and it was very immediately apparent that we share the same vision. The vision of Walrus was to make building high-quality software easy for developers. But, you know, when we started talking, I was like: &#8216;well, let&#8217;s just make building software easier for everyone. Right? And how about that?&#8217; I think there was just immediate click on the DNA of the co-founders and things that they were doing and things that we were doing, and we just started talking and it just felt more and more natural to just work together.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At Airtable, Deng and White argued, the Walrus team would be able to expand on its original vision and that their skills would transfer to building a different kind of product. As White noted, Airtable aims to make it easy for its users to do very complex things and make that process easy and seamless. And at the same time, with enterprise being Airtable&#8217;s fastest-growing segment, its service is also now being used to manage very complex workflows.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think about our work on those two dimensions: About how to make the floor very low for a net new creator to come onto the platform and start building &#8212; and then making sure that our core capabilities and infrastructure will allow us to scale to these massive enterprise engagements,&#8221; White said about the work he is doing at Airtable now. Neither White nor Deng would say what exactly the Walrus team is working on now, beyond Deng saying that they are &#8220;working on big things together&#8221; that involves a number of initiatives to solve &#8220;end-user problems in a very elegant way.&#8221;</p>
