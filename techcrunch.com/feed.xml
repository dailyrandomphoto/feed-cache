					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 19, 2021. Today is a good day, with lots of interesting news, and even a hot, fresh newsletter from the TechCrunch team. More on that in a moment. Before we start, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/uipath-ceo-daniel-dines-is-coming-to-tc-sessions-saas-to-talk-rpa-and-automation/">UiPath CEO Daniel Dines is coming to our October SaaS event</a>. It’s going to be, as the kids say, lit. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-bans-explicit-content/">OnlyFans to kick some adult content off its service:</a></strong> In a move that temporarily broke Twitter and melted TechCrunch servers, well-known subscription content service OnlyFans is moving away from its traditional content varietal. “OnlyFans did not respond to TechCrunch’s inquiries as to its definition of sexually explicit content or how it expected this would impact the company’s bottom line,” is a good summary of where this story is. Expect more as it evolves.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/when-vcs-turned-to-zoom-chicago-startups-were-ready-for-their-close-up/">Chicago puts points on the board for the Midwest:</a></strong> When COVID shook up the venture capital market last year, one city in particular saw its fortunes change &#8212; for the better. Since the second half of 2020, Chicago has seen huge sums of money pour into its local startups. We wanted to better understand what happened, and why.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/facebook-finally-made-a-good-virtual-reality-app/">Feedback divided on Facebook’s meeting VR app:</a></strong> Our own Lucas Matney was modestly positive about Facebook&#8217;s new VR service that mimics a conference room. So that we can all enjoy that office vibe from home. Some folks noted that the tech could be great for folks who might have a harder time physically commuting. And lots of people thought it looked like a hot mess on stilts and more of a method for Facebook to change the narrative about its various regulatory issues than really move the VR ball forward.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Do you love robots and want more robotics in your life? Good news! We’ve shared Brian Heater’s robot roundups here on Daily Crunch for months now. But we won’t have to in the future, because he’s rolling out a newsletter just for the subject. Friends, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/actuator/">meet Actuator</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/eaze-to-become-americas-largest-cannabis-delivery-service-after-buying-green-dragon/">The Standard Oil of cannabis delivery:</a> </strong>Eaze is buying Green Dragon, which is actually pretty big news in the cannabis delivery market. If you live in a part of the U.S., or the world, where you cannot get weed delivered to your house, weep. Civilization will reach you soon enough. Perhaps via an Eaze courier.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/shared-micromobility-company-bird-launches-a-consumer-electric-bike-for-2299/">Bird launches electric bike:</a> </strong>Bird is busy going public via a SPAC &#8212; and it recently dropped its Q2 numbers, mind &#8212; but that’s not all the scooter company is up to. It also built an electric bike. Which is frankly cool, as we should rip out a bunch of streets in global cities and replace them with bike paths and green spaces.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/regology-snares-8m-series-a-to-help-navigate-maze-of-global-regulations/"><strong>Global regulations as a service:</strong></a> That’s the gambit behind Regology, a startup that automates the process of understanding local laws the world ‘round. As companies increasingly go remote, and the internet has made global commerce the norm, Regology could be onto something. Also from this story, there actually <em>is</em> a venture capital firm called “Acme Capital.” Perhaps they invest in anvils, dynamite and other <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ABEsgRHEY">contra-Road-Runner products</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/launch-house-raises-millions-to-launch-houses-and-the-next-big-startups/">Launch House raises $3M to scale venture community:</a></strong> This one is a little bit complicated, so read the story. But in essence: Launch House is building a class-based startup community in physical and digital spaces. And it just put together seven figures of capital to pursue its vision.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/tiger-global-backs-nacelle-with-50m-for-its-e-commerce-infrastructure/">Today’s Tiger Global round is Nacelle:</a> </strong>What is Nacelle, and why did Tiger just lead a $50 million Series B into the company? Nacelle is a headless commerce solution. And Tiger just backed it because it’s a headless commerce solution. If that makes sense.</li>
<li>Hitting the TechCrunch website just after we capped off the Daily Crunch draft yesterday, Ron Miller and I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/would-the-math-work-if-databricks-were-valued-at-38b/">put together some notes</a> on what Databricks might look like at a $38 billion valuation. Enjoy!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Let’s make a deal: A crash course on corporate development</h2>
<p>Venrock Vice President Todd Graham has some frank advice for founders at venture-backed startups: &#8220;It would be wise to generate a return at some point.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that in mind, he authored a primer on corporate development that lays out the three most common categories of acquisitions, tips for dealing with bankers and explains why striking a partnership with a big company isn&#8217;t always the best way forward.</p>
<p>Regardless of the path you choose, &#8220;you need to take the meeting,&#8221; advises Graham.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the worst-case scenario, you’ll get a few new LinkedIn connections and you’re now a known quantity. The best-case scenario will be a second meeting.&#8221;</p>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bytedance-says-china-unit-holds-local-licences-response-media-report-2021-08-16/">Congress wants to eat TikTok’s lunch:</a></strong> Speaking of ByteDance, TikTok’s plans to collect biometric data of its user base is not popular in the U.S. Congress. This is not a surprise. Especially because the Chinese Communist Party takes a board seat in ByteDance’s key China-based company.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/general-motors-and-att-will-offer-5g-connectivity-in-certain-vehicles-from-model-year-2024/">GM wants to put 5G in your ride:</a></strong> From an entirely orthogonal corner of the technology universe, GM is working with U.S. telco AT&amp;T to put 5G into cars. I don’t know precisely why we need this, or if there is enough 5G juice really out there to even squeeze out a single glass of lemonade, but here it is all the same.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the first time, Google has published the number of geofence warrants it&#8217;s historically received from U.S. authorities, providing a rare glimpse into how frequently these controversial warrants are issued.</p>
<p>The figures, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21046081-google-geofence-warrants">published Thursday</a>, reveal that Google has received thousands of geofence warrants each quarter since 2018, and at times accounted for about one-quarter of all U.S. warrants that Google receives. The data shows that the vast majority of geofence warrants are obtained by local and state authorities, with federal law enforcement accounting for just 4% of all geofence warrants served on the technology giant.</p>
<p>According to the data, Google received 982 geofence warrants in 2018, 8,396 in 2019, and 11,554 in 2020. But the figures only provide a small glimpse into the volume of warrants received, and did not break down how often it pushes back on overly broad requests. A spokesperson for Google would not comment on the record.</p>
<p>Albert Fox Cahn, executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP), which led efforts by dozens of civil rights groups to lobby for the release of these numbers, commended Google for releasing the numbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Geofence warrants are unconstitutionally broad and invasive, and we look forward to the day they are outlawed completely.&#8221; said Cahn.</p>
<p>Geofence warrants are also known as &#8220;reverse-location&#8221; warrants, since they seek to identify people of interest who were in the near-vicinity at the time a crime was committed. Police do this by asking a court to order Google, which stores vast amounts of location data to drive its advertising business, to turn over details of who was in a geographic area, such as a radius of a few hundred feet at a certain point in time, to help identify potential suspects.</p>
<p>Google has long shied away from providing these figures, in part because geofence warrants are largely thought to be unique to Google. Law enforcement has long known that Google stores vast troves of location data on its users in a database called Sensorvault, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/13/technology/google-sensorvault-location-tracking.html">first revealed</a> by The New York Times in 2019.</p>
<p>Sensorvault is said to have the detailed location data on &#8220;at least hundreds of millions of devices worldwide,&#8221; collected from users&#8217; phones when they use an Android device with location data switched on, or Google services like Google Maps and Google Photo, and even Google search results. In 2018, the Associated Press <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-america-science-technology-business-ap-top-news-828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb">reported</a> that Google could still collect users&#8217; locations even when their <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3118687?hl=en">location history</a> is &#8220;paused.&#8221;</p>
<p>But critics have argued that <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/its-time-google-resist-geofence-warrants-and-stand-its-affected-users">geofence warrants are unconstitutional</a> because the authorities compel Google to turn over data on everyone else who was in the same geographic area.</p>
<p>Worse, these warrants have been known to ensnare entirely innocent people.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reported earlier this year that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/minneapolis-protests-geofence-warrant/">Minneapolis police used a geofence warrant</a> to identify individuals accused of sparking violence in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd last year. One person on the ground who was filming and documenting the protests had his location data requested by police for being close to the violence. NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/google-tracked-his-bike-ride-past-burglarized-home-made-him-n1151761">reported</a> last year how one Gainesville, Fla. resident whose information was given by Google to police investigating a burglary, but was able to prove his innocence thanks to an app on his phone that tracked his fitness activity.</p>
<p>Although the courts have yet to deliberate widely on the legality of geofence warrants, some states are drafting laws to push back against geofence warrants. New York lawmakers <a href="https://www.protocol.com/new-york-lawmakers-want-to-outlaw-geofence-warrants">proposed a bill last year</a> that would ban geofence warrants in the state, amid fears that police could use these warrants to target protesters — as what happened in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Cahn, who helped introduce the New York bill last year, said the newly released data will &#8220;help spur lawmakers to outlaw the technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let’s be clear, the number of geofence warrants should be zero,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As one of four general partners at Andreessen Horowitz who are now investing the venture firm&#8217;s third crypto fund, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/andreessen-horowitz-triples-down-on-blockchain-startups-with-massive-2-2-billion-crypto-fund-iii/">$2.2 billion</a> vehicle, Arianna Simpson is very focused on how to return that capital and much more to the firm&#8217;s limited partners.</p>
<p>Toward that end, she has been more focused of late on startups that combine crypto with gaming. Last month, for example, her team <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tcg-and-andreessen-horowitz-invest-in-startup-behind-virtual-horse-racing-platform-11626865200">co-led an investment</a> in <a href="https://www.vhslab.com/">Virtually Human Studio</a>, the startup behind a digital horse racing service Zed Run, wherein users buy, sell and breed virtual horses whose value rises depending on their performance against other virtual horses. (Each is essentially a non-fungible token, or NFT, meaning it is unique.)</p>
<p>Simpson is relatedly intrigued with NFT-based &#8220;play-to-earn&#8221; models, wherein gamers can earn cryptocurrency that they can then cash out for their local currency if they so choose. Indeed, a16z is announcing today that it just led a $4.6 million investment in the tokens of <a href="https://yieldguild.io/">Yield Guild Games</a> (YGG), a decentralized gaming startup based in the Philippines that invites players to share in the company&#8217;s revenue by playing games like &#8220;Axie Infinity,&#8221; a blockchain-based game where players breed, battle and trade digital creatures named Axies in order to earn tokens called &#8220;Small Love Potion&#8221; that they can eventually cash out. YGG lends players the money to buy the Axies and other digital assets to start the game, so they can start earning money. (The obvious hope is that they earn more than they have to pay YGG for the use of its assets.)</p>
<p>We talked yesterday with Simpson &#8212; who joined a16z after first backing some of the same startups, including the blockchain infrastructure company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/nba-top-shot-maker-dapper-labs-is-now-worth-2-6-billion-thanks-to-half-of-hollywood-the-nba-and-michael-jordan/">Dapper Labs</a> and the global payment platform <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/celo-a16z-ethereum-funding">Celo</a> &#8212; to learn more about what&#8217;s happening at the intersection of crypto and gaming. She also shared which platforms a16z tracks most closely to identify up-and-coming crypto startups. Our chat, edited for length, follows.</p>

<p><strong>TC: Zed Run is really interesting. How did you first come across this digital horse racing business?</strong></p>
<p>AS: I think it was crypto Twitter, which honestly is where we&#8217;re finding a lot of our gaming investments. The community on there is really incredible and often one of the first places where really exciting new projects are surfaced.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zed really marks the advent of kind of a new type of more involved gameplay in crypto. If you look at [the collectibles game] CryptoKitties, it was one of the first NFT-based games that really caught the attention of people outside of the crypto sphere. Zed is definitely a derivative extension in the sense that you have a digital animal that you&#8217;re playing with, but the gameplay is much more complex, and the thing that&#8217;s been incredible to watch is just how excited the community is. People are putting together all kinds of very sophisticated guides around how to play the game, to read [race] courses, how to do all kinds of different things in the game, and tens of thousands of people all over the world [are playing].</p>
<p><strong>TC: Maybe these already exist, but are there endless opportunities across verticals here, like, say, a digital car racing equivalent or a UFC-style equivalent, or are people buying and betting on digital fighters and hoping they&#8217;ll rise in value?</strong></p>
<p>AS: There&#8217;s an incredibly broad range of possibilities in terms of what&#8217;s happening and what will happen in the universe of crypto games. I think at the core of this movement is really the idea of giving more of the value and ownership in these game assets back to the players. That&#8217;s something that has historically been a problem. You might spend years and years building up your arsenal of skins or in-game assets, and then a game will change the rules, take [some of your winnings] away from you or do any number of things that can leave players feeling very disappointed and kind of ripped off. The idea [with blockchain-based games] is to make them more open and allow players to have actual ownership in the space themselves.</p>

<p><strong>TC: Which leads us to your newest investment, Yield Guild Games, or YGG. Why did this company capture the firm&#8217;s attention?</strong></p>
<p>AS: During the pandemic, a lot of people were put out of work and not able to provide for themselves and for their families. This time kind of coincided with the rise of a game called &#8220;Axie Infinity,&#8221; one of the first games to pioneer a play-to-earn model, which is becoming a very important theme in crypto games.</p>
<p>In order to play &#8220;Axie Infinity,&#8221; you need to have three Axies, and generally speaking, that means you need<br />
to buy them upfront. Obviously if you&#8217;re out of work, you have no money [so buying these digital pets] can become a very challenging proposition. So [YGG founder] Gabby Dizon in the Philippines, who played &#8220;Axie Infinity&#8221; started lending out his Axies so other people could play the game and earn tokens that could then be converted to local currency. And so basically YGG emerged as sort of the productization of what they were doing here, so YGG either purchases or breeds in-game assets that are yield-earning, then loans them to out &#8220;scholars,&#8221; who are the recipients of these in-game assets, and YGG then takes a small cut of the in-game revenue that the players generate over time.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Does a &#8220;scholar&#8221; have to be a sophisticated player?</strong></p>
<p>AS: There are managers who basically manage teams of scholars; they&#8217;re the ones who effectively decide who to bring into the guild.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So these Axies can be cashed out for currency, but where, and who is buying them?</strong></p>
<p>AS: They can be bought or sold on exchanges and other players are buying them if they need to breed in &#8220;Axie&#8221; and needs some [Axies]; others are buying them for investment purposes. Also, they aren&#8217;t necessarily selling the NFTs but they may be selling the tokens that they earn as part of the gameplay.</p>

<p><strong>TC: There are now 5,000 of these scholars playing the game. Are they mostly in Southeast Asia?</strong></p>
<p>AS: A majority of the players and scholars are in Southeast Asia, but we&#8217;re seeing really strong international growth as well, both for &#8220;Axie Infinity&#8221; and YGG, in particular. At this point, scaling internationally is definitely a core focus for the YGG team.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You mentioned crypto Twitter. What about Discord and Reddit? Where else are you looking around for new crypto projects that are bubbling up and capturing people&#8217;s imagination?</strong></p>
<p>AS: All of the above. Discord in particular is very actively used by the crypto community, and the thing that&#8217;s interesting there is it really allows you to get a pulse for how active a community is, how engaged people are, how frequently they&#8217;re talking, and what they&#8217;re talking about. It gives you a look into the community at large and that&#8217;s a very important thing to consider when looking to make an investment or assess the health of a project.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is a monopoly. Right?</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.cbs.com/shows/cbs_this_morning/video/3SnqwNsl9S5iqU5jQCKlqvO2A4sHTbmJ/facebook-ceo-on-misinformation-versus-vaccine-hesitancy/">appeared on national TV today</a> to make a “special announcement.” The timing could not be more curious: Today is the day Lina Khan’s FTC refiled <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/08/ftc-alleges-facebook-resorted-illegal-buy-or-bury-scheme-crush">its case to dismantle Facebook’s monopoly</a>.</p>
<p>To the average person, Facebook’s monopoly seems obvious. “After all,” as James E. Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia put it in his <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.224921/gov.uscourts.dcd.224921.73.0.pdf">recent decision</a>, “No one who hears the title of the 2010 film ‘The Social Network’ wonders which company it is about.” But obviousness is not an antitrust standard. Monopoly has a clear legal meaning, and thus far Lina Khan’s FTC has failed to meet it. <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/ecf_75-1_ftc_v_facebook_public_redacted_fac.pdf">Today’s refiling</a> is much more substantive than the FTC’s first foray. But it’s still lacking some critical arguments. Here are some ideas from the front lines.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>First, the FTC must define the market correctly: personal social networking, which includes messaging. Second, the FTC must establish that Facebook controls over 60% of the market — the correct metric to establish this is revenue.</p>
<p>Though consumer harm is a well-known test of monopoly determination, our courts do not require the FTC to prove that Facebook harms consumers to win the case. As an alternative pleading, though, the government can present a compelling case that Facebook harms consumers by suppressing wages in the creator economy. If the creator economy is real, then the value of ads on Facebook’s services is generated through the fruits of creators’ labor; no one would watch the ads before videos or in between posts if the user-generated content was not there. Facebook has harmed consumers by suppressing creator wages.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>A note: This is the first of a series on the Facebook monopoly. I am inspired by Cloudflare’s recent <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/aws-egregious-egress/">post</a> explaining the impact of Amazon’s monopoly in their industry. Perhaps it was a competitive tactic, but I genuinely believe it more a patriotic duty: guideposts for legislators and regulators on a complex issue. My generation has watched with a combination of sadness and trepidation as legislators who barely use email question the leading technologists of our time about products that have long pervaded our lives in ways we don’t yet understand. I, personally, and my company both stand to gain little from this — but as a participant in the latest generation of social media upstarts, and as an American concerned for the future of our democracy, I feel a duty to try.</em></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h2>The problem</h2>
<p><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.224921/gov.uscourts.dcd.224921.73.0.pdf">According to the court</a>, the FTC must meet a two-part test: First, the FTC must define the market in which Facebook has monopoly power, established by the D.C. Circuit in Neumann v. Reinforced Earth Co. (1986). This is the market for personal social networking services, which includes messaging.</p>
<p>Second, the FTC must establish that Facebook controls a dominant share of that market, which courts have defined as 60% or above, established by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in FTC v. AbbVie (2020). The right metric for this market share analysis is unequivocally revenue — daily active users (DAU) x average revenue per user (ARPU). And Facebook controls over 90%.</p>
<p>The answer to the FTC’s problem is hiding in plain sight: Snapchat’s investor <a href="https://investor.snap.com/events-and-presentations/presentations/default.aspx">presentations</a>:</p>

<p>This is a chart of Facebook’s monopoly — 91% of the personal social networking market. The gray blob looks awfully like a vast oil deposit, successfully drilled by Facebook’s Standard Oil operations. Snapchat and Twitter are the small wildcatters, nearly irrelevant compared to Facebook’s scale. It should not be lost on any market observers that Facebook once tried to acquire both companies.</p>
<h2>The market Includes messaging</h2>
<p>The FTC initially claimed that Facebook has a monopoly of the “personal social networking services” market. The complaint excluded “mobile messaging” from Facebook’s market “because [messaging apps] (i) lack a ‘shared social space’ for interaction and (ii) do not employ a social graph to facilitate users’ finding and ‘friending’ other users they may know.”</p>
<p>This is incorrect because messaging is inextricable from Facebook’s power. Facebook demonstrated this with its WhatsApp acquisition, promotion of Messenger and prior attempts to buy Snapchat and Twitter. Any personal social networking service can expand its features — and Facebook’s moat is contingent on its control of messaging.</p>
<p>The more time in an ecosystem the more valuable it becomes. Value in social networks is calculated, depending on whom you ask, algorithmically (Metcalfe’s law) or logarithmically (Zipf’s law). Either way, in social networks, 1+1 is much more than 2.</p>
<p>Social networks become valuable based on the ever-increasing number of nodes, upon which companies can build more features. Zuckerberg coined the “social graph” to describe this relationship. The monopolies of Line, Kakao and WeChat in Japan, Korea and China prove this clearly. They began with messaging and expanded outward to become dominant personal social networking behemoths.</p>
<p>In today’s refiling, the FTC explains that Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat are all personal social networking services built on three key features:</p>
<ol>
<li>“First, personal social networking services are built on a social graph that maps the connections between users and their friends, family, and other personal connections.”</li>
<li>“Second, personal social networking services include features that many users regularly employ to interact with personal connections and share their personal experiences in a shared social space, including in a one-to-many &#8216;broadcast&#8217; format.”</li>
<li>“Third, personal social networking services include features that allow users to find and connect with other users, to make it easier for each user to build and expand their set of personal connections.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, this is only partially right. In social media’s treacherous waters, as the FTC has struggled to articulate, feature sets are routinely copied and cross-promoted. How can we forget Instagram’s copying of Snapchat’s stories? Facebook has ruthlessly copied features from the most successful apps on the market from inception. Its launch of a Clubhouse competitor called Live Audio Rooms is only the most recent example. Twitter and Snapchat are absolutely competitors to Facebook.</p>
<p>Messaging must be included to demonstrate Facebook’s breadth and voracious appetite to copy and destroy. WhatsApp and Messenger have over 2 billion and 1.3 billion users respectively. Given the ease of feature copying, a messaging service of WhatsApp’s scale could become a full-scale social network in a matter of months. This is precisely why Facebook acquired the company. Facebook’s breadth in social media services is remarkable. But the FTC needs to understand that messaging is a part of the market. And this acknowledgement would not hurt their case.</p>
<h2>The metric: Revenue shows Facebook’s monopoly</h2>
<p>Boasberg believes revenue is not an apt metric to calculate personal networking: “The overall revenues earned by PSN services cannot be the right metric for measuring market share here, as those revenues are all earned in a separate market — viz., the market for advertising.” He is confusing business model with market. Not all advertising is cut from the same cloth. In today’s refiling, the FTC correctly identifies “social advertising” as distinct from the “display advertising.”</p>
<p>But it goes off the deep end trying to avoid naming revenue as the distinguishing market share metric. Instead the FTC cites “time spent, daily active users (DAU), and monthly active users (MAU).” In a world where Facebook Blue and Instagram compete only with Snapchat, these metrics might bring Facebook Blue and Instagram combined over the 60% monopoly hurdle. But the FTC does not make a sufficiently convincing market definition argument to justify the choice of these metrics. Facebook <em>should </em>be compared to other personal social networking services such as Discord and Twitter — and their correct inclusion in the market would undermine the FTC’s choice of time spent or DAU/MAU.</p>
<p>Ultimately, cash is king. Revenue is what counts and what the FTC should emphasize. As Snapchat shows above, revenue in the personal social media industry is calculated by ARPU x DAU. The personal social media market is a different market from the entertainment social media market (where Facebook competes with YouTube, TikTok and Pinterest, among others). And this too is a separate market from the display search advertising market (Google). Not all advertising-based consumer technology is built the same. Again, advertising is a business model, not a market.</p>
<p>In the media world, for example, Netflix’s subscription revenue clearly competes in the same market as CBS’ advertising model. News Corp.’s acquisition of Facebook’s early competitor MySpace spoke volumes on the internet’s potential to disrupt and destroy traditional media advertising markets. Snapchat has chosen to pursue advertising, but incipient competitors like Discord are successfully growing using subscriptions. But their market share remains a pittance compared to Facebook.</p>
<h2>An alternative pleading: Facebook’s market power suppresses wages in the creator economy</h2>
<p>The FTC has correctly argued for the smallest possible market for their monopoly definition. Personal social networking, of which Facebook controls at least 80%, should not (in their strongest argument) include entertainment. This is the narrowest argument to make with the highest chance of success.</p>
<p>But they could choose to make a broader argument in the alternative, one that takes a bigger swing. As Lina Khan <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox">famously noted</a> about Amazon in her 2017 note that began the New Brandeis movement, the traditional economic consumer harm test does not adequately address the harms posed by Big Tech. The harms are too abstract. As White House advisor Tim Wu argues in &#8220;The Curse of Bigness,&#8221; and Judge Boasberg acknowledges in his opinion, antitrust law does not hinge solely upon price effects. Facebook can be broken up without proving the negative impact of price effects.</p>
<p>However, Facebook <em>has </em>hurt consumers. Consumers are the workers whose labor constitutes Facebook’s value, and they’ve been underpaid. If you define personal networking to include entertainment, then YouTube is an instructive example. On both YouTube and Facebook properties, influencers can capture value by charging brands directly. That’s not what we’re talking about here; what matters is the percent of advertising revenue that is paid out to creators.</p>
<p>YouTube’s traditional percentage is 55%. YouTube <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/06/02/youtube-creator-economy-advertising-revenue-war-for-talent-yt-influencers/">announced</a> it has paid $30 billion to creators and rights holders over the last three years. Let&#8217;s conservatively say that half of the money goes to rights holders; that means creators on average have earned $15 billion, which would mean $5 billion annually, a meaningful slice of YouTube&#8217;s <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/">$46 billion in revenue</a> over that time. So in other words, YouTube paid creators a third of its revenue (this admittedly ignores YouTube&#8217;s non-advertising revenue).</p>
<p>Facebook, by comparison, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/technology/facebook-payments-creators.html">announced</a> just weeks ago a paltry $1 billion program over a year and change. Sure, creators may make some money from interstitial ads, but Facebook <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/helping-content-creators-diversify-revenue-on-facebook/">does not announce</a> the percentage of revenue they hand to creators because it would be insulting. Over the equivalent three-year period of YouTube’s declaration, Facebook has generated <a href="https://investor.fb.com/">$210 billion in revenue</a>. one-third of this revenue paid to creators would represent $70 billion, or $23 billion a year.</p>
<p>Why hasn’t Facebook paid creators before? Because it hasn’t needed to do so. Facebook’s social graph is so large that creators must post there anyway — the scale afforded by success on Facebook Blue and Instagram allows creators to monetize through directly selling to brands. Facebooks ads have value because of creators’ labor; if the users did not generate content, the social graph would not exist. Creators deserve more than the scraps they generate on their own. Facebook suppresses creators&#8217; wages because it can. This is what monopolies do.</p>
<h2>Facebook’s Standard Oil ethos</h2>
<p>Facebook has long been the Standard Oil of social media, using its core monopoly to begin its march upstream and down. Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview">announced</a> in July and renewed his focus today on the metaverse, a market Roblox has pioneered. After achieving a monopoly in personal social media and competing ably in entertainment social media and virtual reality, Facebook’s drilling continues. Yes, Facebook may be free, but its monopoly harms Americans by stifling creator wages. The antitrust laws dictate that consumer harm is not a necessary condition for proving a monopoly under the Sherman Act; monopolies in and of themselves are illegal. By refiling the correct market definition and marketshare, the FTC stands more than a chance. It should win.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The Pareto principle, also known as the 80-20 rule, asserts that 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes, rendering the remainder way less impactful.</p>
<p>Those working with data may have heard a different rendition of the 80-20 rule: A data scientist spends 80% of their time at work cleaning up messy data as opposed to doing actual analysis or generating insights. Imagine a 30-minute drive expanded to two-and-a-half hours by traffic jams, and you&#8217;ll get the picture.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			As tempting as it may be to think of a future where there is a machine learning model for every business process, we do not need to tread that far right now.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>While most data scientists spend more than 20% of their time at work on actual analysis, they still have to waste countless hours turning a trove of messy data into a tidy dataset ready for analysis. This process can include removing duplicate data, making sure all entries are formatted correctly and doing other preparatory work.</p>
<p>On average, this workflow stage takes up about 45% of the total time, a recent Anaconda <a href="https://www.datanami.com/2020/07/06/data-prep-still-dominates-data-scientists-time-survey-finds/">survey</a> found. An earlier <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/03/23/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says/?utm_source=thenewstack&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=platform&amp;sh=6a428b126f63">poll</a> by CrowdFlower put the estimate at 60%, and many other <a href="https://businessoverbroadway.com/2019/02/19/how-do-data-professionals-spend-their-time-on-data-science-projects/">surveys</a> cite figures in this range.</p>
<p>None of this is to say data preparation is not important. “Garbage in, garbage out” is a well-known rule in computer science circles, and it applies to data science, too. In the best-case scenario, the script will just return an error, warning that it cannot calculate the average spending per client, because the entry for customer #1527 is formatted as text, not as a numeral. In the worst case, the company will act on insights that have little to do with reality.</p>
<p>The real question to ask here is whether re-formatting the data for customer #1527 is really the best way to use the time of a well-paid expert. The average data scientist is paid between $95,000 and $120,000 per year, according to various estimates. Having the employee on such pay focus on mind-numbing, non-expert tasks is a waste both of their time and the company’s money. Besides, real-world data has a lifespan, and if a dataset for a time-sensitive project takes too long to collect and process, it can be outdated before any analysis is done.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What&#8217;s more, companies’ quests for data often include wasting the time of non-data-focused personnel, with employees asked to help fetch or produce data instead of working on their regular responsibilities. More than half of the data being collected by companies <a href="https://priceonomics.com/companies-collect-a-lot-of-data-but-how-much-do/">is often not used at all</a>, suggesting that the time of everyone involved in the collection has been wasted to produce nothing but operational delay and the associated losses.</p>
<p>The data that has been collected, on the other hand, is often only used by a designated data science team that is too overworked to go through everything that is available.</p>
<h2>All for data, and data for all</h2>
<p>The issues outlined here all play into the fact that save for the data pioneers like Google and Facebook, companies are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/randybean/2020/10/20/the-failure-of-big-data/?sh=6ec999b4a218">still wrapping their heads</a> around how to re-imagine themselves for the data-driven era. Data is pulled into huge databases and data scientists are left with a lot of cleaning to do, while others, whose time was wasted on helping fetch the data, do not benefit from it too often.</p>
<p>The truth is, we are still early when it comes to data transformation. The success of tech giants that put data at the core of their business models set off a spark that is only starting to take off. And even though the results are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/randybean/2021/01/03/decade-of-investment-in-big-data-and-ai-yield-mixed-results/?sh=609070a2409e">mixed for now</a>, this is a sign that companies have yet to master thinking with data.</p>
<p>Data holds much value, and businesses are very much aware of it, as showcased by the appetite for AI experts <a href="https://qz.com/1887438/the-non-tech-companies-hiring-phds-from-elite-ai-programs/">in non-tech companies</a>. Companies just have to do it right, and one of the key tasks in this respect is to start focusing on people as much as we do on AIs.</p>
<p>Data can enhance the operations of virtually any component within the organizational structure of any business. As tempting as it may be to think of a future where there is a machine learning model for every business process, we do not need to tread that far right now. The goal for any company looking to tap data today comes down to getting it from point A to point B. Point A is the part in the workflow where data is being collected, and point B is the person who needs this data for decision-making.</p>
<p>Importantly, point B does not have to be a data scientist. It could be a manager trying to figure out the optimal workflow design, an engineer looking for flaws in a manufacturing process or a UI designer doing A/B testing on a specific feature. All of these people must have the data they need at hand all the time, ready to be processed for insights.</p>
<p>People can thrive with data just as well as models, especially if the company invests in them and makes sure to equip them with basic analysis skills. In this approach, accessibility must be the name of the game.</p>
<p>Skeptics may claim that big data is nothing but an overused corporate buzzword, but advanced analytics capacities can enhance the bottom line for any company as long as it comes with a clear plan and appropriate expectations. The first step is to focus on making data accessible and easy to use and not on hauling in as much data as possible.</p>
<p>In other words, an all-around data culture is just as important for an enterprise as the data infrastructure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For smartwatches, it’s Apple against the world. Per recent numbers from <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-smartwatch-shipments-q1-2021/">CounterPoint</a>, the Apple Watch commanded more than one-third of global shipments in Q1. Samsung/Tizen’s own market share is a distant &#8212; but respectable &#8212; second place, with 8%. With Google’s Wear OS at fifth place at just under 4%, it’s easy to see both companies &#8212; utterly dominant in other categories &#8212; are itching for competitive advantages.</p>
<p>For Google, the answer is two-fold. First, the Fitbit acquisition effectively doubles its existing market. Convincing Samsung to return to Wear OS after a long time in the Tizen woods. For Samsung, a return to the Google operating system made sense from the standpoint of developer access &#8212; and the resulting apps. And hey, if it means Google gets to deal with the underlying support issues, that’s all the better.</p>

<p>From a pure market share standpoint, Samsung has the clear upper hand here. And while building out its own version of Tizen hasn’t necessarily caught the world on fire, it has helped the electronic giant secure a solid second place. Clearly if the company was going to return to Google, it would need to do so on its own terms.</p>

<p>Following an announcement at Google I/O that the two companies were once again working together in the smartwatch category, Samsung finally unveiled the first fruit of that labor last week, in the form of the Galaxy Watch 4. The new wearable, available in both the standard and Classic form, runs “Wear OS Powered by Samsung.” What that means in practical terms is that Samsung worked closely with Google to build out a customized version of Wear OS &#8212; one that, effectively, looks, swims and quacks like Tizen.</p>
<p>It’s an effort to make a leap to a robust &#8212; if struggling &#8212; wearable OS ecosystem, without losing the familiarity of the experience Samsung spent years building out. And honestly, I’m here for it. The Samsung/Google team-up has done a fine job determining what works about their respective ecosystems and building out an experience that pulls from the best of both. It’s an ideal situation for Google, certainly, and one the company would no doubt benefit from by recruiting other big hardware makers &#8212; though none has anywhere near Samsung’s momentum in the category.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>That’s coupled with several generations of hardware iteration and health improvements that go a long way toward making the Galaxy Watch 4 one of the few smartwatches that can truly go head to head with Apple. And like Apple, the new wearable is explicitly tied to the Samsung ecosystem &#8212; after all, even the other week was nothing if not an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/heres-everything-samsung-announced-this-morning/">ecosystem play</a>.</p>

<p>The new Galaxy Buds are arguably the best earbuds for a Samsung user, and the same can be said for the company’s solid new smartwatch. As much as the company is opening things up to third parties by way of Wear OS (fewer than Apple, but a step in the right direction), this is still decidedly a Samsung smartwatch that works best with first-party Samsung apps on Samsung’s mobile hardware. It’s the sort of gamble you can take when you’re the No. 1 smartphone maker in the world. Let the Huaweis, Garmins and Fitbits fight for the rest of the non-iOS market.</p>
<p>As with its smartphones and earbuds, the Galaxy Watch line hasn’t always been the most straightforward, in terms of how things break down. The company has flirted with different models and SKUs over the years, but I think it’s finally hit on a setup that makes sense. Effectively, the lower-end, haptic bezeled Galaxy Watch Active is now the standard Galaxy Watch, and the standard Galaxy Watch is now the Galaxy Watch Classic.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve typed that, I recognize that it’s not as straightforward as it sounded in my head. Basically it breaks down thusly: Galaxy Watch 4 = thinner, lighter, sportier. Galaxy Watch 4 Classic is a bit classier looking, trading the digital bezel for Samsung’s trademark rotating hardware bezel.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188129" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188129" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2188129" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9841.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9841.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9841.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9841.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9841.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9841.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9841.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9841.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9841.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188129" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>I’ve said it before and I’ll say again: The spinning bezel is Samsung’s ace in the hole. It’s the place where the company unequivocally has Apple beat in the smartwatch category. Apple’s crown is fine, but the bezel is currently the best way to navigate a smartwatch interface. I was, frankly, baffled when the company ditched it for the Galaxy Watch 2 in favor of a digital version. The company clearly thought better of it, bringing it back for the 3.</p>
<p>If you read my earlier review, you know my biggest sticking point with earlier Samsung watches was size. The things were giant. I’m not a small man, nor do I possess an abnormally small wrist, but even I had issues walking around with them on. Some people like big, clunky watches, but only making these devices available in the one size is severely limiting your potential audience right out of the gate.</p>

<p>Thankfully, you’ve got a number of choices here. The Galaxy Watch is available in 40mm and 44mm versions ($250 and $300, respectively), while the Classic comes in 42mm and 46mm ($350 and $380, respectively). You’re already talking about a pretty sizable premium for what mostly amounts to design differences. Add LTE onto the classic and you’re talking $379 and $429. Of course, that still compares favorably to the Apple Watch Series 6’s $399 starting price.</p>
<p>I opted to go somewhere in the middle, with the 42mm Galaxy Watch Classic. Having worn the device for several days now, I’m feeling pretty good about the choice. Given the design, I’m fairly certain the 46mm would have been too much watch for my day to day use. And certainly it would have been too large to attempt to sleep in.</p>
<p>I’m still curious how the 44mm version of the standard Watch would have fit, but if you’ve got the choice of rotating bezel, go for rotating bezel. A 40mm version of the Classic would be a nice option for users with smaller wrists looking for that functionality, but Samsung’s heading in the right direction here, with four distinct sizes.</p>

<p>Like much of the competition, Samsung is leading with health offerings here. I’ve been trying to up my exercise game, a year and half into the pandemic, and the watch does a solid job with workout detection. It’s about on par with the Apple Watch, in terms of auto detecting walks and runs. I’ve gotten into the rowing machine at the gym of late, and it does a solid job there, as well. It understandably is considerably more difficult with my morning HIIT routines, and yoga was a wash, so you’re best starting those manually, unless you’re using one of the company’s connected routines.</p>
<p>There’s an ECG on-board to detect heart irregularities. It’s a quickly standardizing tool that many medical professionals have begun to recommend for detecting early heart issues. Body Composition is a standout new feature here that offers key health metrics like skeletal muscle, body water, metabolic rate and body fat percentage by placing two fingers on the device.</p>
<p>Sleep tracking offers solid insight, including blood oxygen, light/deep/rem and total sleep score (hint, mine is low). If you’re able/willing to sleep with your phone near you, the app will also let you know how much time you’ve been snoring during the night. Taken together, the numbers can offer some good, actionable insight into your sleeping patterns.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189172" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189172" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2189172" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0039.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0039.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0039.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0039.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0039.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0039.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0039.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0039.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0039.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189172" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Of course, wearing a watch to sleep is not only a matter of comfort &#8212; it’s also a matter of battery life. The life on the Watch Classic is okay &#8212; I was able to go a day and a half of standard to light usage. That’s enough to do fitness and sleep tracking, assuming you can find some time in the morning or around lunch to charge it up again. Perfectly acceptable for most usage, but not really anything to write home about.</p>
<p>All of these elements add up to a solid smartwatch experience. The Galaxy Watch 4 is the best smartwatch for Samsung users, and there’s a strong case to be made for it being the best Android-compatible smartwatch, period.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adobe announced today it is acquiring </span><a href="https://frame.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frame.io</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a video review and collaboration platform used by over a million customers, for $1.275 billion in cash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2014 by post-production company owner Emery Wells and technologist John Traver, New York-based Frame.io was created to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/31/frame-io-is-cloud-based-collaboration-for-everything/">solve the workflows</a> challenges filmmakers faced in their daily lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the Frame.io platform helps creative professionals streamline the video creation process by centralizing media assets, including dailies, scripts, storyboards, work-in-progress and more, while also allowing for frame-accurate feedback and comments, annotations and real-time approvals. The company additionally touts faster upload speeds than other cloud hosting services, like Vimeo, Box, Dropbox and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frame.io has raised $90 million in venture funding over its lifetime, and in November 2019, announced a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/cloud-video-collaboration-platform-frame-io-raises-50-million-heads-to-hollywood/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$50 million Series C</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Insight Partners that included participation from Accel, FirstMark, SignalFire and Shasta Ventures. Accel led the company’s seed and Series A rounds in 2015.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adobe said the combination of its creative software, including Premiere Pro and After Effects video editing products, and Frame.io’s review and approval functionality would “deliver a collaboration platform that powers the video editing process.” The Frame.io web platform was designed to be a part of its customer’s existing processes, by integrating with non-linear editing systems (NLEs) such as Adobe Premiere Pro. Such integrations allow editors to upload directly to Frame.io, then organize and share their products both internally and with external clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether it&#8217;s the latest binge-worthy streaming series, a social media video that sparks a movement, or a corporate video that connects thousands of remote workers, video creation and consumption is experiencing tremendous growth,” Adobe said in a statement. “&#8230;Today’s video workflows are disjointed with multiple tools and communication channels being used to solicit stakeholder feedback. Frame.io eliminates the inefficiencies of video workflows by enabling real-time footage upload, access, and in-line stakeholder collaboration in a secure and elegant experience across surfaces.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal is expected to close during the fourth quarter of Adobe’s 2021 fiscal year, and is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. Once the deal closes, Wells and Traver will join Adobe. Wells will continue to lead the Frame.io team, reporting to Scott Belsky, Adobe’s chief product officer and EVP of Creative Cloud.</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bringing Frame.io under the Adobe roof means video editing with colleagues will be more like collaboratively working on a Google Doc,&#8221; Barber said. &#8220;The acquisition also means that Adobe will move higher up into the creative process. One of the biggest challenges for Adobe with this acquisition will be driving adoption for the hesitant or budget-strapped brands that aren’t big production houses.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Today, OnlyFans dropped the massive bombshell that it will be banning “sexually explicit content” from the app later this year. This is obviously a wildly seismic shift for OnlyFans, which completely disrupted the adult content industry and gave performers a path toward greater independence by allowing them to connect directly with their fans via subscriptions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This shutdown is also the opportunity of a lifetime for the crypto industry which could capitalize on the shutdown and a recent wave of increasingly consumer-friendly crypto payments infrastructure products to create a platform that won’t crumble under the influence of payment providers.</p>
<p class="p1">OnlyFans, which has been trying to raise at a unicorn valuation and running into plenty of trouble doing so despite huge revenues, didn’t mince words on the reasoning for today’s fundamental change. “These changes are to comply with the requests of our banking partners and payout providers,” a <a href="https://twitter.com/danprimack/status/1428420774449266691">statement on the news from OnlyFans</a> partially read.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="oukvwoyCeD"><p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-bans-explicit-content/">OnlyFans bans explicit content</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;OnlyFans bans explicit content&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-bans-explicit-content/embed/#?secret=oukvwoyCeD" data-secret="oukvwoyCeD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p class="p1">Despite popular culture’s ongoing destigmatization of sex work and adult content, banking institutions are still fundamentally conservative and wary to handle money flowing through these platforms. Most of the operators of these platforms are forced to deal with constant uneasiness of knowing their platforms might one day lose favor among these providers and instantly lose everything. All the while, “vice clauses” present in plenty of venture capital firms’ underpinnings keep them from operating in these spaces as well, and prevent these platforms from accessing growth capital. It&#8217;s clear that adult content platforms are probably never going to have a friendly relationship with these financial institutions and it&#8217;s likely time for the platforms &#8212; and the creators using them &#8212; to move on.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways, OnlyFans dumping porn seems like an outright betrayal of their creator network, and is something those creators will be sure to remember when embracing whatever copycats spring up in their wake. They are likely going to look at new platforms with renewed skepticism in how they&#8217;ll handle payment provider standoffs, but there likely isn&#8217;t going to be a different outcome for ambitious platforms looking to grow. That would likely be a different situation for crypto-native platforms, but given the tiny adoption, it&#8217;s still a substantial risk for creators to embrace a platform on which their fans might not know how to pay for content.</p>
<p>The porn industry has been embracing crypto payments, albeit slowly. In 2018, Pornhub first announced that they would begin accepting cryptocurrency payments. Fast-forward to 2020, when Visa and Mastercard dumped the platform; now crypto payments and ACH bank transfers are the only ways to pay for its premium subscription service. There are already a few crypto platform players in this space, like CumRocket and SpankChain, catering to niche audiences (and probably in need of rebranding), but with the OnlyFans juggernaut out of the way, there might actually be a space for an existing or upstart player to innovate and capture this market.</p>
<p>The real challenge is in making it simple to onboard new users to both a new platform and potentially their first crypto wallet &#8212; while staying compliant with regulatory guidelines &#8212; at a time when more conventional web payment structures have gotten so streamlined and free adult content is just as prolific as ever. Know your customer (KYC) guidelines that push users to upload their passport or driver&#8217;s license to verify crypto purchases probably aren&#8217;t the easiest onboarding ask for a new crypto porn site, but as the market matures a bit and the challenges of a user setting up their first wallet are decoupled from the onboarding process for the platform, there are plenty of benefits to be realized.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">Porn has always been a launchpad of sorts for new technologies. While the popularity of crypto has surged in recent months and nearly eclipsed $2 trillion in total assets, crypto penetration among the apps that people are actually using remains extremely low. As new solutions and startups pop up aiming to demystify buying and sending crypto, it feels like there’s a chance the industry could be in the perfect place to fill the void left by OnlyFans’ exit and build a more innovative platform in its image that goes all-in on crypto.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Have you ever tried to share a funny tweet with a few friends via Twitter DM, only to accidentally start a group chat? You&#8217;re not alone. Today, Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1428408769835421701">announced</a> that it will roll out a few quality of life improvements to its direct messaging system over the next few weeks, including the ability to DM a tweet to multiple people at once in individual conversations. Researcher Jane Manchun Wong noticed that Twitter was working on this functionality <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1413468258888417291">last month</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">No more (awkward) accidental group chats when you DM a Tweet to multiple people. Now you can share the same Tweet in up to 20 different DM convos, separately.</p>
<p>Rolling out on iOS and web, and soon on Android. (2/5) <a href="https://t.co/oHYseF3EJE">pic.twitter.com/oHYseF3EJE</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1428408781239504898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>A potential downside of this update is that it might invite more spam &#8212; you can&#8217;t send a message to more than 20 people at once, but that&#8217;s still a lot of people. And users receiving these messages now may not realize they were a part of group spam, as the individual DMs will seem like private 1:1 messages.</p>
<p>Twitter says Android users will have to wait a bit longer than iOS and web tweeters to gain access to this feature &#8212; and it&#8217;s unclear how long that will take, because in the past, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434936/twitter-dm-search-android-expanding">it&#8217;s taken years</a> for iOS DM updates to reach Android. But as a consolation prize, on both Android and iOS, if you scroll up in a DM conversation, you&#8217;ll be able to return to the latest message by pressing a down arrow button to quick-scroll.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s other two DM improvements are only rolling out so far on iOS &#8212; instead of timestamping individual messages with the date and time, messages will be grouped by day. Individual DMs will still have a timestamp, but Twitter says that this change will yield &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1428408787245928453">less timestamp clutter.</a>&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Finally, in DMs, iOS users will be able to access the &#8220;add reaction&#8221; menu from both double-tapping and long-pressing on a message. Long-pressing a friend&#8217;s message also gives you the option to delete the message on your account only, report the message or copy the text.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">OnlyFans has announced that it will ban sexually explicit content starting in October. The platform was not built specifically for porn but that has grown to be its most popular and visible use case, but pressure from &#8220;banking partners and payout providers&#8221; means the company will have to leave the adult content world behind and focus solely on SFW material going forward.</p>
<p>The news, first reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-19/onlyfans-to-block-sexually-explicit-videos-starting-in-october?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg</a>, was confirmed by the company in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Effective 1 October, 2021, OnlyFans will prohibit the posting of any content containing sexually-explicit conduct. In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the platform, and to continue to host an inclusive community of creators and fans, we must evolve our content guidelines. Creators will continue to be allowed to post content containing nudity as long as it is consistent with our Acceptable Use Policy.</p>
<p>These changes are to comply with the requests of our banking partners and payout providers.</p>
<p>We will be sharing more details in the coming days and we will actively support and guide our creators through this change in content guidelines.</p></blockquote>
<p>OnlyFans did not respond to TechCrunch&#8217;s inquiries as to its definition of sexually explicit content or how it expected this would impact the company&#8217;s bottom line.</p>
<p>The OnlyFans platform has become the de facto standard for independent creators doing adult content. Over the pandemic it grew increasingly popular as the adult industry, like others, had its normal operations interrupted. It has proved an invaluable asset for many creators, professional and aspiring, who used the platform to directly monetize fans without interacting with notoriously predatory established adult industry companies.</p>
<p>But sex work has always been risky in online operations. The practical risk of hosting illegal content means platforms must exert constant vigilance for things like child sex abuse material, malicious content like revenge porn and unwanted leaks, and everyday internet threats like piracy.</p>
<p>At the organizational level, however, the companies may find it difficult to scale due to the trepidation of investors and banks, both of which tend to avoid the industry in general as a &#8220;vice,&#8221; much the way cannabis and sex toy startups have faced challenges. Pushback from financial backers and payment processors can effectively sink an entire business model.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Vn9uoDEkUw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/onlyfans-promotes-its-sfw-app-as-it-seeks-funding-at-a-1b-valuation/">OnlyFans promotes its SFW app as it seeks funding at a $1B+ valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;OnlyFans promotes its SFW app as it seeks funding at a $1B+ valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/onlyfans-promotes-its-sfw-app-as-it-seeks-funding-at-a-1b-valuation/embed/#?secret=Vn9uoDEkUw" data-secret="Vn9uoDEkUw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>OnlyFans in this case says openly that it is abandoning adult content due to exactly this type of pressure. While the company has recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/onlyfans-promotes-its-sfw-app-as-it-seeks-funding-at-a-1b-valuation/">debuted and promoted its OFTV app</a>, a SFW alternative to the main OnlyFans site, and of course there are many creators on the platform who do not produce sexually explicit content, this will be an enormous blow to both the sex work industry and to the company itself. Affected creators were not notified ahead of time.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is going to shatter a lot of people&#8217;s main source of income, the foundation of their entire business,&#8221; said Tristan West, who as dreamboytristan is a top creator of adult content on OnlyFans. &#8220;Me and a lot of people have got to do a lot of work to secure our business, move our assets, move our content to another platform. It&#8217;s not the end of the world, but this is a huge setback.&#8221;</p>
<p>West noted that other platforms are finding ways to monetize adult content as well, such as Twitter adding its paid follows and sites like PornHub building out direct monetization opportunities as well. But OnlyFans holds all the cards and will need to make that transition possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see them do what&#8217;s needed — it&#8217;s weird that they haven&#8217;t come to us and talked to us in any way,&#8221; said West. &#8220;Offer a quick option to download all your content on OnlyFans — that&#8217;s your asset, that&#8217;s your business. That&#8217;s the bare minimum that they can do for creators.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a serious question whether OnlyFans will be able to survive this transition in any recognizable form. The choice to abandon their most lucrative and loyal segment of customers and creators may poison the well, with others declining to rely on a platform that failed to support others. Investors, once wary of the risk of putting money into a sex-adjacent product, may now be wary of paying to board a sinking ship. That $1 billion valuation may be farther away than ever.</p>
<p>The obvious and immediate answer from the tech community is to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-porn-ban-is-cryptos-opportunity-of-a-lifetime/">operate OnlyFans or something like it using cryptocurrencies</a>, which are generally speaking not subject to these limitations. This may represent a way forward for the next platform, but for OnlyFans it may be too late to adapt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thankfully, we have a couple months,&#8221; West said. &#8220;OnlyFans was the top platform in this market but they&#8217;re not the only one. It&#8217;s an opportunity for someone else to come around and do better for sex workers and online creators.&#8221;</p>
<p>This story is developing and may be updated in the near future with more information.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Wash, rinse, repeat: A startup is founded, first product ships, customers engage, and then a larger company’s corporate development team sends a blind email requesting to “connect and compare notes.”</p>
<p>If you’re a venture-backed startup, it would be wise to generate a return at some point, which means either get acquired or go public.</p>
<p>If you’re going to get acquired, chances are you’re going to spend a lot of time with corporate development teams. With a hot stock market, mountains of cash and cheap debt floating around, the environment for acquisitions is extremely rich.</p>
<p>And as I&#8217;ve been on both sides of these equations, an increasing number of my <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/friendda-nda-friends-douche">FriendDA partners</a> have been calling for advice on corporate development mating rituals.</p>
<p>Here are the highlights.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Before my first company was acquired, I believed that every acquisition I’d ever read about was strategic and well thought out. I was blindingly wrong.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>You need to take the meeting</h2>
<p>Book a 45-minute initial meeting. Give yourself an hour on the calendar, but only burn the full 60 minutes if things are going well. Don’t be overly excited, be a pleaser and or ramble on. Pontificate? Yes, but with precision.</p>
<p>You need to demonstrate a command of the domain you’ve chosen. Also, demonstrate that you’re humble and thoughtful, but never come to the first meeting with a written list of “ways we can work together.” That will smell of desperation.</p>
<p>In the worst-case scenario, you&#8217;ll get a few new LinkedIn connections and you’re now a known quantity. The best-case scenario will be a second meeting.</p>
<h2>But they’re going to steal my brilliant idea!</h2>
<p>No, they aren’t. I hear this a lot and it’s a solid tell that an entrepreneur has never operated within a large enterprise before. That’s fine, as not everyone gets to have an employee ID number with five or six digits.</p>
<p>Big companies manage operational expenses, including salaries and related expenses, pretty tightly. And there frequently aren’t enough experts to go around the moneyball startups for new domains, let alone older enterprises.</p>
<p>So there’s no secret lab with dozens of developers and subject matter experts waiting for a freshly minted MBA to return with their meeting notes and start pilfering your awesomeness. Plus, a key component to many successful startups is go-to-market (GTM), and most larger enterprises don’t have the marketing and sales domain knowledge to sell a stolen product.</p>
<p>They still need you and your team.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.revolut.com">Revolut</a> is launching a new feature called <a href="https://www.revolut.com/payday">Payday</a>. It is an alternative to credit card debt and short-term credit as it lets you unlock a portion of your wage early. If a business decides to integrate with Revolut, users can then access the feature from the financial super app directly.</p>
<p>Right now, the feature is limited to businesses based in the U.K., but the company plans to launch it in the European Economic Area and the U.S. as well. That’s the trick — Payday isn’t going to be available to everyone who receive their salary in their Revolut account through direct deposit.</p>
<p>Revolut has to plug into an employer’s payroll system first so that the company knows how much employees are earning at any point in time. The fintech startup says that employers don’t have to change their payroll system, though.</p>
<p>Once this is done, employees can unlock a portion of their earned pay whenever they want. Users can withdraw up to 50% of what they’ve earned in advance. While the feature is free for businesses, Revolut will charge a small, flat fee to users.</p>
<p>“We believe in the importance of making financial wellbeing accessible to all, and this includes focusing on the impact of financial stability on employees’ mental health,” Revolut co-founder and CEO Nik Storonsky said in a statement. “After the difficulties of the past year, the last thing employees need now is financial uncertainty and stress. It is important to move away from a situation where many are dependent on payday loans and expensive short-term credit, a reliance that is exacerbated by the monthly pay cycle.“</p>
<p>People who live paycheck to paycheck could leverage Payday for unplanned expenses. For instance, if you have to fix your car and it cannot wait until the end of the month, you can unlock some money right away.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This isn’t debt and doesn’t affect your credit score — it’s a portion of your salary, which means that you’ll receive less money at the end of the month when you get paid.</p>
<p>Even if you’re not using the salary-advance feature, Payday lets you see how much you’ve earned so far this month. It’s going to be interesting to see whether a lot of companies adopt the feature. With millions of users in the U.K., chances are businesses are going to learn about Payday from their own employees.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The success of a fundraising process is entirely dependent on how well an entrepreneur can manage it. At this stage, it is important for founders to be honest, straightforward and recognize the value meetings with venture capitalists and investors can bring beyond just the monetary aspect.</p>
<p>Here are five pointers that founders should consider while pitching to venture capitalists:</p>
<h2>Be honest and accurate</h2>
<p>Raising a venture round is, in a way, a sales process, but any claims that could call into question a founder’s trustworthiness can result in a negative outcome rather than an investment.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			As VCs, we cannot overemphasize how important it is that founders are transparent and upfront. 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Here are a few select cases of such claims:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overstating traction or revenues, which due diligence brought to light.</li>
<li>Concealing material attributes of the founding team — such as a co-founder’s commitment to the company, which at best was part time.</li>
<li>Speaking of committed investors who were about to wire money to the company, except they were still at the due diligence stage and eventually decided not to invest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Investing in early-stage companies is often about making bets on people. As VCs, we cannot overemphasize how important it is that founders are transparent and upfront. It is critical to help establish the initial seeds of trust with a capital partner.</p>
<p>Further, most investors understand that things change — if there are any material shifts during the diligence process, communicating them promptly is an additional signal of maturity and uprightness. This will go a long way during the capital raise and beyond.</p>
<h2>Know your BATNA</h2>
<p>Founders often enter conversations with venture capitalists with a good handle on their product and the business. However, it&#8217;s common for entrepreneurs to falter at the negotiation stage, not knowing what their best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA) is.</p>
<p>We have witnessed founders who mistake initial interest in the venture market for real commitment, and unreasonably hike their valuation, which results in them losing serious investors. We have also seen founders fail to ascribe the value serious VCs bring to the table and consequently hesitate to discount their valuation, only to later realize that the existing cap table lacks firepower.</p>
<p>The best way for founders to uncover their BATNA is to run an efficient process. This requires:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If your employer does any sort of charity donation matching, the system powering it might be… not great. Maybe it’s got an ancient interface; maybe it’s stuffed behind the VPN at some weird URL that takes a half hour to dig up every December when you remember there’s donation match money about to expire.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.joindeed.com">Deed</a>, a company out of the ongoing Y Combinator S21 class, is looking to modernize the Corporate Social Responsibility (or CSR) concept &#8212; and do a bit more to keep it on your radar, while they’re at it.</p>
<p>Deed&#8217;s web interface does much of what you&#8217;d expect of a platform like this. It&#8217;ll handle employee donations and facilitate donation matching based on the employer&#8217;s rules, and it&#8217;ll offer up volunteer opportunities and track volunteer hours accordingly. And it&#8217;ll do it all with a clean interface that shouldn&#8217;t look out of place and dated in a modern company&#8217;s toolset.</p>
<p>But it also offers up plenty of neat stuff I haven&#8217;t seen the alternatives do — like a dating app-style swipe interface for narrowing down volunteering opportunities, deeper support for employee resource groups (you can follow employee groups within your company, and those groups can highlight organizations you might want to donate to) and tools to promote a bit of friendly who-can-volunteer-more competition between departments. Next up: Slack integration.</p>

<p>This week Deed is rolling out an early build of <a href="https://www.joindeed.com/solutions/slack-app">its Slack tie-in</a>, which, as company co-founder Deevee Kashi tells me, is meant to “meet employees where they are.”</p>
<p>While Deed&#8217;s web interface isn&#8217;t going anywhere, this new integration lets them beam many of the most commonly accessed features &#8212; plus a feed of any donation/volunteer activity your co-workers opt to share &#8212; right into Slack. Easier access, harder to forget.</p>
<p>Deed is a bit further along than many of the companies we see coming out of YC. Many of the teams we see in each YC batch are made up of a couple co-founders working from whatever desk space they can find; Deed, meanwhile, has 20+ employees across the world and a growing HQ in Berlin.</p>
<p>But it’s still early days for the company &#8212; much of its growth, and even its focus on the enterprise, is relatively new.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191703" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191703" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2191703 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Group-photo-deed.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="473" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Group-photo-deed.jpg 4542w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Group-photo-deed.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Group-photo-deed.jpg?resize=300,209 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Group-photo-deed.jpg?resize=768,534 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Group-photo-deed.jpg?resize=680,473 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Group-photo-deed.jpg?resize=1536,1069 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Group-photo-deed.jpg?resize=2048,1425 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Group-photo-deed.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191703" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Deed&#8217;s hybrid in-person/remote team</em><strong> Image Credits: </strong>Deed</p></div></p>
<p>Deed started its life in 2016 as an app with a similar, but different, focus. Kashi, coming off a 10-year stint of running night clubs and, as he puts it, “throwing parties for a living,” decided it was time to retune.</p>
<p>“Externally people perceived my career as being successful. Internally, I was very… distraught,” he tells me. “I wasn’t really connecting to what I was doing and, by any means, it didn’t align with my values.”</p>
<p>“I took a step back and decided to volunteer, just kind of locally in the city. After trying to volunteer, I realized how cumbersome the process was &#8212; how antiquated all the technology was and how nonprofits were struggling to engage with younger demographics.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>From that came the first iteration of Deed, then an app meant to help individuals find the right volunteer opportunities for them. They grew a community of tens of thousands of users around New York… then the big companies came knocking.</p>
<p>“Their employees came to them and said they really enjoyed using the app in their free time,” says Kashi. “They’d assumed we had an enterprise offering as well to help them with their employee volunteering and engagement programs.”</p>
<p>After a bit more tugging at that thread, the team decided to go all in on enterprise in 2020. They took what they learned about building a pretty, modern interface for individual volunteering and adapted it for the needs of these big teams. And it seems to be working; they quickly signed their first big customer with Adidas. Then came Sweetgreen, Airbnb and Stripe. Kashi tells me that they’re now working with companies with anywhere from 250 employees to 100,000.</p>
<p>Deed raised $2 million at the end of last year &#8212; and with the momentum behind its shift to enterprise teams, saw its own team grow quickly. “We couldn’t afford two desks.&#8221; says Kashi. &#8220;Now we’ve hired a bunch of people over the past year and a half. And I’d never met them in person! Then all of a sudden I walk up and the entire floor is ours. It’s really surreal onboarding people remotely, managing them for a year and a half… and <em>then</em> seeing them for the first time.”</p>

<p><a href="https://astra.com/">Astra</a> CEO Chris Kemp tweeted the news on Thursday, adding that the launch operator license through the FAA is valid through 2026. The new license is a modification of the company’s previous launch license and applicable to the current version of the company’s rocket, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tabletop gaming is in the middle of a historic boom, despite recent restrictions imposed on in-person gatherings by COVID. The tools adopted by game masters and casual players to play remotely are powerful, but not always the easiest to use or adopt. <a href="https://www.playrole.com/">Role</a> hopes to change that with a super-accessible video platform focused on the social aspect of role-playing games, and it has raised a $2.75 million seed round to do so.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to say what has powered the incredible growth of the tabletop gaming space, which just a few years ago was perceived as a sleepy realm of basement-dwelling nerds, a niche within a niche. But it was a different kind of sleeping giant, one that has proven to be immensely diverse, valuable and surprisingly tenacious in the face of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Some platforms, like <a href="https://roll20.net/">Roll20</a> and <a href="https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/home.php">Fantasy Grounds</a>, have seized on this opportunity to provide online video collaboration platforms for playing games like D&amp;D, strategy titles and many others of the general tabletop type.</p>
<p>But Logan Dwight and Ian Hirschfeld, co-founders of Role, felt these approaches tended to emphasize the mechanics over what they felt was a more important aspect of RPGs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We asked ourselves, why is it that people, when they have all these options, choose to play D&amp;D on the internet? And what we figured out is, it&#8217;s the people,&#8221; said Dwight. &#8220;The game lives in the minds of the people, a shared social experience. It&#8217;s about the conversation, the face-to-face interactions.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is the start of something new, they said — and big. As an analogue, they referred to the social gaming explosion a decade ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;People always find a way to play. Because we had social media platforms and mobile phones then, we were socializing over those — so we naturally looked for ways to play over them,&#8221; they said. &#8220;We&#8217;re at another one of those inflection points now with the explosion of online video and the creator economy in gaming. Video has become so good and so ubiquitous it&#8217;s becoming the dominant way people socialize — and then what naturally happens is we look for a way to play. And it turns out the, answer was right under our noses, and it&#8217;s been there since the &#8217;70s: it&#8217;s role playing, a game that takes the form of conversation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Role was designed from the ground up to smooth out and simplify how the complex mechanics of these games are implemented, putting the players visually and cognitively at the forefront. After all, when you&#8217;re playing D&amp;D or another game around the table, you spend most of your time looking at each other, not the game board — because it&#8217;s a game and you&#8217;re having fun with each other, right?</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s easy to say the face-to-face interactions should be front and center, but the truth is these games are mechanically complicated and involve sheets, dice, maps, rulebooks and so on. Dwight said the problem here is not so much keeping them always in view, but making them simple and intuitive to access and involve in gameplay.</p>
<p>Take a character sheet with some attributes and associated bonuses, and a standard combat encounter. Depending on how well the GM has prepped, it may be that the dice rolls need to have bonuses added manually, and the results compared manually to the defending monster&#8217;s sheet. But if the bonuses, the dice and the monster&#8217;s stats are all aware of one another, you know if you hit as soon as the die is cast.</p>

<p>This can be done in many games, but it&#8217;s not always easy, and becomes much harder the further one goes from official, canon rulebooks. House rules are common enough, but these days there are entire variant game types being built out from open-license rulebooks that have no &#8220;official&#8221; support from a major gaming company like Wizards. Prepping a game for play online might be weeks of work that&#8217;s relatively technically demanding.</p>
<p>Some GMs and creators take pleasure in the intricacy of these systems, but as Dwight pointed out, the expansion of the community means more people are coming to this from non-gaming and non-tech backgrounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;The core skills people are bringing to this are that they&#8217;re a writer or something. So the ability to create together needs to be really easy and really powerful,&#8221; they said. &#8220;We want to give people like&#8230; a Squarespace for tabletop RPGs. It&#8217;s a WYSIWYG editor, the RPG equivalent of a box of LEGO. You can make a whole set of templates for whatever game you want to run, tweak sheets, create animations, all without having to touch code, and you can share it easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>The platform has already seen major growth in user-created campaigns and variants for games designed to be built upon, like Mörk Borg and Lancer, with thousands being shared.</p>

<p>Role first raised money via Kickstarter (though the idea goes back to 2015), then via some angel funding, but this seed round brings in their first proper VC money. The $2.75 million round is co-led by Konvoy and London Venture Partners, with whom Dwight said they were pleased to find willing partners who understood the opportunity perfectly. That&#8217;s a feat, considering the skyrocketing value and diversity of tabletop has taken even industry veterans by surprise.</p>
<p>The money is going toward effecting the lessons the company has learned from its early adopters, with a renewed focus on ease of use, accessibility and extensibility. As for making money, the company intends to do so through a marketplace for games and scenarios, and for premium features like extra online storage and so on. But for regular users who just want to play with friends, Role is free to <a href="https://app.playrole.com/signup">sign up for</a> and use right now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This January, Twitter acquired the newsletter platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">Revue</a>, but until now its integration into Twitter has been minimal; sometimes when you write Twitter threads, you&#8217;ll be greeted with a &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/luca/status/1364481560506900482?lang=en">Hello, wordsmiths</a>&#8221; message that tells you about its newsletter tools.</p>
<p>Starting today, Twitter is testing a feature that brings Revue newsletters more prominently into the Twitter experience. Some users on web and Android will be able to see writers&#8217; Revue newsletters appear on their profile beneath their follower counts. If you click subscribe, you&#8217;ll be prompted to read a sample issue or subscribe using the email address connected to your Twitter account. Revue says this feature will also <a href="https://twitter.com/revue/status/1428371224099446786">roll out on iOS</a> soon.</p>

<p>Today, we’re starting to test a feature that allows people to subscribe to your Revue newsletter directly from your Twitter profile. </p>
<p>It&#39;s available to all Revue creators immediately. To start though, your newsletters will show only for a test group on Twitter. <a href="https://t.co/YDa1aOGeLM">pic.twitter.com/YDa1aOGeLM</a></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Chicago is an outlying benefactor from accelerating venture capital activity and the rise of remote investing.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chicago’s startup scene is finally getting the attention it long felt it deserved.</p>
<p>By now it’s common knowledge that 2021 is shaping up to be a breakout year for the startup and venture capital worlds, surpassing years of strong results in a long-term bull market for tech-focused business upstarts. But no boom is equally distributed.</p>
<p>Different markets are seeing differing amounts of activity, driven in part by their startup ecosystem’s maturity and the ease with which external capital can be deployed. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/african-startups-join-global-funding-boom-as-fintech-shines/">African startups will set fresh venture capital records</a> this year, for example. But markets closer to the leading hubs of venture capital are seeing even stronger results, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/why-latin-american-venture-capital-is-breaking-records-this-year/">Latin America demonstrates</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/vcs-unfazed-by-chinese-regulatory-shakeups-so-far/">China’s venture capital market, meanwhile, is easing</a> as others accelerate.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Even inside the United States, there is divergence in how individual markets are performing. Chicago is an outlying benefactor from accelerating venture capital activity and the rise of remote investing. Data <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q2-2021/">collected by CB Insights</a>, for example, indicates that Chicago’s ability to attract venture funds has risen to new heights in the first half of the year.</p>
<p>While we anticipated Chicago might do well in a generally warm environment for startup investment, its results were better than we expected. To more fully understand just what is going on in the Windy City, The Exchange corresponded with <a href="https://m25vc.com/">M25</a>, a Midwest-focused venture capital fund; Moderne Ventures’ partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/liza-benson-a8091828/">Liza Benson</a> (fresh off her firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/moderne-ventures-closes-second-fund-with-200m-targets-industry-digital-transformation/">raising $200 million for its second fund</a>); <a href="https://twitter.com/kitun">Scott Kitun,</a> of the Technori community and investing platform that has roots in the city; and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-barnes-m1">Brian Barnes</a>, CEO of M1 Finance, a local unicorn in the fintech space that TechCrunch has covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/m1-finance/">extensively</a>.</p>

And the investors don’t expect that the back half of the year will be too different from the first. That means Chicago-based startups are in the middle of their best year of raising capital <em>ever</em>. Let’s talk about how that came to be.</p>
<h2>A venture capital run for the ages</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pace at which Chicago-area startups have raised capital reached a new, high plateau starting in the second half of 2020. In historical terms, data indicates that Chicago was a beneficiary of an accelerated pace of venture investment that took hold globally once investors, concerned that startup growth could slow, shrugged off initial COVID shocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, startups were not affected as many feared, with many young tech companies actually accelerating during the pandemic’s first quarter of lockdowns, as many traditional businesses had to lean into software solutions and other services that startups sold.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The early boost to Chicago’s venture totals in the final two quarters of 2020 was easily bested in the first quarter of 2021. And then the second quarter of this year crushed <em>that</em> record.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Instead of an EV battery being something that needs to be recharged, like an iPhone, Ample wants to turn them into things that can be swapped out, like batteries in a digital camera.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">San Francisco-based Ample has raised a $160 million Series C to scale its battery swapping service, the largest round yet for the 8-year-old startup that wants to completely rethink how we use electric vehicles.</p>
<p><a href="https://ample.com/">Ample’s</a> approach is relatively straightforward: Cars equipped with the company&#8217;s modular battery pack can drive into one of Ample’s automated charging pod locations and swap out their depleted batteries for ones that are fully charged. The swapped-out batteries are then recharged in the pod and ready to be reinserted into another vehicle.</p>
<p>Although Ample’s battery swapping model is simple on paper, the company is proposing thinking about EV batteries in a completely different way. Instead of an EV battery being something that needs to be recharged, like an iPhone, Ample wants to turn them into things that can be swapped out, like batteries in a digital camera.</p>
<p>This latest nine-figure funding round is a sign that investors are paying attention. The internationally funded Series C was led by Moore Strategic Ventures with participation from PTT, a Thai state-owned oil and gas company, and Disruptive Innovation Fund. Existing investors Eneos, a Japanese petroleum and energy company, and Singapore’s public transit operator SMRT also participated. Ample&#8217;s total funding is now $230 million.</p>
<p>“We realized that there&#8217;s this big elephant in the room with electric vehicles and [it&#8217;s that] nobody is that excited about spending an hour, two hours or three hours charging their vehicle,” Ample co-founder John de Souza said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Industry’s response has been to develop technology like DC fast chargers, which have managed to shave charging time down to only 20 or 30 minutes. But de Souza said that improvements in charging time don’t get rid of fundamental problems: “[Fast charging] generates a lot of heat; the grid doesn’t support it,” he said. “Even if you could have batteries you charge in five minutes, you’d need chargers that were massively powerful and you’d need power plants around every corner to do it.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ample is currently focused on fleets – it operates five battery swapping stations in the Bay Area for participating Uber drivers, and it also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/ev-battery-swapping-startup-ample-charges-up-operations-in-japan-nyc/">locked in a partnership</a> with Sally, an EV rental company for taxi and last-mile deliveries in New York City. But the company sees its battery swapping service as suitable for consumers, as well. Ample co-founder Khaled Hassounah said battery swapping could also be useful for personal consumers who don’t have a good charging solution available to them, like people who live in apartment buildings. “We’re really a lot more focused on the cars that are coming on the road” rather than EVs that have already been manufactured, Hassounah added.</p>

<p>The company says that its modular system means that drivers only need to carry around as much battery as they need. For Ample, that means less battery waste and less weight in the vehicle.</p>
<p>Much of Ample’s vision relies on buy-in from automakers. For example, the company is imagining that when a person goes to buy a car, the OEM could offer either a fixed battery option or a vehicle equipped with an Ample battery system.</p>
<p>Ample says it has validated its approach with 10 different car models by working directly with OEMs, and that none of them have required making modifications to the vehicle. That doesn’t mean that there are no interfaces between the battery and the car that need to be altered &#8212; there are things like voltage cables or a cooling line, for example &#8212; but that the actual architecture of EVs is simpler than one might think.</p>
<p>“The marketing departments at the OEMs want to tell you that … ‘This is a super-duper battery that is very well integrated with the car; there&#8217;s no way you can separate it,’” Hassounah said. “The truth of the matter is they’re built completely separately and so true for almost &#8212; not almost, for every battery in the car, including a Tesla.</p>
<p>“Since we&#8217;ve built our system to be easy to interface with different vehicles, we&#8217;ve abstracted the battery component … from the vehicle,” he added.</p>
<p>Ample said it&#8217;s working with five different OEMs right now, “some of the largest OEMs out there,” de Souza said, though he declined to specify which ones. He added that growing demand from fleets goes hand in hand with conversations with OEMs, which are eager to sell vehicles.</p>
<p>It could be an attractive proposal because much of the cost of an electric vehicle is its battery system. The market has seen a version of this idea from Chinese automaker Nio, which offers consumers the option of purchasing a vehicle with or without a battery (for the latter option, Nio leases the batteries). Under the leasing option, drivers shave ¥70,000 ($10,800) off the price of a vehicle. Nio has already completed more than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/chinese-ev-maker-nio-is-stepping-outside-of-china-for-the-first-time/">2.4 million battery swaps</a> for Chinese drivers, founder William Li said in May.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, Ample is focused purely on scaling: deploying with large customers in new cities. Interestingly, de Souza added that the company is getting a lot of interest from governments who want to shift to electric transportation but don’t have the requisite charging infrastructure.</p>
<p>“The question is, how can we get more miles and be electric, rather than build more infrastructure?” Hassounah said. “If you go and deploy a million fast chargers and no one uses them, we haven&#8217;t achieved anything.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Leaders and senior management everywhere are grappling with how (or not) to bring employees back to the office. It’s a high-stakes decision: Fifty-eight percent of workers said they will look for new jobs if they can’t work remotely, according to a<a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/flexjobs-survey-finds-employees-want-remote-work-post-pandemic/"> FlexJobs survey</a>.</p>
<p>An often overlooked and/or cobbled-together piece of this puzzle is compensation. And inside the transition to hybrid work, compensation planning encapsulates a cacophony of nuances for founders, people leaders and compensation experts.</p>
<p>Here are just a few new questions this group needs to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we adjust salaries for people who have moved to different regions?</li>
<li>Do we alter pay for employees performing the same role, with the same title, when one is remote and the other is in-office?</li>
<li>How can we educate geographies that aren’t as familiar with the value of equity as is, say, Silicon Valley?</li>
</ul>
<p>As we’ve seen in recent weeks, the answers to these questions are different for us all.<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/the-great-reboot/pay-cut-google-employees-who-work-home-could-lose-money-2021-08-10/"> Google employees who work from home</a> may experience a pay cut. <a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/companies-switching-remote-work-long-term/">Adobe workers</a> can self-select what days they work remotely, up to 50% of the time, with no salary impact. Meanwhile,<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/linkedin-allow-most-employees-work-remotely-reversing-course-2021-07-29/"> LinkedIn</a> just loosened its policy, allowing employees to work from home permanently.</p>

<p>Regardless of your startup’s stance on the topic, having a consistent compensation philosophy that you apply to your evolving workplace has a unicorn-sized influence on important growth metrics: attracting and keeping top talent, as well as creating a culture of trust and performance.</p>
<p>As the CEO of a compensation intelligence company, I see four common mistakes that startups commit when compensation planning that hinder successful remote or hybrid workforces. Here are the ways to sidestep them.</p>
<h2>1. Using subpar data for competitive analysis</h2>
<p>The first step in developing a compensation plan — regardless of your company’s stance on distributed work — is determining how your team’s pay compares with the market. To understand market rates, you need one thing: data.</p>
<p>If you’re moving from a strictly office-based environment to a hybrid model, 2019 data won’t work. While it’s tempting to search for free data online or use survey data that your company has purchased in the past, both approaches have risks. Traditional compensation survey information is stale, limited and often not verified. And spreadsheets are hyperprone to error and security risks because they involve manual, and often super laborious, work.</p>
<p>In a world that’s still reacting to a pandemic, only fresh, real-time, accurate benchmarks and pay ranges are sufficient. Both must reflect aggregated information about what others in your segment are paying employees — by experience level, role, department, geography, industry and company size.</p>
<p>For example, technology startups need different data sources than global financial services organizations. Both need information geared toward companies of a similar size and stage. Software engineer salaries need to reflect those of similar roles, with nuances for those that specialize in machine learning, data science, etc.</p>
<p>You’d be shocked how often self-reported data on free websites is inaccurate and unverified. As you seek a credible intelligence source for your compensation data, a data source must:</p>
