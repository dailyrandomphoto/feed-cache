					<description><![CDATA[Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch’s venture-capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. The whole crew was here this week, with Danny and Natasha and Alex  together with Grace and Chris to sort through a very, very busy week. Yep, somehow it is Friday again which means it&#8217;s time for our weekly news roundup. [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/5f15db26-d823-42a1-a7db-b3f54be2ab3a?dark=true" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture-capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>The whole crew was here this week, with <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a>  together with Grace and Chris to sort through a very, very busy week. Yep, somehow it is Friday again which means it&#8217;s time for our weekly news roundup.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we got to in our short window of time:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Jianzhi Education IPO:</strong> We have questions. The Chinese edtech company is <a href="https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/jianzhi-education-is-first-chinese-firm-to-file-to-list-in-us-after-regulators-propose-vetting-overseas-ipos">looking to list</a> in the United States after Chinese regulators clamped down on Didi and other China-based, American public offerings. Bravery? Stupidity? Brilliance? It&#8217;s hard to say, but we&#8217;ll be watching.</li>
<li><strong>Zomato&#8217;s IPO and the Indian tech scene:</strong> As Zomato <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zomato-raises-562-million-from-anchor-investors-ahead-of-ipo/">puts the final touches on its impending public offering</a>, we chatted about the listing and what it may mean for the larger, red-hot Indian startup market.</li>
<li><strong>The AI conversation:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zoominfo-drops-575m-on-chorus-ai-as-ai-shakes-up-the-sales-market/">ZoomInfo bought Chorus.ai this week</a>, which we had lots of say about especially in light of Gong&#8217;s epic valuation. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/discord-buys-sentropy/">Discord bought Sentropy</a>, which also uses AI, albeit for a very different purpose. The great AI startup marketing push of years&#8217; past has finally led to a few neat exits.</li>
<li><strong>Apple vs. Startups:</strong> That&#8217;s the gist of our chat about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/?p=2177976&amp;preview=true">the BNPL space and Apple&#8217;s possible invasion of the hot startup market</a>. In short, who&#8217;s at risk? We have a few ideas.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/the-techcrunch-list-is-dead-long-live-commodity-capital/">The TechCrunch List is dead — long live commodity capital</a>: </strong>We get into how a list that separates VCs by sector and stage makes no sense into today&#8217;s lawless investing world.</li>
<li>Which brings us to a series of new funds. <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1414959994580078592/">As Natasha pointed out</a>, <strong>the scene for emerging fund managers has never looked more diverse. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Nooks raised a seed round</strong>, which turned us back<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/nooks-set-to-seed-its-own-in-the-world-of-virtual-hqs/"> into the world of virtual HQs. </a></li>
<li>And we closed with a quick digest of the <strong>latest morsels from the fake-meat startup smorgasbord</strong>, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/gourmey-is-a-cell-based-poultry-startup-working-on-lab-grown-foie-gras/">what Gourmey is cooking</a>, what <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/next-gen-foods-to-launch-its-plant-based-chicken-in-the-u-s-after-raising-a-20m-seed-extension-from-investors-like-ggv/">Next Gen Foods is whipping up</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/panda-express-is-piloting-beyond-meat-orange-chicken-in-select-locations/">how Beyond Meat plans to keep its market cap sizzling</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like we said, a busy week! Chat you all on Monday morning, <em>early</em>.</p>
<div class="article-content">

					<description><![CDATA["When a VC says they don't like an LLC, they literally mean they are definitely allergic to peanuts, and you are a bowl of nuts."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch virtually sat down with venture capitalist and <a href="https://www.cleocap.com/">Cleo Capital</a> managing director <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahkunst">Sarah Kunst</a> at our latest Early Stage event last week. Kunst joined us to chat about preparing for raising capital in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">today&#8217;s frenetic fundraising environment</a>, digging into the gritty mechanics for the audience.</p>
<p>Cleo Capital invests $500,000 to $1 million into early-stage startups, with portfolio companies that include mmhmm, Cameo and StyleSeat, among others.</p>
<p>Next, a few favorite excerpts from the chat, starting with Kunst&#8217;s notes on how to make a killer pitch deck. Questions from the audience helped direct the conversation, so I&#8217;ve tried to select themes that came from y&#8217;all. We&#8217;ll also explore advice regarding incorporation, how to find a co-founder and when startups are too large to join an accelerator. (Quotes lightly edited for clarity.)</p>
<p>Before we get into key points from the conversation, here&#8217;s a rundown of links that Kunst discussed that I promised to include in this post:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://guykawasaki.com/the-only-10-slides-you-need-in-your-pitch/">Guy Kawasaki&#8217;s 10 slide deck</a></li>

<li>Y Combinator&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cooleygo.com/">documents hub</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://lunchclub.ai/?invite_code=sarahk1">LunchClub</a> with Kunst&#8217;s invite code attached</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/sarahkunst">Kunst&#8217;s Twitter account</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>How to make a great pitch deck</h2>
<blockquote><p>Here&#8217;s the thing about decks: Don&#8217;t be ugly. Don&#8217;t be ugly. Don&#8217;t be ugly.</p>
<p>The good news is it is free and easy to make a non-ugly deck. It is not 1999. You do not have to use clip art. You can go to Canva. You can go to plenty of websites that give you very basic, very cheap &#8212; if not free &#8212; very simple decks. Just use one. It doesn&#8217;t have to change the world. But it can&#8217;t be ugly. No Comic Sans font, unless you&#8217;re a deeply ironic meme-driven company. And even then, the odds that that joke will land are infinitesimal. So, just don&#8217;t have an ugly deck.</p>
<p>What should be in your deck? Again, this will be a link that we&#8217;ll have later, but I love for really early-stage companies to use <a href="https://guykawasaki.com/the-only-10-slides-you-need-in-your-pitch/">Guy Kawasaki&#8217;s 10-slide pitch-deck format</a>. Do not send me something that is a video. Do not send me something that is a one-pager. Do not send me something that&#8217;s 100-pager. [I want] 10 slides. Don&#8217;t make me download anything. Attached as a PDF, use DocSend.</p>
<p>Make it really, really, really simple and really easy to read and digest who you are, what the problem is [you are tackling], what the solution is, why you&#8217;re the right team to do it, what your traction is, how much you&#8217;re raising, [and] maybe a product slide. That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s all I need to know. I&#8217;ll take the meeting or I won&#8217;t. And I say that on behalf of every other VC and angel in the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>This advice is clear and should help you avoid some common pitfalls. Everything that she said not to do, I promise she&#8217;s had sent to her. Don&#8217;t be the next thing that gets deleted. Do what she said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>How to find a co-founder</h2>
<blockquote><p>Look back through everybody you know. This is sort of the same [as] when we get to the friends and family part of fundraising. Really go back and say, <em>Who do I know?</em> Not, <em>Who are my best friends</em>, or <em>who was at my wedding.</em> Take a much broader look. And think about the intern you always sat next to who was an engineer &#8212; what are they up to now? Your college roommate&#8217;s boyfriend or girlfriend who was a great compsci major. What are they doing now? Tweet about it, reach out on social media, reach out on LinkedIn. I&#8217;m obsessed with LinkedIn. If you keep your network up to date, you can literally go search <em>who do you know who&#8217;s a computer scientist</em>? First-degree, second-degree connections [are great]. Then just reach out to people and say, <em>Hey, we&#8217;d love to chat with you.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vyrill helps brands discover and leverage video reviews created by authentic customers and users. The company presented its product at TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising, where it beat out nine other companies, winning the pitch-off. The judges were impressed with Vyrill&#8217;s novel approach and innovative technology around discovering and filtering relevant videos.</p>
<p>This is a struggle for companies of every size. User-generated content is highly sought after as its authenticity is often apparent and therefore powerful. But the challenge is finding the ideal video quickly and efficiently. Right now, that usually involves searching for a video based on its title and then screening the entire video &#8212; a process that&#8217;s haphazard and labor-intensive.</p>
<p>As Vyrill&#8217;s CEO Ajay Bam stressed during his presentation, brands increasingly turn to ordinary people for video advertising. Instead of slick marketing videos, brands are more often licensing and marketing content created by real-life product users. But discovery is challenging and the search tools built into video platforms only parse the text in the title and description. Vyrill claims to have the solution. For example, with Vyrill&#8217;s technology, L&#8217;Oreal can match millions of YouTube videos to their entire product catalog, organizing each video to the appropriate product category. This enables L&#8217;Oreal to identify and utilize the best user-generated videos for the company&#8217;s marketing purposes. In addition, with Vyrill&#8217;s system, L&#8217;Oreal can dig down and identify user-generated content specific to a particular product.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Vyrill&#8217;s system analyzes the videos and parses the video&#8217;s text, audio, and images against a handful of filters, including diversity, subject matter, engagement, and more. According to Vyrill, this system is the secret sauce, enabling brands to discover the best videos quickly. The system also helps brands connect with the content creators by displaying profiles and email addresses.</p>
<p>CEO Ajay Bam said during his presentation the company currently has 40 companies on its platform, and it&#8217;s doubling month over month. Bam and co-founder and CTO Dr. Barbara Rosario started the company in 2015 and raised a $2.1 million pre-seed round in 2018. The company is currently fundraising a seed round with $1.2 million already raised.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Yummy, a Venezuela-based delivery app, raised $4 million in funding to expand its dark store delivery operations across Latin America.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yummy, a Venezuela-based delivery app on a mission to create the super app for the country, announced Friday it raised $4 million in funding to expand its dark store delivery operations across Latin America.</p>
<p>Funding backers included Y Combinator, Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen, Canary, Hustle Fund, Necessary Ventures and the co-founders of TaskUs. The total investment includes pre-seeding capital raised in 2020.</p>
<p>“This appears to be a contrarian bet, but Yummy has quickly become the No. 1 super app in Venezuela and proven that the team can scale the business in a difficult territory,” Mateen said in a statement. “Now Vicente and the rest of the Yummy team will expand into more traditional markets with the necessary experience and support to overcome inevitable challenges that they will face.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Vicente Zavarce, Yummy’s founder and CEO, launched the company in 2020 and is currently part of Y Combinator’s summer 2021 cohort. Born in Venezuela, Zavarce came to the U.S. for school and stayed to work in growth marketing at Postmates, Wayfair and Getaround before starting Yummy. Zavarce was a remote CEO over the past year, stuck in the U.S. due to travel restrictions, but said he is making the most of it.</p>
<p>Yummy’s app can be downloaded for free, and the company charges a delivery fee or merchant fee. In contrast to some of his food delivery competitors, Zavarce told TechCrunch Yummy’s fees are “the lowest in the market” so they do not affect the merchant’s ability to use the app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178272" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178272" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2178272 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Order-Heartmap-Angle-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="495" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Order-Heartmap-Angle-2.png 1875w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Order-Heartmap-Angle-2.png?resize=150,72 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Order-Heartmap-Angle-2.png?resize=300,145 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Order-Heartmap-Angle-2.png?resize=768,371 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Order-Heartmap-Angle-2.png?resize=680,329 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Order-Heartmap-Angle-2.png?resize=1536,742 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Order-Heartmap-Angle-2.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178272" class="wp-caption-text">Yummy order heat map. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yummy</p></div></p>
<p>The company is pulling together additional key components for its super app strategy, which includes launching a ridesharing vertical this year. Yummy has already connected more than 1,200 merchants with hundreds of thousands of customers.</p>
<p>And, over the past year the company completed more than 600,000 deliveries of food, groceries, alcohol and shopping. It reached $1 million in monthly gross merchandise volume while also growing 38% in revenue month over month.</p>
<p>Over the past eight years, the political and economic challenges faced by the country have led to its recent adoption of the U.S. dollar, Zavarce said. In some cases up to 70% of transactions are happening in dollars on the ground. He said this has protected the business against hyperinflation and ultimately created the opportunity for startups to begin operating in Venezuela.</p>
<p>Because of that, combined with more consumer technology innovation over the past decade, Zavarce said there is no reason why Venezuela should not have the best last-mile logistics. It’s there that Yummy has an opportunity to connect multiple vertices into a super app with little to no competition.</p>
<p>“Eventually, other players will enter, but because we have a super app, we already have an amazing frequency of usage,” he added. “We also already have exclusivity with 60% of the food delivery marketplace, which has enabled us to build a moat around the market. We believe we are the right people to execute on this and feel it is our responsibility to do it.”</p>
<p>Plans for the new funding include user acquisition — the company has close to 200,000 registered users already — and to expand in Peru and Chile by August. At the same time, Zavarce will spend some of that capital to attract more users across Venezuela. He also expects to be in Ecuador and Bolivia by the end of the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.halla.io/">Halla</a> wants to answer the question of how people decide what to eat, and now has $4.5 million in fresh Series A1 capital from Food Retail Ventures to do it.</p>
<p>Headquartered in New York, Halla was founded in 2016 by Gabriel Nipote, Henry Michaelson and Spencer Price to develop “taste intelligence,” using human behavior to steer shoppers to food items they want while also discovering new ones as they shop online. This all results in bigger basket orders for stores. Today’s funding announcement brings Halla’s total capital raised to $8.5 million, CEO Price told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company’s API technology is a plug-and-play platform that leverages more than 100 billion shopper and product data points and funnels it into three engines: Search, which takes into account a shopper’s preferences; Recommend, which reveals relevant complementary products as someone shops; and Substitute, which identifies replacement options.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Halla’s Substitute product was released earlier this year as an answer to better recommendations for out-of-stock items that even <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/artificial-intelligence/2021/walmart-uses-predictive-ai-for-grocery-substitutions/">retailers like Walmart are creating technology to solve</a>. Price cited a McKinsey report that found 20% of grocery shoppers sought out competitors following a negative outcome from bad substitutions.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178390" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178390" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2178390" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-4.11.25-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="411" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-4.11.25-PM.png 2304w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-4.11.25-PM.png?resize=150,60 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-4.11.25-PM.png?resize=300,120 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-4.11.25-PM.png?resize=768,308 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-4.11.25-PM.png?resize=680,273 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-4.11.25-PM.png?resize=1536,616 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-4.11.25-PM.png?resize=2048,821 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-4.11.25-PM.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178390" class="wp-caption-text">Halla Substitute. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Halla</p></div></p>
<p>None of these data points are linked to any shoppers’ private data, just the attributes around the shopping itself. The APIs, rather, are looking for context to return relevant recommendations and substitutions. For example, Halla’s platform would take into account the way someone adds items to their cart and suggest next ones: if you added turkey and then bread, the platform may suggest cheese and condiments.</p>
<p>“It’s also about personalization when it comes to grocery shopping and food,” Price said. “When you want organic eggs from a specific brand and it is out of stock, it is often up to your personal shopper’s discretion. We want to lead them to the right substitutions, so you can still cook the meal you intended instead of ‘close enough.’ ”</p>
<p>Halla’s technology is now live in more than 1,100 e-commerce storefronts. The new funding gives Halla some fuel for the fire Price said is happening within the company, including plans to double the number of stores it supports across accounts. He also expects to double employees to 30 in order to support growth and customer base, admitting there is “more inbound interest that we can handle.” Halla has been busy fast-tracking big customers for pilots, and at the same time, wants to expand internationally with additional product lines over the next 18 months.</p>
<p>The company is also seeing “a near infinite increase in recurring revenue,” as it attracts six- and seven-figure contracts that push the company closer to cash flow positivity. All of that growth is positioning Halla for a Series B if it needs it, Price said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as part of the investment, Food Retail Ventures’ James McCann will join Halla’s board of directors.</p>
<p>McCann, who only invests in food and retail technology, told TechCrunch that grocery stores need a way to inspire shoppers, that Halla is doing that and in a better way than other intelligence versions he has seen.</p>
<p>“Their technology is miles ahead of everyone else,” he added. “They have a terrific team and a terrific product. They are seeing huge uplifts in terms of suggestions and what people are buying, and their measurements are out of this world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Switzerland-based privacy startup <a href="https://nymtech.net">Nym Technologies</a> has raised $6 million, which is being loosely pegged as a Series A round.</p>
<p>Earlier raises included a $2.5M seed round in 2019. The founders also took in grant money from the European Union&#8217;s Horizon 2020 research fund during an earlier R&amp;D phase developing the network tech.</p>
<p>The latest funding will be used to continue commercial development of network infrastructure which combines an old idea for obfuscating the metadata of data packets at the transport network layer (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mix_network">Mixnets</a>) with a crypto inspired reputation and incentive mechanism to drive the required quality of service and support a resilient, decentralized infrastructure.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nym&#8217;s <a href="https://nymtech.net/about/">pitch</a> is it&#8217;s building &#8220;an open-ended anonymous overlay network that works to irreversibly disguise patterns in Internet traffic&#8221;.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, given its attention to crypto mechanics, investors in the Series A have strong crypto ties &#8212; and cryptocurrency-related use-cases are also where Nym expects its first users to come from — with the round led by Polychain Capital, with participation from a number of smaller European investors including Eden Block, Greenfield One, Maven11, Tioga, and 1kx.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Will Wolf of Polychain Capital, said: “We’re incredibly excited to partner with the Nym team to further their mission of bringing robust, sustainable and permissionless privacy infrastructure to all Internet users. We believe the Nym network will provide the strongest privacy guarantees with the highest quality of service of any mixnet and thus may become a very valuable piece of core internet infrastructure.”</p>
<p>The Internet&#8217;s &#8216;original sin&#8217; was that core infrastructure wasn’t designed with privacy in mind. Therefore the level of complicity involved in Mixnets &#8212; shuffling and delaying encrypted data packets in order to shield sender-to-recipient metadata from adversaries with a global view of a network &#8212; probably seemed like over engineering all the way back when the web&#8217;s scaffolding was being pieced together.</p>
<p>But then came Bitcoin and the crypto boom and &#8212; also in 2013 &#8212; the Snowden revelations which ripped the veil off the NSA&#8217;s &#8216;collect it all&#8217; mantra, as Booz Allen Hamilton sub-contractor Ed risked it all to dump data on his own (and other) governments&#8217; mass surveillance programs. Suddenly network level adversaries were front page news. And so was Internet privacy.</p>
<p>Since Snowden&#8217;s big reveal, there&#8217;s been a slow burn of momentum for privacy tech &#8212; with rising consumer awareness fuelling usage of services like e2e encrypted email and messaging apps. Sometimes in spurts and spikes, related to specific data breaches and scandals. Or indeed privacy-hostile policy changes by mainstream tech giants (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/">hi Facebook</a>!).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Signal’s Brian Acton talks about exploding growth, monetization and WhatsApp data-sharing outrage&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/embed/#?secret=zsMA2Ib1NG" data-secret="zsMA2Ib1NG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Legal clashes between surveillance laws and data protection rights are also causing growing b2b headaches, especially for US-based cloud services. While growth in cryptocurrencies is driving demand for secure infrastructure to support crypto trading.</p>
<p>In short, the opportunity for privacy tech, both b2b and consumer-facing, is growing. And the <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">team behind Nym thinks conditions look ripe for general purpose privacy-focused networking tech to take off too.</span></p>
<p>Of course there is already a well known anonymous overlay network in existence: Tor, which does onion routing to obfuscate where traffic was sent from and where it ends up.</p>
<p>The node-hopping component of Nym’s network shares a feature with the Tor network. But Tor does not do packet mixing &#8212; and <a href="https://medium.com/nymtech/sphinx-tl-dr-the-data-packet-that-can-anonymize-bitcoin-and-the-internet-18d152c6e4dc">Nym&#8217;s contention</a> is that a functional mixnet can provide even stronger network-level privacy.</p>
<p>It sets out the case on its <a href="https://nymtech.net/#faq">website</a> &#8212; arguing that &#8220;Tor’s anonymity properties can be defeated by an entity that is capable of monitoring the entire network’s ‘entry’ and ‘exit’ nodes&#8221; since it does not take the extra step of adding &#8220;timing obfuscation&#8221; or &#8220;decoy traffic&#8221; to obfuscate the patterns that could be exploited to deanonymize users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although these kinds of attacks were thought to be unrealistic when Tor was invented, in the era of powerful government agencies and private companies, these kinds of attacks are a real threat,&#8221; Nym suggests, further noting another difference in that Tor’s design is &#8220;based on a centralized directory authority for routing&#8221;, whereas Nym fully decentralizes its infrastructure.</p>
<p>Proving that suggestion will be quite the challenge, of course. And Nym&#8217;s CEO is upfront in his admiration for Tor — saying it is the best technology for securing web browsing right now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most VPNs and almost all cryptocurrency projects are not as secure or as private as Tor &#8212; Tor is the best we have right now for web browsing,&#8221; says<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Nym founder and CEO Harry Halpin. &#8220;</span>We do think Tor made all the right decisions when they built the software &#8212; at the time there was no interest from venture capital in privacy, there was only interest from the US government. And the Internet was too slow to do a mixnet. And what&#8217;s happened is speed up 20 years, things have transformed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The US government is no longer viewed as a defender of privacy. And now &#8212; weirdly enough &#8212; all of a sudden venture capital is interested in privacy and that&#8217;s a really big change.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">With such a high level of complexity involved in what Nym&#8217;s doing it will, very evidently, need to demonstrate the robustness of its network protocol and design against attacks and vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis &#8212; such as those seeking to spot patterns or identify dummy traffic and be able to relink packets to senders and receivers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The tech is open source but</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Nym</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> confirms the plan is to use some of the Series A funding for an independent audit of new code. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It also touts the number of PhDs it&#8217;s hired to-date &#8212; and plans to hire a bunch more, saying it will be </span>using the new round to more than double its headcount, including hiring cryptographers and developers, as well as marketing specialists in privacy.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The main motivation for the raise, per Halpin, is to spend on more R&amp;D to explore &#8212; and (he hopes) &#8212; solve some of the more specific use-cases it&#8217;s kicking around, beyond the basic one of letting developers use the network to shield user traffic (a la Tor). </span></p>
<p>Nym&#8217;s whitepaper, for example, touts the possibility for the tech being used to enable users to prove they have the right to access a service without having to disclose their actual identity to the service provider.</p>
<p>Another big difference vs Tor is that Tor is a not-for-profit &#8212; whereas Nym wants to build a for-profit business around its Mixnet.</p>
<p>It intends to charge users for access to the network &#8212; so for the obfuscation-as-a-service of having their data packets mixed into a crowd of shuffled, encrypted and proxy node-hopped others.</p>
<p>But potentially also for some more bespoke services &#8212; with Nym&#8217;s team eyeing specific use-cases such as whether its network could offer itself as a &#8216;super VPN&#8217; to the banking sector to shield their transactions; or provide a secure conduit for AI companies to carry out machine learning processing on sensitive data-sets (such as healthcare data) without risking exposing the information itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main reason we raised this Series A is we need to do more R&amp;D to solve some of these use-cases,&#8221; says Halpin. &#8220;But what impressed Polychain was they said wow there&#8217;s all these people that are actually interested in privacy &#8212; that want to run these nodes, that actually want to use the software. So originally when we envisaged this startup we were imagining more b2b use-cases I guess and what I think Polychain was impressed with was there seemed to be demand from b2c; consumer demand that was much higher than expected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Halpin says they expect the first use-cases and early users to come from the crypto space &#8212; where privacy concerns routinely attach themselves to blockchain transactions.</p>
<p>The plan is to launch the software by the end of the year or early next, he adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will have at least some sort of chat applications &#8212; for example it&#8217;s very easy to use our software with Signal&#8230; so we do think something like Signal is an ideal use-case for our software &#8212; and we would like to launch with both a [crypto] wallet and a chat app,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Then over the next year or two &#8212; because we have this runway &#8212; we can work more on kind of higher speed applications. Things like try to find partnerships with browsers, with VPNs.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this (still fairly early) stage of the network&#8217;s development &#8212; an initial testnet was launched in 2019 &#8212; Nym&#8217;s eponymous network has amassed over 9,000 nodes. These distributed, crowdsourced providers are only earning a NYM reputation token for now, and it remains to be seen how much exchangeable crypto value they might earn in the future as suppliers of key infrastructure if/when usage takes off.</p>
<p>Why didn&#8217;t Mixnets as a technology take off before, though? After all the idea dates back to the 1980s. There&#8217;s a range of reasons, according to Halpin &#8212; issues with scalability being one of them one. And a key design &#8220;innovation&#8221; he points to vis-a-vis its implementation of Mixnet technology is the ability to keep adding nodes so the network is able to scale to meet demand.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Another key addition is that the Nym protocol injects dummy traffic packets into the shuffle to make it harder for adversaries to decode the path of any particular message &#8212; aiming to bolster the packet mixing process against vulnerabilities like correlation attacks.</span></p>
<p>While the Nym network&#8217;s crypto-style reputation and incentive mechanism &#8212; which works to ensure the quality of mixing (&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">via a novel proof of mixing scheme&#8221;, as its <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a> puts it</span>) &#8212; is another differentiating component Halpin flags.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of our core innovations is we scale by adding servers. And the question is how do we add servers? To be honest we added servers by looking at what everyone had learned about reputation and incentives from cryptocurrency systems,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We copied that &#8212; those insights &#8212; and attached them to mix networks. So the combination of the two things ends up being pretty powerful.</p>
<p>&#8220;The technology does essentially three things&#8230; We mix packets. You want to think about an unencrypted packet like a card, an encrypted packet you flip over so you don&#8217;t know what the card says, you collect a bunch of cards and you shuffle them. That&#8217;s all that mixing is &#8212; it just randomly permutates the packets&#8230; Then you hand them to the next person, they shuffle them. You hand them to the third person, they shuffle them. And then they had the cards to whoever is at the end. And as long as different people gave you cards at the beginning you can&#8217;t distinguish those people.&#8221;</p>
<p>More generally, Nym also argues it&#8217;s an advantage to be developing mixnet technology that&#8217;s independent and general purpose &#8212; folding all sorts and types of traffic into a shuffled pack &#8212; suggesting it can achieve greater privacy for users&#8217; packets in this pooled crowd vs similar tech offered by a single provider to only their own users (such as the &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-wwdc-2021-privacy-security/">privacy relay&#8217; network recently announced by Apple</a>).</p>
<p>In the latter case, an attacker already knows that the relayed traffic is being sent by Apple users who are accessing iCloud services. Whereas &#8212; as a general purpose overlay layer &#8212; Nym can, in theory, provide contextual coverage to users as part of its privacy mix. So another key point is that the level of privacy available to Nym users scales as usage does.</p>
<p>Historical performance issues with bandwidth and latency are other reasons Halpin cites for Mixnets being largely left on the academic shelf. (There have been some other deployments, such as Loopix &#8212; which Nym&#8217;s whitepaper says its design builds on by extending it into a &#8220;general purpose incentivized mixnet architecture&#8221; &#8212; but it’s fair to say the technology hasn&#8217;t exactly gone mainstream.)</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Nym&#8217;s contention is the tech&#8217;s time is finally coming; firstly because technical challenges associated with Mixnets can be overcome &#8212; because of gains in Internet bandwidth and compute power; as well as through incorporating crypto-style incentives and other design tweaks it&#8217;s introducing (e.g. dummy traffic) &#8212; but also, and perhaps most importantly, because privacy concerns aren’t simply going to disappear.</p>
<p>Indeed, Halpin suggests governments in certain countries may ultimately decide their exposure to certain mainstream tech providers which are subject to state mass surveillance regimes &#8212; whether that&#8217;s the US version or China&#8217;s flavor or elsewhere &#8212;  simply isn’t tenable over the longer run and that trusting sensitive data to corporate VPNs based in countries subject to intelligence agency snooping is a fool&#8217;s game.</p>
<p>(And it&#8217;s interesting to note, for example, that the European Data Protection Supervisor is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/eu-bodies-use-of-us-cloud-services-from-aws-microsoft-being-probed-by-blocs-privacy-chief/">currently conducting a review of EU bodies use of mainstream US cloud services</a> from AWS and Microsoft to check whether they are in compliance with last summer&#8217;s Schrems II ruling by the CJEU, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">struck down the EU-US Privacy Shield deal</a>, after again finding US surveillance law to be essentially incompatible with EU privacy rights&#8230; )</p>
<p>Nym is betting that some governments will &#8212; eventually &#8212; come looking for alternative technology solutions to the spying problem. Although government procurement cycles make that play a longer game.</p>
<p>In the near term, Halpin says they expect interest and usage for the metadata-obscuring tech to come from the crypto world where there&#8217;s a need to <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">shield transactions from view of potential hackers.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The websites that [crypto] people use &#8212; these exchanges &#8212; have also expressed interest,&#8221; he notes, flagging that Nym also took in some funding from Binance Labs, the VC arm of the cryptocurrency exchange, after it was chosen to go through the Lab&#8217;s incubator program in 2018.</p>
<p>The issue for crypto users is their networks are (relatively) small, per Halpin &#8212; which makes them vulnerable to deanonymization attacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing with a small network is it&#8217;s easy for random people to observe this. For example people who want to hack your exchange wallet &#8212; which happens all the time. So what cryptocurrency exchanges and companies that deal with cryptocurrency are concerned about is typically they do not want the IP address of their wallet revealed for certain kinds of transactions,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;This is a real problem for cryptocurrency exchanges &#8212; and it&#8217;s not that their enemy is the NSA; their enemy could be &#8212; and almost always is &#8212; an unknown, often lone individual but highly skilled hacker. And these kinds of people can do network observations, on smaller networks like cryptocurrency networks, that are essentially are as powerful as what the NSA could do to the entire Internet.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are now a range of startups seeking to decentralize various aspects of Internet or common computing infrastructure &#8212; from file storage to decentralized DNS. And while some of these tout increased security and privacy as core benefits of decentralization &#8212; suggesting they can &#8216;fix&#8217; the problem of mass surveillance by having an architecture that massively distributes data, Halpin argues that a privacy claim being routinely attached to decentralized infrastructure is misplaced. (He points to a <a href="https://www.petsymposium.org/2017/papers/issue4/paper87-2017-4-source.pdf">paper</a> he co-authored on this topic, entitled <em>Systematizing Decentralization and Privacy: Lessons from 15 Years of Research and Deployments</em>.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost all of those projects gain decentralization at the cost of privacy,&#8221; he argues. &#8220;Because any decentralized system is easier to observe because the crowd has been spread out&#8230; than a centralized system &#8212; to a large extent. If the adversary is sufficiently powerful enough all the participants in the system. And historically we believe that most people who are interested in decentralization are not expects in privacy and underestimate how easy it is to observe decentalized systems &#8212; because most of these systems are actually pretty small.&#8221;</p>
<p>He points out there are &#8220;only&#8221; 10,000 full nodes in Bitcoin, for example, and a similar amount in Ethereum &#8212; while other, newer and more nascent decentralized services are likely to have fewer nodes, maybe even just a few hundred or thousand.</p>
<p>And while the Nym network has a similar amount of nodes to Bitcoin, the difference is it&#8217;s a mixnet too &#8212; so it&#8217;s not just decentralized but it&#8217;s also using multiple layers of encryption and traffic mixing and the various other obfuscation steps which he says &#8220;none of these other people do&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We assume the enemy is observing everything in our software,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;We are not what we call &#8216;security through obscurity&#8217; &#8212; security through obscurity means you assume the enemy just can&#8217;t see everything; isn&#8217;t looking at your software too carefully; doesn&#8217;t know where all your servers are. But &#8212; realistically &#8212; in an age of mass surveillance, the enemy will know where all your services are and they can observe all the packets coming in, all the packets coming out. And that&#8217;s a real problem for decentralized networks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Post-Snowden, there’s certainly been growing interest in privacy by design &#8212; and a handful of startups and companies have been able to build momentum for services that promise to shield users’ data, such as DuckDuckGo (non-tracking search); Protonmail (e2e encrypted email); and Brave (privacy-safe browsing). Apple has also, of course, very successfully markets its premium hardware under a ‘privacy respecting’ banner.</p>
<p>Halpin says he wants Nym to be part of that movement; building privacy tech that can touch the mainstream.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because there&#8217;s so much venture capital floating into the market right now I think we have a once in a generation chance &#8212; just as everyone was excited about p2p in 2000 &#8212; we have a once in a generation chance to build privacy technology and we should build companies which natively support privacy, rather than just trying to bolt it on, in a half hearted manner, onto non-privacy respecting business models.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I think the real question &#8212; which is why we didn&#8217;t raise more money &#8212; is, is there enough consumer and business demand that we can actually discover what the cost of privacy actually is? How much are people willing to pay for it and how much does it cost? And what we do is we do privacy on such a fundamental level is we say what is the cost of a privacy-enhanced byte or packet? So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re trying to figure out: How much would people pay just for a privacy-enhanced byte and how much does just a privacy enhanced byte cost? And is this a small enough marginal cost that it can be added to all sorts of systems &#8212; just as we added TLS to all sorts of systems and encryption.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nasir Qadree, a Washington-based investor who just raised $62.1 million for his debut venture fund, recently told us that as his fundraising gained momentum, he was approached by established firms that are looking to absorb new talent.</p>
<p>He opted to go it alone, but he’s hardly alone in attracting interest. Anecdotally, bringing emerging managers into the fold is among the newer ways that powerful venture firms stay powerful. Early last year, for example, crypto investor Arianna Simpson &#8212; who founded and was managing her own crypto-focused hedge fund &#8212; was lured into the heavyweight firm Andreessen Horowitz as a deal partner.</p>
<p>Andy Chen, a one-time CIA weapons analyst who spent more than seven years with Kleiner Perkins, was in the process of raising his own fund in 2018 when another prominent firm, the hedge fund Coatue, came knocking. Today he helps lead the firm’s early-stage investing practice.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to understand the appeal of such firms, which manage enormous funds and wield tremendous power with founders. Still, as older firms look to recruit from a widening pool of new managers, they might have to wait on the most talented of the bunch; in some cases, given today&#8217;s go-go market, they might be out of luck entirely.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nasir Qadree just announced one of the largest debut funds for a solo VC&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/nasir-qadree-grew-up-in-the-projects-now-hes-announcing-one-the-largest-debut-funds-for-a-solo-vc/embed/#?secret=nuuqMQ4djB" data-secret="nuuqMQ4djB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There is, of course, a long list of reasons that so many people are deciding to raise funds these days, from the glut of capital looking to make its way into startups, to tools like Angelist&#8217;s <a href="https://www.angellist.com/blog/rolling-venture-fund-launch">Rolling Funds</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/vc-democratization/">revised regulations</a> around crowdfunding in the U.S.</p>
<p>Emerging managers also seem adept at capitalizing on the venture industry’s blind spots. One is the excessive wealth of more veteran VCs. An investor&#8217;s experience counts for a lot, but there’s a lot to be said for up-and-comers who are still establishing their reputation, who aren’t sitting on more than a dozen boards, and whose future will be closely aligned with their founders.</p>
<p>Yet there are other trends the establishment has long overlooked . Many firms probably regret not taking crypto <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-29-year-old-crypto-billionaire-has-goldman-cme-group-in-his-crosshairs-as-his-exchanges-aims-to-surpass-coinbase-11626278939">more seriously sooner</a>. Many teams have also ignored for too long the soaring economic power of women, which new managers are driving home to their own investors.</p>
<p>Not last, many have stubbornly resisted racially diversifying their ranks, creating an opening for investors of color who are acutely aware of changing demographics. According to census projections, white Americans will represent a minority of the U.S. population within 20 years, meaning today’s racial minorities are becoming the primary engine of the country’s growth.</p>
<p>That new managers have shaken up the industry is arguably a good thing. What some are beginning to ponder is whether they can afford to maintain their independence, and that answer isn&#8217;t yet clear.</p>
<p>Like the startups they fund, many of these new managers are right now operating in the shadows of the firms that came before them. It&#8217;s a seemingly copacetic arrangement. Venture is an industry where collaboration between business competitors is inescapable after all, and it’s easy to stay on the good side of giant firms when you’re investing a non-threatening amount into nascent companies you’ll later introduce to the bigger players.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bobby Goodlatte has designs on how to succeed in venture (and so far, so good)&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/bobby-goodlatte-has-designs-on-how-to-succeed-in-venture-and-so-far-so-good/embed/#?secret=BuvMGxYkYr" data-secret="BuvMGxYkYr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Ensuring that things remain harmonious &#8212; and that deal flow keeps coming &#8212; a growing number of venture firms now plays the role of limited partner, committing capital to new managers. Foundry Group was among the first to do this in an institutionalized way five years ago, setting aside <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/19/foundry-group-just-closed-its-sixth-fund-with-a-record-500-million/">25% of a new fund</a> to pour into smaller venture funds. But it’s happening routinely across the industry. Jake Paul’s new influencer-focused fund? Backed by Marc Andreessen and Chris Dixon of Andreessen Horowitz. Katie Stanton’s Moxxie Ventures?<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/bvc_fund_nine/"> Backed</a> by Bain Capital Ventures.</p>
<p>The running joke is that big firms have raised so much money they don&#8217;t know where to plug all of it, but they&#8217;re also safeguarding what they&#8217;ve built. That was the apparent thinking in 2015, when a then-beleaguered Kleiner Perkins tried to engage in merger talks with Social Capital, a buzzed-about venture firm founded by Chamath Palihapitiya.</p>
<p>That deal reportedly fell apart over who would ultimately <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/31/why-the-kleiner-social-capital-deal-fell-apart/">run the show</a>. Kleiner subsequent underwent a nearly complete <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/kleiner-perkins-early-stage/">management change</a> to regain its footing, while numerous members of Social Capital left to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/05/tribe-capital/">start Tribe Capital</a>. But surely venture firms track managers who <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">think could add value to their brand.</span></p>
<p>Some will certainly make the move if asked, given  the sheen and economics of a big brand, and because teaming up can be far easier than slugging it out alone. Early-stage investor Semil Shah &#8212; who has built up his <a href="https://haystack.vc/">own firm</a> while also working as a <a href="https://lsvp.com/team/">venture partner</a> with different, established outfits &#8212; thinks it&#8217;s &#8220;natural to assume that lots of new rolling funds&#8221; in particular will either &#8220;burn out, stay small, or try to scale and realize how hard it is and perhaps go to a bigger firm once they have established a track record.&#8221;</p>
<p>That last scenario is not as exciting to some as might have been earlier in time, however. Eric Bahn, who cofounded the Bay Area-based seed-stage firm Hustle Fund in 2017, <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://twitter.com/ericbahn/status/1412257757206519809?s=20">predicted last week on Twitter</a> that &#8220;establishment VC funds will acquire emerging VC funds, who are building differentiated networks/brands.&#8221; While that might be seen as a cushy landing, Bahn added: &#8220;Not sure how I feel about this. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f914.png" alt="🤔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />&#8221; (Plenty of people weighed in to say they also felt conflicted.)</p>
<p>Bahn also later tweeted that &#8220;to be unequivocal, Hustle Fund is not for sale.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PyFEmWBD5N"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/jake-paul-looks-to-knock-out-the-venture-capital-world-with-anti-fund/">Jake Paul looks to knock out the venture capital world with Anti Fund</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jake Paul looks to knock out the venture capital world with Anti Fund&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/jake-paul-looks-to-knock-out-the-venture-capital-world-with-anti-fund/embed/#?secret=PyFEmWBD5N" data-secret="PyFEmWBD5N" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Asked about his resistance to a possible tie-up, Bahn says he&#8217;s &#8220;nervous about industry consolidation&#8221; given there have been &#8220;systemic issues with VCs being exclusionary in the past when it comes to women and other underrepresented groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>He adds that even more recently he has &#8220;met LPs who &#8212; wink wink &#8212; really like men who come from Stanford and have computer science degrees.&#8221; Both lead him to fret that even a team with &#8220;good intentions can revert back to the mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>His comments echo those of Qadree, who told us last week: <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“I think it’s up to someone like myself and people who are constantly being asked these questions to have strong conviction around how to think about building your franchise. I’ve been through so much to get to this point that to give up my equity, give up my branding and ideas” was not an option he was willing to consider.</span></p>
<p>In the meantime, investor Lolita Taub of <a href="https://thecommunity.vc/">The Community Fund</a> &#8212;  a $5 million early-stage fund that is focused on community-themed startups and backed by the Boston-based seed-stage venture firm Flybridge &#8212; is more sanguine about emerging managers&#8217; ability to remain independent. Rather than gobble up smaller funds, she foresees more established players begin to fund &#8212; and nurture &#8212; emerging funds that have overlapping areas of interest.</p>
<p>Taub suggests that it&#8217;s the next step beyond VCs who&#8217;ve worked with so-called scouts to find undiscovered gems. &#8220;I think older players are looking to expand their reach beyond what they know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even so, the industry is changing shape, and some form of consolidation, if not imminent, seems inevitable once the checks inevitably stop flying.</p>
<p>Some firms will break out, while others team up. Some newer investors will find themselves at top firms, while others close up shop.</p>
<p>Almost the only certainty right now is that a larger fund &#8220;buying&#8221; a smaller fund is &#8220;not that complicated,&#8221; according to fund administration expert Bob Raynard of Standish Management in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Asked about the mechanics of such tie-ups, he shares that it &#8220;generally involves changing or adding members at the GP entity level [leading to a] change in control of the funds.&#8221; Maybe, too, he says, there is a rebranding.</p>
<p>The real challenge, suggests Raynard, is just &#8220;getting two VCs to agree on a value.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that depends entirely on their other options.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital payments giant Paytm, one of India’s most valuable startups, plans to raise up to $2.2 billion in an initial public offering, it said in draft papers submitted to the country&#8217;s market regulator on Friday.</p>
<p>The Noida-headquartered firm &#8212; backed by Alibaba (which, alongside Ant Financial, owns 36% of Paytm), Berkshire Hathaway, and SoftBank (owns about 18% stake) among others &#8212; <a href="https://listing.bseindia.com/download/350845/DRHP%20-%20One%2097%20Communications%20Limited_20210716130427.pdf">said</a> (PDF) it will issue new shares worth $1.1 billion and offer sale worth of $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Paytm, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/ubs-investment-makes-byjus-the-most-valuable-startup-in-india/">until recently the most valuable startup in India</a>, has said it may raise up to $268 million in a pre-IPO round. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/indian-startups-fundraise-spree/">reported earlier this month</a> that Paytm has held talks with Goldman Sachs and Fidelity to raise a pre-IPO round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, which competes with PhonePe and Google Pay in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market, plans to use the fresh capital of $577 million to broaden its payments services offering and about $269 million to enter into new initiatives and explore acquisition opportunities, it said.</p>
<p>Paytm, which was launched in 2009 to help users easily make digital payments from their phones and top up credit, has expanded to a wide-range of services in the past decade. Today it operates a payments gateway, e-commerce marketplace, ticket booking, and also sells insurance and digital gold. In several of the categories where it operates, Paytm is a market leader.</p>
<p>The startup, formally known as One97 Communications and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/24/paytm-1-billion/">last valued at $16 billion</a>, platform has amassed over 333 million users, 114.3 million of whom transact annually, and has onboarded over 21 million merchants, it said in the papers today.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have created a payments-led super-app, through which we offer our consumers innovative and intuitive digital products and services,&#8221; the Vijay Shekhar Sharma-led describes itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;We offer our consumers a wide selection of payment options on the Paytm app, which include (i) Paytm Payment Instruments, which allow them to use digital wallets, sub-wallets, bank accounts, buy-now-pay-later and wealth management accounts and (ii) major third-party instruments, such as debit and credit cards and net banking,&#8221;</p>
<p>Paytm&#8217;s IPO plans come at a time when the pandemic has fuelled India&#8217;s digital economy and local stock exchanges are showing growing appetite for consumer tech stocks. Indian food delivery giant Zomato&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zomato-raises-562-million-from-anchor-investors-ahead-of-ipo/">$1.3 billion IPO this week</a> took only a few hours to be fully subscribed by retail and anchor investors.</p>
<p>A lot is riding on a successful IPO of Paytm, one of the most celebrated startups in India and which reported a consolidated loss of $233.6 million for the financial year that ended in March this year, down from $404 million a year ago.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Paytm&#8217;s Sequoia-backed rival MobiKwik <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/indian-financial-services-firm-mobikwik-looks-to-raise-255-million-in-ipo/">also filed for an IPO</a>, in which it is seeking to raise about $250 million. SoftBank-backed e-commerce giant Flipkart, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/flipkart-valued-at-37-6-billion-in-new-3-6-billion-fundraise/">raised $3.6 billion at $37.6 billion valuation</a> earlier this week, insurance aggregator PolicyBazaar, make-up retailer Nykaa and delivery startup Delhivery, which on Friday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/india-delhivery-lands-100-million-from-fedex/">announced a $100 million investment from FedEx</a>, may also list in the next three to four quarters.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2162178" style="width: 775px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162178" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2162178 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-business.jpg" alt="" width="765" height="484" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-business.jpg 1528w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-business.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-business.jpg?resize=300,190 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-business.jpg?resize=768,486 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-business.jpg?resize=680,430 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-business.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 765px) 100vw, 765px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2162178" class="wp-caption-text">A look at all Paytm businesses. (Bernstein)</p></div></p>
<p>Bankers and analysts are bullish on Paytm, whose mobile wallet business has lost lustre in recent years as UPI &#8212; a payments framework backed by banks in India &#8212; found takers in Google, PhonePe and others and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/upi-india-growth-startups-business-model/">took the market by storm</a>. But Paytm has bounced back, analysts argue.</p>
<p>“With the advent of UPI, there has been a rising narrative that questioned Paytm’s market leadership,” the analysts wrote, referring to the exponential growth of payments stack developed by retail banks in India that has been adopted by several firms, including Google and PhonePe (as well as Paytm), and which has somewhat lowered the appeal of mobile wallets in India,&#8221; analysts at Bernstein wrote in a recent report to clients.</p>
<p>“However, under the hood, Paytm leads on merchant payments and has built an ecosystem of synergistic fintech verticals around its ‘super-app.’ The ecosystem spans payments (wallet/UPI), full-suite merchant acquiring, credit tech, digital bank, wealth, and insurance tech. We believe the super-app battle in India is not a ‘winner takes all’ but a game of execution, business building, and creating a superior customer experience with ecosystem integration,” Bernstein analysts added.</p>
<p>That said, retail investors should keep in mind some risk factors. In its filing today, Paytm said it is a &#8220;foreign-owned and controlled&#8221; company and will continue to have such ownership after the IPO and hence will be subject to Indian foreign investment laws.</p>
<p>Paytm also said its wealth vertical &#8212; Paytm Money &#8212; has observed &#8220;certain violations&#8221; of laws and regulations in the past. And some of the firm&#8217;s largest investors intend to sell their stake at the IPO.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">FedEx Express, a subsidiary of delivery services giant FedEx, is investing $100 million in Indian startup Delhivery as the global firm looks to expand its presence in the South Asian country.</p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s investment comes less than two months after the Gurgaon-headquartered startup, which is valued at $3 billion, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/indian-logistics-giant-delhivery-raises-277-million-ahead-of-ipo/">secured $277 million</a> ahead of an initial public offering in the coming quarters.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, the companies will enter into a long-term commercial agreement. FedEx Express will focus on international export and import services to and from India, and Delhivery will, in addition to FedEx, sell FedEx Express international products and services in the India market and provide pick-up and delivery services across India. FedEx will transfer certain assets pertaining to its domestic business in India to Delhivery.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our aim is to bring new products and opportunities to Indian and global businesses and consumers through unique access to our networks, and our technology and engineering capabilities,&#8221; said Delhivery co-founder Sahil Barua said of Friday&#8217;s investment.</p>
<p>Delhivery began its life <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/06/delhivery-seriesd/">as a food delivery firm</a>, but has since shifted to a full suite of logistics services in over 2,300 Indian cities and more than 17,500 zip codes. It is among a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/indias-blackbuck-raises-150-million-to-digitize-freight-and-logistics-across-india/">handful of startups</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/rivigo-india-seriese/">attempting to digitize</a> the demand and supply system of the logistics market through a freight exchange platform.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159174" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159174" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2159174 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="508" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg?resize=768,390 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg?resize=680,345 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159174" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Bernstein</p></div></p>
<p>Its platform connects consigners, agents and truckers offering road transport solutions. The startup says the platform reduces the role of brokers, makes some of its assets such as trucking — the most popular transportation mode for Delhivery — more efficient, and ensures round the clock operations.</p>
<p>This digitization is crucial to address the inefficiencies in the Indian logistics industry that has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d529d48c-dc1b-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482">long stunted</a> the national economy. Poor planning and forecasting of demand and supply increases the carrying costs, theft, damages, and delays, analysts at Bernstein wrote in a report last month about India’s logistics market.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.delhivery.com">Delhivery</a>, which says it has delivered over 1 billion orders, works with “all of India’s largest e-commerce companies and leading enterprises,” according to its website, where it also says the startup has worked with over 10,000 customers. For the last leg of the delivery, its couriers are assigned an area that never exceeds 2 sq km, allowing them to make several delivery runs a day to save time.</p>
<p>Indian logistics market’s TAM (total addressable market) is over $200 billion, Bernstein analysts said. The startup said late last year that it was planning to invest over $40 million within two years to expand and increase its fleet size to meet the growing demand of orders as more people shop online amid the pandemic.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/revolut-confirms-a-fresh-800m-in-funding-at-a-33b-valuation-to-supercharge-its-financial-services-superapp/">Revolut is now worth $33B:</a> </strong>U.K.-based neobank Revolut has put together an $800 million round that values the company at $33 billion. The company’s fresh valuation is a multiple of what it was worth in early 2020. Why is it worth so much today? TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/revoluts-2020-financial-performance-explains-its-big-new-33b-valuation/">did a little exploring on the matter</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/valve-launches-steam-deck-a-400-pc-gaming-portable/"><strong>Valve is making gaming hardware:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Yes, the folks behind the Steam gaming store are getting into the hand-held gaming market. Their device, the Steam Deck, will cost $399 and will contain “a quad-core Zen 2 CPU, coupled with AMD RDNA 2 graphics and 16 GB of RAM,” per our own Brian Heater. If you want more storage, get ready to shell out up to $649 for the hand-held computer.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/spacs-keep-rolling-as-autonomous-vehicle-startup-aurora-targets-blank-check-debut-with-13b-valuation/">Autonomous vehicle unicorn Aurora is going public:</a></strong> As TechCrunch previously scooped, autonomous vehicle unicorn Aurora is going public via a SPAC. The company expects to sport a $13 billion valuation when it begins to trade. Recall that Aurora previously absorbed Uber’s self-driving vehicle unit at a roughly $10 billion valuation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>The venture capital market has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/investors-dont-expect-the-us-startup-funding-market-to-slow-down/">been on fire lately</a>, leading to rapid-fire deal-making and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/your-funding-round-isnt-special-but-you-might-be/">more rounds than journalists can dream of covering</a>. But if you are still in the market to raise capital, then you might want to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/norwests-lisa-wu-explains-how-to-think-like-a-vc-when-fundraising/">listen to Norwest’s Lisa Wu</a>, who has a few tips that might prove useful. Chief among them? Think like a VC when you head out to raise.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/american-express-taps-startup-bodeswell-for-expansion-into-financial-planning/"><strong>AmEx dips its toes into financial planning:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today news broke that credit giant American Express invested in BodesWell last year via its venture arm. Now the credit card company has “launched a pilot of its first self-service digital financial planning tool” in conjunction with the startup. Talk about an early customer for BodesWell.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/abodu-raises-20m-to-build-prefabricated-backyard-homes/"><strong>Prefab construction tries again:</strong></a> That’s the word from a new $20 million round for Abodu — what we presume is a portmanteau of “abode” and “you.” Sure, prefab construction unicorn Katerra is kaput, but Abodu is taking a consumer-focused spin on the model. Norwest led the round, with participation from Initialized Capital.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/lightyear-nabs-13m-series-a-as-online-network-procurement-takes-shape/">Lightyear raises $13.1M for online network procurement:</a> </strong>From the geekier side of tech today was news from Lightyear, a startup that its CEO says is the “the first tool for buying your telecom infrastructure on the web.” Ron Miller notes that everything is heading online, so why not network buying?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/credit-suisse-leads-20m-series-a-in-data-extraction-startup-daloopa/"><strong>$20M for financial data extraction:</strong></a> Daloopa has closed an eight-figure Series A led by Credit Suisse Asset Management’s NEXT Investors to help financial types avoid “repetitive data extraction in order to gather insights for analysis and forecasts,” TechCrunch reports. The deal stood out to us given its obvious corporate venture capital (CVC) angle; CVCs have been more active than ever in recent quarters.</li>

<h2>The CockroachDB EC-1</h2>
<p>Ants and camels are famously resilient animals, but when it was time to select a name for a startup that offers open-source, cloud-based distributed database architecture, you can imagine why &#8220;Cockroach Labs&#8221; was the final candidate.</p>
<p>Database technology is fundamental infrastructure, which partially explains why it&#8217;s so resistant to innovation: Oracle Database was released in 1979, and MySQL didn&#8217;t reach the market until 1995.</p>
<p>Since hitting the market, CockroachDB has become &#8220;a next-generation, $2-billion-valued database contender,&#8221; writes enterprise reporter Bob Reselman, who interviewed the company&#8217;s founders to write a four-part series:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-origin/">Part 1: Origin story:</a></strong> From the creation of the popular open-source image editor GIMP to some of Google’s most well-known infrastructure products.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-technology/">Part 2: Technical design:</a></strong> Analyzes the key differentiation that CockroachDB offers, particularly its focus on geography and data storage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We know how much you love a good startup pitch-off. Who doesn&#8217;t? It combines the thrill of live, high-stakes entertainment with learning about the hottest new thing. Plus, you get to hear feedback from some of the smartest folks in the industry, thus learning how to absolutely crush it at your next pitch meeting with a VC.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, we&#8217;re introducing a special summer edition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> that&#8217;s all pitch-off, all the time.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-startup-alley-edition?ref=12c1c3225394">July 21</a> and <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-startup-alley-edition-july-28?ref=05f802c5b3e8">July 28</a>, Extra Crunch Live will feature startups exhibiting in the Startup Alley at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=ecljuly2021suapost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=eclsuajuly&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> in September. Those startups will pitch their products/businesses to a pair of expert VC judges, who will then give their live feedback.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is usually a combination of an interview with a founder/investor duo and an audience pitch-off. But as it&#8217;s summer, and Disrupt is right around the corner, we thought it would be fun to bring you even more pitches and even more feedback.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On July 21, our expert VC judges will be Alexa von Tobel of Inspired Capital and Anis Uzzaman from Pegasus Tech Ventures.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">On July 16th, <em>Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain</em> will open in US theatres. Like many documentaries, the film pieces together archival footage, including interviews and show outtakes, to attempt to tell the story of its subject in their own words. It also includes words Bourdain never spoke to a camera before his death by suicide in 2018, and yet you’ll hear his voice saying them.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/the-haunting-afterlife-of-anthony-bourdain" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>The New Yorker</ins></em></a>, the film’s director, Morgan Neville, said there were three quotes he wanted Bourdain to narrate where there were no recordings, and so he recreated them with software instead. “I created an AI model of his voice,” he told the magazine.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ihEEjwRlghQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>It appears that was no easy feat either. In a separate <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/anthony-bourdain-morgan-neville-roadrunner-documentary" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><ins>interview with </ins><em><ins>GQ</ins></em></a>, Neville said he contacted four different companies about the project before deciding on the best one. That company fed about a dozen hours of audio to an AI model. A lot of the work involved deciding the exact tone of Bourdain’s voice Neville wanted the software to replicate since the way the author and travel host narrated his writing changed so much over the years he was on TV.</p>
<p>Compared to some of the other ways we’ve seen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-24-facebook-fact-check-nancy-pelosi-video.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">AI</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netherlands-deepfake-video-chat-navalny-212606049.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">deepfakes</a> used to trick people, this isn&#8217;t the worst example, but the ethics of it are still questionable. The film, as far as we’re aware, doesn’t include a disclosure that AI was used to replicate Bourdain’s voice. “If you watch the film, other than that line you mentioned, you probably don’t know what the other lines are that were spoken by the AI, and you’re not going to know,” Neville told <em>The New Yorker</em>. “We can have a documentary-ethics panel about it later.” In his interview with <em>GQ</em>, he said Bourdain’s family told him “Tony would have been cool with that,” adding, “I was just trying to make [the quotes] come alive.”</p>

<h2>A look under the hood</h2>
<p>Before I discuss the changes that produced the lift, it is important that I quickly go over the research that informed those changes. Why? Because it is a critical aspect of the process and too many CRO practitioners do not devote enough attention to figuring out why more site visitors aren’t converting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A banner quarter for Xiaomi helped the Chinese mobile company snag the No. 2 spot in global smartphone shipments, according to<a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-smartphone-market-q2-2021?ctid=2143-1ae766ab9e27fab872ea0ad5e1320017"> newly posted Q2 numbers</a> from research firm Canalys. It’s pretty stunning growth for the company, up 83% year-over-year for the quarter and capturing 17% of the global market.</p>
<p>The surge puts Xiaomi at No. 2, globally, behind only Samsung’s 19% by a relatively small margin. Apple is at third with 14% (after its own solid growth has slowed), while fellow Chinese manufacturers Oppo and Vivo round out the top five at 10% a piece.</p>
<p>Huawei, of course, is nowhere to be seen among the top companies. It’s a pretty massive drop, due in no small part to blacklisting that has both barred the company from certain markets (namely, the U.S.) and cut off access to U.S. mobile products, including Google’s Android and various apps.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2178297" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178297" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2178297" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unnamed-2.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unnamed-2.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178297" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Canalys</p></div></p>
<p>Canalys cites aggressive pricing as a big factor in Xiaomi&#8217;s success &#8212; particularly contrasted with premium priced offerings from Samsung and Apple.</p>
<p>“It is now transforming its business model from challenger to incumbent, with initiatives such as channel partner consolidation and more careful management of older stock in the open market,” the analyst firm’s Research Manager Ben Stanton said in a release. “It is still largely skewed toward the mass market, however, and compared with Samsung and Apple, its average selling price is around 40% and 75% cheaper respectively. So a major priority for Xiaomi this year is to grow sales of its high-end devices, such as the Mi 11 Ultra.”</p>
<p>The company certainly isn’t a household name in the States (the company has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/us-removes-xiaomis-designation-as-a-communist-chinese-military-company/">dealt with its own issues here</a>), but of late it has found particular success in Latin America, Africa and Western Europe. It seems that there are still plenty of markets available to continue its expansion as it looks to take on Samsung, even as Oppo and Vivo hope to continue their own respective rapid global growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=disruptagendapost">Disrupt 2021</a> stands to be the best Disrupt yet. We have an incredible lineup of speakers both on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=disruptagendapost">Disrupt Stage and the Extra Crunch Stage</a>. And, of course, we can&#8217;t forget the Startup Battlefield, which has been a launch pad for some of the biggest tech companies in the world today, including Dropbox, Mint and Cloudflare.</p>
<p>Today, we&#8217;re excited to give you a closer look at the Disrupt Stage, where the biggest names in tech talk about their companies, their plans, and what&#8217;s next for the greater tech ecosystem.</p>
<p>This is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg when it comes to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=disruptagendapost&amp;display=true">three jam-packed days</a> we&#8217;re planning for you at Disrupt. Along with these heavy hitters on the Disrupt Stage, you can get your founder how-to knowledge at sessions on the Extra Crunch Stage, breakout sessions and intimate roundtable discussions. You&#8217;ll be able to find and engage with people from all around the world through world-class networking on CrunchMatch and our virtual platform &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=disruptagendapost&amp;display=true">all for under $100 for a limited time</a> with even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=disruptagendapost&amp;display=true">deeper discounts for nonprofit/government agencies, students and up-and-coming founders</a>!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So without any further ado, check out the current agenda for the Disrupt Stage:</p>
<h2>HEALTH/BIOTECH</h2>
<h3>Saving the World with Ugur Sahin (BioNTech) and Ursheet Parikh (Mayfield Fund)</h3>
<p>COVID-19 changed everything. It not only threatened our individual health and well-being, but shook industries and economies across the globe. But the same could be said about the COVID-19 vaccines. Hear from BioNTech co-founder and CEO Ugur Sahin on the process of rapidly developing the world&#8217;s most sought-after vaccine, alongside Pfizer, and the long-term potential of mRNA-based therapies. Sahin will be joined by Ursheet Parikh of Mayfield Fund to discuss what&#8217;s next for startups in this rapidly evolving industry.</p>
<h3>Democratizing Healthcare with Toyin Ajayi (Cityblock Health), Adrian Aoun (Forward),and Eren Bali (Carbon Health)</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that the current healthcare system in America is broken. Technology stands to make a huge difference, especially in the backdrop of eased regulations due to COVID-19. Hear how startup founders from Forward, Carbon Health and Cityblock Health decided to tackle the behemoth, backward industry of healthcare, as well as talk through their plans to democratize access and digitize the industry.</p>
<h3>Pot, Pottery and Beyond with Seth Rogen (Houseplant), Haneen Davies (Houseplant), and Michael Mohr (Houseplant)</h3>
<p>Somehow we live in world where alcohol is sold in grocery stores and weed is considered a gateway drug. But that is rapidly changing. The legalized cannabis industry is estimated to be worth more than $13 billion in 2021, and major players from big food, pharma, etc. all want a slice of the pie. Hear from actor and comedian Seth Rogen on his well-known passion for pot, and how it led him to start Houseplant. Rogen will also be joined by Houseplant Chief Commercial Officer Haneen Davies and co-founder and CEO Michael Mohr.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Language-learning company Duolingo was founded in 2011 and has raised more than $167 million in private capital, and recently filed to go public. Despite avoiding monetization for years, the startup saw revenue growth of 120%+ in 2020, with no signs of slowing. CEO and co-founder Luis von Ahn will join us on the Disrupt stage to talk about gamifying education, prepping for a public offering, and how he and the team built the anti-Rosetta Stone with an owl as a mascot.</span></p>

<h3>Breaking the Bank with Brian Armstrong (Coinbase)</h3>
<p>Coinbase’s massive direct listing earlier this year couldn’t have come at a better time as peaking crypto enthusiasm reached market exuberance, but now amid a major market correction, CEO Brian Armstrong is once again tasked with building for the future and navigating volatility while fending off global competitors knocking at their door.</p>

<h3>Staying a Step Ahead with Rinki Sethi (Twitter)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, in the midst of an already frantic year, Twitter was breached in a very public way. Behind the scenes, Twitter spends a tremendous amount of time, money and energy on user protection and platform integrity. A big part of that is through information security. CISO Rinki Sethi will join us at Disrupt to talk through how Twitter tries to stay ahead of malicious actors, and how tech companies large and small can do the same.</span></p>
<h3>From Bootstrapped to Billions with Tope Awotona (Calendly)</h3>
<p>Dozens have tried to reinvent the calendar, and dozens have failed. Tope Awotona built Calendly not as a way to reinvent the wheel, but to add a layer of simplicity to the chaos of human communication and time management. And boy did it work!

The communication tool (born from one of the odder pivots in tech history) is commonplace across organizations from almost every industry. It&#8217;s an unstoppable force. The sales CRM behemoth is used all over the world by sales teams small and large. An immovable object. In December of 2020, the pair announced a $27.7 billion merger. Hear from Slack founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield and Salesforce President and COO Bret Taylor about the future of the combined entity, why the deal made sense, and what it&#8217;s like to write down that many 0s.</p>
<h3>Dogmatic Design with Melanie Perkins (Canva)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rapid evolution of the design industry can&#8217;t be understated. From better collaboration among designers and other departments, to collaboration among designers themselves, to the democratization of design across an organization, the landscape is changing. Canva has led the charge in this evolution, building one of the simplest (and yet full-featured) tools on the market. Hear co-founder and CEO Melanie Perkins talk about scaling the business to now be worth upward of $15 billion, and expanding the business from B2C to B2B, all while continuing to iterate the product.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new challenger has emerged in the gaming hardware category. Game distribution giant <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/hardware">Valve today announced the launch of Steam Deck</a>, a $399 gaming portable designed to take PC games on the go.</p>
<p>The handheld (which has echoes of several portable gaming rigs of years past) features a seven-inch screen and runs on a quad-core Zen 2 CPU, coupled with AMD RDNA 2 graphics and 16GB of RAM. Storage runs 64GB to 512GB, the latter of which bumps the price up to $649. The built-in storage can be augmented via microSD.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178258" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178258" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2178258" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hero-banner-sequence-english.2021-07-15-13_49_51.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178258" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Valve</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Naturally, the thing is custom built for Valve’s wildly popular Steam platform (it’s right there in the name, after all). Users log into their Steam account and their library &#8212; and friends list &#8212; are right there, ready to go. There’s even a dedicated Steam button.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The system has been rumored for some time now, but it enters the world during a rapidly evolving era for gaming. Essentially the company is hoping to outperform the admitted graphical limitations of Nintendo’s Switch (OLED or no), while filling in the gap as cloud-based gaming from companies like Microsoft are still working on a foothold as they deal with latency and other technical limitations. There’s also the Nvidia Shield Portable &#8212; though we’ve not heard much from that project, of late.</p>

<p>Flanking the 1280 x 800 touchscreen are a pair of trackpads and thumb sticks. A built-in gyroscope also uses movement to control the gaming experience. There’s a single USB-C port for charging, peripherals and connecting to a big screen, while a 40Wh battery promises between 7-8 hours of gameplay, by Valve’s numbers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DeepMind stunned the biology world late last year when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/alphabets-deepmind-achieves-historic-new-milestone-in-ai-based-protein-structure-prediction/">its AlphaFold2 AI model</a> predicted the structure of proteins (a common and very difficult problem) so accurately that many declared the decades-old problem &#8220;solved.&#8221; Now researchers claim to have leapfrogged DeepMind the way DeepMind leapfrogged the rest of the world, with RoseTTAFold, a system that does nearly the same thing at a fraction of the computational cost. (Oh, and it&#8217;s free to use.)</p>
<p>AlphaFold2 has been the talk of the industry since November, when it blew away the competition at CASP14, a virtual competition between algorithms built to predict the physical structure of a protein given the sequence of amino acids that make it up. The model from DeepMind was so far ahead of the others, so highly and reliably accurate, that many in the field have talked (half-seriously and in good humor) about moving on to a new field.</p>
<p>But one aspect that seemed to satisfy no one was DeepMind&#8217;s plans for the system. It was not exhaustively and openly described, and some worried that the company (which is owned by Alphabet/Google) was planning on more or less keeping the secret sauce to themselves — which would be their prerogative but also somewhat against the ethos of mutual aid in the scientific world.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: In something of a surprise, DeepMind published more detailed methods <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2">in the journal Nature today</a>. The code is available <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold">on GitHub</a>. This does considerably lessen the aforementioned concern, but the advance described below is still highly relevant. I&#8217;ve also added a comment from that team at the bottom of the article.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Alphabet&#8217;s DeepMind achieves historic new milestone in AI-based protein structure prediction&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/alphabets-deepmind-achieves-historic-new-milestone-in-ai-based-protein-structure-prediction/embed/#?secret=hfpbOm04m6" data-secret="hfpbOm04m6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That concern seems to have been at least partly mooted by work from University of Washington researchers led by David Baker and Minkyung Baek, published in the latest issue of the journal Science. Baker, you may remember, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/3m-breakthrough-prize-goes-to-scientist-designing-molecules-to-could-fight-covid-19/">won a Breakthrough Prize</a> for his team&#8217;s work combating COVID-19 with engineered proteins.</p>
<p>The team&#8217;s new model, RoseTTAFold, makes predictions at similar accuracy levels using methods that Baker, responding to questions via email, candidly admitted were inspired by those used by AlphaFold2.</p>
<p>&#8220;The AlphaFold2 group presented several new high-level concepts at the CASP14 meeting. Starting from these ideas, and with a lot of collective brainstorming with colleagues in the group, Minkyung has been able to make amazing progress in very little time,&#8221; he said. (&#8220;She is amazing!&#8221; he added.)</p>

A score above 90 is considered extremely good. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> UW/Baek et al</p></div></p>
<p>Baker&#8217;s group more or less placed second at CASP14, no mean feat, but hearing DeepMind&#8217;s methods described even generally set them on a collision course. They developed a &#8220;three-track&#8221; neural network that simultaneously considered the amino acid sequence (one dimension), distances between residues (two dimensions) and coordinates in space (three dimensions). The implementation is beyond complex and far outside the scope of this article, but the result is a model that achieves almost the same accuracy levels — levels, it bears repeating, that were completely unprecedented less than a year ago.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, RoseTTAFold accomplishes this level of accuracy far more quickly — that is, using less computation power. As the paper puts it:</p>
<blockquote><p>DeepMind reported using several GPUs for days to make individual predictions, whereas our predictions are made in a single pass through the network in the same manner that would be used for a server&#8230;the end-to-end version of RoseTTAFold requires ~10 min on an RTX2080 GPU to generate backbone coordinates for proteins with less than 400 residues.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hear that? It&#8217;s the sound of thousands of microbiologists sighing in relief and discarding drafts of emails asking for supercomputer time. It may not be easy to lay one&#8217;s hands on a 2080 these days, but the point is any high-end desktop GPU can perform this task in minutes, instead of requiring a high-end cluster running for days.</p>
<p>The modest requirements make RoseTTAFold suitable for public hosting and distribution as well, something that might never have been in the cards for AlphaFold2.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a public server that anyone can submit protein sequences to and have the structures predicted,&#8221; Baker said. &#8220;There have been over 4,500 submissions since we put the server up a few weeks ago. We have also made the source code freely available.&#8221;</p>
<p>This may seem very niche, and it is, but protein folding has historically been one of the toughest problems in biology and one toward which countless hours of high-performance computing have been dedicated. You may recall Folding@Home, the popular distributed computing app that let people donate their computing cycles to attempting to predict protein structures. The kind of problem that might have taken a thousand computers days or weeks to do — essentially by brute-forcing solutions and checking for fit — now can be done in minutes on a single desktop.</p>
<p>The physical structure of proteins is of utmost importance in biology, as it is proteins that do the vast majority of tasks in our bodies, and proteins that must be modified, suppressed, enhanced and so on for therapeutic reasons; first, however, they need to be understood, and until November that understanding could not be reliably achieved computationally. At CASP14 it was proven to be possible, and now it has been made widely available.</p>
<p>It is not, by a long shot, a &#8220;solution&#8221; to the problem of protein folding, though the sentiment has been expressed. Most proteins at rest in neutral conditions can now have their structure predicted, and that has huge repercussions in multiple domains, but proteins are seldom found &#8220;at rest in neutral conditions.&#8221; They twist and contort to grab or release other molecules, to block or slip through gates and other proteins, and generally to do everything they do. These interactions are far more numerous, complex and difficult to predict, and neither AlphaFold2 nor RoseTTAFold can do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many exciting chapters ahead&#8230; the story is just beginning,&#8221; said Baker.</p>
<p>Regarding the DeepMind paper, Baker offered the following comment in the spirit of collegiate camaraderie:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve read through, and think this is a beautiful paper describing fantastic work.</p>
<p>The DeepMind paper is actually very complementary to our paper, and I think it is appropriate that it is not coming out after ours, as our work is really based on their advances.</p>
<p>I think that readers will enjoy reading both papers — they are very far from being duplicative. As we point out in our paper, their method is more accurate than ours, and now it will be very interesting to see what features of their approach are responsible for the remaining differences. We are already using RoseTTAFold for protein design and more systematic protein-protein complex structure prediction, and we are excited about rapidly improving these, along with traditional single chain modeling, by incorporating ideas from the DeepMind paper.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;re curious about the science and the potential repercussions, <a href="https://moalquraishi.wordpress.com/2020/12/08/alphafold2-casp14-it-feels-like-ones-child-has-left-home/">consider reading this much more detailed and technical account</a> of the methods and possible next steps written in the wake of AlphaFold2&#8217;s CASP14 performance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In our review last year, we called the Freewrite Traveler “outstanding, but expensive.” The latest version of Astrohaus’ distraction-free word processing hardware tool does little to address the latter concern. In fact, the Ernest Hemingway Freewrite Signature Edition comes in at a full $300 more than its predecessor.</p>
<p>But the latest edition of the hardware strives to be something more than just a utilitarian writing tool. In fact, Astrohaus secured the blessing from the Ernest Hemingway estate for the new version of a product that began life as the “Hemingwrite” for its 2014 Kickstarter campaign.</p>

<p>The product strives to live up to some of the ethos and/or aesthetics of &#8220;The Sun Also Rises&#8221; author. “Even though we changed the name to Freewrite in 2015, the original Hemingwrite concept is what captured the world’s attention,” co-founder and CEO Adam Leeb said in a release tied to the news. This time out, however, the company secured the family’s blessing.</p>

<p>The new version trades portability for aesthetic, with the inclusion of an attaché case that brings to mind both writers&#8217; tools of yore and, more recently, retro turntables from companies like Crosley. There were, of course, travel typewriters that came with their own carrying case, but the Freewrite’s significantly slimmer profile makes the setup far more compact.</p>

<p>Here’s Astrohaus’ write-up of the hardware [best read in a Ron Burgundy voice]:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Hemingwrite features an exclusive design with green keycaps and a hand-polished aluminum chassis that is uncoated and will develop a unique patina over time. Each unit is finished by hand &#8211; no two are exactly alike. Every Hemingwrite comes with a Hemingway monogramed cleaning cloth and an exclusive attaché case to safely store the device and elegantly transport it anywhere inspiration is found. The hard-sided Hemingwrite Attaché Case is crafted from rich cognac leather and a cream-colored velvet lining. A deep pocket is located inside to store books, pens, notebooks, or other pieces of writing inspiration.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Express is branching out into financial planning, with a little help from a seven-person startup called BodesWell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, the credit card giant launched a pilot of its first self-service digital financial planning tool, dubbed “My Financial Plan (MFP).” The six-month pilot kicked off on July 11 with about 25,000 select Amex cardmembers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Express quietly invested in BodesWell in late 2020 via its venture arm, Amex Ventures. Since then, the financial services behemoth teamed up with the tiny startup to develop the financial planning tool for its users. The new product is designed to give users a complete picture of their financial health and help them make and achieve major life goals, such as buying a house or retirement.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch talked with Amex Ventures’ Julia Huang, who led the investment and strategy around the new product, and BodesWell co-founder and CEO Matthew Bellows to learn more details.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair actually met while serving on a panel together in 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was drawn to the fact that it was not a round-up savings tool, but rather a holistic tool to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">understand your full financial picture that could be used to plan for the financial impact of your life decisions,” Huang told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before deciding to invest in BodesWell, Huang says Amex Ventures &#8212; which over time has backed more than 70 startups &#8212; had “evaluated the space quite extensively.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huang introduced Bellows and his staff to Amex’s Digital Labs team and they embarked on jointly developing a specialized offering for Amex customers. (While Bellow is based in Boston, he says the startup is “globally distributed.”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to democratize financial planning with our cardmembers by providing detailed insights and forecasts to help them with their holistic planning,” she told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178172" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178172" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2178172 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MFP-expenses.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="419" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MFP-expenses.jpg 3620w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MFP-expenses.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MFP-expenses.jpg?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MFP-expenses.jpg?resize=768,473 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MFP-expenses.jpg?resize=680,419 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MFP-expenses.jpg?resize=1536,945 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MFP-expenses.jpg?resize=2048,1260 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MFP-expenses.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178172" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Amex Ventures</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bellows started BodesWell in early 2019 with the goal of empowering clients and customers to build their own financial plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So much of financial planning software is aimed at financial advisors, and requires them to run it,” he said. “So, most people can’t get the benefits of financial planning&#8230;Our hope is to expand benefits to a lot more people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BodesWell will guide users in setting up a financial plan and will work even better if they sync with their other financial information via Plaid so it can “update in real time,” Huang said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tool “takes into account income, assets, expenses and liabilities &#8212; what cash flow looks like holistically so that users can drag &amp; drop to plan life events,” Bellow said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An estimated 85 million American households don’t have a financial, planner for a variety of reasons &#8212; including mistrust of a planner’s intentions or just feeling overwhelmed by the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The product is free during the pilot phase and American Express hasn’t yet determined if it will charge for it afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re gauging first for engagement and the power of the product for our customers,” Huang told TechCrunch. “We want to make sure the product resonates and that we iterate on the product to make sure it’s good for the broader population. Our primary goal is that our customers use it and find it valuable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amex Ventures has formed “some level of partnership” with more than two-thirds of its portfolio companies, she added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We try to engage with our portfolio in that way, to provide value with our startup ecosystem,” Huang said.</span></p>
<p>For its part, BodesWell had previously raised about $1.5 million from investors such as Cleo Capital, Ex Ventures, Riot.vc, GritCapital and Argon Capital and angels like HubSpot CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianhalligan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianhalligan/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626448853144000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFXPvXUtd-poQKbMwKiX1jEXA4Axg">Brian Halligan</a> and Kintent CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sravishsridhar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/sravishsridhar/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626448853144000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHB6o2j7LIb1gY7mzuLvwAC2oiTDg">Sravish Sridhar.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The General Services Administration has denied a senator&#8217;s request to review documents Zoom submitted to have its software approved for use in the federal government.</p>
<p>The denial was in response <a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/wyden-zoom-gsa.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to a letter</a> sent by Democratic senator Ron Wyden to the GSA in May, expressing concern that the agency cleared Zoom for use by federal agencies just weeks before a major security vulnerability was discovered in the app.</p>
<p>Wyden said the discovery of the bug raises &#8220;serious questions about the quality of FedRAMP’s audits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zoom was approved to operate in government in April 2019 after receiving its FedRAMP authorization, a program operated by the GSA that ensures cloud services comply with a standardized set of security requirements designed to toughen the service from some of the most common threats. Without this authorization, federal agencies cannot use cloud products or technologies that are not cleared.</p>
<p>Months later, Zoom was forced to patch its Mac app after a security researcher found <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/08/a-vulnerability-in-zooms-mac-client-could-allow-websites-to-turn-on-cameras-without-permission/">a flaw</a> that could be abused to remotely switch on a user&#8217;s webcam without their permission. Apple was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/apple-silent-update-zoom-app/">forced to intervene</a> since users were still affected by the vulnerabilities even after uninstalling Zoom. As the pandemic spread and lockdowns were enforced, Zoom&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/zooms-paid-usage-skyrockets-as-remote-work-takes-over/">popularity skyrocketed</a> — as did the scrutiny — including a technical analysis by reporters that found Zoom <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/31/zoom-meeting-encryption/">was not truly end-to-end encrypted</a> as the company long claimed.</p>
<p>Wyden wrote to the GSA to say he found it &#8220;extremely concerning&#8221; that the security bugs were discovered after Zoom’s clearance. In the letter, the senator requested the documents known as the &#8220;security package,&#8221; which Zoom submitted as part of the FedRAMP authorization process, to understand how and why the app was cleared by GSA.</p>
<p>The GSA declined Wyden&#8217;s first request in July 2020 on the grounds that he was not a committee chair. In the new Biden administration, Wyden was named chair of the Senate Finance Committee and requested Zoom&#8217;s security package again.</p>
<p>But in a new letter sent to Wyden&#8217;s office late last month, GSA declined the request for the second time, citing security concerns.</p>
<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
<blockquote><p>&#8220;GSA&#8217;s refusal to share the Zoom audit with Congress calls into question the security of the other software products that GSA has approved for federal use.&#8221; <cite>Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR)</cite></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>&#8220;The security package you have requested contains highly sensitive proprietary and other confidential information relating to the security associated with the Zoom for Government product. Safeguarding this information is critical to maintaining the integrity of the offering and any government data it hosts,&#8221; said the GSA letter. &#8220;Based on our review, GSA believes that disclosure of the Zoom security package would create significant security risks.&#8221;</p>
<p>In response to the GSA&#8217;s letter, Wyden told TechCrunch that he was concerned that other flawed software may have been approved for use across the government.</p>
<p>“The intent of GSA&#8217;s FedRAMP program is good — to eliminate red tape so that multiple federal agencies don’t have to review the security of the same software. But it’s vitally important that whichever agency conducts the review do so thoroughly,&#8221; said Wyden. &#8220;I’m concerned that the government’s audit of Zoom missed serious cybersecurity flaws that were subsequently uncovered and exposed by security researchers. GSA’s refusal to share the Zoom audit with Congress calls into question the security of the other software products that GSA has approved for federal use.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of the people we spoke with who have firsthand knowledge of the FedRAMP process, either as a government employee or as a company going through the certification, FedRAMP was described as a comprehensive but by no means an exhaustive list of checks that companies have to meet in order to meet the security requirements of the federal government.</p>
<p>Others said that the process had its limits and would benefit from reform. One person with knowledge of how FedRAMP works said the process was not a complete audit of a product&#8217;s source code but akin to a checklist of best practices and meeting compliance requirements. Much of it relies on trusting the vendor, said the person, describing it like &#8220;an honor system.&#8221; Another person said the FedRAMP process cannot catch every bug, as evidenced by executive action taken by President Biden this week aimed at <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">modernizing and improving the FedRAMP process</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the people we spoke to weren&#8217;t surprised that Wyden&#8217;s office was denied the request, citing the sensitivity of a company&#8217;s FedRAMP security package.</p>
<p>The people said that companies going through the certification process have to provide highly technical details about the security of their product, which if exposed would almost certainly be damaging to the company. Knowing where security weaknesses might be could tip off cybercriminals, one of the people said. Companies often spend millions on improving their security ahead of a FedRAMP audit but companies wouldn&#8217;t risk going through the certification if they thought their trade secrets would get leaked, they added.</p>
<p>When asked by GSA why it objected to Wyden&#8217;s request, Zoom&#8217;s head of U.S. government relations Lauren Belive argued that handing over the security package &#8220;would set a dangerous precedent that would undermine the special trust and confidence&#8221; that companies place in the FedRAMP process.</p>
<p>GSA puts strict controls on who can access a FedRAMP security package. You need a federal government or military email address, which the senator&#8217;s office has. But the reason for GSA denying Wyden&#8217;s request still isn&#8217;t clear, and when reached a GSA spokesperson would not explain how a member of Congress would obtain a company&#8217;s FedRAMP security package</p>
<p>&#8220;GSA values its relationship with Congress and will continue to work with Senator Wyden and our committees of jurisdiction to provide appropriate information regarding our programs and operations,&#8221; said GSA spokesperson Christina Wilkes, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>GSA works closely with private sector partners to provide a standardized approach to security authorizations for cloud services through the [FedRAMP]. Zoom’s FedRAMP security package and related documents provide detailed information regarding the security measures associated with the Zoom for Government product. GSA’s consistent practice with regard to sensitive security and trade secret information is to withhold the material absent an official written request of a congressional committee with jurisdiction, and pursuant to controls on further dissemination or publication of the information.</p></blockquote>
<p>GSA wouldn&#8217;t say which congressional committee had jurisdiction or whether Wyden&#8217;s role as chair of the Senate Finance Committee suffices, nor would the agency answer questions about the efficacy of the FedRAMP process raised by Wyden.</p>
<p>Zoom spokesperson Kelsey Knight said that cloud companies like Zoom &#8220;provide proprietary and confidential information to GSA as part of the FedRAMP authorization process with the understanding that it will be used only for their use in making authorization decisions. While we do not believe Zoom’s FedRAMP security package should be disclosed outside of this narrow purpose, we welcome conversations with lawmakers and other stakeholders about the security of Zoom for Government.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zoom said it has &#8220;engaged in security enhancements to continually improve its products,&#8221; and received FedRAMP reauthorization in 2020 and 2021 as part of its annual renewal. The company declined to say to what extent the Zoom app was audited as part of the FedRAMP process.</p>
<p>Over two dozen federal agencies use Zoom, including the Defense Department, Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Executive Office of the President.</p>
