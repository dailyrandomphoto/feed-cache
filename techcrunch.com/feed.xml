										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you’re interested in writing a post for TechCrunch or TechCrunch+, <a href="https://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1450095025233223683">please join the Twitter Space I’m hosting today </a>at 3 p.m. PDT/6 p.m. EDT.</p>
<p>I’ll explain our editorial guidelines, the editing process and most importantly, the criteria we use to determine whether a post creates value for readers.</p>
<p>This Space is not a forum for pitching an article — if you’d like to submit your post for consideration, please email <a href="mailto:guestcolumns@techcrunch.com">guestcolumns@techcrunch.com</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220406" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>In light of today’s chat, I’d thought it’d be useful to explain why we ran <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/how-our-startup-boosted-productivity-with-get-s-done-day/">this guest post by Travelpayouts head Ivan Baidin</a> touting the productivity gains created by introducing a GSSD program, aka “Getting S*** Done Day.”</p>
<p>One day every other week, Travelpayouts “employees define clear-cut goals and receive specific, usually non-trivial, tasks with little to no communication involved,” writes Baidin.</p>
<p>Getting S*** Done Day has allowed the team to address “sidelined” projects that may have seemed like small potatoes: rebuilding lifecycle emails, improving analytics and optimizing working hours.</p>
<p>Completing each of these “eternally postponed” tasks created incremental gains, says Baidin. “That is something we value a lot.”</p>
<p>This article contains strategic, actionable advice for implementing a GSDD program alongside the lessons the team learned as they identified problems with the experiment. It’s a classic TechCrunch+ “how-to.”</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading!</p>

<p>Our latest long-form look at a notable tech company examines Automattic, “the leading commercial complement to the open source WordPress publishing platform.”</p>
<p>At 16 years old, the company is growing into a major media player: Its purchase of Tumblr expanded its reach into social media, and WooCommerce, its open-source e-commerce plugin for WordPress users, integrates with POS systems in the real world.</p>
<p>Broken into four parts, this series examines Automattic from multiple angles:</p>
<p>Part 1: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-origin/">How doing everything wrong turned Automattic into a multibillion dollar media powerhouse</a> (origin story)</p>
<p>Part 2: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-developers/">There’s nothing Automattic about balancing commercial growth with an open source developer community</a> (open source development)</p>
<p>Part 3: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-acquisitions/">Can social and e-commerce transform the future of the open web?</a> (acquisitions and future strategy)</p>

<p>With budgets that go into the millions, video games are no small business. And the fast-growing mobile gaming sector is shaping up to be an even more lucrative market.</p>
<p>That’s especially true in the massive mobile game market in China, but the country’s strict regulatory requirements have given pause to international game developers looking to enter.</p>
<p>But there’s a lot to learn from how Chinese publishers have navigated the regulatory environment, writes Jeff Sue, GM of Americas at mobile ad platform Mintegral.</p>
<p>Sue dives deep into the Chinese mobile gaming sector in a TechCrunch+ guest post, outlining how global publishers can successfully advertise and capture market share in China by pursuing local partnerships, focusing on smaller, emerging Chinese cities and studying emerging social media trends.</p>

<h2>Deep tech startups in need of funding should consider federal grants</h2>

<p>So far, 2021 seems like a golden era for raising startup funding, but deep tech startups still face challenges, as few VCs have the patience or risk appetite to experiment — or wait for their investment to show returns.</p>
<p>However, deep tech startups have one source of capital that can also impart a fair amount of prestige, according to CoCoPie co-founder and CTO, Xipeng Shen: Federal grants.</p>
<p>“Being selected out of thousands of U.S. applicants signals that your innovation has strong technical and commercial merit and the potential for broad U.S. economic impact,” he writes.</p>
<p>In a detailed post, Shen outlines the process they followed for acceptance into the Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) program, noting that his company is using the funding tactically “to convert our technology into a minimum viable product.”</p>

<p>Latin America is very quickly becoming a hotbed for fintech startups, and VCs, savvy or not, are rushing to invest.</p>
<p>There are a plethora of factors driving this growth, but one important focus of tech seems to be at the heart of the innovation here: APIs built around open banking.</p>
<p>In a traditionally restrictive banking environment, startups like Nubank and Rebaja Tus Cuentas are revolutionizing banking and financial services, and their efforts can be compounded by the use of open banking APIs, according to Ximena Aleman, co-founder and chief business development officer at Prometeo.</p>
<p>“An open API ecosystem, in which third-party service providers access consumer data from financial institutions, means financial services will be optimized to lower costs and time spent on transactions and improve user experience,” she writes in a TechCrunch+ guest post.</p>

<p>E-bikes just exploded in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic, and no U.S. company in the sector has raised a bigger funding round than Rad Power Bikes’ $150 million raise this year.</p>
<p>Pockets full of cash, the direct-to-consumer company is looking to expand its international presence and scale aggressively while keeping its focus on the one thing that has helped it grow so far: “Being user-friendly,” says founder Mike Radenbaugh.</p>
<p>In a free-wheeling interview with Rebecca Bellan, Radenbaugh talked about the e-bike revolution, diversifying the supply chain, and if the boom in e-bike sales will last.</p>

<p>The entire startup ecosystem gets downright jittery when China brings any new regulation into force — their livelihoods depend on it, after all.</p>
<p>But it seems there’s no slowing the thrust of VC investment in China. As Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim found out this morning, the third quarter of 2021 has by far been the best ever for Chinese startups.</p>
<p>“Will future regulatory activity by the Chinese government manage to impact startup investing in the future? We do not know. But investors are laying bets like they do, which is worth noting.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Buried deep in President Joe Biden’s 2021 tax plan are new amendments to the United States’ <a href="https://www.sba.gov/blog/qualified-small-business-stock-what-it-how-use-it">Qualified Small Business Stock</a> (QSBS) program, which, if passed, will directly impact early-stage startup employees, founders and investors.</p>
<p>Lawmakers say the proposed changes to QSBS are designed to raise taxes on America’s millionaires and billionaires. But the net they’re casting is so wide that it will undoubtedly catch rank-and-file startup employees, who can easily (and temporarily) find themselves pushed into the country’s top tax bracket if they exercise stock options or sell their shares.</p>
<p>Congress should immediately reconsider these changes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220183" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We fear that these unintended consequences could choke innovation and harm a small group of people while raising what will amount to a rounding error’s worth of new tax revenue for the federal government.</p>
<p>If you’ve exercised stock options in an early-stage startup at any point in the last five years, the proposed QSBS change may affect you when you decide to sell your shares in an exit. You might even be holding QSBS-qualifying stock without even knowing it.</p>
<p>Lawmakers want to reduce the QSBS gain exclusion rates to 50% for people who report more than $400,000 in adjusted gross income in a single year, and trusts and estates holding QSBS shares.</p>
<p>The QSBS exemption was initially enacted in 1993 as a tax incentive for small business owners, their investors and early employees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Most technology startups begin life as QSBS-qualifying companies, and there can be significant tax benefits to founders, early-stage investors and early employees if they earn or exercise stock options during a startup’s earliest years.</p>
<p>For example, let’s imagine an engineer who joins a seed-stage software startup and is granted 200,000 stock options at $1 per share. The engineer exercises their stock options early, while the company has raised less than $50 million in venture capital.</p>
<p>Six years later, the startup gets acquired, and the engineer’s 200,000 shares are now worth $10 million.</p>
<p>Under current tax law, the engineer would be able to avoid paying an estimated $2.3 million in federal capital gains taxes under the QSBS exemption — $1.96 million in long-term capital gains (20%), and $372,400 in Net Investment Income Tax (3.8%).</p>
<p>Under the proposed changes to the tax code, the engineer would only be able to exclude federal capital gains taxes on half of their profits using the QSBS exemption.</p>
<p>The remaining $5 million would face taxes of nearly $1.6 million — $1.25 million in long-term capital gains (25% under the current proposal), $190,000 in Net Investment Income Tax (3.8%) and $150,000 of a newly proposed high-income surcharge tax.</p>
<p>Congress says they’re targeting America’s wealthiest people by rolling back the QSBS exemption.</p>
<p>In practice, the QSBS exemption has been popular with startup founders, investors and startup employees — people who take significant financial risks to fuel the startup ecosystem. QSBS was originally designed to reward those of us who drive the country’s innovation engine.</p>
<p>Effectively chopping this tax exemption in half will needlessly choke the innovation ecosystem, while raising an estimated average of<a href="https://www.qsbsexpert.com/joint-committee-on-taxation-estimates-revenue-gained-by-slashed-qsbs-exclusion/"> $570 million</a> per year in new tax revenue over the next decade, according to an analysis of federal data by QSBS Expert. That’s an inconsequential amount compared to the nation’s $3.5 trillion infrastructure plan.</p>
<p>The result will be a slight uptick in new federal revenue, taken from a relatively small group of people working in the innovation economy, and not worth the potential damage to startups. The QSBS exemption must be protected.</p>
<p><em>(Note: QSBS only applies to a specific set of small businesses and startups and requires people to earn or exercise their stock options while the company is still relatively small, and hold onto their shares for at least five years before selling them. Work with a CPA to find out if your shares qualify.)</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snap <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/introducing-arcadia">announced</a> on Tuesday that it’s launching a global creative studio to help brands develop augmented reality (AR) advertising and experiences. The new studio is called ‘<a href="https://www.arcadiacreativestudio.com/">Arcadia</a>’ and aims to help companies develop experiences that can be used across web platforms and app-based AR environments.</p>
<p>The studio will partner with brands and creators to engage with Snapchat’s millennial and Gen Z audience. Arcadia has already partnered with numerous companies, including Verizon, WWE, Shake Shack and P&amp;G Beauty.</p>
<p>Arcadia will function as a division of Snap and have the creative freedom to operate independently and help brands create AR experiences not just for Snapchat but for other social media platforms as well. Snap outlines that Arcadia will serve brands and creators in various ways that align with their goals. For instance, Arcadia can take on all of a brand’s AR production or simply offer AR strategy expertise to clients in the form of workshops and trend reporting.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220417" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Arcadia delivers a compelling solution for brands and agencies who understand the immediate value of developing world-class AR experiences, rooted in craft, technology and customer experience,” said Jeff Miller, the global head of creative strategy at Snap, in a statement. “With the launch of Arcadia, Snap Inc. is further investing in an AR ecosystem, backed by partners, creators and tools, that drives full-funnel results for businesses across the globe”</p>
<p>Snap has been leveraging AR capabilities across Snapchat in several different ways over the past few years. Its first popular foray into the technology gave users the ability to add filters, such as dog ears, on top of their photos and videos. The company later expanded this by letting users add their animated Bitmoji characters to their videos.</p>
<p>More recently, Snap announced several updates to its developer tools and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-emphasizes-commerce-in-updates-to-its-camera-and-ar-platforms/">AR-focused Lens Studio</a>, many of which are focused on bringing shopping deeper into the Snapchat experience. The company also announced a new generation of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-announces-its-latest-generation-of-its-spectacles-a-streamlined-device-for-experience-the-world-in-ar/">AR-capable Spectacles</a> in May. The fourth generation of the glasses will operate 30 minutes at a time, feature dual 3D waveguide displays and a 26.3-degree diagonal field of view.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s plenty of frustration in the world of startups over when a digital asset does and does not constitute a security in the eyes of the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Where many see regulatory murkiness, the five-year-old, New York-based investing platform <a href="https://republic.co/">Republic </a>sees opportunity. Indeed, while many outfits grapple with whether to distance themselves from certain digital assets, Republic &#8212; whose CEO, Kendrick Nguyen, started his career in securities litigation with Goodwin Procter &#8212; has focused from the start on establishing itself as a go-to brand for what Nguyen calls &#8220;compliant tokenization.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, the company is hinting at big ambitions to expand on what it has already built to create, potentially, a compliance-focused marketplace for straight-up digital securities to be bought and sold, and resold.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219742" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As Nguyen told us during a call late last week, &#8220;Within the United States, none of these major exchange deal with digital security tokens,&#8221; meaning tokens that derive their value from an external, tradable asset like real estate versus utility tokens that offer a right to use a product or service.</p>
<p>For example, it&#8217;s because the SEC has made it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/21/technology/ripple-cryptocurrency-sec-lawsuit.html">very plain</a> that it sees XRP, a native cryptocurrency developed by Ripple Labs, as a security, that exchanges like Coinbase don&#8217;t list it for sale.</p>
<p>Nguyen said Republic would be willing to &#8220;partner right now&#8221; with an exchange &#8220;that is capable, that delivers good customer service, and that can facilitate secondary active trading of securities and digital securities&#8221; in the U.S. But it doesn&#8217;t exist, he maintains, and &#8220;if in another year, we do not see a solution out there,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;Republic will look to invest or build directly through an affiliate, a secondary exchange for digital securities.&#8221;</p>
<p>It would be the among the most ambitious in a growing list of products that Republic oversees and that have attracted more than one million users &#8212; along with some serious financing backing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Just today, the company is announcing a $150 million Series B round led by Valor Equity Partners, which follows a $36 million Series A round that the company announced in March from Galaxy Interactive, Motley Fool Ventures, HOF Capital, Tribe Capital, and CoinFund. (Those earlier investors just re-upped, by the way, and were joined by new backers Pillar VC, Brevan Howard, GoldenTree, and Atreides.)</p>
<p>Altogether, says Nguyen, Republic, which employs 200 people, had raised more than $50 million in equity financing ahead of this newest round, and more than $20 million in a token sale.</p>
<p>The outfit is certainly busy putting it all to work. Republic already comprises several different business arms, including a popular retail investment platform that invites people to invest with as little as $10; a private capital division with almost $1 billion in assets under management that funnels accredited investors into startups; and a blockchain consultancy arm that provides technical, financing, distribution, and tokenization services.</p>
<p>Republic also right now has two affiliated closed-end investment funds deploying capital into startups and crypto projects, along with a digital investment arm operating as Republic Realm that focuses exclusively on metaverses and NFTs.</p>
<p>Asked how Republic manages it all, Nguyen says &#8220;not to think of it as different platforms&#8221; but a company that can cater to everyone, no matter their interests or bank account balance. &#8220;If you&#8217;re a multimillionaire coming to Republic and it&#8217;s not worth your time to make a $100 investment but you want to deploy $100,000, we have those to present to you. If you&#8217;re 20 years old, and you want to invest $20 in a video game or in real estate or in a female founder, we have those opportunities, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea is to cater to the &#8220;entire population,&#8221; he says, and in addition to the technical capabilities it has built up, one guiding principle helps, he suggests. That&#8217;s Republic&#8217;s firm belief that &#8220;most tokens, including in the DeFi and NFT space, are securities.&#8221; As a result, &#8220;everything that Republic does, everything we touch, we treat them as securities by and large and fit them under the existing framework of U.S securities law.&#8221;</p>
<p>If other investment platforms want to push back on the SEC, that&#8217;s certainly their prerogative. In the meantime, Nguyen says that at Republic, &#8220;We&#8217;re not looking for new rules and regulations to do what we do. What we do is based on existing law, on firm legal foundation.&#8221;</p>

The latter is some AI-powered post-processing magic &#8211; powered by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/?p=2220294&amp;preview=true">Google&#8217;s brand new Tensor chip</a> &#8211;  aiming to make faces with all skin tones show up as well as possible.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re taking selfies or someone-elsies, the vast majority of photos taken with a smartphone are of human beings. Traditionally, it has been extremely hard to get the exposure to look good for photos where multiple faces appear in the photo &#8212; especially if the faces all have different skin tones. The new Pixel 6 brings a layer of computational photography to the mix to ensure that everyone who appears in the photo looks as good as they can. The Pixel team worked with a diverse set of expert image-makers and photographers to tune the white balance, exposure and algorithms. They claim that this ensures that the photos work for everyone, of every skin tone.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/image-equity-real-tone-pixel-6-photos/">Google highlights that it sees Real Tone as a mission and an improvement on its camera systems</a>, rather than a conclusive solution to the challenges facing photographers. The company has invested substantial resources into ensuring that all people &#8212; and particularly people of color &#8212; are better represented in the way cameras capture their faces.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219795" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;My mother is a dark-skinned Black woman, my father is a white German. My whole life there&#8217;s been a question: How do we get one picture where everyone looks good,&#8221; said Florian Koenigsberger, Advanced Photography product marketing manager for the Android team, in a briefing interview ahead of the release of the new phones. &#8220;The new camera is a step along the journey. Google&#8217;s diversity numbers are not a mystery to the world, and we knew we definitely had some shortcomings in terms of lived experience and who could speak authentically to this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The camera team worked with photographers, colorists, cinematographers, direc1tors of photography and directors to get a deeper understanding of the challenges in lighting and capturing a diverse set of skin tones &#8212; and in particular people with darker skin tones. Among others, the team leaned on the experience from a broad spectrum of professionals, including Insecure&#8217;s director of photography <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2610382">Ava Berkofsky</a>, photographer <a href="https://www.joshuakissi.com/">Joshua Kissi</a>, and cinematographer <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0446579/">Kira Kelly. </a></p>
<p>&#8220;We focused on bringing this really diverse set of perspectives, not just in terms of ethnicity and skin tones, but also a variety of practices,&#8221; said Koenigsberger. &#8220;The colorists were actually some of the most interesting people to talk to because they think of this as a science that happens in the process of creating images.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Google product team worked with these imaging experts to give them cameras and challenged them to shoot extremely challenging imaging situations, including mixed light sources, back-lighting, interiors, multiple skin tones in one image, etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We had to learn where things fall apart, especially for these communities, and from there we can figure out what direction we can take from there,&#8221; Koenigsberger explains. &#8220;The imaging professionals were very frank, and they were directly in the room with our engineers. I helped facilitate these conversations, and it was fascinating to see not just the technical learnings, but also the cultural learning that happened in this space. I am talking about ashiness, darker skin tones, textures. The nuances for mid-tones can vary.&#8221;</p>
<p>The process starts with the camera&#8217;s facial detection algorithms. Once the camera knows it is looking at a face, it can start figuring out how to render the image in a way that works well. In testing across devices, Google&#8217;s team found that the Pixel 6 consistently performed better than those from competing manufacturers, and even the older-generation Pixel phones.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t immediately clear how the feature works in practice, and whether it does global edits (i.e. applies the same filter across the entire image), or whether the AI edits individual faces as part of its editing pass. We are hoping to take a deeper look at this specific aspect of the camera functionality to see how it works in practice very soon.</p>
<p>The camera team highlights that the work done in this space means that the training sets for creating the camera algorithms are more diverse by a factor of 25. The Real Tone feature is a core part of the camera algorithms, and it cannot be turned off or disabled.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google&#8217;s latest flagship phones have an impressive set of automated, AI-powered tools to help make your photos look better, with smart blurs, object removal, and skin tone exposure. While we&#8217;ll have to test them out to see if they work as advertised, they could be useful for everyone from pixel peepers to casual snapshot takers.</p>
<p>The new cameras themselves are pretty impressive to start with. The main rear camera, shared by the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, is a 50-megapixel beast with decent-sized pixel wells and an F/1.85 equivalent aperture (no, it doesn&#8217;t capture as much light as an F/1.8 on a DSLR, but it&#8217;s still good). The ultrawide one, also shared, is 12 megapixels and f/2.2 on a smaller sensor, so don&#8217;t expect mind-blowing image quality. The 6 Pro gets a 48-megapixel telephoto with less low light capability but a 4x equivalent zoom. They&#8217;re all stabilized and have laser-assisted autofocus.</p>
<p>Basically if you want the best quality in any situation, stick to the main camera, but if you&#8217;re sure about your light go ahead and fire up the wide or zoom. It sounds like all the new camera features work on all the cameras, but generally speaking the better the shot to start with, the better the final result.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219792" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The simplest tool to use is probably &#8220;face deblur.&#8221; How many times have you gotten the perfect shot but it&#8217;s not quite sharp? The Pixel Camera will automatically always capture multiple exposures (it&#8217;s part of the ordinary process of taking a picture now), and combines the main shot from one camera with a clear shot of the face captured with another. To do it, you just tap on a shot in your gallery that isn&#8217;t quite sharp and if there&#8217;s a &#8220;face deblur&#8221; option: boom.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219819" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-deblur.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219819" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2219819" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-deblur.jpg" alt="Comparison of two images, a blurry one and one where the face is sharpened." width="1024" height="530" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-deblur.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-deblur.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-deblur.jpg?resize=300,155 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-deblur.jpg?resize=768,397 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-deblur.jpg?resize=680,352 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-deblur.jpg?resize=1536,794 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-deblur.jpg?resize=2048,1059 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-deblur.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2219819" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>OK, it&#8217;s definitely kind of weird to have only the face sharp in a blurry photo, as you can see in the sample, but look: do you want the picture or not? Thought so.</p>
<p>Also in the blur department are two new &#8220;motion modes.&#8221; One is an &#8220;action pan&#8221; that assists in capturing a moving subject like a passing car clearly, while blurring the background &#8220;creatively.&#8221; That means it applies a directed zoom blur instead of the handheld blur it would normally have, so it looks a little &#8216;shoppy, if you will, but it&#8217;s a fun option. The other one is a long exposure helper that adds blur to moving subjects while keeping the background clear. Helpful for doing something like headlight streaks without a tripod. These will be found in their own motion mode area in the camera app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219826" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-magic-eraser.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219826" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2219826" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-magic-eraser.jpg" alt="An image on the beach before using 'magic eraser' and after, with background people removed." width="1024" height="380" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-magic-eraser.jpg 1816w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-magic-eraser.jpg?resize=150,56 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-magic-eraser.jpg?resize=300,111 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-magic-eraser.jpg?resize=768,285 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-magic-eraser.jpg?resize=680,252 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-magic-eraser.jpg?resize=1536,570 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-magic-eraser.jpg?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2219826" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Magic Eraser&#8221; is the most obviously &#8220;AI&#8221; thing here. If you take a picture and it&#8217;s great except someone just walked into the background or there&#8217;s a car parked in the scenic vista, it&#8217;ll help you zap those pesky real-world objects so you can forget they ever existed. Tap the tool and it&#8217;ll automatically highlight things you might want to remove, like distant people, cars, and according to the example they provided, even unsightly logs and other random features. Driftwood, though, on the beach&#8230;really? Fortunately you can pick which to throw in the memory hole, no pressure, or circle unrecognized objects and it will do its best to dispose of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speech Enhancement&#8221; isn&#8217;t for images, obviously, but when you&#8217;re in front camera mode you can opt to have the device tone down the ambient noise and focus on your voice. Basically <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/krisp-nearly-triples-fundraise-with-9m-expansion-after-blockbuster-2020/">Krisp</a> by Google. If it works anywhere near as well you will probably want to use it all the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Real Tone&#8221; is an interesting but potentially fraught feature that we&#8217;ll be looking into in more detail soon. Here&#8217;s how Google describes it: &#8220;We worked with a diverse set of expert image makers and photographers to tune our AWB [auto white balance], AE [auto exposure], and stray light algorithms to ensure that Google’s camera and imagery products work for everyone, of every skin tone.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219838" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-real-tone.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219838" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2219838" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-real-tone.jpg" alt="Photo of a family with dark skin sitting on the beach." width="1024" height="702" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-real-tone.jpg 2004w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-real-tone.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-real-tone.jpg?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-real-tone.jpg?resize=768,527 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-real-tone.jpg?resize=680,466 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-real-tone.jpg?resize=1536,1053 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-real-tone.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2219838" class="wp-caption-text">They look great, sure&#8230; but they&#8217;re models.</p></div></p>
<p>Basically they wanted to make sure that their &#8220;smart&#8221; camera&#8217;s core features don&#8217;t work better or look better on certain skin tones than others. This has happened many, many times before and it&#8217;s an insult and embarrassment when billion-dollar companies blow it over and over. Hopefully Real Tone works, but even if it does there is the fundamental question of whether it amounts to lightening or darkening someone&#8217;s skin in the photo — a sensitive matter for many people. &#8220;This feature cannot be turned off nor disabled,&#8221; Google says, so they must be confident. We&#8217;ll be testing this and talking with developers and photographers about the feature, so look for a deeper dive into this interesting but complex corner of the field.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With Android 12, <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/worldwide">the world&#8217;s most-used mobile operating system</a> continues its steady march of carving out its unique selling points and finding differentiators from Apple&#8217;s iOS. Available for Pixel 3 and beyond, the new OS beefs up some of the strengths in the operating system, while adding some new features along the way.</p>
<p>When everyone has a phone that looks essentially like every other smartphone ever made, personalization becomes more important. That&#8217;s why Google brings the Material You feature to the OS &#8211; when you change your wallpaper, the entire Android 12 experience changes to match its colors. The OS includes color extraction algorithms which helps everything looks integrated and slick. Everything is personalizable, including the lockscreen, notifications, settings, widgets and even apps. Material You comes to Pixel first, and will be rolled out to devices from other device makers further down the line.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220425" style="width: 655px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220425" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2220425 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/you.png?w=645" alt="" width="645" height="307" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/you.png 645w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/you.png?resize=150,71 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/you.png?resize=300,143 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/you.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220425" class="wp-caption-text">Fully customizable OS makes your phone look more&#8230; you.</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220404" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Security and privacy are other themes across the OS. For example, Android 12 enables you to keep your precise location private from apps that, strictly, only need an approximate location to work their magic. You can also see when an app is using your mic or camera, with a new status-bar indicator. And if you want to turn off your camera and mic across the entire OS, you can turn them off in the Quick Settings with a pair of new toggles. The OS also adds additional features to lock down apps you&#8217;ve forgotten about, by automatically revoking permissions from apps after several months of lack of use.</p>
<p>The OS also finally divorces the connection between location and Bluetooth. As Google puts it: &#8220;While your wireless headphones need to connect to your phone, they probably don’t need to know where you are.&#8221; Android 12 makes that possible at long last.</p>
<p>Google introduced a ton of new Android features for Google Lens in previous releases of the OS &#8211; you can do optical character recognition on any screen shot, for example. Android 12 adds additional extensions to that functionality, such as &#8216;scrolling screen shots.&#8221; Just because you reach the end of your screen doesn’t mean you need to reach the end of your screenshot. New scrolling screenshots will allow you to capture all the content on the page in one image. Clever!</p>
<p>The new features extend beyond functionality; Android 12 also brings power-saving and better accessibility features. The company is also rolling out hot-updates, so you can keep using an app even while an update for the very same app is downloading and installing in the background. God forbid you&#8217;d have to put down Pokemon Go for a couple of minutes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alongside the launch of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/google-pixel-event-2021/">new Google Pixel 6 smartphones</a>, the company also introduced a new way to purchase them: Pixel Pass. This all-in-one subscription service allows consumers to purchase a Pixel phone for a low monthly price, rather than paying for it all upfront. The service is available $45 per month for the Pixel 6 and $55 per month for the Pixel 6 Pro  &#8212; but it doesn&#8217;t just provide access to the phones themselves. Also included with the subscription are Google&#8217;s services, like storage, music, YouTube Premium, and free apps and games.</p>
<p>Specifically, subscribers will have access to ad-free YouTube, aka <a href="https://www.youtube.com/premium">YouTube Premium</a>, typically $11.99 per month. This includes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/premium">YouTube Music Premium</a>, the company&#8217;s answer to Spotify and Apple Music, and its replacement for Google Play Music, which was wound down.</p>
<p>Pixel Pass subscribers will also get 200 GB of cloud storage with Google One, Google Store discounts, and <a href="https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/play-pass/">Google Play Pass</a> &#8212; the otherwise $4.99 USD per month or $29.99 per year subscription, which offers a free selection of apps and games without in-app purchase or ads, similar to Apple Arcade.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220403" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The subscription additionally includes insurance, with Preferred Care coverage for hassle-free repairs and &#8220;life&#8217;s little accidents,&#8221; says Google. This is Google&#8217;s version of something like AppleCare for Apple devices.</p>
<p>The Pixel devices that ship with Pixel Pass are unlocked so they work with all major carriers.</p>
<p>Consumers can buy the service through the <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_pass?utm_source=gblog&amp;utm_medium=google_oo&amp;utm_campaign=GS106917" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://store.google.com/product/pixel_pass?utm_source=gblog&amp;utm_medium=google_oo&amp;utm_campaign=GS106917&quot;}">Google Store</a> or with a phone plan on <a href="https://fi.google.com/about/pixel-pass?utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_source=google_blog&amp;utm_campaign=pixelpass&amp;utm_content=20211019_pixel-pass" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://fi.google.com/about/pixel-pass?utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_source=google_blog&amp;utm_campaign=pixelpass&amp;utm_content=20211019_pixel-pass&quot;}">Google Fi</a>, the company&#8217;s own cell service, Google says.</p>
<p>By paying for Pixel Pass as a subscription, device owners would save up to $294 over the course of two years, Google notes. But if they purchase through Google Fi, you&#8217;ll also save an additional $4 off your monthly Fi plan, equalling $414 in savings over the two years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The subscription is designed for regular updaters who like to always carry the latest devices, but also want access to premium services. It&#8217;s clearly aimed to be the Google alternative to Apple&#8217;s own iPhone subscription plan, via the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/iphone/iphone-upgrade-program">iPhone Upgrade Program.</a> But while Apple offers its own set of subscription services separately through its<a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-one/"> newer Apple One subscription plans</a>, the Pixel Pass bundles them in.</p>
<p>The new <a href="http://g.co/pixelpass/tos">Pixel Pass</a> with Pixel 6 is available for pre-order today in the U.S. starting at $45 per month on the <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_pass?utm_source=gblog&amp;utm_medium=google_oo&amp;utm_campaign=GS106917">Google Store</a> or via <a href="https://fi.google.com/about/pixel-pass?utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_source=google_blog&amp;utm_campaign=pixelpass&amp;utm_content=20211019_pixel-pass">Google Fi.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s ever been a phone we knew more about before its official launch than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/google-revamps-its-smartphone-line-with-the-pixel-6/">Google&#8217;s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro</a>. But in a world of samey Android phones, Google made some interesting choices, especially with regards to the chips that power it all. For the first time, Google now offers a phone that is powered by an SoC of its own design.</p>
<p>Dubbed Tensor, Google first <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-tensor-debuts-new-pixel-6-fall/">talked about it</a> earlier this summer. It&#8217;s what powers all of the on-device AI smarts of the phone. It&#8217;s basically Google&#8217;s own AI/ML accelerator, coupled with relatively off-the-shelf Arm CPU and GPU cores, as well as Google&#8217;s new Titan 2 security core.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220409" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tensor_4K_002_1.max-1000x1000-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220409" class="size-full wp-image-2220409" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tensor_4K_002_1.max-1000x1000-1.png" alt="" width="1024" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2220409" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220294" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Google promises that Tensor will offer up to 80% faster performance than the chips that powered the Pixel 5, which, to be fair, was more of a mid-range phone but still feels perfectly smooth in everyday use. Leaked benchmarks ahead of today&#8217;s launch put it on par with modern Snapdragon mobile chips from Qualcomm &#8211; but those don&#8217;t include Google&#8217;s own AI/ML cores and the role these specialized cores play in making the Pixel 6 cameras and their complex computational photography feel snappy can&#8217;t really be captured in a standard benchmark.</p>
<p>What we do know from these early leaks, though, is that Tensor is powered by two Arm Cortex-X1 chips, Arm&#8217;s flagship performance-oriented mobile designs. In comparison, the Snapdragon 888 only features one of those. As usual in modern SoCs, there are also some lower-performance, battery-saving cores. Rumor has it, these are a mix of older A76-based cores and the more recent ultra-efficient A55 ones (all of which help to get the Pixel 6 to a promised 24-hour battery life). Google itself has remained perfectly quiet about those details, which makes sense, given that the company wants to put the full focus on the system&#8217;s AI capabilities.</p>
<p>The chip also features a low-power AI &#8216;Context Hub&#8217; that powers some of the always-on machine-learning features on the phone.</p>
<p>And indeed, throughout today&#8217;s announcement, Google&#8217;s Rick Osterloh stressed these AI experiences, ranging from live translations to the phone&#8217;s photo and video capabilities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;With Google Tensor, we’re unlocking amazing new experiences that require state of the art ML — including Motion Mode, Face Unblur, Speech enhancement mode for videos and applying HDRnet to videos,&#8221; Google&#8217;s senior director for Google Silicon, Monika Gupta, writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;Google Tensor allows us to push the limits of helpfulness in a smartphone, taking it from a one-size-fits-all piece of hardware into a device that’s intelligent enough to respect and accommodate the different ways we use our phones.&#8221;</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s event, she also noted that the chip has been in the works for the last few years. She noted that all of the design choices the team made were based on making those AI features work best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/youtube-to-pilot-test-shopping-from-livestreams-with-select-creators/">announced</a> earlier this year it would begin pilot testing livestream shopping with a handful of select creators. Now, the company is ready for a larger test of its live shopping platform with plans to host a week-long live shopping event, &#8220;YouTube Holiday Stream and Shop,&#8221; starting on November 15. The event will allow viewers to shop new products, unlock limited-time offers, and engage with creators and other viewers via Q&amp;As and polls, the company says.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The company first <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/neal-innovation-series/">unveiled</a> its plans to invest in live shopping at the beginning of 2021, as part of a larger initiative around integrated shopping on YouTube. The initial tests had been focused on videos on demand before the livestream pilot <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/youtube-to-pilot-test-shopping-from-livestreams-with-select-creators/">kicked off this summer</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Since then, a number of YouTube creators have tried out livestream shopping with their fans, including </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/simplynailogical">Simply Nailogical,</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> who launched her </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7dllNiRQpQ">nail polish collection</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to 2.8 million fans on her </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnaXc7HBuxqyP5fwOTH58FQ">Simply Not </a><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnaXc7HBuxqyP5fwOTH58FQ">Logical channel</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">; </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Hyram">Hyram</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, who launched his ‘</span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLhd3fu9-2s">Selfless’ skincare line</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to his 4.5 million fans; and </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RavenElyseTV">Raven Elyse</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> who ran a livestream shopping session where she sold products in partnership with Walmart. (Walmart had earlier experimented with live shopping on TikTok across <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/walmart-to-host-a-new-live-stream-shopping-event-on-tiktok-following-successful-pilot/">multiple</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/">events</a>.)</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220242" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A7dllNiRQpQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Other retailers also participated more directly, YouTube notes. </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx6Wixw7HXo&amp;t=905s">Sephora hosted a live Q&amp;A</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uNY4bllvAU&amp;t=139s">Target ran a live style haul</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> using the new features, for example. </span></p>
<p>The upcoming Stream and Shop event, which kicks off with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/merrelltwins" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/c/merrelltwins&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634656696941000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEcKqdC0MmjgSp7KpqZsxNXipSXHw">Merrell Twins</a>, will also feature products from top retailers including Walmart, Samsung, and Verizon.</p>
<p>As part of its panel at Advertising Week, the company shared a few details from the research it has invested in to better understand the live shopping journey and how YouTube plays a role. In partnership with Publicis and TalkShoppe, YouTube study&#8217;s found that 75% of viewers used YouTube for shopping inspiration &#8212; for instance, by watching creators&#8217; #ShopWithMe videos. It also found that 85% of viewers trust creators&#8217; recommendations and that viewers valued information quality and quantity over the production value of the videos.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite the steps it&#8217;s been making towards live stream shopping, YouTube hasn&#8217;t yet made the feature broadly available. Instead, it&#8217;s continuing to test live shopping with individual creators.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, rival TikTok has moved forward with live shopping features of its own.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, TikTok began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/tiktok-expands-shopify-partnership-pilots-tiktok-shopping-in-us-uk-and-canada/">piloting</a> TikTok Shopping in the U.S., U.K. and Canada, in partnership with Shopify. At an event last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tiktok-shopping-expands-with-more-partnerships-live-shopping-new-ads-and-more/">the company said it was expanding</a> shopping with new partners Square, Ecwid, PrestaShop, Wix, SHOPLINE, OpenCart and BASE. It <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/enter-tiktok-world-and-meet-the-next-era-of-marketing">also introduced a suite of solutions and features</a> under the brand TikTok Shopping, which includes ways to integrate products into videos, ads, and LIVE shopping support.</p>
<p>Facebook also ran its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/facebook-debuts-live-shopping-fridays-featuring-beauty-fashion-and-skincare-brands/">own series of live shopping events</a> this spring and summer, and now offers dedicated live shopping sections inside both its Facebook and Instagram apps&#8217; Shop sections.</p>
<p>YouTube plans to share more about its upcoming live shopping event as the date grows closer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">May of 2020 marked the end of an era for the Pixel. Google’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/top-members-of-googles-pixel-team-have-left-the-company/">team lost a few key players</a>, as it looked forward toward a transformative future. Understandably so. The Pixel has never been bad a phone (though it’s had some struggles through the years), so much as an unremarkable one. But in an era when it’s hard to buy a bad flagship smartphone, pretty good is not good enough.</p>
<p>Google’s attempts to differentiate themselves from the Apples and Samsungs of the world have largely come up short. The company has had decent success with its budget range A-Series, but dreams of going head-to-head with premium manufacturers have thus far fallen short. Last year’s Pixel 5 wasn’t the departure fans had hoped for, because revamping a product line takes time.</p>

<p>This morning, at the company’s virtual hardware event, however, Google is finally showing us what it means to pick up and start over again. In many ways, the Pixel 6 marks the most radical departure in the history of Google’s flagship devices &#8212; and its most serious attempt to take the fight to Samsung and Apple.</p>
<p>The company gave us our first glimpse of the device back in August. It was a surprisingly complete look at a device it would take another three and a half months to announce. Hardware head Rick Osterloh primarily focused on chips, design and the fact that Google was becoming the latest company to buck its reliance on Qualcomm by building its own in-house chip, Tensor.</p>
<p>“AI is the future of our innovation work, but the problem is we’ve run into computing limitations that prevented us from fully pursuing our mission,” the executive wrote. “So we set about building a technology platform built for mobile that enabled us to bring our most innovative AI and machine learning (ML) to our Pixel users. We set out to make our own System on a Chip (SoC) to power Pixel 6. And now, years later, it’s almost here.”</p>

<p>And now it is. The Tensor had landed, alongside the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro it powers. I have the latter in my possession (review soon), and it’s immediately clear that this is a radically new direction for the Pixel line. Google’s clearly gone in a premium direction with the new device, which shares more common DNA with the likes of Samsung’s devices than any of the Pixels we’ve seen to date.</p>
<p>The Pixel 6 sports a 6.4-inch FHD+ OLED at 411 ppi – that bit, at least, is keeping with mid-range specs. The Pro bumps it up to a 6.7-inch QHD+ at 512 ppi. Those displays have refresh rates of 90 and 120 Hz, respectively, protected by a Gorilla Glass Victus cover, which curves on the edges.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219380" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219380" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2219380" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0463.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0463.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0463.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0463.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0463.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0463.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0463.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0463.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0463.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219380" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The rear, meanwhile, is covered in Gorilla Glass 6, with a large and distinctive camera bar that runs along the top third. It’s a sizable enough bump that the phone sits at an angle on its back, unless the phone is in a case [seen above], which keeps things more (but not perfectly ) flush. There’s a slight difference in the hues above and below the camera bar, in an effort to inject a bit more color into the device, now that the Pixel no longer sports the color pop power button. The focus on camera hardware is, in and of itself, a departure for the company. Google has long been so bullish on computational photography that it has implied that hardware is almost a moot point. Perhaps one day in the future, someone will be able to make a compelling version of this argument, where AI and ML are doing most or all of the heavy lifting here. For now, however, camera hardware is still important.</p>
<p>Look no further than the setup on the new Pixels. The 6 supports two lenses: a 50-megapixel wide-angle camera and 12-megapixel on the 6, plus a 48 megapixel telephoto on the 6 Pro. That last one does 4x optical or up to 20x Super Res, though even with computational photography, things are going to degrade pretty quickly. The front-facing camera, meanwhile, is eight megapixels on the 6 and 11 megapixels on the 6 Pro, with 84- and 94-degree fields of view, respectively.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219390" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219390" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2219390" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0417.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0417.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0417.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0417.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0417.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0417.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0417.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0417.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0417.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219390" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>There&#8217;s more info on the various camera features in some of our breakout posts, but here’s a list of what you’ll be able to do on both systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Magic Eraser</li>
<li>Motion Mode</li>
<li>Real Tone</li>
<li>Face Unblur</li>
<li>Panorama</li>
<li>Manual white balancing Locked Folder</li>
<li>Night Sight</li>
<li>Top Shot</li>
<li>Portrait Mode</li>
<li>Portrait Light</li>
<li>Super Res Zoom Motion autofocus Frequent Faces</li>
<li>Dual exposure controls Live HDR+</li>
<li>Cinematic Pan</li>
</ul>
<p>The most interesting new additions are Real Tone, Motion Mode, Magic Eraser and Face Unblur. The latter is pretty much what it sounds like, sharpening a subject&#8217;s face after shooting. Motion Mode is similar to Portrait Mode, creating a motion blur around a moving subject. Magic Eraser uses a Photoshop-like tool to remove unwanted subjects from the background of the photo, with AI filling in the gaps. Real Tone, meanwhile, is an effort to take better photos of subjects, regardless of skin color &#8212; something that&#8217;s been woefully lacking on smartphones to this point.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219381" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219381" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2219381" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219381" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The system sports a quick in-display fingerprint reader, and all of the sorts of first-party software you&#8217;d expect on a Pixel device. That includes Live Translate, Recorder and Android&#8217;s new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-offers-the-best-look-yet-at-android-12/">Material You</a>, which creates aesthetic consistency across the wallpaper and apps. The company described it thusly at the last I/O,</p>
<blockquote><p>Material You explores a more humanistic approach to design. One that celebrates the tension between design sensibility and personal preference, and does not shy away from emotion. Without compromising the functional foundations of our apps, Material You seeks to create designs that are personal for every style, accessible for every need, alive and adaptive for every screen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also new is Calling Assistance, a new feature, which, much like Duplex, is designed to ease the interaction between human and robot operators. Here, it offers projected call wait times for toll free numbers, based on day and time. Direct My Call, meanwhile, uses Google&#8217;s transcription feature to display text versions of audio menus that direct to the dial pad. Hold For Me, meanwhile, will wait on the call and notify you when a human picks up.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also improved Assistant Voice typing. Saying, &#8220;Hey Google, Type&#8221; will use Assistant to dictate text. &#8220;Stop&#8221; turns the feature off, and &#8220;Send&#8221; fires off a message. You can also spell out difficult words, letter by letter and dictate emojis.</p>

<p>The company has addressed some of the battery issues that plagued earlier models. The 6 and 6 Pro feature 4,614 and 5,003mAh batteries, respectively &#8212; that&#8217;s a nice jump from the Pixel 5&#8217;s 4,080mAh (which, in turn, was a nice jump from the Pixel 4). Google says that should translate to around 24 hours of life, or nearly double that if you go into Extreme Battery Saver mode. On-board fast charging via the 30W USB-C plug (sold separately) should give you half a charge in half-an-hour. Both systems also support wireless charging via Qi.</p>

<p>The Pixel 6 is available with 8GB of RAM and 128 or 256GB of storage, and the Pro comes with 12GB of RAM and 128, 256 or 512GB of storage. The company has still managed to keep the pricing low, with a $599 starting price for the Pixel 6 and $899 for the Pixel 6 Pro. They&#8217;re up for pre-order now and set to launch October 28.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this month, Citibanamex — Mexico&#8217;s second-largest bank — <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/payments/news/citis-mexico-unit-takes-first-steps-toward-open-banking">announced</a> that it is building new APIs to allow fintech companies real-time access to information like its services and ATM locations. The move comes as Mexico’s fintech ecosystem flourishes so fiercely that traditional banks have to embrace them or risk lagging behind.</p>
<p>Mexico has been — and still is — leading the fintech charge in Latin America. The country was the first in the region to implement <a href="http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/ref/lritf.htm">a law</a> specific to the sector, and Mexican fintechs account for nearly <a href="https://www.informador.mx/economia/Mexico-segundo-pais-de-AL-que-mas-capital-obtuvo-para-fintech-en-el-2020-20210422-0023.html">20%</a> of total venture investment in the industry throughout Latin America. Not to mention, the Mexican population harbors both the talent and demand for fintech services. Mexico repeatedly tops most innovative fintech hub lists, and neobank and digital wallet transactions are consistently increasing — during COVID lockdowns they rose by an estimated <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/covid-spurs-greater-fintech-use-in-mexico-but-financial-inclusion-lags-58871441">80%</a>.</p>
<p>Considering that nearly 40 million people in Mexico (almost a third of the population) are unbanked, fintech has been a necessary vehicle for fresh routes for credit, insurance and remittances. And because many Mexicans have <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/12/10/mexicans-lack-access-to-credit">little trust</a> in banks, the transparency of fintech options has played a big part in people adopting the new technology.</p>
<p>There are no signs that fintech in Mexico is slowing down. More than a year into the global remote revolution, now is a good time to reflect on the country’s fintech journey, the local players that are having the biggest impact and what lies ahead for the industry.</p>
<h2>Mexico has long nurtured its fintech ecosystem</h2>
<p>Mexico’s fintech success is no coincidence &#8211; it’s due to a combination of factors that have made the country a fertile space to create and grow fintech solutions. This natural evolution has enabled people to gradually become familiar with fintech as a safe and streamlined solution.</p>
<p>For one, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/625424/smartphone-user-penetration-in-mexico/#:~:text=Mexico%3A%20smartphone%20users%20as%20share%20of%20population%202015%2D2025&amp;text=In%202019%2C%2060%20percent%20of,revenue%20in%20Mexico%20in%202019.">smartphone usage</a> and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/379973/mexico-internet-user-penetration/">internet penetration</a> have both significantly improved in Mexico over recent years, shaping a tech savvy population that has become accustomed to managing money through devices. Paired with people’s aversion to traditional banks, this tech literacy makes fintech an attractive alternative.</p>
<p>The country’s fintech law (<em>Ley Fintech</em>) came into effect in 2018 and set the parameters for crowdfunding, cryptocurrencies, and APIs, alongside detailing regulatory sandboxes for fintech products. The law has done wonders to promote a healthy fintech sphere where users are protected and investors are more active thanks to the safety net of regulatory framework. Currently, <a href="https://www.milenio.com/negocios/suman-52-fintechs-autorizadas-operar-mexico-cnbv">52 fintechs</a> have been authorized to operate under the law, while 38 more are pending approval. The law is expected to be developed further this year.</p>

The company has also shared a ton of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/google-gives-the-world-its-first-glimpse-of-the-pixel-6/">details</a> about the new phones.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219407" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Pixel 6 will have a matte aluminum finish and a 6.4-inch display. The Pro models will have a bigger, 6.7-inch display and a polished aluminum finish.</p>
<p>As for cameras, the regular Pixel 6 will have two camera sensors while the 6 Pro will feature three different camera sensors. And if you’ve seen a photo of those devices already, you already know that they feature a camera bump like you’ve never seen before.</p>
<p>But specifications only tell you one part of the story. It’s going to be important to listen to what Google has to say about chipset performances and camera features. We’ll discover all that during Google’s event.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A joint advisory issued by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the National Security Agency (NSA) has warned that the BlackMatter ransomware group has targeted &#8220;multiple&#8221; organizations deemed critical infrastructure, including two organizations in the U.S. food and agriculture sector.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A joint advisory issued by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the National Security Agency (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/nsa/">NSA</a>) has warned that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/technology-giant-olympus-hit-by-blackmatter-ransomware/">BlackMatter ransomware group</a> has targeted &#8220;multiple&#8221; organizations deemed critical infrastructure, including two organizations in the U.S. food and agriculture sector.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-291a">agencies did not name</a> did not name the victims, but Iowa New Cooperative, an Iowa-based farm service provider, was last month hit by a ransomware attack that saw hackers demand a $5.9 million ransom to unlock their systems. The attack was followed by a <a href="https://www.crystalvalley.coop/about-us/news/article/cyber-attack-update">similar attack</a> on Crystal Valley, a Minnesota-based farm supply and grain marketing cooperative.</p>
<p>The advisory provides an overview of the BlackMatter threat, its tactics (which includes the wiping of backup data stores and appliances, rather than encrypting them), detection signatures, and mitigation best practices. It also lends credence to the wider belief that BlackMatter might be a &#8220;possible rebrand&#8221; of the now-defunct DarkSide ransomware operation, which the FBI said was behind the attack on <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Colonial+Pipeline+techcrunch&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Colonial Pipeline</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220291" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>BlackMatter provides ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) that allows other groups to rent its infrastructure, and taking a cut of the ransom if a victim pays. The advisory notes that BlackMatter ransom demands have ranged from $80,000 to $15 million in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The advisory urges organizations, particularly those in critical infrastructure, to shore up cybersecurity defenses and to follow security best practices, including the use of strong passwords and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication</a>. The three agencies also recommend keeping all operating systems up to date, using a host-based firewall, and ensuring all backup data is encrypted.</p>
<p>The agencies also urge any organization hit by a ransomware attack to report it immediately and to refuse to pay the hackers&#8217; ransom demands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paying a ransom may embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or may fund illicit activities,&#8221; the three agencies warned. &#8220;Paying the ransom also does not guarantee that a victim&#8217;s files will be recovered.&#8221;</p>
<p>BlackMatter has also hit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/technology-giant-olympus-hit-by-blackmatter-ransomware/">Japanese technology giant Olympus</a> that forced the shutdown of its European, Middle East and Africa network.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-live/">TechCrunch Live</a> (formerly Extra Crunch Live) has been <em>incredibly</em> educational over the past few months. We&#8217;ve learned how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/stephanie-zhan-walks-through-the-rec-room-pitch-deck-that-won-sequoias-investment/">Rec Room&#8217;s pitch landed investment from Sequoia</a>, how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/craft-your-pitch-deck-around-that-one-thing-that-can-really-hook-an-investor/">Wheel crafted a pitch deck that hooked Tusk Venture&#8217;s Jordan Nof</a>, how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/how-retail-ziplines-series-a-pitch-deck-ticked-every-box-for-emergence-capital/">Retail Zipline ticked every box for Emergence Capital</a> and how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/ceo-shishir-mehrotra-and-investor-s-somasegar-reveal-what-sings-in-codas-pitch-doc/">Coda made their pitch doc sing for Madrona Capital</a>.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s plenty more where that came from.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Live is specifically designed to help founders build better venture-backed businesses. We do this by bringing together startup founders and the investors who back them to talk about what, specifically, helped close the deal. What metrics are the investors looking at? What questions did the founders answer that made the VCs want to learn more? How did the founders communicate their grand vision, and their step-by-step plan to getting there?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217550" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We cover all this &#8212; complete with a look at these companies&#8217; early pitch decks, and more &#8212; on TechCrunch Live. TechCrunch Live is also home to the TCL Pitch-off, where founders in the audience can get on our virtual stage to pitch their startup to our esteemed guests and get their live feedback.</p>
<p>As with any TechCrunch event, this weekly series also features networking so you can meet and greet other attendees.</p>
<p>The event goes down every Wednesday at noon PT/3pm ET, and is free to attend. Only TechCrunch+ members get access to the complete library of on-demand content, so if you haven&#8217;t yet already, sign up now!</p>
<p>And without any further ado, here is a look at the outstanding guests joining us on TechCrunch Live in November.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Storing great pools of data is an increasingly figured-out challenge. Between public clouds, and data lakes more specifically, you can stick oceans of corporate data in any number of places. But leveraging that data into something useful is another challenge altogether.</p>
<p>The analogy that data is this era&#8217;s oil is at best half-baked. Oil takes ages to form, while data doesn&#8217;t, for example. But where the data:oil comparison does work to a degree is that crude oil is not good for that many things by itself. You have to refine it to get the plethora of products that still power the modern world.</p>
<p>Data isn&#8217;t too different. And at the upcoming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=datapanelpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=datapanelpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Sessions: SaaS on October 27</a> event we&#8217;re hosting a panel to dig more deeply into the matter. Barr Moses, co-founder and CEO of Monte Carlo, will join DataRobot CEO Dan Wright and Jenn Knight, co-founder and CTO at AgentSync, to guide us through the topic.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219477" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Monte Carlo helps companies with their data ingestion through a product-set called data <em>observability. </em>AgentSync sits inside the world of insurance data, helping pass key information regarding brokers between different parties. And DataRobot, recently valued at $6.25 billion per Crunchbase data, has built a data platform that combines AI, automation and machine learning into a single package, making machine learning more efficient.</p>
<p>So, we&#8217;ll have folks with deep knowledge regarding how to make sure data arrives, how to link data to other platforms and how to massage it deeply to better understand its contours.</p>
<p>With that collected panel, we&#8217;ll dig into two main themes. The first dealing with their companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why there are so many startups attacking the data market from different angles, and when we may see consolidation in the market for data-related products</li>
<li>Building platforms versus building more targeted solutions</li>
<li>What&#8217;s ahead for the data market that founders may not be aware of</li>
</ul>
<p>And some more in-market questions regarding how modern companies are leveraging data today:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li>How effectively startups are using machine learning today, and corporations more generally</li>
<li>How data can lead to better customer understanding, if at all</li>
<li>The tension between greater data collection, and analysis and privacy</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be a blast. I can&#8217;t wait to host, as I am going to learn a lot. Tickets start at just $35, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=datapanelpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=datapanelpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book yours today</a> before prices go up at the door. See you there!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">John Diener, the CEO of an aquaculture nutrition and genetics company, would visit hundreds of shrimp farms as part of his job. But gradually he became frustrated by some of the environmentally unsustainable practices used in many locations. One night, his wife bought some frozen shrimp to cook for dinner and he realized the industry he was involved in was poised to affect the health of his own family. Why? Because the shrimp was from a country that is known to use antibiotics on its shrimp farms. He decided enough was enough, and set about building a new model for seafood.</p>
<p>The result was <a href="http://verticaloceans.blue">Vertical Oceans</a>, a startup that grows sustainable shrimp in huge &#8220;aqua towers&#8221;, which can be located inside cities, potentially in facilities that even look like buildings. The towers can incubate shrimp without chemicals or antibiotics, and out of season. And let’s remember, Shrimp is a $50 billion a year market globally.</p>
<p>Coming out of IndieBio, Vertical Oceans has now closed a $3.5 million seed round with Khosla Ventures. This would appear to be the first time a major Silicon Valley fund has invested directly in an aquaculture startup (as far we know). Khosla led the round at $3 million and <a href="https://sosv.com/">SOSV</a> followed their pro-rata for the remaining $500,000.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220298" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>So far the startup has had 10 harvests in the last six months from its small proof of concept facility in Singapore to demonstrate the core biological concept works and can produce a good product.</p>
<p>Competition-wise, there are two companies in Singapore with vertical aquaculture systems &#8212; Universal Aquaculture and Apollo Aquaculture. There is an indoor system in the U.S. called Tru Shrimp, which is not specifically vertical farming but is developing a scalable indoor farming technology.</p>

<p>Diener says: “Our product tastes like fresh shrimp from the ocean, that&#8217;s really hard to achieve consistently in a recirculating aquaculture system. Because our product is so high-quality and fresh, we can sell on par with fresh wild-caught versus farmed frozen shrimp. This higher price more than offsets the costs of going vertical and urban.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The system is specifically designed to be &#8220;location agnostic&#8221; vertical farming in urban locations, including cities with cold winters like Chicago. It’s now expanding into a new facility adjacent to downtown Singapore where it will develop its technologies at full scale.</p>
<p>Diener and co-founder Enzo Acerbi previously worked together at an insect protein company where they helped to develop and scale up their technology, and so have experience with scaling agritech.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since its earliest days, the Portal line has been plagued by one major question: why? Not so much why did Facebook make it (for that I give you the following: $$$), but rather, why should people be interested, given Amazon and Google’s respective head starts in both the smart assistant and display categories?</p>
<p>In addition to its integration with Facebook services, Portal’s original standout feature was smart panning, which used object detection to reframe its subjects. It was a clever addition &#8212; if not necessarily enough to justify purchasing a Facebook-produced product over the competition. Since then, however, Google, Amazon and even Apple have introduced their own versions of the technology, removing Facebook’s edge.</p>

<p>While the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/facebook-adds-a-battery-powered-smart-screen-to-the-portal-line/">Portal Go</a> doesn’t address the larger question of why, it does once again showcase Facebook’s ability to think outside the smart screen box by adding portability to the mix. Honestly, it’s one of those things I’m surprised the competition hasn’t gotten on board with. Amazon discontinued its portable Bluetooth speaker, the Tap, some time ago.</p>
<p>Beyond that, you’d have look to an Alexa-enabled Fire tablet or third-party devices for a similarly portable solution. Otherwise, the Amazon and Google solution has effectively been convincing users to simply stick a device in every room in which they plan to use it. Personally, I’ve always wondering why they’ve not embraced the flexibility of a battery-powered model.</p>
<p>The Go was built with portability in mind, right down to the inclusion of a built-in handle on the rear of the device. It’s a reasonably light three pounds (compared to, say, the 4.7-pound MacBook Pro that Apple just launched). Does anyone need a smart screen they can take with them? Certainly no more than anyone needs a smart screen period, but there’s a lot to be said for flexibility. For a device primarily designed for video, it’s genuinely nice to be able to pick it up and take it with you.</p>

<p>The key to this is a built-in battery and wireless charging. The latter relies on a proprietary three-pin charging pad with a USB-C plug on the other side. The charger may be my biggest complaint about product design here. I understand why Facebook decided not to go hardwired here, so you can simply pick it up and go without unplugging. But a wired charging option would have been nice, letting you top that battery up faster. At the very least, it would be great to have a charging pad that snaps into place magnetically, because it’s a pain getting the pins aligned to charge the thing.</p>

<p>The display is a 10-inch touchscreen, with 1280 x 800 resolution. Nothing to write home about there, but certainly adequate for a vast majority of what you need to do on this thing, from teleconferencing to watching bite-sized videos through Facebook. That’s coupled with a 12-megapixel front-facing camera and a four-mic array. Again, this isn’t going to compete with the teleconference setup you invested in when the world went to hell and all meetings went virtual, but it’s perfectly fine for calling family or even taking the occasional work meeting. The fabric-covered back of the device houses two rear-facing speakers and a woofer. The sound isn’t great. It&#8217;s a bit muffled. Not something I would use in everyday music listening, but it works in a pinch.</p>
<p>The device is chunkier than most smart displays. It’s got rounded corners and a sizable bezel, wrapped in a fabric covering that’s standard fare for home products these days. In fact, the design is something of a cross between an Echo or Nest-style home product and something targeted toward kids. The latter lends it a kind of robustness you’d want out of a portable product like this.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218427" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218427" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2218427" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218427" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>It’s not rugged exactly, but it can probably handle the occasional accidental knocks and bumps better than, say, the Nest Home. That, combined with some of the storybook content, may make the Go better suited than most for a setting with younger kids around. There’s a physical shutter that slides over the front-facing camera. If you’re like me, you’re probably going to keep that on 90% of the time &#8212; essentially any time I’m not making a call. That doesn’t disable the microphone, but a circular button sitting next to the volume keys will. Clicking that will take the camera and microphone offline, denoted with a red light.</p>
<p>For Facebook calling in particular, the thing is a cinch. Say, “hey Portal, call such and such,” and it will show you a name and ask if it found the right person. This is really the heart of the product, offering a device specifically tailored to the sorts of conversations you would have through Facebook Messenger. You can add filters and watch videos or read story books together. The device’s strength has always been in these shared experiences, built specifically around Facebook&#8217;s software.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220179" style="width: 6730px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220179" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2220179 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg" alt="" width="6720" height="4480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6720px) 100vw, 6720px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220179" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>There are shared storybooks, good for grandparents connecting remotely with grandkids. The selection of filters in the Facebook Messenger app is just okay. They’ll add funny hats and occasionally distort your voice, but aren’t really aimed at, say, smoothing perceived flaws, for better or worse. I found that they struggled a bit on slower Wi-Fi, ditto for the Facebook Watch videos &#8212; in some cases there was a lag, which can ruin the effect a bit.</p>
<p>The app selection beyond Facebook is limited. Spotify, Tidal, Deezer and Pandora are nice. The Go works as a portable Bluetooth speaker with a built-in display. I found myself turning off the camera, bringing it into the bedroom and listening to music by interacting with Spotify on the touchscreen. You’ve got a decent selection on the teleconferencing front, including Zoom, WebEx and Blue Jeans. It’s not a catchall, but that should cover a decent number of work meetings.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220178" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220178" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2220178" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0472.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0472.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0472.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0472.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0472.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0472.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0472.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0472.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220178" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>It handles these well &#8212; in fact, that, combined with portability, is probably the most compelling use case of the bunch. The leading smart displays all have some compatibility with third-party teleconferencing apps, but it’s nice being able to move it around and not have to worry about finding an outlet if you don’t want to be stuck to your desk all day.</p>
<p>Beyond this, the app selection is bare-boned. There are a couple of news and cooking apps, while popular third-party services like YouTube are available as browser shortcuts. If you want to, say, watch Netflix, you can visit the site in the browser and watch it that way. Ultimately, much of it comes down to that. If you’re all in on Facebook apps (and all of the complications that brings), then one of these is probably the device for you.</p>
<p>On the portability side, there’s isn’t really any direct competition to the Go at the moment. The product doesn’t answer the broader questions of “why” for the Portal line, but at least it addresses the &#8220;where.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Sixteen years in and now valued at $7.5 billion, Automattic has found a multitude of strides, even as it strives to own ever more of the media market.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s hard to build a publishing empire, and it&#8217;s just as easy to lose one. Newspaper magnates were mostly replaced by broadcast moguls, first radio and then TV and cable, and now of course, they are all fighting against the social media tycoons and streaming impresarios who want to capture our attention. Each generation of media titans dies off and is replaced, just as each medium finds its niche only to be supplanted by something novel.</p>
<p>So when it comes to <b>Automattic</b>, the leading commercial complement to the open-source <b>WordPress</b> publishing platform, time and longevity have a rather peculiar meaning in an industry littered with the gravestones of media sites of yore. Founded in 2005, the company continues to assiduously evolve and expand as it staves off that ambient and inclement sense of doom that pervades media.</p>
<p>Sixteen years in and now valued at $7.5 billion, Automattic has found a multitude of strides, even as it strives to own ever more of the media market. It’s a publisher, a social media network via its acquisition of Tumblr, an e-commerce giant with WooCommerce, a productivity tool with P2, and more. It reached this peak doing pretty much everything wrong, according to VCs, a strategy, as we will see, that proved to be exponentially effective in the long run.</p>
<p>The lead writer for this TC-1 (our slightly rechristened EC-1 to match our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/introducing-techcrunch-plus/">TechCrunch+ rebrand</a>) is <b>Chris Morrison</b>. Chris has been among our most productive analysts of breakthrough companies, profiling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/roblox-ec1/">Roblox</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1/">Klaviyo</a> in previous entries of this series. In addition to writing and analyzing, he’s an independent game developer and brings his expertise in business development and engineering to bear in understanding Automattic and its open source focus. The lead editor for this package was <b>Danny Crichton</b>, the assistant editor was <b>Ram Iyer</b>, the copy editor was <b>Richard Dal Porto</b> and illustrations were created by <b>Nigel Sussman</b>.</p>
<p><i>Morrison has no financial ties to Automattic or other conflicts of interest to disclose.</i></p>
<p>The Automattic TC-1 comprises four main articles numbering 10,700 words and a reading time of about 40 minutes. Let’s take a look:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Part 1: Origin story</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-origin/">How doing everything wrong turned Automattic into a multibillion dollar media powerhouse</a>&#8221; (3,850 words/15 minutes) — explores the formation of Automattic in the wake of the success of the WordPress project and how a 21-year-old jazz saxophonist with a side hobby in publishing became a media magnate.</li>
<li><strong>Part 2: Open source development</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-developers/">There&#8217;s nothing Automattic about balancing commercial growth with an open source developer community</a>&#8221; (2,500 words/10 minutes) — investigates the tensions inherent in being a commercial backer of an open source project, and how Automattic balances pushing the community forward while allowing contributors to participate in the project.</li>
<li><strong>Part 3: Acquisitions and future strategy</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-acquisitions/">Can social and e-commerce transform the future of the open web?</a>&#8221; (2,350 words/9 minutes) — analyzes Automattic&#8217;s long history of acquisitions and expansions by surveying the company&#8217;s initiatives in e-commerce and social media, two competitive verticals upon which its future success will be built.</li>
<li><strong>Part 4: Remote work culture</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-remote/">The future of remote work is text</a>&#8221; (2,000 words/8 minutes) — reports on the development of Automattic&#8217;s unique corporate culture, which was remote years before the corporate tech world was ready for work from home, and how the company centralizes communications around text.</li>
