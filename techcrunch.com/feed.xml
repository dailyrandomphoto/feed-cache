According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-20/apple-will-force-unvaccinated-office-workers-to-get-tested-daily?sref=10lNAhZ9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the tech giant will start requiring all unvaccinated corporate employees to be tested for COVID-19 every time they have to work in the office instead of working from home. Back in September, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vaccination-status-report-185408210.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">reported</a> that Apple asked employees to share their vaccination status voluntarily. Those who refuse to share their vaccine status will also have to undergo daily testing, while vaccinated office workers will only have to do rapid testing once a week.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s retail store employees, however, won&#8217;t be subjected to daily tests despite having consumer-facing jobs. Unvaccinated staff members are required to be tested twice a week. Like Apple&#8217;s office workers, vaccinated staff will only have to undergo weekly rapid testing. It&#8217;s unclear if the tech giant will ever issue a COVID-19 vaccine mandate, but the Biden administration previously gave all federal contractors a December 8th deadline to require all their employees to be inoculated against the virus. As <em>Bloomberg</em> notes, Apple sells products to the US government.</p>
<p>For now, Apple has reportedly given employees an October 24th deadline to report and show proof of their vaccination status, so it could implement the new rules starting on November 1st. Unvaccinated employees will have to pick-up at-home rapid tests from Apple offices and stores, do the test themselves and then report their results through an internal app.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221665" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify has already invested <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/12/spotify-continues-its-podcast-shopping-spree/">around $1 billion</a> in podcasting between its acquisitions, exclusive deals, and other partnerships. Now, it wants people to do more than just listen &#8212; it wants them to watch, too. The company announced today it&#8217;s opening up access to a new tool for creators that will allow them to begin publishing their video podcasts to its service. The tool will be provided by the company&#8217;s podcast creation platform Anchor, and expands on <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/12/spotify-continues-its-podcast-shopping-spree/">the global launch of video podcasts last year</a> which encompassed only a select group of creators.</p>
<p>At the time, Spotify said its debut lineup of video podcasts included Spotify Originals and Exclusives, as well as some third-party podcasts. But there wasn&#8217;t a way for any creator to publish video to the service. Instead, they would have to turn to other video platforms, like YouTube.</p>
<p>Now, that&#8217;s changing. With Anchor, creators will be able to upload their videos through their account, similar to how they create and publish audio episodes today. Once published, fans can listen to the podcasts across platforms, including through the Spotify mobile app, desktop app, web player, and on most smart TVs and game consoles. Creators will also be able to monetize their videos as they do their audio podcasts through the use of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/spotifys-podcasts-subscriptions-service-is-now-open-to-all-u-s-creators/">subscriptions</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221335" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While creators can set their pricing and determine what a subscription includes, Spotify suggests subscriptions could provide access to exclusive video content or even unlock the video portion of the creator&#8217;s podcasts. The video podcasts can also incorporate the creator&#8217;s existing advertising partnerships and soon, they&#8217;ll support the newer <a href="https://anchor.fm/ads">Automated Ads</a>, too.</p>
<p>While Spotify is officially opening up access to Anchor creators, the feature is being rolled out gradually. That means interested creators will have to sign up for a <a href="http://anchor.fm/video">waitlist</a> for the time being.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Spotify&#8217;s video lineup will include video podcasts from its Originals and Exclusives, like The Ringer’s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0KsFDwCqXyZS1M8dh0tp76?si=VI_zn5L8QTmwQsi14jStFA&amp;nd=1">Higher Learning with Van Lethan and Rachel Lindsay</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4rOoJ6Egrf8K2IrywzwOMk?si=VO4mgUQhS0umteOlOUSQRg&amp;nd=1">The Joe Rogan Experience</a>; and it will include other video creators who will now publish on Spotify, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClFSU9_bUb4Rc6OYfTt5SPw">Philip DeFranco</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jasminechiswell?lang=en">Jasmine Chiswell</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5l8IBkxX6pgPPfEL6AI57O?si=btHwk1KRRgqQtOL6p_PG2w&amp;nd=1">The WAN Show</a>,<br />
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/1zsZEElOM8NBrgVvZ48gsO?si=9mfQm8WuTiqOr-N6yl7qyQ&amp;nd=1">Juicy Scoop with Heather McDonald</a>, and more to come.</p>
<p>Spotify has tried and failed to expand into video in years past. Its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/11/spotifys-first-original-videos-are-boring-behind-the-music-cartoons/">first efforts in original video</a> half a decade ago largely flopped, and the company shelved its video plans for some time. But more recently, the company signaled its potential interest in returning to video when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/spotify-is-buying-the-ringer-to-boost-its-sports-podcast-content/">acquired</a> sports network The Ringer, which <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/02/spotify-is-buying-the-ringer-expanding-its-podcast-footprint-and-dipping-its-audio-toes-into-plain-old-text/">came with</a> a YouTube-based video operation. It then went on to make more deals that could translate to video, like the one with <a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/addison-rae-podcast-spotify-exclusive-1234709818/">TikTok star, turned Netflix actress, Addison Rae.</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The expansion of video to more podcast creators directly follows news that YouTube is now also considering investing further in its own podcasting efforts. Bloomberg this month <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-05/youtube-looks-to-hire-its-first-executive-focused-on-podcasts">reported</a> the company is hiring its first executive focused on podcasts. This may have encouraged Spotify to promote its own video podcasting efforts, even though the actual access to start uploading is still blocked by a waitlist.</p>
<p>Currently, to find video content on Spotify, you&#8217;ll need to navigate to the episode page from the show you want to watch, then hit play to start the episode. From the play bar at the bottom of the screen, you can tap to view the video in full-screen mode. You can then choose to either listen or watch the program, depending on what you&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t yet an easy way to see all the podcasts that are video-enabled, however. Spotify also declined to share how many podcasts would be available as videos at launch, but said it expected to have rolled out access to &#8220;thousands&#8221; by year-end.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Three months after announcing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/yummy-raises-4m-aims-to-be-super-app-of-venezuela/">$4 million seed round</a>, Venezuelan delivery super app Yummy is back with an $18 million Series A round that will accelerate the company’s proposed expansion throughout Latin America.</p>
<p>Anthos Capital led the latest round, with additional participation from JAM Fund, whose founder Justin Mateen was an investor in the seed round.</p>
<p>Yummy was started by Vicente Zavarce in 2020 and has amassed over 200,000 registered users so far. He came to the United States for school and stayed to work in marketing roles at Postmates, Wayfair and Getaround before starting Yummy. The app, which includes both delivery and ridesharing, can be downloaded for free, and the company charges a delivery fee or merchant fee.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221113" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>“We can’t wait to be live in every city in Venezuela with both Yummy Delivery and Yummy Rides, and continue our expansion across LatAM,” Zavarce said via email. “We want to become a part of everyone’s daily life and put the local economy in the hands of our users, while creating a way to earn in U.S dollars for thousands of Yummers and drivers.”</p>
<p>The company launched this month in Peru and Chile. Yummy plans to have 50 active dark stores in each country by the end of 2022, touting that it will be able to deliver more than 2,000 products in less than 15 minutes.</p>
<p>It is already processing over 340,000 monthly transactions in Venezuela, with a consistent growth of over 35% for the past four months. Yummy already has a network of over 5,000 drivers across its delivery and ridesharing operation across 12 cities in Venezuela that make this possible.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://thefund.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Fund</a> is raising a new angel investment fund, dubbed <a href="https://thefund.vc/community/xx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Fund XX</a>, that is pulling together a community of women investors and entrepreneurs that will make pre-seed and seed stage investments.</p>
<p>Jenny Fielding, managing director of Techstars and one of the founders of The Fund, said the organization was started in 2018 by a group that pooled its network, capital and resources together to take a community-driven approach to angel investing. The Fund overall has invested in 140 companies.</p>
<p>This is The Fund’s first investment vehicle focused on female founders. It is only half closed, so Fielding was not able to say how much it would ultimately raise, but did say that previous funds raised between $2 million and $4 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221483" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2221486" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221486" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2221486" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-1.jpeg?w=680" alt="The Fund, The Fund XX" width="680" height="486" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-1.jpeg 700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-1.jpeg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-1.jpeg?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-1.jpeg?resize=680,486 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-1.jpeg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221486" class="wp-caption-text">The Fund XX investment committee, clockwise from left, Allison<br />Stoloff, Ragini Holloway, Gabriela Isturiz, and Sylvia Kuyel</p></div></p>
<p>On the investment committee for The Fund XX are Ragini Holloway, senior vice president of people at Affirm; Allison Stoloff, an operator with previous roles at Knotel, Oscar and Facebook; Gabriela Isturiz, Founder of eBillingHub and Bellefield Systems; and Sylvia Kuyel, vice president of revenue at JumpCloud.</p>
<p>Stoloff says the fund is specific about investing in companies that are not only women-led, but also where women are the CEO.</p>
<p>“They also have to be venture-backable and tech-enabled,” she added. “We believe women are building $1 billion businesses, and we have an advantage in finding them. We get to see deals before venture capitalists, and our secret sauce is our network of LPs that helps us get to know amazing founders.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While it has become easier for someone to become an angel investor, they noticed that women weren’t showing up on top 10 lists of the most active syndicates on investment platforms like AngelList even though women make up 22% of angel investors, Kuyel said. She believes this suggests that women don’t make as many investments, and when they do, it is in fewer dollars.</p>
<p>The Fund XX is sector agnostic, and the group has not yet made its first investment. Its focus is building a community that will remove these hurdles and unlock opportunities for both investors and startups, as well as attracting new women to the ecosystem.</p>
<p>“For at least 50% of LPs, this is their first time making an investment,” Stoloff said. “Even though women may not have done this before, they are two times more likely to invest in other women.

					<description><![CDATA[OpenSponsorship is disrupting the $60 billion sponsorship industry by providing flexibility on the kinds of deals brands can make with athletes.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ishveen Anand grew up in England playing sports all of her life, including during her time at Oxford. She wanted to do something sporty for a career and “fell in love” with sponsorship marketing.</p>
<p>However, what she found was that the process was inefficient — the sports world was slow-moving in terms of brands getting contracts with athletes. She thought with the rise of influencers, there should be something like an “Airbnb meets LinkedIn” for the industry, Anand told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Combining both of her passions, in 2016, she started <a href="https://www.opensponsorship.com/">OpenSponsorship</a>, a sports sponsorship company, with Ron Nesbitt, and today, announced a $4 million growth round.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221184" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2221207" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221207" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2221207" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-iPhone_5.5_Deals.png?w=383" alt="OpenSponsorship" width="383" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-iPhone_5.5_Deals.png 1242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-iPhone_5.5_Deals.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-iPhone_5.5_Deals.png?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-iPhone_5.5_Deals.png?resize=768,1365 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-iPhone_5.5_Deals.png?resize=383,680 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-iPhone_5.5_Deals.png?resize=864,1536 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-iPhone_5.5_Deals.png?resize=1152,2048 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-iPhone_5.5_Deals.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221207" class="wp-caption-text">OpenSponsorship deals page</p></div></p>
<p>The round is led by Philadelphia 76ers owner David Blitzer, who is joined by Eric Stern and executives from WWE and Excel Sports Management. Other notable investors include Jeffrey Talpins, Alex Jung with Isos Capital, NHL player Alex Killorn, and Nike director Shaherose Charania.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used to continue building out the product and integrations. Anand plans for expansion into new verticals, sales and marketing.</p>
<p>OpenSponsorship has 15 employees and is on target to do $5 million in top line revenue and $1.5 million in net revenue this year, and has facilitated over 10,000 deals across 400 brands.</p>
<p>Brands create an account on OpenSponsorship by choosing a subscription plan. Then they can search through athletes, teams and events, including filtering down to those that fit a need, like social media, logo placement or appearances. Then the user will create a campaign and either choose an athlete or let OpenSponsorship do the work. From there, the brand can launch and measure the success of the campaign.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Sponsorship is a $60 billion industry, and we are redefining what sponsorship means,” Anand said. “It can be digital, repurposing content and photoshoots. We want to make sponsorship cool and accessible.”</p>
<p>Prior to this latest funding, the company raised a pre-seed round of $1.3 million from investors that included 500 Startups after being in their program in 2016. Since then the company touts the largest marketplace of athletes, over 11,000, and works with companies like Walmart, Foot Locker and Levi’s.</p>
<p>Anand finds that local advertising benefits from sports sponsorships because athletes often stay in their hometowns. And with influencer marketing skewing female, some of her clients find athletes help them reach male audiences.</p>
<p>The additional funding will enable the company to test new verticals, like music, which she finds has a similar supply and demand.</p>
<p>“People want to have flexibility, but traditional sponsorship didn’t always allow for that,” she added. “Instead, brands were locked into multiyear contracts with one athlete. We have come a long way, and if you have a $100,000 budget, you can now spread it over 10 athletes and have variety across the industry.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Moves, a Toronto-based gig economy fintech startup, wants to reward gig workers with stocks from the companies for which they drive. The first version of the Moves Collective, as the startup&#8217;s new service is called, launches on Thursday with Uber stocks available and then quickly offer Lyft, DoorDash and Grubhub shares, says CEO of Moves, Matt Spoke.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Moves&#8217;s thesis is this: If gig workers become shareholders, they might feel more economic alignment to the platforms they work for. Furthermore, if enough workers own stocks in these companies through the Moves Collective, they might be able to form a voting bloc in the future and actually influence company decisions. Moves says it already owns a &#8220;significant and growing stake&#8221; in these companies, all of which are common shares with voting rights.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over the past year, poor working conditions for gig economy workers have led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/doordash-workers-protest-outside-ceo-tony-xus-home-demanding-better-pay-tip-transparency-and-ppe/">worker protests</a> and attempts by states like California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York to reclassify gig workers as employees, worthy of all the basic rights that status affords, such as health care, vacation pay and paid sick leave. Companies like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Instacart have fought back against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/californias-gig-worker-prop-22-ruled-unconstitutional-by-superior-court/">the ongoing debacle in California over Prop 22</a> and have formed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/massachussetts-ag-greenlights-uber-lyft-backed-gig-worker-ballot-initiative/">a coalition in Massachusetts</a> to get a proposal on the November 2022 ballot that would classify gig workers as independent contractors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220706" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Gig workers contribute a huge amount of value to the gig economy, but they don&#8217;t get any of the economic returns as a result of the value they&#8217;re contributing, and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re trying to solve for is effectively making them feel like they have an economic stake in the success of the companies that they work for,&#8221; Matt Spoke, CEO of Moves, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Workers who are already a part of the Moves platform – which enables gig workers to track and manage their money from different companies, have access to a monthly spending account and instant business cash advances up to $1,000 – are eligible to sign up for the Collective and receive rewards in the form of stocks. Moves will give workers a series of &#8220;tasks&#8221; to complete, like refer three friends or participate in a user survey, in order to receive free stocks, or fractions of stocks, which then go into the user&#8217;s own brokerage account that Moves has opened for them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the long run, the Moves Collective, aptly named, is meant to bring gig workers together and leverage the power in numbers to create a voice that can be used in corporate governance decisions. Moves would propose proxy material submissions at annual general shareholder meetings of the major platforms in order to ensure the interests of gig workers are heard, says Spoke.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Moves&#8217;s primary business relies on interchange rates that it is accumulated every time a gig worker uses their Moves card to make a purchase, and it&#8217;s that revenue which funds the shares Moves gives back to the workers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We&#8217;re effectively trading off revenue to acquire new customers and hold on to them, if you want to think of it that way,&#8221; said Spoke. &#8220;So the revenues we earn off the use of your checking account are being put back into the product to finance these rewards that are effectively denominated in stocks.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">At the moment, the program is invite-only and shares are accumulated via a partnership with Bumped Financial, a stock rewards program. Spoke says Moves will also keep an eye out for Instacart&#8217;s IPO to purchase stock for its platform, and is even considering supporting Amazon stock for Flex delivery people or Target stock for Shipt workers. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">All of the app-based gig economy companies &#8220;suffer from the same problem,&#8221; says Spoke, &#8220;which is a massively high percentage of driver and <a href="https://www.td.org/insights/has-the-gig-economy-jumped-the-shark#:~:text=Turnover%20for%20traditional%20employees%20is,to%20do%20the%20same%20job.">worker churn rates</a>. Their workers just don&#8217;t stick around. They either leave to go to another gig app or they leave the gig economy altogether. So these companies are spending tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars replacing workers all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">(See: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uber-entices-drivers-back-post-pandemic-with-250-million-stimulus/">Uber spends $250 million</a> to incentivize drivers back to the app, which then results in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/how-uber-plans-to-rebound-from-massive-q2-losses-stemming-from-driver-incentives/">crushing Q2 losses</a>.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Before their IPOs Uber and Lyft considered issuing stock to drivers as a mechanism to increase retention and create worker loyalty, but there are different regulatory issues that got in the way of a sincere effort on the companies&#8217; parts. In the end, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/uber-and-lyft-are-reportedly-giving-drivers-cash-to-buy-shares-in-their-respective-ipos/">the two companies decided to reward some more active drivers with a one-time cash award</a> that gave them the option to buy stock. Uber, for example, set aside 5.4 million shares, which was 3% of total shares, of its common stock for drivers, but said it would offer those to the public if drivers didn&#8217;t scoop them up.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For reference, former Uber founder and CEO Travis Kalanick, who owned 8.6% of Uber at the time of public filing, made about <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/05/10/how-travis-kalanick-other-investors-fared-in-uber-ipo/">$5 billion on his stake</a>, and Alphabet, which owned 5.2% of the company, took home around $3.2 billion. U.S.-based drivers at the time had the option of using cash bonuses which could be used to purchase up to $10,000 worth of company stock.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Companies that rely on the gig economy do have a harder regulatory time giving out stock options to workers. SEC Rule 701 allows companies to issue stock to employees, consultants and advisors as compensation without having to submit detailed financial records, but gig companies don&#8217;t fit neatly into that current exemption. In 2018, the SEC<a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/concept/2018/33-10521.pdf"> called for comment</a> on possible ways to expand the rule to adjust to the changing nature of work relationships. <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-18-18/s71818-4510185-175992.pdf">Uber responded</a>, albeit past the deadline, but with a request that the SEC revise the rule in order to allow &#8220;partners to share in the growth of the company which could lead to enhanced earning and saving opportunities for the partner and for the generations ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As the laws currently stand, if Uber or Lyft were so inclined to incentivize drivers themselves with stocks, it would encroach dangerously on employer territory. However, the company&#8217;s past stance signals it might makes sense to one day outsource this kind of service.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Instacart have come together on topics like Prop 22, they&#8217;re lobbying together against new regulations, and so I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s inconceivable that they would see this as being generally positive for the industry,&#8221; said Spoke. &#8220;Eventually I think we&#8217;re going to end up wanting to find some way to share the economics with them. Fast forward a year or two years, I definitely see us talking to Uber about the tangible benefits that we are able to demonstrate and say, &#8216;A driver that was issued Uber stock is X% more likely to stick around longer, so you should be partially participating in funding this.'&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Moves says it currently has about 10,000 users on its platform across all 50 states. The company was founded in February 2020, right before ride-hailing took a massive pandemic-sized dip, and has been in the markets since April 2021. The plan is to begin fundraising again in the first half of next year, but Spoke said Moves doesn&#8217;t want to do that until it refines the unit economics in the narrative of the business and creates a use case for Moves Collective.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;It&#8217;s not that Uber doesn&#8217;t care about their drivers but that their drivers are not their primary stakeholder,&#8221; said Spoke. &#8220;Their primary stakeholder is their consumer. They do everything they can to innovate value for the consumer side of their markets, and often the workers are sort of an afterthought.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The NFT craze of the past year has triggered an avalanche of crypto capital flowing into art, trading card games, luxury avatars and digital objects but so far, institutional investment firms have largely been keeping a watchful eye on the blockchain-based goods while reserving their capital pools for equity bets on the platforms behind them.</p>
<p>Miami-based <a href="https://www.meta4.capital/">Meta4 Capital</a> wants to buck that trend and put LP dollars into the projects themselves, buying up pixelated toads, digital horses and moderately fatigued apes with investor capital. It&#8217;s a bold proposition that many traditional startup investors might scoff at, but the team has already secured a major endorsement &#8212; a lead investment from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). Meta4 is ultimately targeting a $100 million fund anchored by a16z.</p>
<p>Founders Brandon Buchanan and Nabyl Charania hope they can blaze the trail of funds backed by storied firms entering a market that has largely been known for its lack of predictability. Meta4 is more interested in buying up rare items of established &#8220;blue chip&#8221; NFT projects rather than focusing on quantity. Earlier this year, the team deployed a $1 million pilot fund, using the capital to buy up just 31 NFTs including a pair of <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptopunksbot">CryptoPunks</a>, a <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptoadzNFT">CrypToad</a>, and a handful of<a href="https://twitter.com/zed_run?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"> Zed run</a> horses. They say their investments have already appreciated 500-600% in total value amid a market resurgence in recent months.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221149" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Cult of CryptoPunks&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/the-cult-of-cryptopunks/embed/#?secret=z2d3R5Z1Bn" data-secret="z2d3R5Z1Bn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While NFTs first popped up on the radars of many investors after the $69 million purchase of a Beeple collage back in April, the space has seen a dramatic influx of capital since. In August, NFT platform OpenSea recorded a record $3.4 billion in transaction volume. One of the catalysts for that dramatic surge of investment was business influencer Gary Vaynerchuk buying a rare ape CryptoPunk for $3.76 million. The pace of high-priced deals has continued. This week, a rare <a href="https://twitter.com/BoredApeYC">Bored Ape</a> sold for $2.7 million (it specifically sold for 696.969 ETH).</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m telling investors that the tsunami has not even hit yet; we need this stuff and we need it now &#8212; we need an alien and we need an ape,&#8221; Buchanan told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>What the NFT space has in excitement, it lack in regulatory clarity and often adherence to known rules, as well. While regulatory bodies largely seem focused on major exchanges like Coinbase at the moment, Buchanan, who was previously a securities lawyer before getting involved with the crypto investment world, says that a number of popular NFT projects are drifting into murky territory. Many NFT projects are developing complex mechanisms for returning investor capital, with Buchanan specifically highlighting a handful of projects that reward NFT owners with proprietary tokens over time, something he says behaves an awful lot like a security.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">&#8220;There are reasons that there are some assets that we have not purchased yet,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>New projects are popping up every day, and the explosion of capital has created a number of fast-rising unicorn NFT startups, many of which have been minted by Meta4&#8217;s anchor a16z, including OpenSea, NBA Top Shot-maker Dapper Labs and Axie Infinity-maker Sky Mavis. This summer, a16z launched a $2.2 billion crypto-specific fund. With this fund, Meta4 says they will focus on the art and collectibles and shy away from making equity investments in NFT startups.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think [a16z] has that side of it covered,&#8221; Buchanan says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Running out of inventory not only means you are missing out on sales of popular items, but you may also have to wait awhile to get those items back in stock.</p>
<p>New York-based Toolio has built cloud-based merchandising and inventory planning software to enable retailers to optimize their merchandise planning and make better and faster decisions on what products to have and when to have them.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the company announced an $8 million round of Series A capital. Jump Capital led the round and was joined by Rho Capital’s Ignition Fund and existing investors like Founder Collective, Notation Capital and Max Ventures. The latest funding gives Toolio a total of $10.3 million raised since the company was founded in 2019.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221329" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Toolio was co-founded by ex-Walmart employees Eytan Daniyalzade and Berk Atikoglu, who previously built the fashion app Stylr and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/16/walmartlabs-grabs-its-first-silicon-alley-startup-with-acquisition-of-fashion-app-stylr/">sold it to Walmart in 2014</a> after growing to hundreds of thousands of users. While at Walmart, they recognized inefficiencies with supply chain and merchandising in which products were to be sold and in which stores.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;@WalmartLabs Grabs Its First &#8220;Silicon Alley&#8221; Startup With Acquisition Of Fashion App Stylr&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/16/walmartlabs-grabs-its-first-silicon-alley-startup-with-acquisition-of-fashion-app-stylr/embed/#?secret=blW04IHT1s" data-secret="blW04IHT1s" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Even at a company of that scale, the process was spreadsheet driven,” CEO Daniyalzade told TechCrunch. “They wanted to make it data-driven and were investing in resources internally. We realized there was a gap and left Walmart in 2019 to democratize the next planning platform.”</p>
<p>The planning software integrates with the commerce tech stack and automates workflows to provide forecasting analytics that customers can use to respond to demand in real time so they decrease the amount of stockouts, improve margins and have faster inventory turns.</p>
<p>Toolio initially started on the enterprise side, but last year saw a need in the mid-market for cloud tools. As a result, the company grew 20% month over month in revenue and similarly in customer growth. It is already working with retailers like Chubbies, Mack Weldon and Rothy’s, and has managed over $1 billion in inventory for retailers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series A will enable the company to scale into other retailer vertices, expand the team and add new product modules like supply chain and materials resource planning.</p>
<p>Yelena Shkolnik, partner at Jump Capital, said she learned about Toolio from retail advisors who mentioned that the company was solving many of the pain points around inventory, including how to purchase the right items.</p>
<p>Just as the supply chain side was getting more analytical and sophisticated, the global pandemic disrupted everything and gave retailers an insight into just how connected to China they really were, Shkolnik said.</p>
<p>In trying to solve how to prioritize inventory creatively, Toolio stood out.</p>
<p>“They were in the space before with Stylr and understand the approach,” she added. “Inventory was the one piece of the retail stack that wasn’t elevated to the cloud, and Toolio has made it possible for everything now to be on the cloud.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Daniyalzade says much has happened in retail over the past 15 years, especially on the front end from companies like Shopify, but the back end has not yet caught up because it is not one of the more “sexier” aspects of retail and previous solutions fell flat.</p>
<p>With everyone establishing direct-to-commerce channels, even manufacturers, demand for planning has become “everyone’s problem and is a total addressable market that Toolio can tap into,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A large number of UK tech ‘unicorns’ have been in complex markets where policy and regulation really matters. But regulated markets (fintech, healthtech etc), or markets where regulation is still emerging (e.g. lab-grown meat)  are, well, HARD. Founders have to navigate policy-makers, regulators and even politicians.</p>
<p>To it’s interesting that today a new VC is launching specifically to back founders working in regulated markets.</p>
<p><a href="http://formventures.vc">Form Ventures</a> today announces the final close of a £30m Fund II at its target fund size to do just that.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221626" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Form will invest in startups at pre-seed and seed stage in sectors “directly shaped by policy and regulation”.</p>
<p>It’s secured the support of the British Business Bank as the cornerstone investor as part of its Enterprise Capital Funds programme.</p>
<p>The Form Ventures Fund II becomes the 36th fund in the Enterprise Capital Fund portfolio, taking the programme’s total investment capacity to £1.66bn. Fund 1 invested in areas such as childcare, mental health, carbon offsetting and cellular agriculture.</p>
<p>Patrick Newton, Partner, Form Ventures said: “Technology is now disrupting every corner of our lives, from our mental health to our childcare to the future of our planet. More than ever, policymakers want to have their say on how disruption happens &#8211; gone are the days when startups could just “move fast and break things”. Smart founders realize that if they take policymakers seriously, they can build faster, not slower, and gain a real competitive edge.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So if it&#8217;s so important to back founders in regulated markets, why hasn&#8217;t it been solved already?</p>
<p>Newton  told me that sounders can&#8217;t always get this support from European VCs as they “tend to be generalist in how they support founders &#8211; so while they invest in aspects of regulated markets, policy/ regulatory insight and network is well outside their core zone of competence.” He notes that in the US, “this problem has been solved.” VCs in this area include Tusk Ventures, Trust Ventures, investing in Uber, Bird, Lemonade, Ro etc.</p>
<p>Form will invest between £200k and £1m in pre seed and seed stage startups, usually as a co-investor rather than leading rounds, as was the modus operandi for its Fund I, previously investing in nine startups alongside the likes of Index Ventures and Founders Fund.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Small and medium-sized exporters in India struggle to communicate their designs with buyers. They can’t list those designs publicly on their website or sell through popular business-to-business platforms such as Alibaba and IndiaMart as doing so would risk giving away the proprietary property to rivals.</p>
<p>So they have traditionally showcased their work to potential buyers &#8212; who in this equation, depending on the category, could be anyone from Zara to Armani &#8212; in PDF and PowerPoint presentations.</p>
<p>The way their business works is that buyers offer feedback and provide specifications for exactly what they want. PDF and presentations, as you can imagine, are not the most efficient way to relay such conversations.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221599" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That’s the problem that attracted three entrepreneurs &#8212; two of whom worked at Zomato previously and one as an investor at Bessemer. Their startup, five-month-old SourceWiz, said on Thursday it has raised $3 million in a round led by Blume Ventures and Falcon Edge Capital’s Alpha Wave Incubation (AWI).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sourcewiz.co">SourceWiz</a> has built a platform to digitize the way exporters operate. Its platform helps them modernize their cataloguing, which leads to a direct improvement in revenue, said Divyaanshu Makkar, the startup’s co-founder and chief executive, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Cataloguing may sound like an easy problem, but it entails combining information such as images, prices, product ID from multiple databases and then combining them from scratch. “An exporter is able to use our platform to build their customized catalogue in 15 minutes. This task takes about 5 days if done in the traditional way,” he said.</p>
<p>India is one of the world’s largest exporters &#8212; and it’s a space that has become even more popular because of recent geopolitical dynamics, said Sajith Pai, Director at Blume Ventures, in a statement. The total exports of textiles, footwear and miscellaneous design-led products was about $40 billion in the financial year that ended in March.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“As exporters compete on the global stage, they are craving for tools that will digitize their workflows and help them trade faster and better. This is where SourceWiz comes in. We are excited by Sourcewiz’s potential to bring aboard $200b of transactions online. Most of all we are excited by the passion of the founding team &#8211; Divyaanshu, Vikas and Mayur &#8211; and their obsession to take on this massive challenge,” he added.</p>
<p>India’s market is also largely untapped. In recent years, several firms &#8212; including Amazon &#8212; have attempted to make inroads to help Indian businesses sell to customers globally.</p>
<p>Amazon said in August, for instance, that over 70,000 Indian businesses had cumulatively exported over $3 billion worth of items. But Amazon is attempting to cater to different segments of exporters.</p>
<p>Amazon focuses on the B2C market, whereas SourceWiz is a business-to-business play. This means that SourceWiz is serving exporters who largely produce and sell hand-made products that aren’t sold without customization. Additionally, SourceWiz is not a marketplace. (The startup makes money by charging a licensing fee for its service to exporters.)</p>
<p>The startup has already amassed dozens of exporters on its platform &#8212; despite the hands-on nature of this business, which as you can imagine, has been severely disrupted by the coronavirus. Makkar said the startup will eventually broaden its offerings by integrating logistics, payments, and financing services to its platform.</p>
<p>It also plans to expand its offerings to other Asian countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Vietnam in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Portuguese VC <a href="https://www.faber-ventures.com/">Faber</a> is launching a new fund, Faber Blue Pioneers I, to invest in early-stage startups &#8211; primarily from Portugal and Southern Europe &#8211; developing innovative “deep tech solutions” around ocean sustainability and climate action,</p>
<p>The fund will have an initial target of €30 million, including funding from Portugal Blue as well as impact-driven institutional investors like Sociedade Francisco Manuel dos Santos (through its investment arm Movendo Capital), Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, and Champalimaud Foundation.</p>

<p>The Faber Blue Pioneers Fund will be managed by Faber Capital, with a new dedicated investment team led by Rita Sousa and Carlos Esteban as Fund Partners and by Bruno Ferreira as Venture Partner.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Marginalized communities, survivors of abuse, politicians, law enforcement &#8211; they all use encrypted communications to keep their information safe. But the encryption of the kinds of services you and I use every day &#8211; from messaging to confidential internal company communications &#8211; is increasingly under threat by governments globally. The reasons are sometimes understandable, such as the protection of children, but more often than not it’s about state snooping and control of populations, especially in authoritarian regimes. Democratic countries that give the green light to breaking encryption make it easier for dictatorships to argue in its favor.</p>
<p>That’s why a group of civil society organizations and technology companies is today launching a campaign in favor of strong encryption on what they are calling “<a href="https://ged.globalencryption.org/">Global Encryption Day</a>”.</p>
<p>Edward Snowden, the whistleblower behind the NSA surveillance revelations and Board Member of <a href="https://freedom.press/">Freedom of the Press Foundation</a> will launch the day at a special broadcast today at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm  BST / 3pm CET  which you’ll be able to watch live here:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221586" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KrYvzIfY8_w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>While governments worldwide often bleat about criminals exploiting encryption messaging to hide illegal activity, proposals to weaken or undermine strong encryption are far more likely to leave users more vulnerable to cyber-attacks and criminal activity, because once you create those back-doors, anyone can use them.</p>
<p>In a statement, Snowden said: “If you weaken encryption, people will die. This year alone, after the fall of the government of Afghanistan, we saw how crucial encryption is in keeping ordinary people safe. The Covid pandemic brought home how essential encrypted messaging apps on our smartphones are for communicating with loved ones if we’re ill and need help… It would have been impossible for me to whistleblow without encryption.”</p>
<p>He added: “Despite this, governments around the world are seeking to weaken encryption by calling on platforms to create ‘backdoors’ for law enforcement… Weakening encryption would be a colossal mistake that could put thousands of lives at risk.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jimmy Wales, founder of Wikipedia said: “Protecting strong encryption is essential for protecting the human rights of millions of people around the world. Everyone has the right to privacy and security&#8230; Weakening encryption puts us all at risk. When we started Wikipedia, it was prohibitively expensive to use secure encryption for every page on the site, but it was always a priority of ours and we introduced it as soon as we could. There is no excuse for not using encryption now &#8211; governments and technology platforms have a duty to protect the public.”</p>
<p>Global Encryption Day will also feature a series of other online events including <a href="https://www.lgbttech.org/post/lgbt-tech-internet-society-release-new-encryption-infographic">LGBT Tech</a> hosting an Instagram Live, and a leading civil society group in <a href="https://irisbh.com.br/en/eventos/webinar-the-importance-of-encryption-for-activists-and-civil-society/">Brazil hosting an all-women panel</a> discussing the importance of encryption.</p>
<p>The Global Encryption Coalition (GEC) was founded by the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, Global Partners Digital and the Internet Society.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two wheelers have long been a cornerstone of life in India — their smaller size and affordability making these traditionally gas and diesel-powered vehicles a go-to means of navigating the traffic-jammed streets of the country&#8217;s most populous cities.</p>
<p>Now, a new startup called River has come out of stealth with an electric two-wheeler scooter &#8212; and accompanying subscription services &#8212; designed to appeal to modern-day consumers looking for an affordable, yet stylish vehicle that can be used for work, play and every task in between.</p>
<p>River, founded in late 2020 by Aravind Mani and Vipin George with $2 million in backing from Maniv Mobility and TrucksVC, has grown to 42 people in its short life. Its small and growing team, who hail from companies like Ather, Arai, Bosch, Honda, Ultraviolette and Vespa, have developed a prototype vehicle that will be unveiled to consumers later this year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220972" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Both founders also have experience in two-wheeled transport. Mani, an engineer who once worked in the petrochemicals industry before switching to electrified transportation, was most recently vice president of business strategy at Ultraviolette before he left to form River. George worked at Honda R&amp;D in India for eight years, including as head designer, and most recently was design lead at Ultraviolette.</p>
<p>The pair wanted a two-wheeler robust enough to be used as a tool for work or any other task while amping up the performance and style to make it useful and fun for all of the other hours in the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;A parallel would be the truck culture in the United States; if you&#8217;re carpenter or shop owner you have a truck, which you use to carry stuff and it&#8217;s also your primary mode of commute,&#8221; Mani said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have anything similar on the two-wheeler space in India, and that&#8217;s what we want to create.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the same time, Mani noted the vehicle also had to have personality because &#8220;in India it is still a status purchase that you want to show off to your friends; it is a first symbol that you have arrived in life for many people owning a two wheeler.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2221138" style="width: 463px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/River_Frontview.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221138" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2221138 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/River_Frontview.jpg?w=453" alt="River front view of two wheeler electric vehicle" width="453" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/River_Frontview.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/River_Frontview.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/River_Frontview.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/River_Frontview.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/River_Frontview.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/River_Frontview.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/River_Frontview.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/River_Frontview.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2221138" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> River</p></div></p>
<p>What they came up with is a &#8220;multi-utility&#8221; two-wheeled electric scooter codenamed the RX-1 that is available in several battery pack sizes that can travel between 100 km (62 miles) and 180 km (112 miles) on a single charge.</p>
<p>The vehicle can accelerate from zero to 40 kilometers per hour (25 mph) in 4 seconds and has a top speed of 80 kmph (50 mph). And because its main focus is as a multi-utility vehicle, it has a payload of 200 kilograms, enough for a rider to carry packages.</p>
<p>The price, which depends on the battery pack, ranges between 80,000 INR ($1,070) and 100,000 INR ($1,337).</p>
<p>River&#8217;s launch comes at a fruitful yet fiercely competitive moment in India.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s government, keen to accelerate the adoption of EVs in an effort to get away from polluting gas and diesel powered vehicles, have increased subsidies for electric two-wheelers made in the country. India&#8217;s Department of Heavy Industries <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/electric-2-wheeler-firms-see-subsidy-pushing-adoption/articleshow/83493217.cms?from=mdr">now offers incentives</a> that provides Rs 15,000 ($200) per kilowatt-hour. The cap on subsidies has also doubled to 40% of the price of the vehicle.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is also an effort by e-commerce and delivery companies, including Flipkart, Swiggy and Zomato to electrify fleets. Zomato to have EV-only fleets by the end of the decade. Startup Swiggy announced in August it would <a href="https://yourstory.com/2021/08/swiggy-aims-8-lakh-kms-per-day-through-electric-vehicles-2025/amp">cover 800,000 kilometers</a> (497,000 miles) every day via electric vehicles by 2025.  In February, Walmart-owned Flipkart said it would deploy more than 25,000 electric vehicles in its supply chain by 2030.</p>
<p>&#8220;About 60% to 70% of the country is self employed and two wheelers are a basic part of the Indian livelihood,&#8221; co-founder Aravind Mani said in an interview, adding that e-commerce has driven growth with an estimated 14 million fleet delivery riders in India today. &#8220;COVID has actually accelerated this trend, and on demand services are continuously increasing.&#8221;</p>
<p>These opportunities have fueled the launch of hundreds of EV startups. There are more than 470 EV companies registered in India, according to March 2021 research note from Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.</p>
<p>&#8220;The gold rush to capture this emerging opportunity has commenced,&#8221; the report from managing director and senior analyst Venugopal Garre said. &#8220;A few will get acquired, several will perish, some will remain low scale niche OEMs, but we think a few will scale up materially.&#8221;</p>
<p>River is going up against bigger and better funded competitors like Ola Electric, Bounce and Aether Energy as well as dozens of smaller outfits. But River&#8217;s co-founders contend their new vehicle and business model fills a gap in the market.</p>
<p>River plans to sell directly to consumers and offer a suite of subscription services and an array of accessories that lets owners customize their scooters and remove them there needs change throughout the day. Sales are expected to begin in the second half of 2022.</p>
<p>The company plans to offer charging, battery packs that will range in size, maintenance and connectivity packages offered through subscriptions. River is not going to take on the costly task of building out charging infrastructure. Instead, the company plans to operate a charging franchise system. Mani said the company is already working set of small businesses that might buy the vehicles and chargers and open up the chargers for public use.</p>
<p>River wants to sell its scooters directly to businesses like restaurants as well as to fleet operators and even larger ecommerce companies that can sell to consumers.</p>
<p>The startup will assemble the scooters at what Mani described as &#8220;small scale manufacturing facilities&#8221; that can turnout around 3,000 vehicles a month. If successful, River wants to create a number of these facilities throughout India. Mani said River has reached initial agreements with several suppliers, including for the co-development and assembly of its battery packs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://stationf.co">Station F</a>, the big startup campus located in Paris, is launching an online component called <a href="https://launch.stationf.co">Launch by Station F</a>. With this new program, entrepreneurs from anywhere can get started and learn all the basics to start a company.</p>
<p>Launched in 2017, Station F is a massive building that used to be a rail freight depot. It has become a flagship entity for the tech community in France with hundreds of startups working from there.</p>
<p>“From day one, Station F has always been about making life easier for entrepreneurs,” Station F director Roxanne Varza said at the launch event earlier today.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221557" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>There are many ways to join the Station F community. And yet, Station F still has to turn down most applications. Right now, around 9% of entrepreneurs applying to a Station F program get accepted. That’s why Station F is launching Launch.</p>
<p>“Launch is a new way to become an entrepreneur. It’s a fully online program, which means you can access it from anywhere in the world,” Varza said. “It’s literally all the basics to start a company. By the time you finish this program, you should understand all that crazy jargon.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221563" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221563" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/directory.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" class="size-full wp-image-2221563" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/directory.png 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/directory.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/directory.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/directory.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/directory.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/directory.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221563" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Station F</p></div></p>
<p>There are three basic building bricks behind Launch — content, tools and community.</p>
<p>The Station F team has created a ton of videos and articles by talking with some well-known entrepreneurs and investors in the startup community in France. This content will help you understand the tech industry.</p>
<p>People joining the Launch program will also be able to access a collection of essential tools to build a startups with free trials and free tiers. Tools include Notion, Asana, Shopify, Bubble and Qonto.</p>
<p>Finally, the program is based on peer-to-peer feedback. Members can talk to each other in a Slack community, browse a directory of people and more. But the most powerful peer-to-peer component is that you have to give feedback to people when you’re going through the program.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Throughout the program, you’ll be going through the steps of building a pitch deck. It’s really about asking yourself the right questions about the business,” Varza said. And other members will give you feedback on your pitchdeck.</p>
<p>Launch costs €9.90 per month and users can cancel whenever they want. Station F hopes it can attract 5,000 to 10,000 members.</p>
<p>And Station F’s diversity partners, such as Singa, Les Déterminés, La French Tech Tremplin and the Fighters Program, will be able to access the service for free.</p>
<p>With this new online program, Station F is focusing on online education. While a ton of people want to start a startup, there’s still a steep learning curve to get started.</p>
<p>People who complete the Launch program won’t necessarily create a startup. But at least they’ll be able to have a conversation about the business model of a startup, product-market fit and more.</p>

<h2>An update on Station F</h2>
<p>Station F currently hosts dozens of different startup programs. Some programs are managed by partners, while others are managed by the Station F team directly.</p>
<p>Current partners include Ubisoft, Microsoft, Facebook and HEC Paris. Each program selects a batch of startups that can come and work from Station F. In addition to office space, they can network and get some perks from both partners and Station F. Today, Station F announced two new partners — <a href="https://42.fr">Ecole 42</a> and <a href="https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en">CentraleSupélec</a>.</p>
<p>“We also manage our own in-house programs and we have three of them,” Station F head of startup programs Marwan Elfitesse said.</p>
<p>There’s the Founders Program, which was announced back in 2016 when Varza <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/05/with-station-f-paris-will-have-the-worlds-biggest-startup-campus/">unveiled Station F at TechCrunch Disrupt</a>. With this program, pre-seed and seed startups working across any vertical can apply.</p>
<p>“It’s a program designed by entrepreneurs, for entrepreneurs, from day one. The whole selection process is managed by entrepreneurs,” Elfitesse said. There are 130 well-known entrepreneurs who currently participate in the selection process.</p>
<p>Station F also runs the Fighters Program. It is designed specifically for entrepreneurs coming from underprivileged backgrounds. “Good and great entrepreneurs can come from any background,” Elfitesse said.</p>
<p>So far, four cohorts of startups have participated in the Fighters Program. Station F is currently working on the fifth batch. For the first time, Station F is adding a sponsor to this program. TikTok is going to sponsor the Fighters Program’s next batch.</p>
<p>Finally, Station F <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/station-f-launches-femtech-program-on-its-startup-campus/">recently unveiled</a> a third in-house program, the FemTech Program. As the name suggests, this program is going to be focused on companies working on female health, women’s sexual health and more.</p>
<p>“When we looked at the topic, we thought it was both an opportunity and that startups urgently needed some help,” Varza told me <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/station-f-launches-femtech-program-on-its-startup-campus/">at the time</a>. “It’s still a little-known category, it’s still a taboo subject.”</p>
<p>The first batch of companies in the FemTech program will join the campus next month.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[FlixMobility, the $3 billion-German transportation startup that has doubled down on long distance buses and slowly and quietly gobbled up transit lines and operations across Europe, today announced a big move to raise its game in the U.S. The company announced that it is acquiring Greyhound Lines, the iconic U.S. bus network, from UK-based owner [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://global.flixbus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FlixMobility</a>, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/flixmobility-raises-650m-at-a-3b-valuation-to-double-down-on-buses-and-other-transport-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3 billion</a>-German transportation startup that has doubled down on long distance buses and slowly and quietly gobbled up transit lines and operations across Europe, today <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211020006200/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a big move to raise its game in the U.S. The company announced that it is acquiring Greyhound Lines, the iconic U.S. bus network, from UK-based owner FirstGroup. Flix said the deal &#8212; which includes a vehicle fleet, trademarks, and related assets and liabilities &#8212; has an enterprise value on a debt-free / cash-free basis of $46 million, with an unconditional deferred consideration of $32 million with an interest rate of 5% per annum alongside that.*</p>
<p>FirstGroup acquired Greyhound back in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/09/transportintheuk.usnews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2007</a> in a bigger $3.6 billion deal, part of a bigger strategy to take on the U.S. market (it also bought Ryder, the yellow school bus network, around the same time). But more recently it has been divesting a number of its U.S. assets in a bid to focus more on the U.K. market. It had in fact been looking to sell the assets Flix has now acquired since 2019. FirstGroup <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-55497587" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hived off its Greyhound facilities last December</a> for $138 million, and in <a href="https://eqtgroup.com/news/2021/eqt-infrastructure-to-acquire-first-student-and-first-transit-the-market-leading-providers-of-essential-north-american-transportation-services-for-usd-4.6bn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April</a> sold off the bulk of the rest of the business to EQT, but that did not include the Greyhound transit network.</p>
<p>The deal signifies a huge move for Flix to double down not just on bus transport, but the U.S. market, where it was already active but with a significantly smaller profile. FlixBus, as the service is known, is today active in more than 2,500 destinations in 36 countries outside the U.S., working across 400,000 daily connections. Greyhound is actually nearly as big: it covers 2,400 destinations in North America, with almost 16 million passengers annually. (Flix&#8217;s last reported customer numbers were from 2019, pre-pandemic, and were more 62 million; those figures would have drastically dropped in recent times given distancing and travel restrictions around Covid-19, which could be one reason why it does not provide more updated numbers.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221545" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The deal is not about expanding Flix&#8217;s network, but also presence and mindshare. Greyhound is nothing short of an iconic presence. In a country fixated on travel, it has figured in <a href="https://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/i-need-help-with-songs-that-mention-greyhound-buses.264464/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dozens of famous songs</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/search/keyword/?keywords=greyhound-bus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">films</a> and <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artwork/berenice-abbott-greyhound-bus-terminal-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other art forms</a>, albeit not always in the most flattering of lights.</p>
<p>And that somewhat extended to the business, too: Greyhound was a waning part of FirstGroup&#8217;s profitability, although Flix would argue that there is still a lot of mileage (sorry) left in long-distance bus transport &#8212; a profile that it believed, even as many stopped traveling anywhere, increased during the pandemic as it presented itself as a lower-cost form of travel at a time when gas prices have gone up, and air travel was too expensive or too difficult to manage, yet people still needed to get from A to B.</p>
<p>This is also where Flix&#8217;s tech comes into play. Like other transportation startups such as Uber but also those that have focused on longer-distance journeys like BlaBlaCar, Flix&#8217;s approach has been to take a legacy service &#8212; in this case buses (it also operates trains) &#8212; and apply better algorithms to determine pricing and routing and timing for the different buses on the network. Indeed, it has often been referred to as the &#8220;Uber of buses.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also generally does not own its fleet, working with third-party independent bus companies to operate vehicles that it brands itself. (I think it&#8217;s very unlikely to drop the Greyhound branding altogether however, given the iconic status of it.) However, this deal appears to represent a shift in that strategy. When the company raised its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/flixmobility-raises-650m-at-a-3b-valuation-to-double-down-on-buses-and-other-transport-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monster $650 round</a> earlier this year &#8212; a round it specifically said would be used to expand in the U.S., a long-desired frontier for the startup &#8212; we raised the question of whether it would, longer term, continue to pursue a model where it does not directly own buses, but instead works with third parties that take on that capital investment themselves (not unlike Uber). The Greyhound deal will include a fleet so it may well be moving further into that realm now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jochen Engert, FlixMobility&#8217;s co-founder and co-CEO said in a statement: “The continuous expansion of our services through partnerships and acquisitions has always been an integral part of our growth strategy to build our global presence. The acquisition of Greyhound is a major step forward in the US. The FlixBus and Greyhound teams share a common vision to make smart, affordable and sustainable mobility accessible to all.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Consumers across North America are increasingly seeking affordable, comfortable, smart and sustainable mobility solutions. A compelling offering will draw significantly more travellers away from private cars to shared coach mobility,&#8221; added André Schwämmlein, another co-founder and co-CEO of FlixMobility, in a statement. &#8220;Together, FlixBus and Greyhound will be better able to meet this increased demand. As our business continues to recover from the effects of the pandemic, we will replicate the success that we have already achieved in 36 countries outside of the US with our innovative and customer centric approach.”</p>
<p>*The more specific details of the transaction, as described to me by a Flix spokesperson:</p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400;">
<li><em>The Transaction results in cash consideration to the Group of $172m, comprising $140m paid initially, with $32m in unconditional deferred consideration paid in instalments over eighteen months</em></li>
<li><em>Greyhound properties with an estimated net market value of c.$176m will be retained by FirstGroup; they will initially be leased back to Greyhound at market rates but are expected to be sold over the next three to five years</em></li>
<li><em>FirstGroup also retains certain legacy Greyhound net liabilities, including pension, self-insurance, and finance leases settled at closing, which in total were valued at $320m as at 27 March 2021, as well as grant receivables, buyout premia and other items estimated at a net cost of c.$47m, against which the Group had retained $197m of proceeds from the sale of First Student and First Transit earlier in the year</em></li>
<li><em>The $140m of Greyhound initial cash proceeds will be retained by the Group to support the close-out of these legacy liabilities and related net costs, with the balance of the property proceeds and deferred consideration resulting in c.$178m (c.£128m) in net value for the Group being realised over time</em></li>
<li><em>The Transaction is not subject to any closing conditions and will complete today</em></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just over five months after raising </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/argentinas-pomelo-raises-9m-to-build-a-new-payments-infrastructure-for-latam-fintechs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $9 million seed funding round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Latin American fintech Pomelo announced today that it is raising $35 million in Series A financing led by Tiger Global Management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup was founded earlier this year to build a fintech-as-a-service platform for Latin America. Its infrastructure aims to allow fintechs and embedded finance players to launch virtual accounts and issue prepaid and credit cards via “compliant” onboarding processes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s impressive just how many high-profile investors the young company has managed to attract in a relatively short amount of time.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221398" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides Tiger, a slew of venture capital firms also participated in the Series A, including Insight Partners, Index Ventures, monashees, SciFi, QED Investors, BoxGroup, Greyhound, Gilgamesh Ventures and Clocktower. A number of notable angels have also invested in the company, such as Affirm founder Max Levchin, Biz Stone, Martin Varsavski, Jackie Reses, a16z’s Angela Strange, N26’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Max Tayenthal, Plaid co-founder William Hockey, Ramp co-founders Eric Glyman and Karim Atiyeh and Unit co-founder and CEO Itai Damti.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding event comes after Pomelo raised a $1 million extension to its seed round in June that included participation from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sequoia Capital, Checkout’s Guillaume Pousaz, GGV’s Hans Tung and GoCardless’ Matt Robinson. The financing marked Sequoia&#8217;s first investment as part of its </span><a href="https://medium.com/sequoia-capital/the-latin-american-startup-opportunity-46ace259777f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renewed interest in Latin America</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after taking a break from investing in the region and having previously backed the likes of Nubank and Rappi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven-month-old Pomelo may be in its early stages but it has so far landed four customers, including three fintechs and one embedded finance player. The remote-first fintech started in Argentina and has since launched operations and offices in Brazil and Mexico with plans to also expand to Chile and Colombia. In Argentina, it was granted a Mastercard and payments license.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why global investors are flocking to back Latin American startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/why-global-investors-are-flocking-to-back-latin-american-startups/embed/#?secret=FjV0nHLrE1" data-secret="FjV0nHLrE1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cards have an estimated payments volume of $900 billion per year, and yet 95% of these transactions are being processed by local incumbents, asserts Pomelo. This is a problem the company’s founders experienced firsthand in previous roles, and are eager to solve by creating a new payments infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know from previous experiences…that building a fintech, and particularly issuing cards, in Latin America is a real nightmare,” said Pomelo co-founder and CEO Gaston Irigoyen at the time of the company’s last raise. “It takes anywhere from 12 to 18 months to launch a simple prepaid card, and unfortunately companies have to go through the painful experience of repeating the process in every market where they operate.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pomelo’s goal is to solve the problem by creating a new generation of financial services infrastructure that allows companies to build a fintech business and launch cards “much faster” throughout Latin America, which Irigoyen said is home to a financial services infrastructure that is “completely obsolete and highly fragmented.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup claims that its API-driven platform gives companies a way to build compliant onboarding processes, launch virtual accounts that are connected to the local financial systems and issue debit and credit cards throughout Latin America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Each market has its own regulation and nuances, and legacy providers offer poor technology </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at expensive prices,” he said. “Most founders and technical teams are frustrated with the status quo and can’t scale their products fast enough given the lack of regional solutions. Our goal at Pomelo is to make LatAm look like Europe, meaning that we’ll help our partners unlock multiple markets in a short period of time, allowing them to grow their businesses instead of worrying about regulation, dozens of contracts and backend integrations.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiger Global partner John Curtius notes what we have also observed here at TechCrunch: that LatAm’s tech scene is “booming” and some emerging startups are working to transform entire industries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve seen some amazing consumer products disrupt consumer banking, lending and insurance in recent years,” Curtius said in a written statement. “We are now excited to partner with Pomelo given their unique perspective about LatAm, their vision for a new regional fintech infrastructure, and a strong team capable of executing with the highest standards.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presently, Pomelo has 100 employees, including people who have previously worked at Mercado Pago, Amazon Payments, Mastercard, Nubank, D-Local, Lime and N26. Its goal is to hire another 150 employees by the end of 2022, according to Irigoyen, who was an early employee at Google LatAm. He is also a third-time founder, with two previous exits (including one to TripAdvisor) and former CEO of Naranja X, one of Argentina’s largest neobanks.</span></p>
<p>(Side note: Pomelo says it gives stock options to all employees, which is somewhat rare in LatAm)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also plans to use its new capital to accelerate its product road map and toward business development efforts.</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a week of fintech infrastructure-related investments in Latin America. On Wednesday, we covered Brazil&#8217;s Hash, a payment infrastructure fintech, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/brazils-hash-raises-40m-in-round-led-by-qed-and-kaszek-for-its-white-label-payments-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising $40 million in a Series C funding round</a> co-led by QED Investors and Kaszek. We also reported on São Paulo-based Pismo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/softbank-amazon-and-accel-back-brazilian-banking-and-payments-infrastructure-provider-pismo-in-108m-round/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closing on $108 million</a> in a Series B funding round co-led by SoftBank, e-commerce giant Amazon and Silicon Valley-based venture firm Accel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/16/lokal-news-yc/">hyperlocal social media platform Lokal</a> has raised $12 million in a new round of financing led by Chinese internet conglomerate Tencent, according to a source familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Existing investors 3one4 Capital, Y Combinator, and India Quotient have also participated in the Bangalore-based startup’s Series A, the source said, requesting anonymity as the matter is private.</p>
<p>Tencent and Lokal did not respond to a request for comment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221535" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to estimates, there are over 400 million non-English speaking Indians who are online today. For them, the internet’s offerings are very limited as there aren’t many services that have been built to serve such users &#8212; and many don’t have any offering for such large masses at all.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.getlokalapp.com">Lokal</a> is attempting to reach these users and provide them with a broad range of services. Its eponymous hyperlocal social media app enables non-English speaking users to connect and interact with one another.</p>
<p>The app also helps users find jobs in their vicinity, and keeps them up to date with things such as commodity prices, real estate prices, and matrimonial ads that you would otherwise find in local newspapers. Its offerings also include upskilling services.</p>
<p>The startup says on its website that it has amassed over 10 million downloads and is popular in several states in South India.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new investment comes more than a year and a half after New Delhi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/to-avoid-hostile-takeovers-amid-covid-19-india-mandates-approvals-on-chinese-investments/">introduced rules</a> to require that Indian firms take its approval before raising capital from a Chinese investor. The move significantly slowed down Chinese firms&#8217; investment pace in India. But in recent months, several firms have raised from Tencent.</p>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/tencent-in-talks-to-lead-funding-in-indias-pocket-fm/">reported in August</a> that India&#8217;s Pocket FM was in advanced talks to raise a round from Tencent and others. The Chinese giant, which has <a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/09/tencent-china-debt-india-startups-vc-investments/">invested over $2 billion in Indian startups</a> since 2016, also invested over $200 million in Indian social media platform ShareChat earlier this year, though the startup didn&#8217;t disclose Tencent&#8217;s involvement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/sharechat-valued-at-2-1b-in-502-million-fundraise/">at the time of announcement</a>.</p>
<p>The firm, which also poured in more money in Indian music streaming service Gaana, has made several recent investments in Indian firms as convertible debts to buy the parties time for approval and give Tencent the option to convert its debt into an equity investment in future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small and medium enterprises make up more than 95% of all businesses in Nigeria. But despite their sheer size and importance, a majority of them are underserved by financial institutions and lack the full suite of financial services needed to scale their operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from full-stack financial needs, including credit, small and medium businesses </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">require</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> other essential resources to understand their financial operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.trybrass.com/about/">Brass</a> is a Nigerian fintech tackling these challenges by providing banking services to small and medium businesses. The company has secured a $1.7 million funding round to scale its offerings for &#8220;local entrepreneurs, traders and fast-growing businesses.&#8221;</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220883" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sakindolu">Sola Akindolu</a> and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/emmanix2002">Emmanuel Okeke</a> founded Brass in July 2020. Before Brass, CEO Akindolu was</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the head of product at YC-backed Kudi, while CTO Okeke was an engineering manager at Stripe subsidiary Paystack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akindolu&#8217;s work at Kudi opened his eyes to the problems small and medium businesses face in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He explained that he found out how hard it was for these businesses to have seamless financial operations and cash-flow support services integral to tracking vendor payments, money movement and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overall</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> business health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But why start Brass when there are existing products in the Nigerian market that SMEs and entrepreneurs can use?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/uzoma-dozies-sparkle-raises-3-1m-for-personal-business-neobank-play-in-nigeria/">Sparkle</a>, for instance, offers both personal and business banking services (with more priority on the latter)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer neobanks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/nigerian-digital-bank-carbon-hit-240m-in-payments-processed-last-year-up-89-from-2019/">Carbon</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/kuda-the-african-challenger-bank-raises-55m-at-a-500m-valuation/">Kuda</a> are in varying stages of offering business features to SMEs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/nigerias-prospa-gets-3-8m-pre-seed-to-offer-small-businesses-banking-and-software-services/">Prospa</a>, a YC-backed company that doesn&#8217;t like to think of itself as a neobank, also provides software and banking services to microbusinesses and freelancers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akindolu believes that while these products have their entry points into the SME market, they do not capture the entire banking needs of businesses like Brass.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are many ways money can get out of the business, be it payroll, vendor payment, invoicing. We want to support businesses&#8217; cash flow; we want to support them in those areas to make sure that money keeps running and they can keep growing their business,&#8221; Akindolu said, describing Brass&#8217; application. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So that&#8217;s, for the most part, what we&#8217;re doing with Brass today: financial operations and cash flow support</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brass offers a suite of products &#8212; credit and payment services, payroll and expense management, API support, cash-flow analytics, team and contact management, other core business services such as POS, debit and credit cards &#8212; all wrapped around a business bank account. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of all these features, Brass is betting big on credit with Brass Capital, a space already heating up with other platforms such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/float-wants-to-provide-liquidity-to-african-smbs-in-a-way-never-done-before/">Float</a>, which provides working capital and software services to businesses. That said, Brass Capital has done quite well in a short amount of time; the cash-flow financing service claims to have disbursed more than $2 million in credit after being used for six months by two dozen Brass customers in private beta.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akindolu told TechCrunch that the company would make the service available to the public soon</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brass says that many of its clients use the platform as their default money-operation service provider</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fintech makes money from providing credit and API calls on its regular product offering, said the CEO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has over 5,000 customers ranging from schools and malls to restaurants and fintechs such as Eden and Mono, which use its complete banking solution. And u</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nlike other platforms, Brass is trying to optimize its platform for different levels of businesses with varying needs at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What we&#8217;ve set out to do is to build stacks of financial operation services. We may be overkill for a micro business; they might not find us useful, so we&#8217;re more concerned about small and medium-sized businesses.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mission to make banking work for small businesses was one reason why pan-African VC firm Ventures Platform invested in the company, according to its founder and general partner, Kola Aina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investors include Flutterwave CEO Olugbenga &#8220;GB&#8221; Agboola, Paystack co-founder Ezra Olubi, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/hustle-fund-wants-to-help-spawn-a-new-generation-of-angel-investors/">Hustle Fund</a>, Acuity Ventures and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/japans-uncovered-fund-launches-15m-fund-to-back-early-stage-startups-in-africa/">Uncovered Fund</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to back Sola and the Brass team, who are providing critical financial technology to Africa&#8217;s businesses, starting with Nigeria&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">approximately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 41.5 million businesses,&#8221; said Elizabeth Yin, the general partner at Hustle Fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Nigeria that access to comprehensive banking solutions services continues to be one of the most significant constraints for SMEs &#8212; it&#8217;s most major economies in Africa. Indeed, the continent&#8217;s formal SME sector has an annual financing gap of over <a href="https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/11/african-smes-face-136bn-financing-gap-annually-ifc/">$136 billion</a>, although they account for over 80% of employed people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, Akindolu affirmed that Brass would use part of the financing to take its business to Kenya and South Africa by next year (it has finalized incorporation in the former). Integral to driving its expansion plans across Africa is a partnership with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Flutterwave</a>, the one-year-old company said in a statement. Brass also plans to diversify its customer base by launching more product categories, especially around credit in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">its markets.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the pandemic turning us into delivery experts, consumers have also switched on to meal-kits on droves, given that it combines both delivery and home cooking. But many meal kits can be inflexible.</p>
<p>The Kitchenful startup in Germany realized this and so it allows users to browse recipes from food bloggers and have personalized meal plans created, adjustable to preferences and dietary requirements. Kitchenful’s other offering is that it tries to be affordable as well, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/kitchenful-combines-meal-planning-with-a-grocery-concierge-service/">we wrote earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>After going through the Y-Combinator Summer 2021 program, it has now raised a $1.9M funding round from VentureFriends, Goodwater Capital, and Jabbar Internet Group.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219781" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Previous investors include Y-Combinator and angels such as Valentin Stalf (Co-Founder and CEO of N26), Samih Toukan (Co-founder at Souq), David Fischer (HighSnobiety), Maik Ludewig (MD of DurstExpress), and Victor Henning (Co-Founder of Mendeley).</p>
<p>Co-Founders Chris Schiller and Christian Hartung now plan to expand into the EU and North America.</p>
<p>Schiller previously spent 4 years as Vice President of Product at Hello Fresh, and both he and Hartung were formerly at Rocket Internet.</p>
<p>Schiller said: “We believe that cooking at home should be simple, fun, and personal. However in today’s world “What’s for dinner” is still a nerve-wracking question, and grocery shopping costs millions of people time and energy every single day. We are fixing this with our new service and the ambition to become the leading brand for cooking at home in the United States and Europe.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apostolos Apostolakis, Co-Founder and Partner at VentureFriends, said: “Online grocery is currently being disrupted and we see a trend of commoditization of delivery services itself which makes the adjacent layers that help to decide what to actually buy ever more relevant. With the founders’ highly relevant backgrounds Kitchenful is in a promising position to become a leading brand in the cook at home space.”</p>
<p>Kitchenful is likely to meet stiff opposition from other new players in this space <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/lollipop-ai-launches-online-grocery-marketplace-where-you-can-build-your-own-recipes/">such as Lollipop</a>.</p>
