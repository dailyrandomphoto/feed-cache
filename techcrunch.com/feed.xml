										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">According to the World Bank, more than one billion people in South and East Asia <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/Research/GlobalFindex/PDF/N2Unbanked.pdf">lack access to a bank account</a>. For many, this makes it is difficult to secure loans and other services because they don’t have traditional financial records like a credit score. <a href="https://www.jeff-app.com/">Jeff</a>’s loan brokerage platform was created to make it easier for financial service providers to integrate alternative data scoring, allowing them reach more potential borrowers.</p>
<p>The startup, which launched its app in Vietnam last year, announced today it has raised $1 million, led by the Estonian Business Angels Network (EstBAN). The funding will be used to enter other Southeast Asian markets, including Indonesia and the Philippines, and introduce new products, like free credit score and insurance offers, digital discount coupons and mobile wallet cashbacks. Other participants in the round included Startup Wise Guys; Taavi Tamkivi, the founder of Salv who formerly held lead roles at TransferWise and Skype; and angel investors from European on-demand ride platform Bolt.</p>
<p>Jeff currently claims more than 300,000 users in Vietnam. Though it is based in Latvia, Jeff will continue focusing on unbanked people in South and Southeast Asia, said founder and chief executive officer Toms Niparts. Its goal is to build a &#8220;super app&#8221; that combines personalized loan comparisons with other services like e-commerce, mobile top-ups and online discounts, Niparts told TechCrunch in an email.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Before starting Jeff, Niparts was CEO of Spain for Digital Finance International, a fintech company that is part of the Finstar Financial Group, which has investments in more than 30 countries. This gave Niparts the chance to &#8220;learn about the similarities and differences of financial services from the inside in different markets,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In particular, he saw that in Southeast Asian countries, most loan applicants &#8220;were rejected not because of bad credit history, low income or other similar reasons, but because there was not enough data about them.&#8221; While some lending companies have developed pilot projects for alternative data scoring, the process is often time-consuming, complicated and expensive.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a massive problem in a big part of the world, and it makes absolute sense to build it as a centralised solution,&#8221; Niparts said.</p>
<p>In Vietnam, Jeff currently has between 12 to 15 active partners at a time (the number changes because lenders occasionally turn off demand, a standard industry practice), and is adding another eight to 10. In total, the company now has about 80 to 100 potential partners in its Vietnam pipeline, and part of its new funding will be used to expand its team to speed up the onboarding process.</p>
<p>In Indonesia, Jeff has identified about 40 potential partners, &#8220;but so far we have only been scratching the surface,&#8221; said Niparts. &#8220;The Indonesian market is considerably larger than what we have seen in Vietnam, and the forecast is we will grow the pipeline to 150-200 banks and partners in 2021.&#8221;</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s selling point hinges on its ability to accurately measure creditworthiness based on alternative data. For lenders, this means more pre-qualified leads and access to a larger customer segment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Building a credit score is a never-ending process, and we are at the very early stages of it. What we have right now is mainly around publicly accessible information and client-consented data,&#8221; Niparts said. This includes behavioral analytics, smart devices meta data, data from social media and other sources that have open APIs.</p>
<p>As Jeff grows, it also plans to make partnerships with mobile wallets, telecom companies and consumer apps. It is developing a lender toolkit that includes bank portal and lender API to reduce the amount of time needed to integrate with the app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2128827" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jeff-App-v3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128827" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2128827" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jeff-App-v3.jpg" alt="Loan brokerage app Jeff's onboarding chatbot, shown on a smartphone display" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jeff-App-v3.jpg 4500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jeff-App-v3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jeff-App-v3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jeff-App-v3.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jeff-App-v3.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jeff-App-v3.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jeff-App-v3.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jeff-App-v3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2128827" class="wp-caption-text">Jeff&#8217;s onboarding chatbot</p></div></p>
<p>Borrowers sign up for Jeff with the app&#8217;s chatbot and can start getting offers once they enter basic information like their name, contact information, the amount they want to borrow and the purpose of the loan. But adding more details and data sources to their profiles, which are screened by multiple lenders at once, increases their chances of approval, and unlocks more offers. This may include uploading documents, connecting social media accounts or consenting to share their smart device metadata.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we evolve, new integrations and compatible accounts from other service providers—such as utilities, food delivery, and more—will be regularly added,&#8221; said Niparts.</p>
<p>Jeff’s partners currently offer near-prime, peer-to-peer and digital lending services that include unsecured consumer loans, installment loans and motorbike financing. It plans to add more loan products, and is also working on its first insurance collaborations, credit cards and other bank-grade products.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our ambition for Jeff is to become a super app, where people can not only get access to financial services that were previously unavailable to them, but also tap in other benefits and discounts,&#8221; Niparts said. &#8220;This is also a great way to learn more about creditworthiness and what’s on demand. Every new interactions gives us more data and insights to further evolve the accuracy and value added of Jeff’s credit score.&#8221;</p>
<p>The number of fintech startups focused on financial inclusion is <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/fintech-startups-southeast-asia-market-map-expert-intelligence/">on the rise across Southeast Asia</a>. Jeff&#8217;s competitors fall into two main categories. The first are comparison portals like TopBank, TheBank and GoBear (which recently <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/financial-services-firm-gobear-closing-business">announced it is closing</a>), that allow users to compare financial providers and banks, but don’t focus on enabling them to access services. The second are companies like CredoLab, Seon and Kalap that provide third-party services like single data-source insights and fraud prevention, but &#8220;do not have control over the customer journey,&#8221; Nipsart said.</p>
<p>Jeff’s goal is to &#8220;be a one-stop shop for both,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We provide both clients, as well as deeper insights about them for banks and other partners using our platform. At the same time, we are the main point of interaction for the users, which not only solves the main need of comparing financial services and accessing them, but also offers an increasing range of other discounts and benefits.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sending money from the U.S. to Nigeria can be a painstaking process. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For remittance platforms like Western Union, it will cost a transfer fee and take between one to five business days for money sent from a U.S. debit card to enter a Nigerian bank account</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto remittance platforms are rising to the challenge of fixing these cross-border payment issues by reducing time and fees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> yesterday, we talked about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/these-undergraduates-left-university-to-build-flux-a-payments-startup-now-in-yc/">Flux</a>, a Nigerian fintech solving this problem in the present YC W2021 batch. Today, another YC-backed startup, <a href="https://www.afriexapp.com/">Afriex</a> &#8212; but from the Summer 2020 batch &#8212; is raising a $1.2 million seed round. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/topealabi">Tope Alabi</a> and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/obirije-john-a2403310a">John Obirije</a> in 2019 provides instant, zero-fee transfers to Africans at home and in the diaspora</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It allows users to deposit cash on the app, send money to a bank account or another user, and withdraw money to a connected bank or debit card</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like other crypto remittance platforms, Afriex has built its business on stablecoins &#8212; cryptocurrency backed by the dollar</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In essence, the company buys cryptocurrency in one country and sells it in another to offer better exchange rates</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is in contrast to better-known platforms like Western Union and Wise that use traditional banking systems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year while the startup graduated from YC, it claimed to be processing about $500,000 per month in transaction fees and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in over 30 countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, Afriex was only present in Nigeria and the U.S. But having started operations in Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda, Afriex claims to be processing millions of dollars each month</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On its website, though, Afriex states that customers can only send money to and from Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Canada, and the U.S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the new investment, the Lagos and San Francisco-based startup is looking to scale up by growing the team and expanding to other markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pan-African VC firm <a href="https://www.launchafrica.vc/">Launch Africa</a> led the seed round. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investors include Y Combinator, SoftBank Opportunity Fund, Future Africa, Brightstone VC, Processus Capital, Uncommon Ventures, A$AP Capital, Precursor Ventures, and Ivernet Holdings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Angel investors like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russell Smith, Mandela Schumacher-Hodge Dixon, Furqan Rydhan, and Andrea Vaccari also took part</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://theopportunityfund.com/">SoftBank Opportunity Fund</a>, a subsidiary of the SoftBank Group, targets founders of color in the U.S. running early-stage startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching in June 2020, it has invested in 22 startups and Afriex seems to be the only one catering to a set of users in the US and another continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is due to Alabi&#8217;s upbringing as an immigrant child who has had a mix of both worlds. It</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was difficult to send money to Nigeria and his experience as a blockchain developer at Consensys made him realize he could solve a problem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We would go back home every two years and even then, I would always take note of what was missing and what could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be improved</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I would find myself having to pay for foreign expenses with money that was sitting in a US bank account,” said Alabi. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Traditional remittance companies were so slow and expensive that I knew I could do it better with crypto</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Remittance is the best and most important use case for crypto. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our goal is to build the world&#8217;s largest remittance company, starting with emerging markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While much of the recent wave of relentless hype around NFTs &#8212; or non-fungible tokens &#8212; has been most visibly manifested in high-dollar art auctions or digital trading cards sales, there&#8217;s also been a relentless string of chatter among bullish investors who see a future that ties the tokens to the future of social media and creator monetization.</p>
<p>Much of the most spirited conversations have centered on a pre-launch project called <a href="https://bitclout.com/">BitClout</a>, a social crypto-exchange where users can buy and sell tokens based on people&#8217;s reputations. The app, which launches out of private beta tomorrow morning, has already courted plenty of controversy inside the crypto community, but it&#8217;s also amassed quite a war chest as investors pump tens of millions into its proprietary currency.</p>
<p>Early backers of the platform&#8217;s BitClout currency include a who&#8217;s who of Silicon Valley investors including Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, the startup&#8217;s founder tells TechCrunch. Other investors include Chamath Palihapitiya&#8217;s Social Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Winklevoss Capital and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. A report in <a href="https://decrypt.co/62162/bitclout-reaped-160m-tokens-pegged-celebs-followed-money">Decrypt</a> notes that a single wallet connected to BitClout has received more than $165 million worth of Bitcoin deposits suggesting that huge sums have already poured into the network ahead of its public launch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>BitClout falls into an exploding category of crypto companies that are focusing on tokenized versions of social currency. Others working on building out these individual tokens include <a href="https://tryroll.com/">Roll</a> and <a href="https://rally.io/">Rally</a>, which aim to allow creators to directly monetize their internet presence and allow their fans to bet on them. Users who believe in a budding artist can invest in their social currency and could earn returns as the creator became more famous and their coins accrued more value.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why Terry Crews is launching a social currency&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/why-terry-crews-is-launching-a-social-currency/embed/#?secret=yzBBIiRFT3" data-secret="yzBBIiRFT3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;If you look at people&#8217;s existing relationships with social media companies, it&#8217;s this very adversarial thing where all the content they produce is not really theirs but it belongs to the corporation that doesn&#8217;t share the monetization with them,&#8221; BitClout&#8217;s founder, who refers to themselves pseudonymously as &#8220;diamondhands,&#8221; tells TechCrunch. (There&#8217;s been some <a href="https://twitter.com/_prestwich/status/1373737053012201473?s=20">speculation on their identity</a> as a former founder in the cryptocurrency space, but in a call with TechCrunch, they would not confirm their identity.)</p>
<p>The BitClout platform revolves around the BitClout currency. At the moment users can deposit Bitcoin into the platform which is instantly converted to BitClout tokens and can then be spent on individual creators inside the network. When a creator gets more popular as more users buy their coin, it gets more expensive to buy denominations of their coin. Creators can also opt in to receive a certain percentage of transactions deposited into their own BitClout wallets so that they continue to benefit from their own success.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s biggest point of controversy hinges on what has been opt-in and what has been opt-out for the early group of accounts on the platform. Most other social currency offerings are strictly opt-in. Users come to the platform in search of a way to create tokens that allow them to monetize a fanbase and build a social fabric across multiple platforms. The thought being that if the platforms own the audience then you are at their mercy.</p>
<p>BitClout has taken an aggressive growth strategy here, turning that model on its head. T<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he startup has pre-populated the BitClout network with 15,000 accounts after scraping information from popular public Twitter profiles. This means that BitClout users can buy shares of Kim Kardashian&#8217;s social coin or Elon Musk&#8217;s without those individuals ever having signed up for a profile or agreeing to it. This hasn&#8217;t been well-received by all of those who unwittingly had accounts set up on their behalf including <a href="https://twitter.com/_prestwich/status/1373737053012201473?s=21">many crypto-savvy users</a> who got scooped up in the initial wave of seeding.</span></p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s founder says that this effort was largely an effort to prevent handle squatting and user impersonation but he believes that as the platform opens, a sizable pre-purchase of creator coins reserved for the owners of these accounts will entice those users to verify their handles to claim the funds.</p>
<p>Perhaps BitClout&#8217;s most eyebrow raising quirk is that the platform is launching with a way to invest into the platform and convert bitcoin into BitClout, but at launch there&#8217;s no way to cash out funds. The project&#8217;s founder says that it&#8217;s only a matter of time before this is resolved, and points to Coinbase and the Winkelvoss twin&#8217;s status as coin holders as a sign of future exchange support to come, but the company has no specifics to share at launch.</p>
<p>While the founders and investors behind the project see a bright future for social currencies on the blockchain, many in the decentralized community have been less impressed with BitClout&#8217;s early efforts to achieve viral adoption among creators in a permission-less manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;BitClout will make a great case study on how badly crypto projects can mess up incentive engineering when they try to monetize social networks.&#8221; Jay Graber, a decentralized platform researcher involved in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/">Twitter&#8217;s bluesky effort</a>, said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/arcalinea/status/1374059653009575936">tweet</a>. &#8220;Trust and reputation are key, and if you create a sketchy platform and mess with people’s reputations without their consent it is not going to go well.&#8221;</p>
<p>If BitClout comes out of the gate and manages to convert enough of its pre-seeded early adopter list that there is value in joining its closed ecosystem version of a social token then it may have strong early momentum in an explosive new space that many creators are finding valuable. The concepts explored by others in the social currency space are sound, but this particular execution of it is a high-risk one. The network launches tomorrow morning so we&#8217;ll see soon enough.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Starting May 1, apps in China can no longer force users into providing excessive personal data, according to a document jointly released by a group of the country&#8217;s top regulators, the Cyberspace Administration, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Public Security and the State Administration for Market Regulation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a common practice in China where apps ask users to provide sensitive personal information and those who decline to share are often denied access. While some of the requests are justifiable, such as one&#8217;s location information to use a navigation map, many others are unnecessary, such as one&#8217;s biometrics to make mobile payments.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In December, Chinese authorities lay out the acceptable range of data that 39 common app types are entitled to collect, as TechCrunch </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/chinas-internet-regulator-takes-aim-at-forced-data-collection/">reported</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All forms of apps are subject to the requirements, including the increasingly popular &#8220;mini programs,&#8221; which are lite apps accessed through an all-encompassing native app such as WeChat and Alipay without the need for an app store install, said the new document.</p>
<p>&#8220;Extraneous data is most often used for advertising purposes, such as serving up localized ads or ads based on the user&#8217;s interests,&#8221; said Todd Kuhns, marketing manager at AppInChina, a firm that helps overseas apps distribute in China. &#8220;Developers could still request this additional info, but users who refuse will probably still get ads and offers &#8212; just less relevant ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>For now, the document appears to be a guideline at best as it does not specify how the rules should be enforced and how offenders will be punished. While it marks China&#8217;s incremental progress on data protection, regulators will have to keep updating the rules as people&#8217;s daily lives are becoming more linked to digital devices at a rapid rate.</p>
<p>In recent months, China has been clamping down on the technological darlings that it used to pride itself on. It introduced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/china-antitrust-rules-on-internet-industry/">sweeping antitrust law</a> to rein in its &#8220;platform economy&#8221; and slammed anti-competition fines on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/china-literature-alibaba-fined/">Alibaba and Tencent</a>, following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">Ant Group&#8217;s IPO fiasco</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nearly five years after the launch of Pokémon Go, Niantic <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/nintendo-apps-partnership/?hl=en">announced</a> Monday that they are partnering with Nintendo to co-develop a new title based on the company&#8217;s Pikmin franchise.</p>
<p>Niantic says the app is being developed in their Tokyo office and will launch later this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The app will include gameplay activities to encourage walking and make walking more delightful,&#8221; a press release from Niantic reads. The company notably specifies that the title will make use of their augmented reality platform to integrate the real world into the app&#8217;s experiences.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pokémon Go has fallen out of headlines but has continued to deliver massive sums to the San Francisco gaming company, eclipsing $1 billion in revenue in 2020. In recent years, Nintendo has sought to build out their presence on mobile gaming platforms with a number of titles playing on some of their biggest franchises, but none of them have reached Pokémon Go&#8217;s level of success.</p>
<p>Niantic has raised nearly $500 million in capital, most recently raising at a $4 billion valuation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The music streaming arm of Tencent is further tightening its ties with the &#8220;big three&#8221; record label companies, its major licensing partners. Tencent Music Entertainment announced Tuesday that it has formed a new joint label with Warner Music Group, following similar deals with Universal Music Group in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/universal-music-tencent-joint-label/">August 2020</a> and Sony Music Entertainment<a href="https://sonymusic.me/news/sony-music-entertainment-tencent-music-entertainment-group-announce-new-label-liquid-state-east-meets-west-dancefloor/"> in early 2018</a>.</p>
<p>The collaboration will take advantage of &#8220;Warner Music&#8217;s global resources and experience in supporting artists&#8217; careers, as well as TME&#8217;s massive influence in mainland China&#8217;s music and entertainment market,&#8221; TME says in an <a href="https://ir.tencentmusic.com/2021-03-22-Tencent-Music-Entertainment-Group-And-Warner-Music-Sign-Multi-Year-Strategic-Licensing-Agreement-And-Agree-to-Establish-a-Joint-Venture-Music-Label-in-China">announcement</a>.</p>
<p>The joint label<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/universal-music-tencent-joint-label/"> established with UMG</a> similarly aims to bring international artists to China, one of the world&#8217;s fastest-growing music markets, and take Chinese musicians abroad.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alongside the label deal, TME and WMG have signed a multi-year licensing agreement, an extension of their decade-long collaboration.</p>
<p>TME has ongoing licensing relationships with all three major record labels and some have manifested in equity relationships. In January, a Tencent-led consortium increased its total stake in UMG to 20%.</p>
<p>TME also operates some of China&#8217;s most popular online music services. Through its family of music streaming apps including QQ Music, Kugou Music and Kuwo Music, TME collectively commands 622 mobile monthly active users as of the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Paying ratio remains relatively low, however, with 9% of the users paying in the quarter, up from 6.2% in the previous year.</p>
<p>But TME has another major revenue stream that distinguishes it from Western streaming services like Spotify: social entertainment. This category includes the karaoke app WeSing which monetizes through the sales of virtual gifts, which are bought by users and sent to performers they appreciate. It mirrors real-life fan-idol interaction.</p>
<p>The segment contributed $854 million to Q4 revenue, compared to $423 million generated from user subscription and digital music sales.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Purplle, an e-commerce platform for beauty products in India, said on Monday it has raised $45 million in a new financing round as it looks to expand its presence in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>The new round, a Series D, was financed by Sequoia Capital India and existing investors Verlinvest, Blume Ventures, and JSW Ventures. The new round values the Indian startup &#8212; which has raised $95 million to date &#8212; at about $300 million, up from $150 million in its 2019 Series C round, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The new round gave partial exit to IvyCap Ventures, which had invested about $2 million in <a href="https://www.purplle.com">Purplle</a> in 2015. The venture firm said in a statement that Purplle delivered a 22X return and 1.35x of its entire Fund 1.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We continue to believe in the growth of the company and therefore we have retained our stake for Fund 2,” said Vikram Gupta, Founder and Managing Partner of IvyCap Ventures.</p>
<p>Eight-year-old Purplle.com, which counts Goldman Sachs among its investors, says it sells nearly 50,000 products from over 1,000 brands. The startup said it has amassed 7 million monthly active users.</p>
<p>“Purplle has been on a robust growth trajectory. Even with a Covid year, we have delivered &gt;90% GMV CAGR for the last 3 years. This, while scaling our private brands successfully; Good Vibes is already an INR 150 Cr [$20.7 million] brand. The investment will help to shape Purplle into a multibillion-dollar, digital-first, beauty and personal care enterprise,” said Manish Taneja (pictured above), co-founder and chief executive of Purplle, in a statement late Monday.</p>
<p>The growth of Purplle is indicative of the growing e-commerce space in India, where users are beginning to purchase fashion and beauty products online. MyGlamm, an omnichannel direct-to-consumer Indian brand, last week raised $24.2 million in a round co-led by Amazon.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with Purplle as we believe they have cracked the beauty playbook of value retailing with 3 key tenets – a business built on high retention and low customer acquisition cost (CAC), a wide assortment of brands offering quality at best prices, and an attractive private label portfolio mix. We see Purplle emerging as a dominant beauty destination as the online beauty penetration grows from 10% to 25%+ over the next decade,” said Sakshi Chopra, Principal, Sequoia India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Healthcare tech startup <a href="https://ro.co">Ro</a> has raised $500 million to help fuel continued growth of its hybrid telehealth/in-home primary care platform, which also includes a growing pharmacy business as the company pursues a strategy of vertical integration to optimize delivery and reduce costs for clients. The company&#8217;s latest raise is a Series D round, and means it has now raised over $876 million since its 2017 founding.</p>
<p>That may seem like a lot of money, but as Ro co-founder and CEO Zachariah Reitano told me in an interview, it&#8217;s actually &#8220;peanuts&#8221; when it comes to the healthcare industry – which is part of why they founded the company in the first place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes people talk about how great it is to be in the healthcare arena, in tech circles,&#8221; Reitano said. &#8220;They say, &#8216;Oh, healthcare is a $4 trillion market – it&#8217;s so massive.&#8217;  But that&#8217;s the worst thing in the entire world; it&#8217;s awful how large it is. And I think what we have the opportunity to cut it in half with technology.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s what Reitano says will be the primary focus of this round of funding: Fueling its efforts around vertical integration of healthcare services and technology, to further the eventual end goal of reducing costs to patients through the efficiencies realized in that process.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me, what I&#8217;m really excited about is being able to continue to invest in that infrastructure and add even more,&#8221; Reitano told me. &#8220;We&#8217;ll continue to invest in telemedicine, we&#8217;ll continue to invest in our logistics and pharmacy, and continue to invest in in-home care, as well as the connection between the three, and then we&#8217;ll also invest in additional diagnostics, remote patient monitoring – so collecting and distributing devices to patients to go from reactive to proactive care.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ro&#8217;s model focuses on primary care delivered direct to consumer, without involving any payer or employer-funded and guided care programs. The idea is to reduce costs through vertical integration and other efficiency engineering efforts in order to get them to the point where they&#8217;re effectively on par with your out-of-pocket expense with co-pays anyway. Reitano explained that the insurance system as it exists in the U.S. now only effectively masks individual costs, making it less clear that much of what a person pays out in healthcare costs comes out of their pocket anyway, whether it&#8217;s through taxation, or employers allocating more of the funds they have available for compensation to healthcare, vs. take-home pay.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2128686" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128686" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2128686" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2128686" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ro</p></div></p>
<p>That&#8217;s what&#8217;s behind Ro&#8217;s recent push into operating its own pharmacies, and growing that footprint to include more all the time. Reitano told me that the company will have 10 pharmacies by the end o this year, and 15 by the end of next, all placed strategically around the country to ensure that it can provide next-day shipping to patients at ground shipping rates pretty much anywhere in the U.S.</p>
<p>Doing that kind of vertical optimization has enabled Ro to offer 500 common drugs at $5 per month, including treatments for heart disease, anxiety, depression and diabetes — with a plan to ramp it to 1,000 drugs available at that price by year&#8217;s end. That&#8217;s roughly equal to the co-pay required for many insurers for the same treatments.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Reitano says Ro has seen big changes in the healthcare system generally that favor its model and accelerate its hybrid care plans owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say that there are two most profound impacts of the pandemic on the healthcare system,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One is that it simultaneously shed light on all of the inequities for the entire country to see, right at the same time where we all cared about it. So those things were sort of known for the people impacted day to day — the geographic inequity, the financial inequity, the racial inequity. If someone felt that that inequity, then they would talk about it, but it wasn&#8217;t something everyone cared about at the same time. So this massive spotlight was shed on the healthcare system. And the second was that everyone&#8217;s healthcare journey now starts online, even if it is going to end in person, it will still start online.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ro&#8217;s model all along has espoused this time of healthcare delivery, with remote care and telehealth appointments handling most day-to-day needs, and follow-up in person care delivered to the home when required. That obviously generate a lot of efficiencies, while ensuring that older patients and those with mobility issues also don&#8217;t need to leave the house and make a regular trip into their physician&#8217;s office for what amounts to a 15-minute visit that could&#8217;ve been handled over video.</p>

<p>According to most industry observers, Reitano is likely right that healthcare probably won&#8217;t go back to the old, inefficient model of favoring primarily in-person care after the pandemic ends. One of the positive outcomes of the COVID-19 situation has been proving that telehealth is more than capable of handling a lot of the primary care needs of a lot of people, particularly when supplemented with remote monitoring and ongoing proactive health measures, too.</p>
<p>While Ro doesn&#8217;t work with insurance currently, Reitano points out that he&#8217;s not against the concept entirely – he just says that health insurance as it exists now doesn&#8217;t actual work as intended, since it&#8217;s meant to pool risk against an, expensive, uncertain and rare outcome. Eventually, he believes there&#8217;s a place for insurance in the overall healthcare mix, but first the industry needs to face a reckoning wherein its incentive structure is realigned to its actual core customer – patients themselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Teamflow, founded by ex-Uber manager Flo Crivello, has raised an $11 million Series A just three months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/teamflow-lands-3-9-million-for-a-productive-virtual-hq-platform/">raising a $3.9 million seed f</a>or its virtual HQ platform. The latest round in the startup was led by Battery Ventures, with Menlo Ventures leading its previous financing event.</p>
<p>Teamflow’s raise comes just days after competitor<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/sequoia-capital-puts-millions-of-dollars-into-gather-a-virtual-hq-platform/"> Gather announced a $26 million Series A round led by Sequoia Capital.</a> Another company, Branch, has raised a $1.5 million seed round from investors such as Homebrew and Gumroad’s Sahil Lavingia and is currently raising its Series A.</p>
<p>All these startups want to bring into the mainstream a game-like interface for people to toggle through during their work day. The reality is, all three companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/virtual-hqs-race-to-win-over-a-remote-work-fatigued-market/">(and dozens of others)</a> likely can’t win. The winning difference lies in strategy, Teamflow’s Crivello tells me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I think in the early days, the biggest differentiator is going to be UX and our aesthetic,” he said. “A lot of the other players have a very gamified approach, and we&#8217;re big fans of that, but we think that people don’t want to have their [work] meetings in a Pokémon game.”</p>
<p>A tour through Teamflow’s office shows that the company is more focused on productivity than gamification. Integrations include a Slack-like chat feature as well as file and image sharing. It is working on an in-platform app store so users can download the integrations that work best with their team, Crivello said. There are games too.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2128503" style="width: 861px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128503" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2128503" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Illo-Spatiality-v2@2x.png" alt="" width="851" height="605" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Illo-Spatiality-v2@2x.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Illo-Spatiality-v2@2x.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Illo-Spatiality-v2@2x.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Illo-Spatiality-v2@2x.png?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Illo-Spatiality-v2@2x.png?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Illo-Spatiality-v2@2x.png?resize=1536,1092 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Illo-Spatiality-v2@2x.png?resize=2048,1456 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Illo-Spatiality-v2@2x.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 851px) 100vw, 851px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2128503" class="wp-caption-text">Teamflow&#8217;s virtual HQ platform.</p></div></p>
<p>This focus has helped Teamflow gain traction with employers instead of event organizers, a more stable source of revenue per the founder. The company currently hosts thousands of teams within startups on its platform, wracking in “hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue.” Gather, a competitor, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/sequoia-capital-puts-millions-of-dollars-into-gather-a-virtual-hq-platform/">recently told TechCrunch</a> that it gets the majority of its revenue from one-off events. Gather’s monthly revenue is currently $400,000, according to founder Philip Wang.</p>
<p>Gather, alternatively, looks and feels very different from Teamflow in that it is closer to the feel of Sims.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124265" style="width: 869px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124265" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2124265" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png" alt="" width="859" height="506" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png 1574w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png?resize=768,452 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png?resize=680,400 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png?resize=1536,905 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 859px) 100vw, 859px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2124265" class="wp-caption-text">Gather&#8217;s virtual HQ platform.</p></div></p>
<p>Branch&#8217;s Dayton Mills said that it has been able to stay competitive through becoming &#8220;much more gamified.&#8221; It has added levels, in-game currencies and XP to encourage employees to customize their office space.</p>
<p>&#8220;Productivity isn’t broken, but culture, fun and social interaction is,&#8221; Mills told TechCrunch. &#8220;So when it comes to work and play we’re aiming to fix the play part, not the work. Work comes as a side effect.&#8221; Branch has not made revenue yet.</p>

<p>The next ambition for Teamflow is expanding its customer base beyond the hip experimental team at startups. Crivello noted that Zoom brings in about 40% of its revenue through enterprise sales, and Teamflow is resultedly “doubling down on enterprise readiness.”</p>
<p>The company will work on being compliant and upholding privacy standards so it can onboard healthcare and biotech companies, what it views as “buttoned up verticals” that might not want the other gamified approaches.</p>
<p>Crivello is clear about his vision for the startup: He wants to make it harder to move out of a virtual office than a physical office. If Teamflow can become an operating system of sorts long-term, adding on applications and bringing in a high quality of standards, it might be able to bring on a broader set of clients.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[At its most generous share count and highest projected price, Coursera's valuation could reach $5.56 billion.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001651562/000119312521089500/d65490ds1a.htm">new S-1/A filing</a>, Coursera set an initial IPO price range between $30 and $33 a share, signaling the market views its edtech business warmly ahead of its impending public offering.</p>
<p>Coursera will have 130,271,466 shares outstanding after its IPO, or 132,630,966 including its underwriters’ option. At $30 per share, the low end of the company’s IPO range and a share count inclusive of 2,359,500 shares reserved for its underwriting banks, the firm would be worth $3.98 billion. That number rises to $4.38 billion at $33 per share.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Coursera is being valued as a software company, likely a breathe-easy moment for still-private edtech companies, since the debut could be an industry bellwether.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>This is a solid increase from Coursera’s last private-market valuation, which was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2020/07/17/online-learning-platform-coursera-raises-130-million-at-reported-25-billion-valuation/?sh=306e1d2f688f">around $2.4 billion</a> when it raised a Series F round in October 2020.</p>
<p>For the bulls in the room, there’s a bigger valuation if you tinker with the numbers. In a fully diluted accounting, including in our calculation, shares that are issuable upon vested options and RSUs, Coursera’s share count rises to 166,006,474, or 168,365,974 if we count its underwriters’ option. At its most generous share count and highest projected price, Coursera&#8217;s valuation could reach $5.56 billion.</p>
<p>However, IPO-watching group Renaissance Capital <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/79790/Online-education-platform-Coursera-sets-terms-for-$495-million-IPO">comes to</a> a smaller $5.1 billion figure for a midpoint-range, fully diluted valuation. That result excludes shares reserved for underwriters and equity currently present in vested RSUs.</p>
<p>Using the more modest $5.1 billion midpoint figure, Coursera would be worth around 17.5 times its 2020 revenue of $293.5 million. Using a run-rate figure calculated from the company’s Q4 2020 results, its multiple falls to just over 15x.</p>
<p>Coursera is therefore being valued as a software company, likely a breathe-easy moment for still-private edtech companies, since the debut could be an industry bellwether.</p>
<p>The valuation is also a vote of confidence that Coursera’s rising deficits are not even a valuation risk, let alone an existential threat to its business. In the four quarters of 2020, the edtech giant lost $14.3 million, $13.9 million, $11.9 million and $26.7 million, the final Q4 net loss being the largest among the time interval for which we have data.</p>
<p>From all appearances, investors are valuing Coursera on its growth, not its profitability — or lack thereof.</p>
<p>Helping push its losses higher are rising sales and marketing costs, something<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/5-takeaways-from-the-coursera-ipo-filing/"> TechCrunch has written about in the past</a>. In Q4 2019, for example, the company spent $16.7 million on sales and marketing activities. That figure rose to $35 million in Q4 2020.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shares of <a href="http://box.com">Box</a>, a well-known content-and-collaboration company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/22/box-prices-ipo/">went public in 2015</a>, rose today after <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-box-m-a-exclusive-idUSKBN2BE28W">Reuters reported</a> that the company is exploring a sale. TechCrunch previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/as-activist-investors-loom-whats-next-for-box/">discussed rising investor pressure</a> for Box to ignite its share price after years in the public-market wilderness.</p>
<p>At the close today Box’s equity was worth $23.65 per share, up around 5% from its opening value, but lower than its intraday peak of $26.47, reached after the news broke. The company went public a little over five years ago at $14 per share, only to see its share price rise to around the same level it returned today during its first day’s trading.</p>
<p>Box, famous during its startup phase thanks in part to its ubiquitous CEO and co-founder Aaron Levie, has continued to grow while public, albeit at a declining pace. Dropbox, a long-term rival, has also seen its growth rate decline since going public. Both have stressed rising profitability over revenue expansion in recent quarters.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GbPPMSEOmo"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/as-activist-investors-loom-whats-next-for-box/">As activist investors loom, what’s next for Box?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As activist investors loom, what’s next for Box?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/as-activist-investors-loom-whats-next-for-box/embed/#?secret=GbPPMSEOmo" data-secret="GbPPMSEOmo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But the problem that Box has encountered while public, namely hyper-scale platform companies with competing offerings, could also prove a lifeline; Google and Microsoft could be a future home for Levie’s company, after years of the duo challenging Box for deals.</p>
<p>As recently as last week, Box announced a deal for <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210318005272/en/Box-Announces-Deeper-Integrations-With-Microsoft-365-to-Power-Secure-Collaboration-in-the-Cloud">tighter integration with Microsoft Office 365</a>. Given the timing of the release, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1372569232664375297">it was easy to speculate</a> the news could be landing ahead of a potential deal. The Reuters article adds fuel to the possibility.</p>
<p>While we can’t know for sure if the Reuters article is accurate, the possible sale of Box makes sense.</p>
<p>The article indicated that one of the possible acquisition options for Box could be taking it private again via private equity. Perhaps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/private-equity-firms-can-offer-enterprise-startups-a-viable-exit-option/">a firm like Vista or Thoma Bravo</a>, two firms that tend to like mature SaaS companies with decent revenue and some issues, could swoop in to buy the struggling SaaS company. By taking companies off the market, reducing investor pressure and giving them room to maneuver, software companies can at times find new vigor.</p>
<p>Consider the case of Marketo, a company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/31/vista-equity-partners-buys-marketo-for-1-8b-in-cash/">Vista purchased in 2016 for $1.6 billion</a> before turning it around and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/20/adobe-gets-its-company-snaring-marketo-for-4-75-billion/">selling to Adobe in 2018 for $4.75 billion</a>. The end result generated a strong profit for Vista, and a final landing for Marketo as part of a company with a broader platform of marketing tools.</p>
<p>If there are expenses at Box that could be trimmed, or a sales process that could be improved, is not clear. But Box’s market value of $3.78 billion could put it within grasp of larger private-equity funds. Or well within the reaches of a host of larger enterprise software companies that might covet its list of business customers, technology or both.</p>
<p>If the rumors are true, it could be a startling fall from grace for the company, moving from Silicon Valley startup darling to IPO to sold entity in just six years. While it’s important to note these are just rumors, the writing could be on the wall for the company, and it could just be a matter of when and not if.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Biden didn&#8217;t campaign on getting tough against Big Tech, but his early actions are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/tech-biden-era-cabinet-antitrust-transition/">speaking louder than his words</a>.</p>
<p>The White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/22/president-biden-announces-his-intent-to-nominate-lina-khan-for-commissioner-of-the-federal-trade-commission/">confirmed</a> its intentions to nominate Lina Khan to the FTC Monday, sending a clear signal that his administration will break from the Silicon Valley-friendly precedents of the Obama era. Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tech/2021/03/09/biden-taps-lina-khan-for-ftc-commissioner-793869">first reported</a> Biden&#8217;s planned nomination of Khan, which will be subject to Senate confirmation, earlier this month.</p>
<p>Lina Khan is a star of the antitrust movement, insofar as a topic like regulating big business can produce one. Khan is best known for a paper she published as a law student in 2017 called <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox">&#8220;Amazon&#8217;s Antitrust Paradox.&#8221;</a> The paper argues that thinking about what qualifies as monopolistic behavior hasn&#8217;t kept pace with how modern businesses operate, particularly within the tech sector.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She believes that a modernized approach to antitrust must look at market forces in a big picture way instead of only examining traditional measures like <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/dealings-competitors/price-fixing">price and output</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;My argument is that gauging real competition in the 21st century marketplace — especially in the case of online platforms — requires analyzing the underlying structure and dynamics of markets. Rather than pegging competition to a narrow set of outcomes, this approach would examine the competitive process itself. Animating this framework is the idea that a company’s power and the potential anticompetitive nature of that power cannot be fully understood without looking to the structure of a business and the structural role it plays in markets. Applying this idea involves, for example, assessing whether a company’s structure creates certain anticompetitive conflicts of interest; whether it can cross-leverage market advantages across distinct lines of business; and whether the structure of the market incentivizes and permits predatory conduct.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As associate law professor at Columbia, Khan also contributed to a comprehensive <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/competition_in_digital_markets.pdf?utm_campaign=4493-519">report from the House&#8217;s antitrust subcommittee</a> last year that set the stage for major antitrust reform that could trim back Big Tech&#8217;s considerable overgrowth.</p>
<p>Khan isn&#8217;t the only high-profile tech antitrust crusader in the Biden administration&#8217;s orbit. In early March, Biden named Columbia law&#8217;s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-staff/biden-adds-big-tech-critic-tim-wu-to-his-economic-staff-idUSKBN2AX1LS">Tim Wu</a> to shape technology and competition policy at the National Economic Council. Wu came up with the term &#8220;net neutrality&#8221; and is well known as an advocate for an open internet. In 2018, Wu authored &#8220;The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age,&#8221; a treatise calling out corporate consolidation in tech as a looming political and economic threat.</p>
<p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is leading tech-focused antitrust reform efforts through the Senate&#8217;s own antitrust subcommittee, praised Khan&#8217;s nomination. &#8220;We need all hands on deck as we work to take on some of the biggest monopolies in the world, and President Biden is making his commitment to competition policy clear,&#8221; Klobuchar said in a statement provided to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lina’s experience working both in Congress and at the Federal Trade Commission and as an advocate for competitive markets will be vital as we advance efforts to strengthen enforcement and protect consumers.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There has been a growing industry trend in recent years for large-scale companies to build their own chips. As part of that, Google announced today that it has hired long-time Intel executive Uri Frank as vice president to run its custom chip division.</p>
<p>&#8220;The future of cloud infrastructure is bright, and it’s changing fast. As we continue to work to meet computing demands from around the world, today we are thrilled to welcome Uri Frank as our VP of Engineering for server chip design,&#8221; Amin Vahdat, Google Fellow and VP of systems infrastructure wrote in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/systems/the-past-present-and-future-of-custom-compute-at-google">a blog post</a> announcing the hire.</p>
<p>With Frank, Google gets an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/uri-frank-95ab5330/">experienced chip industry executive</a>, who spent more than two decades at Intel rising from engineering roles to corporate vice president at the Design Engineering Group, his final role before leaving the company earlier this month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Frank will lead the custom chip division in Israel as part of Google. As he said in his announcement <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/uri-frank-95ab5330_build-for-everyone-google-careers-activity-6779764218351771648-dm7L">on LinkedIn</a>, this was a big step to join a company with a long history of building custom silicon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google has designed and built some of the world’s largest and most efficient computing systems. For a long time, custom chips have been an important part of this strategy. I look forward to growing a team here in Israel while accelerating Google Cloud&#8217;s innovations in compute infrastructure,&#8221; Frank wrote.</p>

<p>Google&#8217;s history of building its own chips dates back to 2015 when it launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/25/google-is-making-a-fast-specialized-tpu-chip-for-edge-devices-and-a-suite-of-services-to-support-it/">the first TensorFlow chips</a>. It moved into video processing chips in 2018 and added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/05/google-opentitan-secure-chip/">OpenTitan </a>, an open-source chip with a security angle in 2019.</p>
<p>Frank&#8217;s job will be to continue to build on this previous experience to work with customers and partners to build new custom chip architectures. The company wants to move away from buying motherboard components from different vendors to building its own &#8220;system on a chip&#8221; or SoC, which it says will be drastically more efficient.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of integrating components on a motherboard where they are separated by inches of wires, we are turning to “Systems on Chip” (SoC) designs where multiple functions sit on the same chip, or on multiple chips inside one package. In other words, the SoC is the new motherboard,&#8221; Vahdat wrote.</p>
<p>While Google was early to the &#8220;Build Your Own Chip&#8221; movement, we&#8217;ve seen other large scale companies like Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft begin building their own custom chips in recent years to meet each company&#8217;s unique needs and give more precise control over the relationship between the hardware and software.</p>
<p>It will be Frank&#8217;s job to lead Google&#8217;s custom chip unit and help bring it to the next level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.techstars.com/accelerators/nyc">Techstars NYC</a> just announced the 10 startups participating in this year&#8217;s program, making up what Managing Director Jenny Fielding described as the accelerator&#8217;s most global class yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always had applications from around the world and I was always able to take companies from anywhere,&#8221; Fielding said. &#8220;But the truth is, when you run Techstars New York, if you don&#8217;t have five companies from New York, there&#8217;s a feeling that you&#8217;re letting the ecosystem down a little bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that the program is almost entirely virtual, Fielding said she felt free to &#8220;open up the geos.&#8221; In fact, not a single one of the startups is based in New York — instead, there are multiple San Francisco and Washington, D.C. companies, as well as others based in the France, Israel, Kenya, Portugal and the United Kingdom.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fielding argued that even without New York startups, the accelerator still has a New York identity, because it connects global startups with the New York ecosystem.</p>
<p>After conducting last year&#8217;s accelerator virtually, Fielding said the hardest element to recreate has been the in-person camaraderie between the founders. So she&#8217;s hoping to have an in-person meetup here at the end of May, although the logistics of that meetup will depend on what&#8217;s safe and legal at that time (and what the entrepreneurs are comfortable with).</p>
<p>Other aspects of the virtual experience are likely to stick around post-pandemic. After all, Techstars hosts around 200 mentors per class, and Fielding said the virtual program marked the first time &#8220;nobody was late.&#8221; Similarly, she suggested that demo day remains an &#8220;open question,&#8221; as an extended period of investor meetings seems to be driving more fundraising for the startups.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here are the startups:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://spektra.co">Dash</a> (Nairobi, Kenya) — An alternative, cross-currency payment network for African consumers.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.detech.ai">Detach.ai</a> (Lisbon, Portugal) — An AI operations platform focused on resolving issues proactively.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.elanzawellness.com">Elanza Wellness</a> (San Francisco and London, U.K.) — A fertility platform that brings together medical, lifestyle and mental health data.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gable.to">Gable</a> (San Francisco and Tel Aviv, Israel) — A &#8220;workspace as a service&#8221; company helping businesses find neighborhood workspaces for their employees.</li>
<li><a href="https://hiitide.com">Hiitide</a> (Chicago) — A marketplace that turns books into virtual book clubs and courses.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.onevillage.io/">OneVillage</a> (Washington, D.C.) — An online wishlist, planning tool and retailer for cancer patients and their supporters.</li>
<li><a href="https://paerpay.com">Paerpay</a> (Boston) — A contactless payment platform that doesn&#8217;t require additional hardware or app downloads.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.phalanx.io">Phalanx</a> (Washington, D.C.) — A company that secures AI systems using data, model validation and vulnerability scanning.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.phood.co">Phood</a> (Boulder) — A startup digitizing university student cards so they can be used payments in various online services.</li>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic-induced growth of e-commerce is, by now, now well documented.</p>
<p>What is happening in the app ecosystem that supports e-commerce? Is it growing? Are we likely to see consolidations or IPOs? Are there superapps that will emerge?</p>
<p>This post is less about conclusions and more about taking you along while I go through the rabbit hole to satiate my own curiosity.</p>
<p>I see all three trends forming:</p>
<ol>
<li>Superapps are likely to emerge. I think companies like <a href="https://boldcommerce.com/">Bold Commerce</a> will be among the earliest superapps.</li>
<li>There will be consolidations anchored around large SaaS players and roll-ups powered by private equity funds.</li>
<li>There are players like Tiny that acquire early-stage firms and let them run independently.</li>
</ol>
<p>The closest match to the growing e-commerce stack is the marketing automation stack. While there are significant overlaps, it&#8217;s fascinating to compare and contrast the growth of these ecosystems and what drives consolidation.</p>

<p>Between 2015 and 2021, the martech stack grew from 1,800 to 8,000, meaning it roughly doubles every three years.</p>
<p>The explosion of the martech stack is common knowledge and is well documented by Scott Brinker and his <a href="https://chiefmartec.com/">famous supergraphics</a>. What&#8217;s worth noting is that the consolidation we expected to happen is happening, and yet the pace of new companies coming up in the space makes up for the consolidation — and some more.</p>
<p><a href="https://chiefmartec.com/2020/04/marketing-technology-landscape-2020-martech-5000/">According to Brinker</a>, the martech landscape grew 5,233% between 2011 and 2020. The fastest-growing category within martech in 2020 is data and governance, which grew in numbers by 25%. The martech app ecosystem more than tripled between 2015 to 2018, powered by the growth of SaaS and e-commerce industries.</p>
<p>I am an avid tracker of this space, but I am also interested in how we can apply martech’s evolution to the e-commerce stack. The e-commerce stack also grew 3.5 times between 2017 and 2020. But much of the growth is ahead, and so is the upcoming consolidation.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s plain to see that electric vehicles are the future, but there&#8217;s more to making that change happen than swapping out a gas motor for a battery-powered one — especially in aircraft. <a href="https://www.h3x.tech/">H3X</a> is a startup that aims to accelerate that future with a reimagined, completely integrated electric motor that it claims outperforms everything on the market.</p>
<p>The small founding team — CEO Jason Sylvestre, CTO Max Liben, and COO Eric Maciolek — met in college while participating in an electric vehicle building and racing program. After stints in the tech and automobile industry (including at Tesla), the crew came back together when they saw that the Department of Energy was offering a bounty for improved high power density electric motors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem was uniquely suited to our abilities, and passions too — we&#8217;re excited about this stuff. We care about decarbonization of the different transit sectors, and aviation is going to become a growing part of the global carbon footprint over the next few decades as electric improves ground vehicles,&#8221; said Liben. &#8220;We just kinda decided to take a leap of faith, and applied to Y Combinator.&#8221;</p>
<p>Electric flight isn&#8217;t so much a wild idea as one that&#8217;s in its early, awkward stages. Lightweight craft like drones can do a great deal with the batteries and motors that are available, and <a href="https://www.harbourair.com/harbour-air-and-magnix-announce-successful-flight-of-worlds-first-commercial-electric-airplane/">converted small aircraft</a> like seaplanes are able to make short flights, but that&#8217;s about the limit with the way things are today.</p>
<p>The problem is primarily a simple lack of power: The energy required to propel an aircraft fast enough to generate lift grows exponentially as the size and mass of the plane increase. A handful of kilowatt-hours will serve for a drone, and a few EV-scale batteries will work for a light aircraft, but beyond that the energy required to take flight requires batteries the bulk and weight of which make flight impractical.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127737" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-lab.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127737" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2127737" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-lab.png" alt="The H3x lab with someone working on a motor the size of a toaster." width="450" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-lab.png 682w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-lab.png?resize=150,127 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-lab.png?resize=300,255 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-lab.png?resize=680,577 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-lab.png?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2127737" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> H3X</p></div></p>
<p>Of course, it doesn&#8217;t <em>have</em> to be like that. And there are two general avenues for improvement: better batteries or better motors. So either you can fit more energy in the same mass or use what energy you have more efficiently. Both are being pursued by many companies, but H3X claims to have made a huge leap forward in power density that could unlock new industries overnight. While even an improvement of 10% or 20% in power per kilogram (e.g., a 50-pound motor putting out 120 horsepower rather than 100) would be notable, H3X says its motor is performing at around 300% of the competition&#8217;s output.</p>
<p>How? It&#8217;s all about integration, Liben explained. While the pieces are similar in some ways to motors and power assemblies out there now, the team basically started from scratch with the idea of maximizing efficiency and minimizing size.</p>
<p>Electric motors generally have three main sections: the motor itself, a power delivery system and a gearbox, each of which may have its own housing and be sold and mounted separately from one another. One reason why these aren&#8217;t all one big machine is temperature: The parts and coolant systems of the gearbox, for instance, might not be able to operate at the temperatures generated by the motor or the power system, or vice versa. Put them together and one may cause the other to seize up or otherwise fail. The different sections just have different requirements, which seems natural.</p>

<p>H3X challenges this paradigm with a novel integrated design, but Liben was careful to clarify what that means.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not just taking the inverter box and slapping it on top and calling it <em>integrated</em>,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All the components are all intimately connected to the same housing and motor. We&#8217;re making a truly integrated design that&#8217;s one of the first of its kind at this power level.&#8221;</p>
<p>And by &#8220;one of the first&#8221; he doesn&#8217;t mean that Airbus has one in some powertrains, but rather that there have been research projects along these lines — nothing intended for production.</p>
<p>The idea that no one else has gone this far in putting everything in the same box at scales that could be used commercially may sound suspicious to some. One would think that the existing players in aerospace would have been barking up this tree for years, but Liben said large companies are too slow to innovate and too invested in other methods, while smaller ones tend to avoid risk by improving incrementally on successful existing designs and competing among themselves. &#8220;No one is targeting the level of performance we&#8217;re looking at right now,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127738" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127738" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2127738 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="644" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg?resize=768,483 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg?resize=680,428 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg?resize=1536,966 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg?resize=2048,1289 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2127738" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> H3X</p></div></p>
<p>But it isn&#8217;t like H3X stumbled over a single advance that magically tripled the performance of electric motors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not relying on one big tech or something — there&#8217;s no magic bullet,&#8221; Liben said. &#8220;There are a few improvements that have very significant gains, like 50% better than the state of the art, and lots of areas that add 10%-20%. It&#8217;s good from the technical risk side.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went into considerable detail on a lot of those improvements, but the less technical-minded among our readers, if they&#8217;ve even read this far, might close the tab if I tried to recount the whole conversation. To be brief, it amounts to combining advances in materials, manufacturing and electric components so that they act synergistically, each enabling the other to be used to best effect.</p>
<p>For instance, recently improved power switching hardware can be run at hotter temperatures and handle higher loads — this raises performance but also allows for shared cooling infrastructure. The shared infrastructure can itself be improved by using new pure-copper 3D-printing techniques, which allow more cooling to fit inside the housing. Using 3D printing means custom internal geometries so that the motor, gearbox and power delivery can all be mounted in optimal positions to one another instead of bolted on where existing methods allow.</p>
<p>The result is an all-in-one motor, the HPDM-250, that&#8217;s smaller than a lot of the competition, yet produces far more power. The best production motors out there are around 3-4 kilowatts per kilogram of continuous power. H3X&#8217;s prototype produces 13 — coincidentally, just above the theoretical power density that would enable midrange passenger aircraft.</p>

<p>There is the risk that stacking cutting-edge techniques like this makes the cost rise faster than the performance. Liben said that while it&#8217;s definitely more expensive in some ways, the smaller size and integrated design also lead to new savings in cost, time or material.</p>
<p>&#8220;People think, &#8216;3D-printing copper, that&#8217;s expensive!&#8217; But when you compare it to the super high-performance windings you&#8217;d need otherwise, and the different ways that you manufacture them, that can require a lot of manual steps and people involved … it can be a lot simpler printing something,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;It can be counterintuitive, but at least from my BOM [bill of materials] cost, when you&#8217;re selling something three times smaller than the other guy, even if it&#8217;s high-performance materials, it&#8217;s actually not as expensive as you&#8217;d think. Based on the customers we&#8217;ve talked to so far, we think we&#8217;re in a good spot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Servicing a fully integrated motor is also fundamentally more complex than doing so for an off-the-shelf one, but Liben noted that they were careful to think about maintenance from the start — and also that, while it may be a little harder to service their motor than an ordinary electric one, it&#8217;s much, much simpler than servicing even the most reliable and well-known gas-powered motors.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127739" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-side.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127739" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2127739 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-side.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="605" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-side.jpg 1477w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-side.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-side.jpg?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-side.jpg?resize=768,453 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-side.jpg?resize=680,401 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-side.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2127739" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> H3X</p></div></p>
<p>Despite the huge gains H3X claims, the target market of passenger aircraft is hardly one that they, or anyone, can just jump into. Heavily regulated industries like air travel require years of work and technology proving to change a fastener style, let alone the method of propulsion.</p>
<p>So H3X is focusing on the numerous smaller, less regulated industries that could use vastly improved electric propulsion. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/24/wingcopter-raises-22-million-to-expand-to-the-u-s-and-launch-a-next-generation-drone/">Cargo drones</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/zin-boats-reinvents-the-electric-speedboat-in-a-bid-to-become-the-tesla-of-the-sea/">electric boats</a> and air taxis might still be rare sights on this planet, but a big bump to motor power and efficiency might be what helps tip them from niche (or vaporware) to mainstream. Certainly all three of those applications could benefit hugely from improved range or payload capacity.</p>

<p>Graduating to passenger flights isn&#8217;t a distant dream, exactly, suggested Liben: &#8220;We&#8217;re already on our way — this isn&#8217;t 20-years-out type stuff. In the last few years the timelines have shrunk drastically. You could have a full-battery electric vehicle soon, but it isn&#8217;t going to cut it for longer flights.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still a role for motors like H3X&#8217;s in hybrid aircraft that use jet fuel, batteries and perhaps even hydrogen fuel cells interchangeably. Like the switch to electric cars, it doesn&#8217;t happen all at once and it doesn&#8217;t need to for the purposes of their business. &#8220;That&#8217;s the great thing about motors,&#8221; Liben said. &#8220;They&#8217;re so ubiquitous.&#8221;</p>
<p>H3X declined to disclose any funding or partners, although it&#8217;s hard to believe that the team could have gotten as far as it has without some kind of significant capital and facilities — this sort of project outgrows the garage workbench pretty fast. But with Y Combinator&#8217;s demo day happening tomorrow, it seems likely that they&#8217;ll be receiving a lot of calls over the next few weeks, after which it may be reasonable to expect a seed round to come together.</p>
<p>If H3X&#8217;s prototypes perform as well in the wild as they do on the bench, they may very well enable a host of new electric transportation applications. We&#8217;ll be watching closely to see how the startup&#8217;s play affects the future of electric mobility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">BMW Group and California utility Pacific Gas &amp; Electric are rolling out the next phase of a pilot that aims to test — and learn — how electric vehicles could support the integration of renewable energy on the electric grid.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ChargeForward program, now entering its third phase, is open to PG&amp;E customers who drive a BMW electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. Around 3,000 drivers can sign up to voluntarily allow their vehicle to be “smart charged” when electricity demand is low and renewable energy availability is high. Drivers will earn incentives for participating in the program, including $150 at sign-up and an additional $250 per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program is one of the longest-running partnerships between an electric utility and an automaker. The first two phases had only 100 and 400 participants respectively, so this latest phase presents a marked expansion for the collaboration. It’s a sensible alliance for two industries that are preparing for the gradual decline in sales of internal combustion engines. For electric utilities, this means planning for a drastic increase in customer demand on a grid that is increasingly powered by renewable resources like solar and wind.   </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2128487" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128487" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2128487 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-1.png?w=314" alt="bmw chargeforward electric" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-1.png 381w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-1.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-1.png?resize=138,300 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-1.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-1.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2128487" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s assume someone plugs in at home on a Saturday morning at 9 a.m. and sets their departure time for 4 p.m. that day,&#8221; Adam Langton, BMW’s Energy Services manager who oversees the ChargeForward program, explained. &#8220;The ChargeForward software system communicates with the vehicle and determines that the vehicle is more than half full, needing two hours of charging to fill up the battery. The system then evaluates the person’s home electricity rate, renewable energy availability and congestion on the grid in their neighborhood. On this day, there is no congestion on the grid and solar energy will be very high in the afternoon. The ChargeForward system directs the vehicle to start charging at 1 p.m. and complete charging by 3 p.m. This allows the driver to get a full battery prior to their departure time.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electricity demand tends to follow a “duck curve” shape, peaking in the early evening as people return home from work — right as solar energy resources go offline. And people tend to charge their EVs overnight. To meet this demand, fossil-fuel-emitting resources like natural gas ramp up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result? More greenhouse gas emissions. A</span><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.0c02312"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published by MIT researchers in &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental Science and Technology&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">found that in California overnight EV charging produces around 74% more GHGs than midday charging. (Variations in the grid mix matter here — in wind-heavy regions in the Midwest or Texas, overnight EV charging may make the most sense as lots of wind tend to be generated overnight.)  </span></p>
<p>The ChargeForward program aims to take advantage of the ample renewable resources available during the day and reduce GHG emissions in the process. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Participating customers will enter their charging preferences and departure times on a BMW ChargeForward mobile app. BMW will also receive real-time information about the grid, such as the availability of renewable energy relative to the customer’s location, and it will use this data to calculate an optimal charging window and send it automatically to the vehicle. Customers will be able to opt-out of the charging shift at any point through the app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While California is known for pursuing ambitious clean energy goals — including codifying into law a landmark target of achieving 100% renewable and zero-carbon electricity by 2045 — the state has also set a goal of getting 5 million EVs on the road by 2030. And that’s no surprise, considering that transportation is the single largest source of GHG emissions in the state.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMW and PG&amp;E will also collaborate in a lab setting to explore vehicle-to-grid technologies that enable EVs to discharge electricity to the power grid. Such bidirectional functionality could allow EVs to be used as big backup generators in the case of emergencies or as distributed nano power plants to help balance the grid throughout the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third phase of the ChargeForward program begins in mid-April and runs through March 2023. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Social audio app Clubhouse has now promised a time frame of sorts for the launch of its anticipated Android version, following <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/clubhouse-hires-android-developer-work-on-android-app-has-begun.html">its recent hire</a> of an Android software developer last month. In its weekly Townhall event on Sunday, Clubhouse co-founder Paul Davison remarked that the company was working &#8220;really hard&#8221; to come to Android, but said it&#8217;s going to take a &#8220;couple of months&#8221; to make that happen. That seems to indicate a time frame that&#8217;s closer to late spring or summer 2021.</p>
<p>Clubhouse had previously said <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/welcoming-more-voices">in a late January blog post</a> that it would begin work on its Android version &#8220;soon,&#8221; but had not yet promised any sort of time frame as to when it would be able to bring that version to the public. Instead, most of its statements about Android have been vague mentions of the importance of supporting the Android user base and making its app more accessible to a wider audience.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Clubhouse&#8217;s biggest rival, Twitter Spaces, has been taking advantage of Clubhouse&#8217;s delay to address the sizable Android user base by rapidly rolling out support to more people across platforms. This month, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/twitter-spaces-arrives-on-android-ahead-of-clubhouse/">Twitter Spaces opened up to Android users</a>, allowing anyone on Android to join and talk inside its live audio rooms. Shortly thereafter, Twitter said that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/twitter-spaces-to-launch-publicly-next-month-may-include-spaces-only-tweets/">plans to publicly launch Twitter Spaces</a> to the general public in April. That would be well ahead of Clubhouse, unless the latter rapidly speeds up development and drops its invite-only status in the weeks ahead.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzOsJxnLeI8">Sunday&#8217;s Clubhouse Townhall,</a> co-founder Davison explained the company&#8217;s approach to scaling to a larger market &#8212; like one where Android users participate &#8212; as an effort that requires a slower pace, when it comes to opening up access to more users. He noted that when Clubhouse grows, the discovery experience inside the app can be negatively impacted as a result. Users today are seeing more foreign language groups in their feeds, for instance, and are having a harder time finding friends and some of the best content, he said.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, Clubhouse plans to make several changes, including tweaks to the app&#8217;s Activity feed, tools to give users more control over their push notifications, and the launch of more personalization features &#8212; like showing users a personalized list of suggested rooms that appear on screen when you first open the app. These sorts of improvements are necessary to make Clubhouse succeed even as it scales its app to a larger user base, the company believes.</p>
<p>That said, Davison also spoke of dropping Clubhouse&#8217;s invite-only status as something it hopes to do &#8220;in the coming months.&#8221; He noted that he wants the app to open up to everyone, because there are &#8220;so many incredible creators not yet on Clubhouse, who have an audience elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be really important that we just open up to everyone,&#8221; Davison said. &#8220;Android&#8217;s going to be really important. Localization is obviously going to be very important.&#8221; Plus, making Clubhouse more accessible was important, too, he said.</p>
<p>The lack of an Android version of Clubhouse has already caused some complications for the company.</p>
<p>A number of Android app developers have taken advantage of the hole left in the market to hawk their &#8220;Clubhouse guides,&#8221; which intentionally aim to confuse Android users looking for Clubhouse by using the same app icon. (Google apparently doesn&#8217;t bother to weed out low-value and/or infringing content like this from the Play Store.)</p>

<p>More recently,<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/fraudsters-jump-on-clubhouse-hype-to-push-malicious-android-app/"> cybercriminals have gotten in on the action</a>, too. They&#8217;ve created fake versions of Clubhouse that even pointed to a well-executed copy of the Clubhouse website in order to trick users into downloading their malicious app. One of these apps has been <a href="https://threatpost.com/android-clubhouse-app-malware/164915/">found to be spreading BlackRock malware</a>, which steals users&#8217; login credentials for over 450 services, including Facebook, Twitter and Amazon.</p>
<p>Davison addressed this issue during the Townhall, warning users that if they see anyone trying to impersonate Clubhouse on Android, not to use that app because &#8220;it could be harmful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is certainly not the real Clubhouse. Same thing with PC. There&#8217;s no PC app for Clubhouse,&#8221; he said, adding that a desktop version of Clubhouse is not a high priority for the company.</p>
<p>The company made a number of other announcements, as well, the most notable being its plans for more creator tools. These will be focused on helping creators grow their own audiences for their shows, and even monetize their events, if they choose, through things like direct payments, subscriptions, brand sponsorships and even &#8220;paid events.&#8221; Clubhouse will also offer tools for managing memberships and tracking metrics around listeners and retention, but overall, details were light on what specific tools would be available or when they would roll out.</p>
<p>Clubhouse hasn&#8217;t responded to a request for further comment on the statements made during its Townhall event.</p>
