										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robotic process automation unicorn UiPath is set to go public this week, concentrating our focus on its value.</p>
<p>The well-known company was last valued on the private markets at $35 billion in February when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">closed a $750 million round</a>. Living up to that price as a public company, however, at least when it comes to its formal IPO price, is proving to be challenging.</p>
<p>In a sense, that&#8217;s not too surprising given that the red-hot IPO market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/as-compass-downsizes-its-ipo-signs-of-weakness-appear-for-high-growth-companies/">cooled as Q1 2021 came to a close</a>. UiPath raised its last private round when the markets were most interested in public offerings and is now going public in a slightly altered climate.</p>
<p>In numerical terms, UiPath <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521120347/d98556ds1a.htm">raised its IPO range</a> from $43 to $50 per share, to $52 to $54 per share. That&#8217;s a 21% jump in the value of the lower end of its range, and an 8% gain to the value of the upper end of its per-share IPO price interval.</p>
<p>UiPath is also selling more shares than before, which should make its total valuation slightly larger at the top end than a mere 8% gain. So let&#8217;s go through the math one more time. Afterward, we&#8217;ll stack its new simple, fully diluted IPO valuations against its final private price, ask ourselves if our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/what-we-all-missed-in-uipaths-latest-ipo-filing/">musings on the company&#8217;s recent profitability bore out</a>, and close by asking where the company might finally price, and if we expect it to do so above its new price range.</p>
<h2>UiPath at $54<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been a strange few years for Fitbit. After defining the fitness tracking space, the company was a bit late to the smartwatch trend, but was still able to ride that wave to a rebound. But while watches have received most of the press the now Google-owned company has garnered in recent years, bands still comprise a substantial part of its business.</p>
<p>Today Fitbit announced the arrival of the Luxe. It’s a weird product. There’s certainly a market for it, but it’s hard to say how much of a niche were talking about here. The company called its target demo, “a unique set of buyers whose needs weren’t being met.” Specifically, the product is a “fashioned-forward” tracker for people looking for something a bit nicer than a plastic band to wear out and about.</p>
<p>Frankly, it’s hard not to see some reflections of Misfit’s take on the category. Perhaps the Fossil-owned company was ahead of its time. At $149, the device is priced between the Charge and the Versa, but decidedly closer to the former. That is to say, it’s pricey in the grand scheme of fitness trackers, but more or less in line with other Fitbit products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/uElafJGOJCU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>It is, indeed, a nice-looking tracker, as far of these things go, featuring a color touchscreen surrounded by a stainless steel case. That’s coupled with a broad range of accessories, ranging from leather to gold-colored stainless steel.</p>
<p>Here’s Fitbit co-founder and GM (under Google) James Park:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the past year, we’ve had to think differently about our health – from keeping an eye out for possible COVID-19 symptoms to managing the ongoing stress and anxiety of today’s world. Even though we are starting to see positive changes, it has never been more important to manage your holistic health. That’s why we’ve been resolute in introducing products to support you in staying mentally well and physically active. We’ve made major technological advancements with Luxe, creating a smaller, slimmer, beautifully designed tracker packed with advanced features – some that were previously only available with our smartwatches – making these tools accessible to even more people around the globe.</p></blockquote>
<p>Certainly physical and mental health have been top of mind over the past year, even as step counts have dramatically plummeted. The device sports the usual array of Fitbit sensors, tracking activity, sleep and stress. It also works with a number of different mindfulness/meditation apps, including the company’s recently announced partnership with Deepak Chopra.</p>
<p>The band is up for preorder starting today and starts shipping in the spring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is deepening its relationship with music company Spotify and will allow users to listen to music hosted on Spotify while browsing through its apps as part of a new initiative called &#8220;Project Boombox,&#8221; Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Monday.</p>
<p>Facebook is building an in-line audio player that will allow users to listen to songs or playlists being shared on the platforms without being externally linked to Spotify&#8217;s app or website. Zuckerberg highlighted the feature as another product designed to improve the experience of creators on its platforms, specifically the ability of musicians to share their work, &#8220;basically making audio a first-class type of media,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>We understand from sources familiar with the Spotify integration that this player will support both music and podcasts. It has already been tested in non-U.S. markets, including Mexico and Thailand, and that it’s expected to arrive in about a week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The news was revealed in a wide-ranging interview with reporter Casey Newton on the company&#8217;s future pursuits in the audio world as Facebook aims to keep pace with upstart efforts like Clubhouse and increased activity in the podcasting world. </span></p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;We think that audio is going to be a first-class medium and that there are all these different products to be built across this whole spectrum,&#8221; said Zuckerberg. &#8220;Of course, it includes some areas that, that have been, you know, popular recently like like podcasting and and kind of live audio rooms like this, but I also think that there&#8217;s some interesting things that are that are under explored in the area overall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spotify has already supported a fairly product relationship with the Facebook and Instagram platforms. In recent years the music and podcasts platform has been integrated more deeply into Instagram Stories where users can share content from the service, a feature that&#8217;s also been available in Facebook Stories.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook today officially announced a suite of new audio products &#8212; an indication that it&#8217;s taking the threat from Clubhouse and other audio platforms more seriously. The company is doing more than just building its own take on Clubhouse, however, it&#8217;s also announcing tools that allow podcast creators to share long-form audio, a new Spotify integration for music and a brand-new short-form experience called Soundbites.</p>
<p>The Clubhouse clone was probably the most-discussed of the new products ahead of today&#8217;s announcement, given the increased interest in the audio networking market.</p>
<p>Like Clubhouse, the Facebook experience will also involve live audio rooms, where users can engage in topical discussions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I think the areas where I&#8217;m most excited about it on Facebook are basically in the large number of communities and groups that exist. I think that you already have these communities that are organized around interests, and allowing people to come together and have rooms where they can talk is &#8212; I think it&#8217;d be a very useful thing,&#8221; said Zuckerberg, in a friendly interview with <a href="https://www.platformer.news/subscribe">Platformer</a>, timed alongside the official announcement. &#8220;When we launched video rooms earlier last year, groups and communities were one of the bigger areas where that took off. So, I think around audio, just given how much more accessible it is, that&#8217;ll be a pretty exciting area as well.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140522" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140522" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140522" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Live-Audio-Rooms-Rooms-Discovery-Stars-and-Fundraising-Side-by-Side.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Live-Audio-Rooms-Rooms-Discovery-Stars-and-Fundraising-Side-by-Side.png 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Live-Audio-Rooms-Rooms-Discovery-Stars-and-Fundraising-Side-by-Side.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Live-Audio-Rooms-Rooms-Discovery-Stars-and-Fundraising-Side-by-Side.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Live-Audio-Rooms-Rooms-Discovery-Stars-and-Fundraising-Side-by-Side.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Live-Audio-Rooms-Rooms-Discovery-Stars-and-Fundraising-Side-by-Side.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Live-Audio-Rooms-Rooms-Discovery-Stars-and-Fundraising-Side-by-Side.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140522" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>The Live Audio Rooms will be available across both Facebook and Messenger, Facebook says in an official <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/bringing-social-audio-experiences-to-facebook/">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>The company will first test Live Audio Rooms in Groups, reaching Groups&#8217; 1.8 billion monthly users. They&#8217;ll also be made available to public figures and experts. Early adopters of the feature will include American football quarterback <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DangerRussWilson">Russell Wilson</a>, Grammy-nominated electronic music artist <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tokimonsta">TOKiMONSTA</a>, artist and director <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ellemoxleyofficial/">Elle Moxley</a> and five-time Olympic medalist and entrepreneur <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NastiaLiukin">Nastia Liukin</a>, Facebook says.</p>

<p>Live Audio Rooms will be available to everyone on Facebook this summer. Also this summer, Live Audio Rooms will be made available on Messenger, for an experience that allows friends to hang out, too.</p>
<p>In addition to products that rehash audio functionality available in tech products from other companies, Zuckerberg also revealed that the company was working on an audio-only version of its TikTok competitor Instagram Reels that allows users to quickly move through algorithmically sorted short audio clips, a project being called Soundbites. In its blog post, Facebook detailed that they will be testing Soundbites over the next few months with a small group of creators before making it widely available.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140521" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140521" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140521" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Soundbites-Audio-Creation-Tool-and-Listening-Side-by-Side.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Soundbites-Audio-Creation-Tool-and-Listening-Side-by-Side.png 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Soundbites-Audio-Creation-Tool-and-Listening-Side-by-Side.png?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Soundbites-Audio-Creation-Tool-and-Listening-Side-by-Side.png?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Soundbites-Audio-Creation-Tool-and-Listening-Side-by-Side.png?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Soundbites-Audio-Creation-Tool-and-Listening-Side-by-Side.png?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Soundbites-Audio-Creation-Tool-and-Listening-Side-by-Side.png?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140521" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;The idea here is it&#8217;s short-form audio clips, whether it&#8217;s people sharing things that they find funny… or kind of pithy things that people want to share that cover a bunch of different genres and topics,&#8221; Zuckerberg said.</p>
<p>For podcast creators, Zuckerberg said the company will build out tools for those who follow podcasts and creators through Facebook Pages, but don&#8217;t currently have a way to access podcast content via the social network. He noted that there are now 170 million Facebook users who are connected to a Page for a podcast, which is why it wants to ensure they have a way to access this audio content more easily.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140520" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140520" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140520" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Podcasts-Listening.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Podcasts-Listening.png 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Podcasts-Listening.png?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Podcasts-Listening.png?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Podcasts-Listening.png?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Podcasts-Listening.png?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Podcasts-Listening.png?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140520" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>For these users, they&#8217;ll be able to discover the audio and start playing it, even in the background. Or they could choose to launch a second app to continue to play it, Zuckerberg said. We understand that the experience will actually allow users to directly open Spotify, if they would prefer to listen to the music or audio there, instead.</p>
<p>The feature will also help users with new podcast discovery based on your interests, and users will be able to comment on podcasts and recommend them to friends.</p>
<p>Related to these audio efforts, Zuckerberg referenced Facebook&#8217;s partnership with Spotify, which is now being expanded with something it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-is-expanding-spotify-partnership-with-new-boombox-project/">internally referred to as &#8220;Project Boombox&#8221;</a> &#8212; an integration that would allow people to share content from their favorite artists, playlists and other types of audio in their feed. That content would then appear in a little, in-line player for others to click and play.</p>
<p>We understand from sources familiar with the Spotify integration that this player will support both music and podcasts. It has already been tested in non-U.S. markets, including Mexico and Thailand. It&#8217;s expected to arrive in about a week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook’s interest in audio is further validation of the category and reinforces what we’ve known all along — the power and potential for audio is limitless,&#8221; a spokesperson for Spotify told TechCrunch. &#8220;Our ambition has always been to make Spotify ubiquitous across platforms and devices — bringing music and podcasts to more people — and our new integration with Facebook is another step in these efforts. We look forward to a continued partnership with Facebook, fueling audio discovery around the world,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg also referenced the need to serve the growing creator economy with its new products.</p>
<p>With Live Audio Rooms, fans will be able to support creators through Stars, Facebook&#8217;s existing in-app tipping feature, or donate to causes. Facebook says it will later offer other monetization tools like access to Live Audio Rooms on subscriptions. There&#8217;s also an Audio Creator Fund being made available to kick off the launch of Soundbites.</p>

<p>The exec also spoke about Facebook&#8217;s plans for a newsletter product, all under the umbrella of serving the creator community with a suite of tools &#8212; something Twitter is now doing, too, with<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/"> its plans for Super Follow.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;I think a product where a journalist or a creator can basically create a subscription for people who want to follow them, that spans both a newsletter and a podcast, is going to be a really powerful thing,&#8221; said Zuckerberg. &#8220;So that&#8217;s a big part of what we&#8217;re going to enable with some of the monetization tools around podcasts. That dovetails with the work that we&#8217;re planning to do&#8230;our work on our newsletters and giving tools for for independent journalists. I think enabling both of those things to come together on extremely favorable terms to journalists and creators, will be a pretty powerful thing,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>The product launches, which <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/4/18/22390742/facebook-podcasts-clubhouse-audio-launch-spotify-zuckerberg-apple">Vox scooped</a> on Sunday, indicate how seriously Facebook considers the disruption to its dominance that could be attributed to the growing number of places where fans connect with creators. The threat for Facebook today is not just a new app like Clubhouse or Substack&#8217;s newsletters or even Patreon, but the fact that the creator economy, in general, isn&#8217;t being centralized and owned by Facebook itself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Geico, the second-largest auto insurer in the U.S., has fixed a security bug that let fraudsters steal customers&#8217; driver&#8217;s license numbers from its website.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20618953-geico-data-breach-notice">a data breach notice</a> filed with the California attorney general&#8217;s office, Geico said information gathered from other sources was used to &#8220;obtain unauthorized access to your driver’s license number through the online sales system on our website.&#8221;</p>
<p>The insurance giant did not say how many customers were affected by the breach but said the fraudsters accessed customer driver&#8217;s license numbers between January 21 and March 1. Companies are required to alert the state&#8217;s attorney general&#8217;s office when more than 500 state residents are affected by a security incident.</p>
<p>Geico said it had &#8220;reason to believe that this information could be used to fraudulently apply for unemployment benefits in your name.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many financially driven criminals target government agencies using stolen identities or data. But many U.S. states require a government ID — like a driver&#8217;s license — to file for unemployment benefits. To get a driver&#8217;s license number, fraudsters take public or previously breached data and exploit weaknesses in auto insurance websites to obtain a customer&#8217;s driver&#8217;s license number. That allows the fraudsters to obtain unemployment benefits in another person&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, San Francisco-based insurance startup Metromile <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/metromile-website-bug-hacker/">admitted a bug on its website</a> was used to obtain driver&#8217;s license numbers for six months before the bug was fixed in January.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve received correspondence from your state government and haven&#8217;t filed for unemployment benefits, there&#8217;s a good chance your personal data may have been used fraudulently.</p>
<p>Geico spokesperson Christine Tasher did not return multiple requests for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Venture capital is a networks business — from networks of founders to the web of investors and angels and gossamer threads of potential customers, talent and service providers. The density of those networks determines success: Find just the right person to fit a role or a slot on a cap table, and a startup might just get a bit more lift.</p>
<p>It’s a topic that Casey Caruso has thought a lot about. In a research project at Stanford, she looked at a slightly different form of network density: <a href="http://cs230.stanford.edu/projects_fall_2020/reports/55791766.pdf">using convolution neural network (CNN) models to evaluate investment decisions</a>, working with a group of three other authors to analyze how to optimize VC using algorithms. It’s a crossover point she’s familiar with, building upon a technical background and an engineering role at Google while also part-time investing with Bessemer.</p>
<p>While at a dinner at San Francisco’s northern Italian restaurant SPQR in Lower Pac Heights, she talked about investing with friends Lauren Stephanian, now a principal at blockchain-focused Pantera Capital, and Terri Burns, a partner at GV. They realized that much like how all roads lead to Rome, all three were on paths heading for the same direction: using technology to improve venture decision-making. “We are all computer scientists by training,” Caruso said. “Because of that fundamental training, we all approach problems pretty pragmatically.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The three began collaborating outside of their day jobs on how to integrate AI better into the earliest stages of venture, identifying features from models while also being open to the qualitative nature of the business. Then, they decided to more formally build a compact around investing in 2019, creating <a href="https://tlccollective.space">TLC Collective</a> (their combined initials) as a base to invest from.</p>
<p>Investing using their own combined capital, TLC writes angel and pre-seed checks into companies built by technical founders. So far, the group has invested in 11 companies, including data discovery platform <a href="https://selectstar.com">Select Star</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/select-star-raises-seed-to-automatically-document-datasets-for-data-scientists/">which I profiled a couple of weeks ago</a>), audio breakout app <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com">Clubhouse</a>, biology data platform <a href="https://watershed.ai">Watershed</a>, remote work manager <a href="https://friday.app">Friday</a>, cryptocurrency risk compliance platform <a href="https://trmlabs.com">TRM</a>, user infra platform <a href="https://stytch.com/">Slytch</a>, and a variety of others.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="nb91l5oyTr"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/select-star-raises-seed-to-automatically-document-datasets-for-data-scientists/">Select Star raises seed to automatically document datasets for data scientists</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Select Star raises seed to automatically document datasets for data scientists&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/select-star-raises-seed-to-automatically-document-datasets-for-data-scientists/embed/#?secret=nb91l5oyTr" data-secret="nb91l5oyTr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While their investments span sectors, the thread holding them all together is the technical chops of the founders. “We invest in very technical teams because we are very technical and that is our first qualifier,” Caruso said. Stephanian meanwhile emphasized that while technical talent is a key benchmark, the trio can diverge on areas of focus. “Despite having a similar background, we all have different interests and skillsets,” she said. They noted that Burns focuses on consumer, Stephanian on fintech, enterprise and crypto, and Caruso on frontier tech.</p>
<p>So far, the group remains a “side gig” for the three, and they are continuing to iterate on their underlying algorithm. “We go back and forth between using the actual algorithm versus just using it as a framework or reference,” Caruso explained. “We are finding a balance between the art and the science by applying our programming background.”</p>
<p>The collective’s pace has been roughly an investment per quarter, a bandwidth that the group said they are likely to continue for the time being. They continue to invest their own capital, and they don’t feel pressure to expand into new models like rolling funds or crowdfunding — at least, not yet. “We haven’t even considered doing a rolling fund,” Caruso said, although noted that <a href="https://www.beondeck.com/angels">the group is part of On Deck Angels</a>. Stephanian said that the competition today in that space is keen. “I have gotten so many messages from people who are raising their own syndicates,” she said.</p>
<p>The firm’s checks range from the tens of thousands to the hundreds of thousands of dollars per investment.</p>
<p>Like the networks powering their AI models and the networks they are building among their founders, TLC Collective has built a triangle of connections amidst its investors. As those connections expand out, the hope for the group is that they are able to expand the data to optimize their models while also investing in the best technical founders growing new businesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The era of cloud gaming hasn&#8217;t arrived with the intensity that may have seemed imminent a couple years ago when major tech platforms announced their plays. In 2021, the market is still pretty much nonexistent despite established presences from nearly all of tech&#8217;s biggest players.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been slow to roll out its Xbox Cloud Gaming beta to its users widely across platforms, but that&#8217;s likely because they know that, unlike other upstart platforms, there&#8217;s not a huge advantage to them rushing out the gate first. This week, the company will begin rolling out the service on iOS and PC to Game Pass Ultimate users, sending out invites to a limited number of users and scaling it up over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;The limited beta is our time to test and learn; we’ll send out more invites on a continuous basis to players in all 22 supported countries, evaluate feedback, continue to improve the experience, and add support for more devices,&#8221; wrote Xbox&#8217;s Catherine Gluckstein in a<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/04/19/xbox-cloud-gaming-windows-pc-and-apple-limited-beta/"> blog post</a>. &#8220;Our plan is to iterate quickly and open up to all Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members in the coming months so more people have the opportunity to play Xbox in all-new ways.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The service has been available in beta for Android users since last year but it&#8217;s been a slow expansion to other platforms outside that world.</p>
<p>A big part of that slowdown has been the result of Apple playing hardball with cloud gaming platform providers, whose business models represent a major threat to App Store gaming revenues. Apple announced a carve-out provision for cloud-gaming platforms that would maintain dependency on the App Store and in-app purchase frameworks but none of the providers seemed very happy with Apple&#8217;s solution. As a result, Xbox Cloud Gaming will operate entirely through the web on iOS inside mobile Safari.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration is opening an investigation into a crash involving a Tesla that authorities say was operating with no one behind the wheel, which left two men dead on late Saturday evening outside of Houston.</p>
<p>The 2019 Tesla Model S went off the road after it failed to negotiate a slight curve, <a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/tesla-spring-crash-fire/285-c28a4993-5b5f-43f4-a924-e39638390647">local CBS-affiliate KHOU-TV reported</a>. Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman told local reporters that the accident was unprecedented.</p>
<p>“Our office has never experienced a crash scene like this,” he said. “Normally, when the fire dept arrives, they have a vehicle fire under control in minutes, but this went on for close to four hours.” The long burn time was reportedly due to the electric vehicle batteries repeatedly reigniting.</p>
<p>More than 30,000 gallons of water were used to put out the fire. One of the victims was in the front passenger seat and the other was in the backseat, “and at the time of the accident there was no one in the [driver’s] seat,” Herman said.</p>
<p>Earlier on the day of the crash, Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1383548841438236674">retweeted news</a> that the company released its first-quarter 2021 safety report. “Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle,” he said. Tesla describes its Autopilot as a “suite of driver assistance features” and states that it requires “active driver supervision.”</p>
<p>“NHTSA is aware of the tragic crash involving a Tesla vehicle outside of Houston, Texas,” an spokesperson told TechCrunch. “NHTSA has immediately launched a Special Crash Investigation team to investigate the crash. We are actively engaged with local law enforcement and Tesla to learn more about the details of the crash and will take appropriate steps when we have more information.”</p>
<p>TechCrunch reached out to Tesla for comment and will update the story if the company responds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse/">Clubhouse&#8217;s latest fundraise</a>, Reddit today <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/mu3f0x/lets_talk_get_a_sneak_preview_of_reddit_talk_and/">officially unveiled</a> its Clubhouse rival, Reddit Talk following a recent report from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/reddit-clubhouse-voice-chat/">Mashable that revealed</a> the company had been developing audio-based social networking features. Like many of the newly launched Clubhouse clones, Reddit&#8217;s voice chat experience hasn&#8217;t deviated much from Clubhouse&#8217;s overall design where speakers sit at the top of the screen in a stage area of sorts, and listeners appear below &#8212; all with rounded profile icons, plus tools to react or raise a hand to ask to speak.</p>
<p>In Reddit&#8217;s case, however, it&#8217;s repurposed this Clubhouse-style format for its own communities, known as subreddits. Initially, Reddit Talk will live within subreddits, which are individual forums focused on a given topic or theme. Those community&#8217;s moderators will be the only ones able to start a talk for the time being, as the audio feature is still being tested, Reddit says.</p>
<p>These moderators will be given tools that allow them invite users to join, mute participants, and remove speakers during the live sessions. They can also ban unwanted users from the talk entirely and stop them from being able to rejoin.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Although only the subreddit moderators can start talks, once they are underway, they can invite anyone they choose to join them to speak. The other users can listen the Reddit Talk sessions across both iOS and Android.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140464" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140464" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140464" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/91jj01hxg5u61.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="446" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/91jj01hxg5u61.png 2928w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/91jj01hxg5u61.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/91jj01hxg5u61.png?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/91jj01hxg5u61.png?resize=768,504 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/91jj01hxg5u61.png?resize=680,446 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/91jj01hxg5u61.png?resize=1536,1007 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/91jj01hxg5u61.png?resize=2048,1343 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/91jj01hxg5u61.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140464" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Reddit</p></div></p>
<p>While the overall style is very much Clubhouse-like, Reddit has added its own touches. For example, users can react to speakers using a different set of emojis than you might find on rival services. Reddit&#8217;s product images today showed reactions that included popular Reddit designs like a rocket ship, the Reddit alien, and the diamond emoji, among others. Reddit says it&#8217;s currently testing a way for moderators to customize the background colors and the emoji used in their own communities when they launch Reddit Talk. They&#8217;re also able to change their own avatar&#8217;s appearance to fit the talk, too.</p>
<p>Reddit suggests the new audio features will make sense for things like Q&amp;As, AMAs (Ask Me Anything), lectures, sports radio-style discussions, community feedback sessions or even just hangouts.</p>
<p>The company is currently developing other features designed specifically to support AMAs and other types of conversations, it also noted.</p>
<p>In the comments of the Reddit Talk announcement, Reddit responded to questions from users about why it&#8217;s doing this, and acknowledged the Clubhouse similarities.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140463" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140463" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140463" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-19-at-12.58.21-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="451" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-19-at-12.58.21-PM.jpg 1346w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-19-at-12.58.21-PM.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-19-at-12.58.21-PM.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-19-at-12.58.21-PM.jpg?resize=768,509 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-19-at-12.58.21-PM.jpg?resize=680,451 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-19-at-12.58.21-PM.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140463" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Reddit</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that there is more to offer here by letting users have real-time live voice discussions with others in their communities &#8212; maybe talking about a sporting event while it’s on TV or listening to a casual chat or AMA with field experts,&#8221; Reddit&#8217;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/signal/">Product Lead for creators </a>wrote. &#8220;Yes, there are a few different platforms diving into live audio right now. Our hope is that by announcing this early with a community-first design, we will see engaging conversations hosted first by moderators, who we’ll be working with closely to ensure we’re creating a unique, supportive, and positive user experience,&#8221; the comment read.</p>
<p>There are more than a &#8220;few&#8221; other platforms now building out Clubhouse clones at this point, of course. Facebook has several tools on the way, Twitter has Spaces, and there are audio platforms in various stages of development from Discord, Telegram, Spotify and even LinkedIn, in the works.</p>
<p>Reddit Talk is not publicly available as it&#8217;s in a test period. But community moderators can join a <a href="https://forms.gle/TAR6Ee51o8NzqpGE7">waitlist</a> to be alerted as to when they can try out the feature for themselves. After the test period, Reddit says it will work with moderators to allow other trusted users to host talks through the new feature, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A stunning first quarter in venture capital funding was not restricted to the United States; Europe also had one hell of a start to the year.</p>
<p>According to data from Dealroom and Crunchbase News, an investor, and an analyst from PitchBook, European startups put together an impressive fundraising haul. The venture capital world kicked off its 2021 European investing cycle with enough activity to set the continent on the path that would crush yearly records.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Inside the data, there’s lots to unpack, including which sectors of European startups stood out in terms of capital raised, rising seed and late-stage deals, and dollar volume. We’ll also need to discuss exits &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/what-to-make-of-deliveroos-rough-ipo-debut/">the Deliveroo IPO and its various woes</a> was not the only transaction from the period worth understanding.</p>

And we’ll keep in mind that all venture capital data lags reality somewhat, as many deals from a particular period are not disclosed or discovered until long after they actually occurred.</p>
<p>In this case, it makes the numbers all the more impressive. Let’s get into the data.</p>
<h2>The big numbers</h2>
<p>Dealroom was first out of the gate, <a href="https://twitter.com/dealroomco/status/1377575470565298179">reporting that</a> European startups had a record quarter in Q1 2021 back when April just got started. Its preliminary results for the first quarter indicated that startups on the continent raised €16.6 billion, or $19.9 billion at today’s exchange rates.</p>
<p>That total was not only a record, but what Dealroom described as double the results of Q1 2020. While we’ve become slightly inured in recent months to the venture capital market’s rapid pace and capital-rich environment, it’s worth considering for a moment, as the first quarter of last year ended, how few of us would have guessed that just a year later &#8212; as COVID-19 still harms public health and disrupts life and business &#8212; we’d see numbers like this.</p>
<p>The Dealroom data, however, was not all records. Round volume by the group’s estimates was down from the year-ago period, if slightly better than the last few quarters. The general move toward the later-stage and larger-round venture capital market is alive and well in Europe.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Jumping on the TC Early Stage bandwagon this well, early, offers a sweet benefit — you’ll save $100 bucks. But that early-bird savings disappears in less than two weeks. Don’t miss out. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-2/?display=true">Buy your Early Stage 2021: Marketing and Fundraising ticket</a> <strong>before </strong><strong>April 30, at 11:59 p.m. (PT).</strong></p>

<p>You’ll hear from top-tier investors, seasoned founders and respected subject-matter experts across the startup ecosystem. Topics range from fundraising and marketplace positioning to growth marketing and content development.</p>
<p>But it’s more than just listening — all the presentations are highly interactive. It’s a rare opportunity to ask questions and get answers from the folks who’ve been there, done that and want to help you move forward.</p>
<p>We debuted TC Early Stage last year, and it was so well received that we doubled-down in 2021. Here’s what Ashley Barrington, the founder of MarketPearl, told us about her experience.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Early Stage 2020 was a great opportunity to hear seasoned startup founders talking about their experiences and how they dealt with many of the same challenges I faced then and am going through now. It’s like a mini-MBA session on early-stage companies.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Here are just two of the high-profile speakers lined up to share their knowledge in July at TC Early Stage 2021. We’re adding new speakers every week, so keep checking back.</p>

</ul>
<p>That’s just the tip of the TC Early Stage experience. Day one will be packed with presentations and break-out sessions and day two…well that’s a whole new realm of opportunity. That’s the day-long TC Early Stage Pitch-off. TechCrunch will select 10 standout startups to pitch to a panel of VC judges for invaluable feedback and prizes, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon&#8217;s Project Kuiper satellite constellation is one step closer to actually making it to space: The company announced it has secured an agreement with the United Launch Alliance (ULA) to fly its satellites on nine Atlas V rocket launches. Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/amazons-project-kuiper-will-seek-multiple-launch-providers-to-carry-its-satellites-to-space/">intends to use multiple launch providers and spacecraft</a> to ultimately get the full complement of 3,236 Kuiper satellites into low Earth orbit (LEO), but ULA is the first launch provider that Amazon has signed or announced.</p>
<p>ULA&#8217;s Atlas V is a proven workhorse in the space launch industry, having flown 85 prior missions with a perfect track record. The spacecraft was used to launch NASA&#8217;s Perseverance rover, for example, as well as Lockheed Martin&#8217;s OSIRIS-REx robotic asteroid exploration craft. While Amazon and ULA detailed to total number of launch vehicles that the contract covers, they didn&#8217;t share a timeline about when we can expect the launches to take place.</p>

<p>Late last year, I spoke to Amazon SVP of Devices &amp; Services Dave Limp at our TC Sessions: Space events, and I asked him about timelines for launches. Limp said at the time that Amazon was about at the &#8220;middle of [its] design phase&#8221; for the Project Kuiper satellites, which indicates there&#8217;s still work to be done before they enter mass production, which would obviously precede launch.</p>
<p>Limp also pointed out that the clock is ticking for Amazon in terms of its FCC license to operate the constellation, so it essentially has to &#8220;have half [its] constellation up in about six years.&#8221; That will mean an aggressive launch schedule once the design phase is complete and its actually in the process of building its satellites.</p>
<p>Amazon has invested a lot of capital and time into Project Kuiper, with a commitment to back it with an initial $10 billion investment, and a dedicated staff on the project that now includes 500 people, as well as a dedicated office and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/amazon-will-establish-a-new-headquarters-for-its-kuiper-satellite-broadband-project/">research &amp; development facility in Redmond near its global HQ</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple will reinstate Parler on its App Store following its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/apple-suspend-parler-from-app-store/">multi-month ban,</a> according to a letter Apple has sent to Sen. Mike Lee and Rep. Ken Buck, which was made public this morning via <a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1384159186209054721">a post</a> on Congressman Buck&#8217;s Twitter. TechCrunch also obtained the letter and confirmed with Apple directly. The lawmakers had earlier written to Apple on March 31, 2021 to ask for additional information about why the app, which is heavily favored by conservatives, had been removed from the App Store. Apple&#8217;s response explains how Parler violated its policies but said it [Apple] has engaged in extensive conversions with Parler&#8217;s team since the app&#8217;s removal. It also says Parler&#8217;s proposed updates to the app, its content and its moderation practices will allow it to be approved for reinstatement to the App Store immediately update its release.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">On March 31, <a href="https://twitter.com/SenMikeLee?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SenMikeLee</a> and I sent a letter demanding answers about why Apple removed Parler from the App Store.</p>

Huge win for free speech. <a href="https://t.co/FQBDSSSFGk">pic.twitter.com/FQBDSSSFGk</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Congressman Ken Buck (@RepKenBuck) <a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1384159186209054721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 19, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Apple was one of several tech platforms that banned Parler following the Capitol riot, after it came to light how the app had been used by Trump supporters and other far-right users<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/01/06/trump-riot-twitter-parler-proud-boys-boogaloos-antifa-qanon/6570794002/"> to call for violence </a>and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/trump-rioters-planned-online?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">organize their plans</a> to storm the Capitol. The insurrection left five people dead, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/police-union-says-140-officers-injured-in-capitol-riot/2021/01/27/60743642-60e2-11eb-9430-e7c77b5b0297_story.html">more than 140 police officers injured</a> and resulted in <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/capitol-riot-arrests-2021-04-16/">hundreds of arrests.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/">Google</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/amazon-web-services-gives-parler-24-hour-notice-that-it-will-suspend-services-to-the-company/">Amazon</a> also quickly banned Parler from their respective platforms after the Capitol riot.</p>
<p>In Apple&#8217;s case, the company had first given Parler notice the app would be removed unless the company submitted a content moderation improvement plan. But Parler&#8217;s then-CEO John Matze posted to his own Parler account that he would not cave to Apple&#8217;s ultimatums and the app, having failed to meet Apple&#8217;s requirements, was banned. In the weeks that followed, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-parler-ceo/parler-ceo-john-matze-says-he-was-fired-by-board-idUSKBN2A33B0">Matze was fired</a> by Parler&#8217;s board, controlled by Republican Party donor Rebekah Mercer.</p>
<p>Parler has been working to obtain re-entry to the App Store since its removal, but those efforts continued to fall short. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-10/parler-cuts-ios-team-after-apple-blocks-return-to-app-store">Bloomberg reported</a> last month, for example, that Parler had submitted new guidelines in February that were insufficient to comply with the App Store rules due to issues with violating content. That letter, addressed to Parler&#8217;s chief policy officer on February 25, stated: &#8220;There is no place for hateful, racist, discriminatory content on the App Store.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to Apple&#8217;s new letter, released today, things have changed. It says that Apple has now informed Parler as of April 14, 2021 that its proposed moderation practices will qualify it for reinstatement. The letter, signed by Timothy Powderly, Apple&#8217;s senior director of Government Affairs in the Americas, says:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the period since Apple removed the Parler app from the App Store, Apple’s App Review Team has engaged in substantial conversations with Parler in an effort to bring the Parler app into compliance with the Guidelines and reinstate it in the App Store. As a result of those conversations, Parler has proposed updates to its app and the app’s content moderation practices, and the App Review Team has informed Parler as of April 14, 2021 that its proposed updated app will be approved for reinstatement to the App Store. Apple anticipates that the updated Parler app will become available immediately upon Parler releasing it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The letter also notes that it did not consult with Google or Amazon in respect to its original decision to remove Parler &#8212; a response meant to put to rest the false claims of a coordinated effort between tech giants to silence conservatives.</p>
<p>Apple did not detail what specific changes Parler had agreed to, but earlier this year, the app was still non-compliant with Apple&#8217;s guidelines for allowing user profile pictures that featured swastikas and white nationalist imagery, and because it had permitted usernames and posts that were misogynistic, homophobic and racist, Bloomberg said at the time.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s letter, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/19/tech/apple-parler-app-store/index.html">first reported this morning by CNN</a>, indicates Parler will be approved immediately when submitted.</p>
<p>Apple also told TechCrunch the app&#8217;s relaunch time frame will be up to Parler to decide, but offered no additional comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://alan.com">Alan</a> has raised a $220 million funding round at a $1.67 billion valuation (€185 million and €1.4 billion respectively). Coatue is leading the round with Dragoneer, Exor, and existing investors Index Ventures, Ribbit Capital and Temasek also participating.</p>
<p>Alan has been building health insurance products from scratch. When I first covered the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/24/alan-wants-to-turn-health-insurance-into-software-as-a-service/">back in 2016</a>, the startup had just managed to get approval from regulators to become an official health insurance company.</p>
<p>Since then, it’s been a not-so-slow and steady growth story as the company now covers 160,000 people. Overall, Alan generates over €100 million in annualized revenue. While most of that revenue is spent back on claims, it’s an impressive revenue trajectory.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Like other insurance companies, Alan has some capital requirements to comply with health insurance regulation. Alan has to raise more if it wants to insure more people. But that’s just part of the story as the startup still had enough cash on its bank account for the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
<p>“The context is that we managed to end the year 2020 very strong, finally — and I say finally because it’s been stressful until the last minute,” co-founder and CEO Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve told me.</p>
<p>Alan managed to meet its goals and international expansion finally started to take off. Many startups try to raise when they’re in a strong position. You shouldn’t wait until you have your back against the wall and that’s exactly what’s happening here.</p>
<p>“We thought it was the right time and we had multiple term sheets. Even though valuation is really good we first looked at a partner that has a really long-term vision,” Samuelian-Werve said.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company can iterate on its core product — health insurance — and everything that makes Alan a super app — a single app that lets you access several services. In France, employees are covered by both the national healthcare system and private insurance companies. Alan sells its products to other companies so that their employees are automatically covered by Alan contracts. It’s a sort of B2B2C play.</p>
<p>9,400 companies have opted for Alan in France, Belgium and Spain — the company’s home market remains its main market. Clients include WeWork, Deliveroo, JustEat, Vitaliance and Big Mamma. By 2023, Alan wants to reach 1 million members.</p>
<p>In order to gain more customers, Alan is betting on three pillars —&nbsp;product innovation, customer satisfaction through additional services, and expansions to new verticals and markets.</p>
<p>When it comes to product innovation, Alan has designed a modular insurance builder. Small companies can subscribe to Alan in a few clicks. Big companies can tweak every single parameter to build the right insurance package for them.</p>
<p>After that, the company tries to make it easy to manage your health insurance. You’ll soon be able to automatically manage sick leaves, change the employee affiliation status, etc. As for employees, the company has always promoted a transparent offering. For instance, you should know how much you’re going to pay out of pocket when you see a doctor. You can see a map of doctors around you and how much they charge on average. This way, there’s no surprise.</p>
<p>Alan also tries to reimburse you as quickly as possible. If it’s a straightforward claim, the startup tries to analyze and categorize your claim as quickly as possible and then issue an instant SEPA transfer. 75% of claims are reimbursed and available on your bank account in less than an hour.</p>
<p>These core product features definitely contributes to customer satisfaction. But Alan is expanding beyond insurance products with several additional services that should increase retention. For instance, you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/health-insurance-startup-alan-lets-you-chat-with-a-doctor/">chat with a doctor</a>, get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/health-insurance-startup-alan-launches-free-medical-app-alan-baby/">medical advice for your baby’s health</a>, get a free <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/17/health-insurance-startup-alan-covers-meditation-app-subscription/">meditation app subscription</a>, start a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/alan-partners-with-krys-livi-for-telemedicine-appointments/">telehealth appointment</a> via a partner, talk with someone about your mental health, etc.</p>
<p>Those services contribute to turning Alan into a super app for your health. Essentially, as soon as you’re insured by Alan, you become a member and can access all those services without additional charges.</p>
<p>Eventually, Alan plans to launch a personal care guidance service to help you contact the right healthcare professional based on your health issue. In Spain, Alan can already book appointments for you.</p>
<p>Finally, Alan plans to reach new customers through aggressive expansion goals. The company plans to hire 400 people within the next three years and expand to other industries with tailor-made insurance products, such as retail, wholesale and manufacturing.</p>
<p>While the company is still going to focus on France, Belgium and Spain in the near future, it is looking at opportunities across Europe. So let’s see where Alan is going to expand next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve all heard the phrase “passive income” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to describe how people can make money by owning rental properties. Many Americans would love to passively earn money, but the process of becoming a landlord can be intimidating and complicated. </span></p>
<p>I mean, how many people have looked back and wished they hadn&#8217;t sold a property after seeing its value rise years after selling it?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And those who are already landlords can get overwhelmed by the complexities of managing properties.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One startup out of Boston, <a href="https://knoxfinancial.com">Knox Financial</a>, aims to help people identify and manage residential rentals with its algorithm-based platform, and it’s raised a $10 million Series A to help it further that goal. Boston-based <a href="https://www.g20vc.com">G20 Ventures</a> led the round, which included participation from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greycroft, Pillar VC, 2LVC, and Gaingels.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment brings Knox’s total raised since its inception in 2018 to $14.7 million. The company closed on a $3 million seed round in January 2020, led by Greycroft.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knox co-founder and CEO David Friedman is no stranger to startups. He founded Boston Logic – an integrated marketing platform and online marketing services for real estate offices and agents – in 2004. He sold that company (now under the name Propertybase) to Providence Equity for an undisclosed amount in 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knox launched its platform in March of 2019, with the goal of offering homeowners who are ready to move “a completely hands-off way” of converting a home they’re moving out of into an investment property. It also claims to help landlords more easily and efficiently manage their rentals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of its seed round early last year, the company was only operating in the Boston market and had 50 units on its platform. It’s now operating in seven states, has “hundreds” of investment properties on its platform and is overseeing a portfolio of more than $100 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how does it work? Once a property is enrolled on Knox’s “Frictionless Ownership Platform,” the company automates and oversees the property’s finances and taxes, insurance, leasing and legal, tenant and property care, banking and bill pay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knox also has developed a rental pricing and projection model for calculating the investment rate of return a property will produce over time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We save investors a lot and almost always make their portfolios more profitable,” Friedman said. “If someone is moving or upsizing, we can turn properties into incredible ROI generators or cash flow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s revenue model is simple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a dollar of rent moves through our system, we keep a dime,” Friedman told TechCrunch. “We align our interests with our customers. If there’s no rent coming in, we’re not making money. Or if a tenant doesn&#8217;t pay rent, we don’t make money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knox plans to use its new capital to continue expanding geographically and getting the word out to more people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to become the de facto platform for real estate investment acquisition and ownership,” Friedman said. “And we have to be coast to coast to really do that for everybody. So, we’re still very early in our growth trajectory.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob Hower, co-founder and partner of G20 Ventures, shared that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">weeks after his college graduation, he had bought a fixer upper with his mother’s help. A week after finishing renovations, he put the house on the market. Over the subsequent 5 months, he gradually reduced the price as the market softened, and eventually the property sold at a small profit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That house now is worth a multiple of what I paid for it,” Hower recalls. “In hindsight, the mistake I made was deciding to sell the house at all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That experience helped Hower appreciate what he describes as a “clarity of thinking” in Knox’s business model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Had Knox existed decades ago, I&#8217;d likely still have that fixer-upper I bought after college,” he said. “Investing platforms such as Betterment have collapsed multiple advising and optimization activities into a simple single-sign-on service, and Knox is the first company to apply this type model to residential real estate investing.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tyltgo wants to make it easier for restaurants and small businesses to compete with same-day delivery services offered by the likes of Amazon and HelloFresh. The Canadian company, which recently raised CAD $2.3 million (USD $1.8 million) in a seed round, is akin to a white label Uber Eats, providing businesses an on-demand delivery platform under their own branding that connects them to gig economy couriers.</p>
<p>“I think about us as a post-purchase experience company,” co-founder and CEO Jaden Pereira told TechCrunch. “The recipient goes directly onto the merchant’s platform and places orders through them, so it feels like they&#8217;re interacting with the brand they purchased from throughout the entire experience. Our messages, notifications, tracking pages and delivery are all customized under the merchant’s brand name, but it’s powered by Tyltgo.”</p>
<p>The necessity of having products delivered during the pandemic&#8217;s shelter-in-place orders combined with the massive reach of e-commerce giants like Amazon has created a society that expects same-day deliveries. Tyltgo recognized the exclusionary nature of that reality on smaller businesses with less time and fewer resources, and contrived to remedy the situation with some innovative tech and gig economy couriers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In July 2018, Pereira, 22, co-founded the company with fellow student and developer Aaron Paul while studying at the University of Waterloo. Pereira originally did deliveries himself as a side hustle, while building up a consumer-facing service on Shopify. In October 2019, Pereira and Paul shifted focus to B2B, identifying the real problem as merchants struggling to offer quality same-day delivery at an affordable price.</p>

<p>From December 2019 to December 2020, Tyltgo’s revenue grew 2,000%, says Pereira. The company started 2020 with two staff members and ended with nine, including former head of Uber Eats Canada’s marketplace operations, Joe Rhew, and former director of engineering at Goldman Sachs-acquired fintech company Financeit, Adnan Ali.</p>
<p>Aided by funding from VC firm TI Platform Management, Y Combinator and angel investor Charles Songhurst, Tyltgo projects another 1,500% revenue growth for 2021. The company’s goal is to expand its team, develop an API and app-based platform and add 100 more merchants across Ontario.</p>
<p>Pereira said Tyltgo originally focused on florists, and occasionally pharmacies, but demand from the restaurant industry led to the company’s new target &#8212; meal kit deliveries.</p>
<p>Meal kit services that provide the culinarily challenged with perfectly portioned ingredients and cooking instructions were already gaining popularity in the before times. When the pandemic hit, services like HelloFresh and Blue Apron saw even more growth. As restaurants struggled to keep their businesses open, many started to get in on the action, delivering restaurant-quality meals with instructions for heating and serving.</p>
<p>The global meal kit delivery services market is expected to reach almost $20 billion by 2027, with heat-and-eat options taking a large share of that market. Tyltgo is counting on the success of this industry. It has already secured partnerships with restaurants like General Assembly Pizza and Crafty Ramen, as well as with more traditional meal kit delivery services from grocery stores and organic farms.</p>

<p>Pereira said working in the “quasi-perishable space” of flowers and meal kits is both a challenge and a differentiator for the company. Depending on the contents of the delivery, Tyltgo will determine its perishability window and make sure to match that window with a driver. It’s also got an advanced fleet management platform that assigns a number of deliveries to suit the size of a courier’s vehicle.</p>
<p>“In the earlier days, the hardest part was being able to match those perishability windows without causing damage to the products,” said Pereira. “We all know that in logistics, you have to account for traffic, weather conditions, all these other things, but you have an eight-hour delivery window to get out 35 deliveries.”</p>
<p>Another challenge is ensuring the top-quality service Tyltgo advertises while working in the gig economy. Selecting for reliable couriers has slowed the company down at points, but Tyltgo aims to grow capacity only if it can simultaneously maintain a low error threshold.</p>
<p>“We won’t bring on a merchant if we don’t think we have the capacity to handle their deliveries and meet those expectations,” said Pereira.</p>
<p>Whether or not Tyltgo’s meal kit focus will end up driving scalability in the long run, the platform itself has legs. Pereira’s goal is to see Tyltgo become a part of every post-purchase customer experience for all retail trade categories, and that includes expanding into customer service, branding and transactions on top of delivery.</p>
<p>“The main reason why we’re doing this is because a lot of these smaller, brick-and-mortar retailers don’t have the time and resources to be able to compete with the Amazons of the world,” said Pereira. “We want to be able to put that power in their hands.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-commerce is booming as retailers race to transform their brick-and-mortar footprints into online storefronts. By some counts, the market grew an astonishing 42% in 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/u-s-e-commerce-on-track-for-its-first-1-trillion-year-by-2022-due-to-lasting-pandemic-impacts/">estimates show that online spending in the U.S. will surpass $1 trillion by 2022</a>. It’s a bonanza, and everyone is figuring out this new terrain.</p>
<p>Consumers are likely familiar with the front-end brands for these storefronts — with companies like Amazon, Shopify, Square, and Stripe owning attention — but it’s the tooling behind the curtain that is increasingly determining the competitiveness of individual stores.</p>
<p><strong>Klaviyo</strong> may not be a household name to consumers (at least, not yet), but in many ways, this startup has become the standard by which email marketers are judged today, triangulating against veterans Mailchimp and Constant Contact and riding the e-commerce wave to new heights.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012, this Boston-based company helps marketers personalize and automate their email messaging to customers. By now, most people are intimately familiar with these kinds of emails; if you’ve ever given your email address to an online store, the entreaties to come back to your abandoned cart or browse the latest sale are Klaviyo’s bread and butter.</p>
<p>It may seem obvious in retrospect that email would grow to become a premier platform for marketing, but this wasn’t the case even a few years ago when social ads and search engine marketing were the dominant paradigm. Today, owned marketing and customer experience management are white-hot trends, and Klaviyo has surged from a lifestyle business to a multi-billion dollar behemoth in just a few short years. Its story is at the heart of the internet economy today, and the future.</p>
<p>TechCrunch’s writer and analyst for this EC-1 is <b>Chris Morrison</b>. Morrison, who previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/roblox-ec1/">wrote our EC-1 on Roblox</a>, has been a writer and independent game developer covering the video game industry and the marketing challenges that come with publishing. As an analyst and a potential user, he’s in a unique position to explain the Klaviyo story. The lead editor for this package was <b>Danny Crichton</b>, the assistant editor was <b>Ram Iyer</b>, the copy editor was <b>Richard Dal Porto</b> and illustrations were created by <b>Nigel Sussman</b>.</p>
<p><i>Klaviyo had no say in the content of this analysis and did not get advance access to it. Morrison has no financial ties to Klaviyo or other conflicts of interest to disclose.</i></p>
<p>The Klaviyo EC-1 comprises four main articles numbering 9,700 words and a reading time of 43 minutes. Let’s take a look:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Part 1: Origin story</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-origin/">How Klaviyo transformed from a lifestyle business into a $4.15B email titan</a>&#8221; (2,600 words/10 minutes) — Explores the rise of Klaviyo from a database for e-commerce data into a modern email powerhouse as it successively learned from customers and bootstrapped in the absence of funding from accelerators and early VCs.</li>
<li><strong>Part 2: Business and growth</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-business/">How Klaviyo used data and no-code to transform owned marketing</a>&#8221; (3,000 words/12 minutes) — Analyzes Klaviyo&#8217;s recent growth and how marketers increasingly focus on owned marketing channels and customer experience management.</li>
<li><strong>Part 3: Dynamics of e-commerce marketing</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-marketing/">Marketing in 2021 is emotional and not just transactional</a>&#8221; (2,200 words/9 minutes) — To fully understand Klaviyo and this new world of martech, this article contextualizes how and why marketers are increasingly trying to personalize and build deeper emotional bonds with their customers outside of social media channels.</li>
<li><strong>Part 4: Lessons on startup growth</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-lessons/">Drama and quirk aren’t necessary for startup success</a>&#8221; (1,900 words/8 minutes) — Founders shouldn&#8217;t have to keep learning the same lessons over and over again. Klaviyo offers a number of tried-and-true tutorials to understand how to build a competitive startup and not get bogged down in finding product-market fit and scaling.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startups are stories of feverish dreams and obsessive fears. Short of hearing it from the source, a glimpse into the inbox of a founder would be the best way to experience the travails they endure on the way to building a business. A customer finally makes a purchase, a VC invests or walks away, an employee signs their offer letter — all of the major and minor milestones of a startup are communicated via that now-ancient medium of email.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Current Klaviyo users may be surprised to hear that email was not a part of the initial product.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Email’s ubiquity is only part of the story, though. It’s also a symbol of freedom: The last social platform that remains relatively open and free from the clutches of a single monopoly owner. It’s a market rife with entrenched incumbents, but one that simultaneously continues to invite founders to find some new take on this venerable communications channel and make it better for everyone.</p>
<p>That was the mission that Andrew Bialecki and Ed Hallen undertook when they founded <a href="https://www.klaviyo.com">Klaviyo</a> back in 2012. What they perhaps didn’t bank on was just how long of a route they were about to take — or how many rejections they might find in their own inboxes from accelerators and VCs who never thought a new generation of email service providers could make it.</p>
<p>So they bootstrapped, kept things lean. They debated canceling dinners to pay the bills when customers churned. And along the way, they built a special startup that is today valued at a whopping $4.15 billion. Klaviyo is the story of how two scrappy, inexperienced entrepreneurs set out to build a lifestyle business — and ended up creating an email titan.</p>
<h2>Racing to the starting line</h2>
<p>Klaviyo’s origin story sounds a bit like the generic advice given by every book on entrepreneurship. Andrew Bialecki — he goes by AB — had a need that no existing company filled. So, he started a company to address that need.</p>
<p>It began with what he calls a side hustle: a website devoted to cataloging the dates and locations of running races. Bialecki had the technical chops to build it, but the data wasn’t already available online and he needed race organizers to provide it. That, in turn, meant he needed to let them know his site existed and constantly follow up to make sure they were using it.</p>
<p>“I realized I&#8217;m on the phone with people and it&#8217;s never going to scale. After a while, I was working on that while I was at another startup, and I said I have two options here. Either I can go all-in on road races, or all-in on the problem: ‘How do we help these businesses connect with the people using their software or products?&#8217;” recalls Bialecki.</p>
<p>By then, he already had a co-founder in mind. Bialecki had been a student together with Ed Hallen at MIT, but the pair actually met while working at Applied Predictive Technologies (APT), a Washington, D.C. tech consultancy.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;d read all those books on, hey, when you&#8217;re looking for someone to start a business with, you want someone with similar values who&#8217;s also complementary,” says Bialecki. “I&#8217;d known he was kind of interested in starting a company, and we had really complementary skillsets. I loved the engineering and design and product, and he was a big product guy too, but was used to working with customers and clients.”</p>
<h2>An email company that didn’t (initially) do email</h2>
<p>Current Klaviyo users may be surprised to hear that email was not part of the product that emerged. Instead, Bialecki and Hallen built a database to collect all the e-commerce data that was falling through the cracks.</p>
<p>“Once we really talked to a lot of e-commerce people, it was clear there were long-standing problems,” says Hallen.</p>
<p>Bialecki adds, “There are facts you know, like their name, their email address, their favorite color or something they told you about their birthday. But some of the harder stuff was, jeez, how many times has this person visited my website, bought something from me, what products did they buy and how is that trending over time? Were they a really frequent customer that dropped off the face of the Earth?”</p>
<p>As they spoke to customers, the founders realized that handling customers&#8217; data and making it useful to them was going to be critical to Klaviyo’s success. It just so happened that gathering data matched well with their experiences working at APT.</p>
<p>“We had a ton of experience stitching together data sources,” says Hallen. “We took that expertise and put it as our foundation. What&#8217;s the most broken, largest market, and let&#8217;s really tie data to it, not as an afterthought.”</p>

<p>What that required, in practical terms, was spending the initial months building a custom database to store the disparate data types that come up during e-commerce transactions — events, documents and object data models. Conor O’Mahony, who joined the company in 2018 as chief product officer and departed this month to become an advisor, says that the company’s early time investment in its database laid the foundations for its later success in scaling up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Email is the communication medium that refuses to die.</p>
<p>“Eventually, every technology is trumped by something new and better. And I feel that email is ready to be trumped. But by what?” <a href="https://avc.com/2007/05/what_trumps_ema/">wrote the venture capitalist Fred Wilson in 2007</a>. Three years later, <a href="https://avc.com/2010/04/social-networking-vs-email/">he updated readers</a> that other forms of messaging had outgrown email. “It looks like email&#8217;s reign as the king of communication is ending and social networking is now supreme,” he said. (To be fair to Wilson, his view was nuanced enough to continue investing in email tech.)</p>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>Investors weren’t alone — marketers have also spent years anticipating the next big thing.</p>
<p>“It was SMS, it was YouTube, it was Instagram. Before that it was Facebook, then it was Snapchat and TikTok. I kinda feel like individually all those things are fleeting. I think people found: You know what? Everyone still opens their emails every day,” says Darin Hager, a former sneaker entrepreneur who is now an email marketing manager at <a href="https://www.adjustmedia.co/">Adjust Media</a>.</p>
<p>Email has an estimated <a href="https://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Email-Statistics-Report-2019-2023-Executive-Summary.pdf">four billion users</a> today and continues to grow steadily even as mature social networks plateau. Estimates of the number of nonspam messages sent each day range from <a href="https://talosintelligence.com/reputation_center/email_rep">25 billion</a> to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/456500/daily-number-of-e-mails-worldwide/">over 300 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly for a marketing channel with so much volume, there’s voluminous competition to send and program those emails. Yet, despite the competition, Klaviyo didn’t just break into the market — it has also achieved an unusual level of excitement and loyalty among marketers despite its youthful history.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re not using Klaviyo and you&#8217;re in e-commerce, then it&#8217;s not very professional. If you see ‘Sent by Constant Contact or Mailchimp’ at the bottom of an email by a brand, it makes it look like they&#8217;re not really there yet,” Hager said.</p>
<p>How did Klaviyo become the standard solution among email marketers?</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-origin/">In Klaviyo’s origin story</a>, we delved into part of the answer: The company began life as an e-commerce analytics service. Once it matured to compete as an email service provider, Klaviyo benefited from the edge given by its deeper, more comprehensive focus on data.</p>
<p>However, that leaves several questions unanswered. Why is email so important to e-commerce? What are the substantive differences between Klaviyo’s feature set and those of its competitors? And why did several large, well-funded incumbents fail to capitalize on building an advantage in data first?</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll answer those questions — as well as laying out the significance of COVID-19 on the e-commerce market, and how newsletters and AI figure into the company’s future.</p>
<h2>A positive Outlook on email’s longevity</h2>
<p>Email is one of the oldest tech verticals: <a href="https://www.constantcontact.com/">Constant Contact</a>, one of the most venerable email service providers (ESPs), was founded in 1995, <a href="https://xconomy.com/boston/2007/10/03/constant-contact-completes-107-million-ipo-shares-up-10-out-of-the-gate/">went public in 2007</a> and <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2015/11/02/email-marketing-giant-constant-contact-acquired-for-1-billion/">was taken private in 2015 for $1 billion</a>. By the time Klaviyo started in 2012, the space was well served by numerous incumbents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brands are emotions made physical. The clothes we wear, the media we consume, the devices we use — all signal not only to others what we value and see in ourselves, they also are a way to construct our very identities. Experimenting to deepen that bond has been at the core of the marketing profession for a century; its origins rooted in Freudian psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>There had always been one critical limitation, though: Marketers had to appeal to the masses. Radio, television and print media allowed brands to deliver only one message to everyone, no matter if their product conferred luxury or smart cost-consciousness.</p>
<p>On the internet, the masses have been shattered into ever smaller shards, shifting that marketing calculus toward targeted audiences and social network interest groups. Today, niche brands, large corporations and every business in between are reaching ever-narrower audiences.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Marketers who become expert at personalization, especially for existing customers through owned marketing platforms like email, will hold an edge over their competitors.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Yet, advertising and social networks are competitive marketplaces. Over time, prices to reach niche audiences rise, and strategies that once worked become unviable. In 2021, these perpetual challenges are joined by two new factors: a fresh influx of new e-commerce brands and changing privacy policies on third-party platforms.</p>
<p>Klaviyo benefits from these secular trends. While the cost or difficulty of acquiring new customers may increase, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-business/">we looked at in the second part of this EC-1</a>, the cost of emailing an existing one remains much the same. Marketers who become expert at personalization, especially for existing customers through owned marketing platforms like email, will hold an edge over their competitors. It’s no longer about marketing to narrow slices of audiences — it&#8217;s about building an emotional bond with an audience of one.</p>
<h2>To a booming economy, now ad inflation</h2>
<p>While 2020 was a banner year for e-commerce in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the early months of 2021 have brought about a new problem: Customer acquisition costs are rising, sometimes to a worrying degree. For instance, one company interviewed by TechCrunch that did not wish to be named said it has seen its return on investment for Facebook ads fall by nearly half in the first months of 2021. Such inflation has also been <a href="https://www.ecimediamanagement.com/eci-inflation-report-q1-2021/">predicted by firms like ECI Media Management</a>.</p>
<p>There are two possible reasons for this increase. First, an unprecedented number of companies are moving online, spurred by COVID-19 and worldwide lockdowns.</p>
