										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/">Raspberry Pi Pico</a>, a tiny little microcontroller that lets you build hardware projects with some code running on the microcontroller. Even more interesting, the Raspberry Pi Foundation is using its own RP2040 chip, which means that the foundation is now making its own silicon.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with microcontrollers, those devices let you control other parts or other devices. You might think that you can already do this kind of stuff with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/23/the-raspberry-pi-foundation-unveils-the-raspberry-pi-4/">a regular Raspberry Pi</a>. But microcontrollers are specifically designed to interact with other things.</p>
<p>They’re cheap, they’re small and they draw very little power. You can start developing your project with a breadboard to avoid soldering. You can pair it with a small battery and it can run for weeks or even months. Unlike computers, microcontrollers don’t run traditional operating systems. Your code runs directly on the chip.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Like other microcontrollers, the Raspberry Pi Pico has dozens of input and output pins on the sides of the device. Those pins are important as they act as the interface with other components. For instance, you can make your microcontroller interact with an LED light, get data from various sensors, show some information on a display, etc.</p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi Pico uses the RP2040 chip. It has a dual-core Arm processor (running at 133MHz), 264KB of RAM, 26 GPIO pins including 3 analog inputs, a micro-USB port and a temperature sensor. It doesn’t come with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. And it costs $4.</p>
<p>If you want to run something on the Raspberry Pi Pico, it’s quite easy. You plug your device to your computer using the micro-USB port. You boot up the Raspberry Pi Pico while pressing the button. The device will appear on your computer as an external drive.</p>
<p>In addition to C, you can use MicroPython as your development language. It’s a Python-inspired language for microcontrollers. The Raspberry Pi Foundation has written a ton of <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/pico/getting-started/">documentation</a> and a <a href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/pico_datasheet.pdf">datasheet</a> for the Pico.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Raspberry Pi Foundation wants to let others benefit from its own chip design. It has reached out to Adafruit, Arduino, Pimoroni and Sparkfun so that they can build their own boards using the RP2040 chip. There will be an entire ecosystem of RP2040-powered devices.</p>
<p>This is an interesting move for the Raspberry Pi Foundation as it can go down this path and iterate on its own chip design with more powerful variants. It provides two main advantages —&nbsp;the ability to control exactly what to put on board, and price.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based early-stage fund <a href="https://apx.ac/">APX</a> today announced that its two investors, European publisher <a href="https://www.axelspringer.com/en/">Axel Springer</a> and sports car maker <a href="https://www.porsche.digital/">Porsche</a>, have increased their investment in the fund to a total of €55 million.</p>
<p>With this, APX, which <a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/company/porsche-digital-axel-springer-ventures-accelerator-apx-start-up-support-joerg-rheinboldt-henric-hungerhoff-15205.html">launched in 2018</a>, is now able to deploy up to €500,000 in pre-Series A seed funding per company. That&#8217;s up from up to €100,000 when the fund launched. So far, the group has invested in more than 70 companies and plans to increase this number to close to 200 by 2022.</p>
<p>When APX launched, the fund didn&#8217;t disclose the total investment from Porsche and Axel Springer. Today, the team said that the new investment &#8220;more than doubles APX&#8217;s total amount for investing in new and current companies.&#8221; APX also stressed that the total volume of the fund is now &#8220;at least&#8221; €55 million, in part because the investors can always allocate additional funding for outliers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to the new funding, APX also today announced that it is doing away with its 100-day accelerator program and instead opting for a long-term commitment to its companies, including participation in future rounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will try and invest into 50 or more companies this year &#8212; and we were at 35 last year. So this is quite some growth,&#8221; APX founding managing director (and <a href="https://medium.com/@likeaCEO_/pitch-perfect-with-henric-hungerhoff-409b7a049275">folk music aficionado</a>) Henric Hungerhoff told me. &#8220;We think that our deal flow systems and our entire operations are settled in well enough that we can have quality founders in our portfolio. That&#8217;s our goal &#8212; and that might even increase to 70 the year after. [&#8230;] We see really nice synergies or network effects within our portfolio, with founders helping other founders and learning from each other.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2098674" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APX_MDs.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2098674" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2098674" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APX_MDs.png" alt="" width="390" height="279" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APX_MDs.png 575w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APX_MDs.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APX_MDs.png?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APX_MDs.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2098674" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> APX</p></div></p>
<p>Hungerhoff tells me that the team is quite confident in its ability now to identify quality deal flows. The team is using a data-driven approach. And while it leverages its own network and that of its founders, it has also set up a scout program at leading European universities to identify potential founders, for example.</p>
<p>As APX founding managing director, and the former CEO of Axel Springer&#8217;s Plug and Play accelerator, Jörg Rheinboldt noted, APX never asks its founders to pitch. Instead, the team has multiple conversations with them about the product they want to build, how they came up with the idea &#8212; and how it changed over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then, we do multiple things simultaneously,&#8221; Rheinboldt said. &#8220;One is, we look at team dynamics. How do the founders interact? We also stress them a little bit &#8212; in a friendly way &#8212; where someone asks very fast questions, or we focus a little bit on one person and see how the others rescue them. We want to know about the team dynamics and then we want to understand the strategy, how we can help them best?&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea here is to be able to invest quickly. In addition, though, with the new funding, the team isn&#8217;t just able to invest into more companies but also invest more into the individual companies.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2098673" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APX_2021_4.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2098673" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2098673" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APX_2021_4.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APX_2021_4.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APX_2021_4.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APX_2021_4.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APX_2021_4.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APX_2021_4.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APX_2021_4.jpg?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APX_2021_4.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2098673" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> APX</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We want to invest deeper per startup at a very early stage,&#8221; Hungerhoff said. &#8220;So far, [&#8230;] our typical approach was a non-dilution, pro-rata follow-on strategy with most of our portfolio companies. And this is something we want to pledge in the future. Looking at the past, 100% of the times in equity rounds, we do the pro-rata follow-on or more, but now, we have developed a strategy that we will, for the fastest-moving of fastest-growing companies, we want to deploy significantly more cash in a very early phase, which means an amount of up to €500,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>What the team saw was that the companies in its portfolio would raise a small pre-seed round from APX and other investors, with APX typically taking a 5% stake in the startup. Most founders would then go on and raise extended pre-seed or seed rounds soon thereafter.</p>
<p>&#8220;We more felt like we missed out when we saw these companies raising really nice financing rounds and we did our investment,&#8221; Rheinbolt said. &#8220;We felt very good that we can do a pro-rata investment. but we looked at each other and said: we knew this, we knew that they would do this 12 weeks ago. We could have given them a check and maybe the round would have been done in eight weeks and maybe [our stake] wouldn&#8217;t be 5% but 7%.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given this new focus on supporting startups throughout their lifecycle, it&#8217;s no surprise that APX did away with the 100-day program as well. But the team still expects to be quite hands-on. With a growing network, though, the partners also expect that founders will be able to learn from each other, too. &#8220;We now see the value that is coming from this,&#8221; Hungerhoff said. For example, a team that we&#8217;ve invested in two months ago, they&#8217;re now thinking about the angel round. They can actually get the best advice on this &#8212; or just experienced sharing &#8212; from another team, rather than talking to Jörg who did this maybe 30 years ago &#8212; no offense.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team also spends a lot of time thinking about its community, which now includes founders from 20 countries. The COVID pandemic has obviously moved most of the interactions online. Before COVID, APX often hosted events in its offices, which helped create the kind of serendipity that often leads to new ideas and connections. Looking ahead, the team still believes that there is a lot of value in having face-to-face meetings, but at the same time, maybe not every company needs to move to Berlin and instead visit for a few days every now and then.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">No-code &#8212; software that lets you accomplish tasks that previously required coding skills &#8212; is an increasingly hot space, even if the basic premise has been promised and not fully realised for many years. Related to this are companies like Airtable, which attempt to make building relational databases and interrogating them as easy as creating a spreadsheet. Now <a href="https://www.softr.io/">Softr</a>, a startup out of Berlin, wants to push the no-code concept further by making it easy to build websites on top of Airtable without the need to write code.</p>
<p>Recently soft launched on Product Hunt, today the young company is disclosing $2.2 million in seed funding, having previously been bootstrapped by its two Armenian founders, CEO Mariam Hakobyan and CTO Artur Mkrtchyan. Leading the round is Atlantic Labs, along with Philipp Moehring (Tiny.VC) and founders from GitHub, SumUp, Zeitgold, EyeEm and Rows.</p>
<p>Started in 2019, Softr has built a no-code platform to enable anybody to build websites and web apps based on data housed in Airtable. The idea is to let Airtable do the database grunt work, combined with Softr&#8217;s relatively flexible but template-driven approach to website and web app creation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Softr&#8217;s Hakobyan explains that out of the box the startup offers templates for anything from a simple marketing website to web apps for an e-commerce store, job board, marketplace and more. Those applications can include functionality like user authentication, gated content, payments, upvoting, and commenting etc.</p>
<p>&#8220;Softr has zero learning curve and can literally be used by anyone without a tech background, as it abstracts away all the technical aspects and focuses the user on product building and content, rather than technology,&#8221; she explains. &#8220;Softr uses Airtable as the database, as it makes it easy creating and sharing relational databases, without having to learn SQL or scripting. Airtable has gotten pretty popular in the last few years and is used not only by individuals but also Fortune 500 companies&#8221;.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2098453" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2098453" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="407" class="size-large wp-image-2098453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-2.png 3810w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-2.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-2.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-2.png?resize=768,460 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-2.png?resize=680,407 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-2.png?resize=1536,919 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-2.png?resize=2048,1226 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-2.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2098453" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Softr</p></div></p>
<p>To that end, Hakobyan says Softr’s magic is that it uses the concept of “pre-built building blocks” (listings, user accounts, payments etc) and business logic to handle most of the heavy lifting on behalf of the website creator. &#8220;When using blocks and templates.. ., 70% of the work is already done for the user,&#8221; she explains.</p>
<p>In addition, Softr connects to popular services like Stripe, Paypal, Mailchimp, Zapier, Integromat, Hotjar, Google Analytics, Hubspot, Drift and others.</p>
<p>Softr is currently used by “several thousands of makers and startups”. Examples of applications that customers have built on Softr include a language learning school with membership, a baby-sitters booking marketplace, and a community with gated content and online courses.</p>
<p>Armed with capital, Softr plans to expand its customer base to non-tech functions of SMBs to help them build internal tooling, such as employee directories, product inventories, real estate listings etc., and to automate manual processes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world of European VC can post another win for diversity this week as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucilecornet/?locale=en_US">Lucile Cornet</a> is appointed Partner with <a href="https://eightroads.com/en/">Eight Roads Ventures Europe</a>, a firm focusing on startups in Europe and Israel. Cornet is its first female Partner. Eight Roads is backed by Fidelity and has over $6 billion assets under management globally.</p>
<p>Cornet will be focusing on the software and fintech sectors and previously led a number of investments for the firm, having risen from Associate to Partner within five years. It&#8217;s an out of the ordinary career trajectory when VC is notorious for having a &#8216;no succession&#8217; culture, unless partners effectively buy into funds.</p>
<p>Cornet commented: “I am hugely optimistic about what is to come for European technology entrepreneurs. We are seeing more and more amazing founders and innovative businesses across the whole European region with ambitions and abilities to become global champions, and I look forward to helping them scale up.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking with TechCrunch, Cornet added: “I feel so, so fortunate because I think we&#8217;ve been living during a once in a lifetime transformation in general in tech and also in Europe. To build some of those companies, and just be part of the ecosystem has been fantastic. I know how much more exciting things are going to be in the next couple of years.”</p>
<p>Cornet previously led investments into Spendesk, the Paris-based spend management platform; Thinksurance, the Frankfurt-based B2B insurtech; and Compte-Nickel, one of the first European neobanks which was successfully acquired by BNP Paribas in 2017. She also sits on the boards of VIU Eyewear, OTA Insight and Fuse Universal.</p>
<p>France-born Cornet’s previous career includes investment banking, Summit Partners, and she joined Eight Roads Ventures in 2015.  She was a ‘rising star’ at the GP Bullhound Investor of the Year Awards 2020.</p>
<p>Commenting, Davor Hebel, managing partner at Eight Roads Ventures Europe, said: “We are delighted with Lucile’s success so far at Eight Roads. She has made a huge impact in Europe and globally since joining the firm. She has a tremendous work ethic and drive&#8230; identifying the best European companies and helping them scale into global winners. Her promotion also speaks to our desire to continue to develop our best investment talent and promote from within.”</p>
<p>Speaking to me in an interview Hebel added: “We always believed in a slightly different approach and we say when we hire people, even from the start, we want them to have judgment, and we want them to have that presence when they meet entrepreneurs. So it was always part of the model for us to say, we might not hire many people, but we really want them to have the potential to grow and stay with us and have the path and the potential to do so.”</p>
<p>In 2020, Eight Roads Ventures Europe invested in Cazoo, Otrium, Spendesk, Odaseva and most recently Tibber, completed eight follow-on investments and exited Rimilia. The firm also saw its portfolio company AppsFlyer reach a $2 billion valuation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With every year, AI is beginning to bring more standardized levels of diagnostic accuracy in medicine. This is true of <a href="https://www.dermatologytimes.com/view/ai-has-potential-to-improve-melanoma-detection">skin cancer detection</a>, for example, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/health/cancer-artificial-intelligence-ct-scans.html">lung cancers</a>.</p>
<p>Now, a startup in Israel called <a href="https://www.embryonics.me/">Embryonics</a> says its AI can improve the odds of successfully implanting a healthy embryo during in vitro fertilization. What the company has been developing, in essence, is an algorithm to predict embryo implantation probability, one they have trained through IVF time-lapsed imaging of developing embryos.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just getting started, to be clear. So far, in a pilot involving 11 women ranging in age from 20 to 40, six of those individuals are enjoying successful pregnancies, and the other five are awaiting results, says Embryonics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Still, Embryonics is interesting for its potential to shake up a big market that&#8217;s been stuck for decades and continues to grow only because of external trends, like millennial women who are putting off having children <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleystahl/2020/05/01/new-study-millennial-women-are-delaying-having-children-due-to-their-careers/?sh=4ee92e54276a">owing to economic concerns</a>.</p>
<p>Consider that the global in-vitro fertilization market is expected to grow from roughly $18.3 billion in 2019 to nearly double that number in the next five years by <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-ivf-market">some estimates</a>. Yet the <a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/fertility-blog/2018/march/ivf-by-the-numbers">tens of thousands</a> of women who undergo IVF each year have long faced costs of anywhere from <a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/fertility-blog/2018/march/ivf-by-the-numbers">$10,000 to $15,000</a> per cycle (at least in the U.S.), along with <a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/fertility-blog/2018/march/ivf-by-the-numbers">long-shot odds</a> that grow worse with age.</p>
<p>Indeed, it&#8217;s the prospect of reducing the number of IVF rounds and their attendant expenses that drives <a href="https://www.embryonics.me/">Embryonics</a>, which was founded three years ago by CEO Yael Gold-Zamir, an M.D. who studied general surgery at Hebrew University, then became a researcher in an IVF laboratory owing to an abiding interest in the science behind fertility.</p>
<p>As it happens, she would be introduced to two individuals with complementary interests and expertise. One of them was David Silver, who had studied bioinformatics at the prestigious Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and who, before joining Embryonics last year, spent three years as a machine learning engineer at Apple and three years before that as an algorithm engineer at Intel.</p>
<p>The second individual to whom Gold-Zamir was introduced was Alex Bronstein, a serial founder who spent years as a principal engineer with Intel and who is today the head of the Center for Intelligent Systems at Technion, as well as involved with several efforts involving deep learning AI, including at Embryonics and at <a href="https://www.sibylla.io/">Sibylla AI</a>, a nascent outfit focused on algorithmic trading in capital markets.</p>
<p>Embryonics currently remains a small outfit, but the three, along with 13 more full-time employees who&#8217;ve joined them, appear to be making progress.</p>
<p>Fueled in part by $4 million in seed funding led by the Shuctermann Family Investment Office (led by the former president of Soros Capital, Sender Cohen) and the Israeli Innovation Authority, Embryonics says it&#8217;s about to receive <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/product-requirements/labels-markings/ce-marking/index_en.htm">regulatory approval</a> in Europe that will enable it to sell its software &#8212; which the team says can recognize patterns and interpret image in small cell clusters with greater accuracy than a human &#8212;  to fertility clinics across the continent.</p>
<p>Using a database with millions of (anonymized) patient records from different centers around the world that representing all races and geographies and ages, says Gold-Zamir, the company is already eyeing next steps, too.</p>
<p>Most notably, beyond moving into the U.S. with its embryo analysis software, Embryonics wants to work with fertility clinics on improving what&#8217;s called hormonal stimulation, so that their patients produce as many mature eggs as possible.</p>
<p>As Bronstein observes, every woman who goes through IVF or fertility preservation goes through an hormonal stimulation process &#8212; which involves getting injected with hormones from 8 to 14 days &#8212; to induce their ovaries to produce numerous eggs. But right now, there are just three general protocols and  a &#8220;lot of trial and error in trying to establish the right one,&#8221; he says. Through deep learning, Embryonics thinks it can begin to understand not just which hormones each individual should be taking but the different times they should be taken.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s more in the works if all goes as planned. &#8220;Embryonics&#8217;s goal is to provide a holistic solution, covering all aspects of the process,&#8221; says Gold-Zamir, who is raising four children of her own, along with running the company.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s too soon to say whether the nascent outfit will succeed. But it certainly seems to be at the forefront of a technology that is fast changing after more than 40 years wherein many IVF clinics worldwide have simply assessed embryo health by looking at days-old embryos on a petri dish under a microscope to assess their cell multiplication and shape.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2019, for instance, investigators from Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City <a href="https://news.weill.cornell.edu/news/2019/04/artificial-intelligence-approach-optimizes-embryo-selection-for-ivf">published own their conclusion</a>  that AI can evaluate embryo morphology more accurately than the human eye after using 12,000 photos of human embryos taken precisely 110 hours after fertilization to train an algorithm to discriminate between poor and good embryo quality.</p>
<p>The investigators said that each embryo was first assigned a grade by embryologists that considered various aspects of the embryo’s appearance. The investigators then performed a statistical analysis to correlate the embryo grade with the probability of a successful pregnancy outcome. Embryos were considered good quality if the chances were greater than 58 percent and poor quality if the chances were below 35%.</p>
<p>After training and validation, the algorithm was able to classify the quality of a new set of images with <a href="https://news.weill.cornell.edu/news/2019/04/artificial-intelligence-approach-optimizes-embryo-selection-for-ivf">97% accuracy</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup Georges — or <a href="https://www.georges.tech">Georges.tech</a> — is raising a new round of funding of $42.4 million (€35 million). The company is also getting a new name and will be called Indy going forward. The startup has been building an accounting automation application for freelancers and small companies.</p>
<p>Singular is leading today’s funding round. You might not be familiar with Singular, but it makes a ton of sense to see the VC firm on the cap table. Former Alven partners <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremyuzan/">Jeremy Uzan</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raffikamber/">Raffi Kamber</a> left the Paris-based VC firm to raise their own fund. Uzan previously invested in Indy when he was at Alven and he’s following up with Singular.</p>
<p>Existing investors Alven and Kerala are also investing once again. Overall, Indy has managed to attract 40,000 clients who pay a monthly subscription fee to access the service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indy first started with a product specifically designed for freelancers, self-employed people, doctors, architects, lawyers, etc. It can help you replace your accountant altogether. You first connect the service to your bank account. Indy then imports all your transactions and tries to tag and categorize as many transactions as possible.</p>
<p>You can go back and add missing data. You can also add receipts or invoices right next to your transactions. Once this is done, you know how much VAT you’re supposed to get back at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Indy then automatically fills out administrative forms based on your data. You can then download your tax documents or send them directly from Indy.</p>
<p>You can also use the platform to get an overview of your business. You can see your corporate revenue, track your expenses, and see how much you earn per year based on personal expenses and your own pay.</p>
<p>Over time, Indy has expanded its service so that it supports more types of companies. In addition to freelancers, Indy supports EURL, SARL, SAS and SASU. In 2020, the startup has tripled its revenue.</p>
<p>And the company plans to improve its product to support even more self-employed people, including people selling stuff under the BIC status in France. Indy plans to hire 100 people in 2021 in Lyon.</p>
<p>Indy has even bigger plans as it has been evaluating the U.S. as a potential market. There are a ton of self-employed people in the U.S. and that’s why it represents an interesting opportunity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When the two year-old Indian company <a href="https://www.jetsonsrobotics.com/">Jetsons Robotics</a> began searching for a partner to help design charging stations for their autonomous rooftop solar installation cleaning robots, the Israeli company <a href="https://powermat.com/">Powermat</a> was an obvious choice.</p>
<p>While the company had made its name as the designer for wireless charging technologies for consumer electronics, over the past two years the company was shifting its focus to more industrial applications. So it made sense to work with the Indian company on new form factors and applications for its charging technologies.</p>
<p>Indeed, the consumer market that Powermat had hoped to capture had been, by that point, broadly commoditized, so the tech developer needed a new direction.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cleaning rooftop solar installations can be a costly endeavor, running companies anywhere from $100,000 to $500,000 per year, according to Jetsons Robotics chief executive, Jatin Sharma. The use of robots to replace human labor can save money, but the autonomous solution that the company wanted to build necessitated some kind of wireless charging dock, he said.</p>
<p>Contact-based charging meant too many variables in the outdoor environment, but an inductive charger would be too costly. Until the company worked with Powermat on a solution, Sharma said.</p>
<p>Backed by 100x.vc, Sharma&#8217;s robots are already cleaning roughly 1.7 megawatts of solar installations on a daily basis.</p>
<p>For Powermat, the solar cleaning robots are a good test of the company&#8217;s new industrial focus, according to chief technology officer Itay Sherman.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You can look at it like maturation of the market,&#8221; Sherman said. &#8220;Powermat had been a pioneer in driving wireless technology. This market is maturing and we are moving on to markets where the technology and innovation is important. We have decided to shift our efforts to these emerging markets. Robotics is one, medical devices, IOT, and the automotive market are others.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://istox.com/">iSTOX</a>, a digital securities platform that wants to make private equity investment more accessible, has added new investors from Japan to its Series A round, bringing its total to $50 million. Two of its new backers are the government-owned Development Bank of Japan and JIC Venture Growth Investments, the venture capital arm of Japan Investment Corporation, a state-backed investment fund.</p>
<p>Other participants included Juroku Bank and Mobile Internet Capital, along with returning investors Singapore Exchange, Tokai Tokyo Financial Holdings and Hanwha Asset Management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2017 and owned by blockchain infrastructure firm ICHX, iSTOX’s goal is to open private capital opportunities, including startups, hedge funds and private debt, that are usually limited to a small group of high-net-worth individuals to more institutional and accredited investors. (It also serves accredited investors outside of Singapore, as long as they meet the country’s standards by <a href="https://support.istox.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045217294-Do-I-qualify-as-an-iSTOX-investor-">holding the equivalent amount in assets and income</a>.) iSTOX&#8217;s allows users to make investments as small as SGD $100 (about USD $75.50) and says it is able to keep fees low by using blockchain technology for smart contracts and to hold digital securities, which makes the issuance process more effective and less costly.</p>
<p>iSTOX’s Series A round was <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-ready-capital-markets-platform-istox-secures-series-a-funding-through-leading-thai-investment-bank-kiatnakin-phatra-financial-group-300924689.html">first announced in September 2019</a>, when the company said it had raised an undisclosed amount from Thai investment bank Kiatnakin Phatra Financial Group while participating in the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) FinTech Regulatory Sandbox. The Singaporean government has been especially supportive of blockchain technology, launching initiatives to commercialize its use in fintech, data security, logistics and other sectors.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Singapore’s government launches blockchain innovation program with $8.9 million in funding&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/06/singapores-government-launches-blockchain-innovation-program-with-8-9-million-in-funding/embed/#?secret=90IPGAMH9v" data-secret="90IPGAMH9v" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>iSTOX completed the sandbox program in February 2020, and was approved by the MAS for the issuance, custody and trading of digitized securities. The new funding will be used for geographical expansion, including in China, where it already has an agreement in the city of Chongqing, and Europe and and Australia, where it is currently working on issuance deals. iSTOX also plans to add new investment products, including private issuances that investors can subscribe to in &#8220;bite-size portions.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a press statement, iSTOX chief commercial officer Oi Yee Choo said, &#8220;Capital markets are transforming rapidly because of advancements in technology. The regulator MAS and our institutional investors have been far-sighted and progressive, and they support the change wholeheartedly.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is among several Asia-based fintech platforms that want to democratize the process of investing. For retail investors, there are apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/indonesian-robo-advisor-app-bibit-raises-30-million-led-by-sequoia-capital-india/">Bibit</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/singapore-based-syfe-a-robo-advisor-with-a-human-touch-raises-18-6-million-led-by-valar-ventures/">Syfe</a>, Stashaway, Kristal.ai and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/grab-launches-new-consumer-financial-services-including-micro-investments-and-loans/">Grab Financial’s investment products</a>.</p>
<p>Since iSTOX works with accredited and institutional investors, however, its most direct competitors include the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/dbs-exchange-digital/singapore-bank-dbs-to-launch-digital-exchange-as-demand-for-virtual-currencies-soar-idINKBN28K151">recently-launched DBS Digital Exchange</a>, which is also based in Singapore. iSTOX’s advantage is that it offers more kinds of assets. Right now, it facilitates the issuance of funds and bonds, but this year, it will start issuing private equity and structured products as well. The company’s securities are also fully digitized, which means they are created on the blockchain, instead of being recorded on the blockchain after they are issued, which means iSTOX is able to offer faster settlement times.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian stock exchanges approved the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/29/indias-reliance-retail-to-acquire-future-groups-retail-wholesale-and-logistics-businesses-for-3-4-billion/">$3.4 billion deal between retail giants Reliance Retail and Future Group</a> on late Wednesday in yet another setback for Amazon, which has invested <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">over $6.5 billion in the world’s second largest internet market</a> and sought to block the aforementioned deal.</p>
<p>The Bombay Stock Exchange said in a notification that it had spoken with India’s markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), and had no objection or adverse observation on the deal.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s notification is the latest setback for Amazon, which had written to SEBI and Indian antitrust watchdog to block the multi-billion deal between Future Group and Reliance Retail, the two largest retail chains in India. Last year, India’s antitrust group <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/india-approves-reliances-3-4-billion-deal-with-future-group-brings-a-new-headache-to-amazon/">gave a go ahead to the deal</a> to the Indian firms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We hereby advise that we have no adverse observations with limited reference to those matters having a bearing on listing/de-listing/continuous listing requirements within the provisions of Listing Agreement, so as to enable the company to file the scheme with Hon’ble NCLT [National Company Law Tribunal],&#8221; the notification read. SEBI has advised Future to share various aspects of its ongoing litigation with Amazon to NCLT, whose approval for the deal is pending.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/amazon-future-coupons/">bought 49% stake in one of Future’s unlisted firms in 2019</a> in a deal that was valued at over $100 million. As part of the deal, Future could not have sold assets to rivals, Amazon has said in court filings.</p>
<p>Things changed last year after the coronavirus pandemic starved the Indian firm of cash, Future Group chief executive and founder Kishore Biyani said at a recent virtual conference. In August, Future Group said that it had reached an agreement with Ambani’s Reliance Industries, which runs India’s largest retail chain, to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing businesses for $3.4 billion.</p>
<p>Amazon later protested the deal by reaching an arbitrator in Singapore and asked the court to block the deal between the Indian retail giants. Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/25/reliance-says-its-3-4-billion-deal-with-future-group-fully-enforceable-under-indian-law-despite-amazon-winning-an-arbitration-order/">secured emergency relief from the arbitration court</a> in Singapore in late October that temporarily halted Future Group from going ahead with the sale.</p>
<p>The two estranged partners also fought at the Delhi High Court last year, which in a rare glimmer of hope for the American giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/20/indian-court-rejects-retail-giant-future-groups-plea-against-amazon/">rejected Future’s plea for an ad-interim injunction</a> to restrain Amazon from writing to regulators and other authorities to raise concerns over — and halt — the deal between the two Indian giants.</p>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson told TechCrunch that the firm will continue to pursue legal remedies. &#8220;The letters issued by BSE &amp; NSE clearly state that the comments of SEBI on the &#8216;draft scheme of arrangement&#8217; (proposed transaction) are subject to the outcome of the ongoing Arbitration and any other legal proceedings. We will continue to pursue our legal remedies to enforce our rights,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>At stake is India’s retail market that is estimated to balloon to $1.3 trillion by 2025, up from $700 billion in 2019, according to consultancy firm BCG and local trade group Retailers’ Association India. Online shopping accounts for about 3% of all retail in India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://genflow.com/">Genflow</a>, a London and LA-based brand-building agency that offers an e-commerce and mobile tech platform to let influencers start companies, has raised $11 million in funding.</p>
<p>Leading the round is U.K. investor BGF. The injection of capital will be used by Genflow to further scale its offering and for international expansion.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016 by entrepreneur Shan Hanif to help social media influencers develop their brands and extract revenue from their audiences, Genflow combines aspects of a traditional branding agency &#8212; such as strategy, design and planning &#8212; and a tech company with its own software stack.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This sees Genflow position itself as a brand-as-a-service (BaaS) platform, which helps influencers develop their own digital and physical products instead of promoting other brands, and enables them to launch their own membership club, gated community, mobile app or direct to consumer brand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Genflow offers the complete infrastructure from design, development, manufacturing and logistics through to strategy, marketing and content creation to drive revenue and profit,&#8221; explains the company.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="U9HTPWXYUP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/18/out-of-the-box-influencer-strategies-to-accelerate-awareness-for-your-startup/">Out of the box influencer strategies to accelerate awareness for your startup</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Out of the box influencer strategies to accelerate awareness for your startup&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/18/out-of-the-box-influencer-strategies-to-accelerate-awareness-for-your-startup/embed/#?secret=U9HTPWXYUP" data-secret="U9HTPWXYUP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Genflow says its client base are established influencers who typically have large followings on Instagram and YouTube.</p>
<p>“Genflow allows an influencer to start their own business instead of the traditional brand deals so if someone with an audience wants truly their own audience and business Genflow does that for them,” says Hanif. “We provide them the complete infrastructure to launch a business: design, manufacturing, development, content, strategy and marketing all in one place. This gives us the unique ability to execute to a very high level that drives revenue”.</p>
<p>Hanif says influencers typically approach Genflow either with an idea or when they need help figuring out what brand they can launch. “We use ‘Genlytics,’ our in-house built software, to see what the best brand they can release by checking their analytics, breakdown of their followers, what brands they have worked with in the past and to see how much they can potentially sell,” he explains.</p>
<p>Next, Genflow onboards the client and begins the brand building process, offering broadly two options: Gated content, membership clubs, community and mobile apps, or developing direct to consumer brand with physical products.</p>
<p>The first is akin to having your own OnlyFans, Patreon or social media platform. The second is a classic D2C e-commerce play and includes designing the products, and working with factories to create samples, manufacture the products and then handle all logistics etc.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kuZSviZnLZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/10/in-the-future-everyone-will-be-famous-for-15-followers/">In the future, everyone will be famous for 15 followers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;In the future, everyone will be famous for 15 followers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/10/in-the-future-everyone-will-be-famous-for-15-followers/embed/#?secret=kuZSviZnLZ" data-secret="kuZSviZnLZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“In both cases then we plan the launch of the brand, the marketing strategy and then work with the influencer to launch the brand itself,” adds Hanif.</p>
<p>“What’s interesting is that traditionally in startups you find a problem, get a team, some funding then try to find customers. What we have invented is the ‘audience first approach’ where we already have the audience and now just need the right products and it&#8217;s instantly a success. The metrics that I see for our brands are not normal: conversion rates that are 5-30%, 20% repeat purchase buys and around 6:1 return on Facebook ads.</p>
<p>“We are proud that every brand we have launched to date is profitable and growing year on year so we know our approach works.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.curtsyapp.com/">Curtsy</a>, a clothing resale app and competitor to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/14/poshmark-ipo-posh-starts-trading-on-nasdaq.html">recently IPO&#8217;d</a> Poshmark, announced today it has raised $11 million in Series A funding for its startup focused on the Gen Z market. The app, which evolved out of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/16/peer-to-peer-dress-rental-startup-curtsy-lets-you-rent-the-wardrobes-of-fashionistas-near-you/">an earlier effort for renting dresses</a>, now allows women to list their clothes, shoes and accessories for resale, while also reducing many of the frictions involved with the typical resale process.</p>
<p>The new round was led by Index Ventures, and included participation from Y Combinator, prior investors FJ Labs and 1984 Ventures, and angel investor Josh Breinlinger (who left Jackson Square Ventures to start his own fund).</p>
<p>To date, Curtsy has raised $14.5 million, including over two prior rounds, which also included investors CRV, SV Angel, Kevin Durant, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/priscillascala/">Priscilla Scala</a> and other angels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Like other online clothing resale businesses, Curtsy aims to address the needs of a younger generation of consumers who are looking for a more sustainable alternative when shopping for clothing. Instead of constantly buying new, many Gen Z consumers will rotate their wardrobes over time, often by leveraging resale apps.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2098693" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2098693" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2098693" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screens-2-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="554" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screens-2-1.png 2727w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screens-2-1.png?resize=150,122 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screens-2-1.png?resize=300,245 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screens-2-1.png?resize=768,626 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screens-2-1.png?resize=680,554 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screens-2-1.png?resize=1536,1252 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screens-2-1.png?resize=2048,1669 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screens-2-1.png?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2098693" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Curtsy</p></div></p>
<p>However, the current process for listing your own clothes on resale apps can be time-consuming. A <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/get-rich-selling-used-fashion-online-or-cry-trying/">recent report by Wired</a>, for example, detailed how many women were spinning their wheels engaging with Poshmark in the hopes of making money from their closets, to little avail. The Poshmark sellers complained they had to do more than just list, sell, package and ship their items &#8212; they also had to participate in the community in order to have their items discovered.</p>
<p>Curtsy has an entirely different take. It wants to make it easier and faster for casual sellers to list items by reducing the amount of work involved to sell. It also doesn&#8217;t matter how many followers a seller has, which makes its marketplace more welcoming to first-time sellers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The big gap in the market is really for casual sellers &#8212; people who are not interested in selling professionally,&#8221; explains Curtsy CEO David Oates. &#8220;In pretty much every other app that you&#8217;ve heard about, pro sellers really crowd out everyday women. Part of that is the friction of the whole process,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Peer-to-peer dress rental startup Curtsy lets you rent out your wardrobe&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/16/peer-to-peer-dress-rental-startup-curtsy-lets-you-rent-the-wardrobes-of-fashionistas-near-you/embed/#?secret=heLAAhWCKV" data-secret="heLAAhWCKV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>On Curtsy, the listing process is far more streamlined.</p>
<p>The app uses a combination of machine learning and human review to help the sellers merchandise their items, which increase their chances of selling. When sellers first list their item in the app, Curtsy will recommend a price, then fill in details like the brand, category, subcategory, shipping weight and the suggested selling price, using machine learning systems training on the previous items sold on its marketplace. Human review fixes any errors in that process.</p>
<p>Also before items are posted, Curtsy improves and crops the images, as well as fixes any other issues with the listing, and moderates listings for spam. This process helps to standardize the listings on the app across all sellers, giving everyone a fair shot at having their items discovered and purchased.</p>
<p>Another unique feature is how Curtsy caters to the Gen Z to young Millennial user base (ages 15-30), who are often without shipping supplies or even a printer for producing a shipping label.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2098694" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2098694" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2098694 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screen-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="602" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screen-1.png 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screen-1.png?resize=150,133 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screen-1.png?resize=300,266 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screen-1.png?resize=768,680 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screen-1.png?resize=680,602 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screen-1.png?resize=1536,1361 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screen-1.png?resize=2048,1814 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curtsy-screen-1.png?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2098694" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: Curtsy / Photo credit: Brooke Ray</p></div></p>
<p>First-time sellers receive <a href="https://curtsyapp.com/item/imB1yQBUSE">a free starter kit</a> with Curtsy-branded supplies for packaging their items at home, like poly mailers in multiple sizes. As they need more supplies, the cost of those is built into the selling flow, so you don&#8217;t have to explicitly pay for it &#8212; it&#8217;s just deducted from your earnings. Curtsy also helps sellers to schedule a free USPS pickup to save a trip to the post office, and it will even send sellers a shipping label, if need be.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things we realized quickly is Gen Z does not really have printers. So we actually have a label service and we&#8217;ll send you the label in the mail for free from centers across the country,&#8221; says Oates.</p>
<p>Later, when a buyer of an item purchased from Curtsy is ready to resell it, they can do so with one tap &#8212; they don&#8217;t have to photograph it and describe it again. This also speeds up the selling process.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KTacIdGaWn"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/poshmark-is-pushing-into-the-public-market-at-a-high-end-valuation-as-the-resale-market-sizzles/">Poshmark is pushing into the public market at a high-end valuation as the resale market sizzles</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Poshmark is pushing into the public market at a high-end valuation as the resale market sizzles&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/poshmark-is-pushing-into-the-public-market-at-a-high-end-valuation-as-the-resale-market-sizzles/embed/#?secret=KTacIdGaWn" data-secret="KTacIdGaWn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Overall, the use of technology, outsourced teams who improve listings and extra features like supplies and labels can be expensive. But Curtsy believes the end result is that they can bring more casual sellers to the resale market.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever costs we have, they should be in service of increased liquidity, so we can grow faster and add more people,&#8221; Oates says. &#8220;In case of the label service, those are people who otherwise wouldn&#8217;t be able to participate in selling online. There&#8217;s no other app that would allow them to sell without a printer.&#8221;</p>

<p>This system, so far, appears to be working. Curtsy now has several hundred thousand people who buy and sell on its iOS-only app, with an average transaction rates of three items bought or sold per month. When the new round closed late in 2020, the company was reporting a $25 million GMV revenue run rate, and average monthly growth of around 30%. Today, Curtsy generates revenue by taking a 20% <a href="https://curtsyapp.com/faq">commission</a> on sales (or $3 for items under $15).</p>
<p>The team, until recently, was only five people &#8212; including co-founders David Oates, William Ault, Clara Agnes Ault and Eli Allen, plus a contract workforce. With the Series A, Curtsy will be expanding, specifically by investing in new roles within product and marketing to help it scale. It will also be focused on developing an Android version of its app in the first quarter of 2021 and further building out its web presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never before have we seen such a strong overlap between buyers and sellers on a consumer-to-consumer marketplace,&#8221; said Damir Becirovic of Index Ventures, about the firm&#8217;s investment. &#8220;We believe the incredible love for Curtsy is indicative of a large marketplace in the making,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ulesson.com/">ULesson</a>, an edtech startup based in Nigeria that sells digital curriculum to students through SD cards, has raised $7.5 million in Series A funding. The round is led by Owl Ventures, which closed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/owl-ventures-new-pair-of-funds-gives-edtech-a-585-million-boost/">over half a billion in new fund money</a> just months ago. Other participants include LocalGlobe and existing investors, including TLcom Capital and Founder Collective.</p>
<p>The financing comes a little over a year since uLesson closed its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/26/sim-shagayas-ulesson-african-edtech-startup-raises-3-1m/">$3.1 million seed round</a> in November 2019. The startup’s biggest difference between now and then isn’t simply the millions it has in the bank, it’s the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on its entire value proposition.</p>
<p>ULesson launched into the market just weeks before the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic. The startup, which uses SD cards as a low-bandwidth way to deliver content, saw a wave of smart devices enter homes across Africa as students adapted to remote education.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The ground became wet in a way we didn’t see before,” founder and CEO Sim Shagaya said. “It opens up the world for us to do all kinds of really amazing things we&#8217;ve wanted to do in the world of edtech that you can&#8217;t do in a strictly offline sense,” the founder added.</p>
<p>Similar to many edtech startups, uLesson has benefited from the overnight adoption of remote education. Its positioning as a supplementary education tool helped it surface 70% month over month growth, said Shagaya. The founder says that the digital infrastructure gains will allow them to “go online entirely by Q2 this year.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5Ve0TW8R0P"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/26/sim-shagayas-ulesson-african-edtech-startup-raises-3-1m/">Sim Shagaya’s uLesson African edtech startup raises $3.1M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Sim Shagaya’s uLesson African edtech startup raises $3.1M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/26/sim-shagayas-ulesson-african-edtech-startup-raises-3-1m/embed/#?secret=5Ve0TW8R0P" data-secret="5Ve0TW8R0P" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It costs an annual fee of $50, and the app has been downloaded more than 1 million times.</p>
<p>With fresh demand, Shagaya sees uLesson evolving into a live, online platform instead of an offline, asynchronous content play. The startup is already experimenting with live tutoring: it tested a feature that allowed students to ask questions while going through pre-recorded material. The startup got more than 3,000 questions each day, with demand so high they had to pause the test feature.</p>
<p>“We want you to be able to push a button and get immediate support from a college student sitting somewhere in the continent who is basically a master in what you’re studying,” he said. The trend of content-focused startups adding on a live tutoring layer continues when you look at Chegg, Quizlet, Brainly and others.</p>
<h2>The broader landscape</h2>
<p>E-learning startups have been booming in the wake of the coronavirus. It’s led to an influx of tutoring marketplaces and content that promises to serve students. One of the most valuable startups in edtech is Byju’s, which offers online learning services and prepares students for tests.</p>
<p>But Shagaya doesn’t think any competitors, even Byju’s, have cracked the nut on how to do so in a digital way for African markets. There are placement agencies in South Africa and Kenya and offline tutoring marketplaces that send people to student homes, but no clear leader from a digital curriculum perspective.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Owl Ventures&#8217; new pair of funds gives edtech a $585 million boost&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/owl-ventures-new-pair-of-funds-gives-edtech-a-585-million-boost/embed/#?secret=hshpu4jqOd" data-secret="hshpu4jqOd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Everybody sees that Africa is a big opportunity,” Shagaya said. “But everybody also sees that you need a local team to execute on this.”</p>
<p>Shagaya thinks the opportunity in African edtech is huge because of two reasons: a young population, and a deep penetration of private school-going students. Combined, those facts could create troves of students who have the cash and are willing to pay for supplementary education.</p>
<p>The biggest hurdle ahead for uLesson, and any edtech startup that benefitted from pandemic gains, is distribution and outcomes. ULesson didn’t share any data on effectiveness and outcomes, but says it&#8217;s in the process of conducting a study with the University of Georgia to track mastery.</p>
<p>“Content efforts and products [will] live or die at the altar of distribution,” Shagaya said. The founder noted that in India, for example, pre-recorded videos do well due to social nuances and culture. ULesson is trying to find the perfect sauce for videos in markets around Africa and embed that into the product.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following Joseph Biden’s swearing in as the 46th president of the United States, Amazon is offering help in the administration’s stated goals for rolling out the COVID-19 vaccine. In a letter provided to TechCrunch, Worldwide Consumer CEO Dave Clark congratulates Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, while promising, “to assist you in reaching your goal of vaccinating 100 million Americans in the first 100 days of your administration.”</p>
<p>The note references a pledge set by Biden while introducing members of the pandemic team during a press conference in December of last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;My first 100 days won&#8217;t end the COVID-19 virus. I can&#8217;t promise that,&#8221; the then-president-elect said. &#8220;But we did not get in this mess quickly, we&#8217;re not going to get out of it quickly, it&#8217;s going to take some time. But I&#8217;m absolutely convinced that in 100 days we can change the course of the disease and change life in America for the better.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More recently, COVID-19 task force member epidemiologist Michael Osterholm called the goal “aspirational […] but doable,” adding that it would take time to ramp up.</p>
<p>In his letter, Clark details Amazon’s response to the virus, as many warehouse and other workers were employed throughout as essential workers. Included in the resources on offer are deals with healthcare providers who can administer vaccines on-site.</p>
<p>“We have an agreement in place with a licensed third-party occupational health care provider to administer vaccines on-site at our Amazon facilities,” Clark writes. “We are prepared to move quickly once vaccines are available. Additionally, we are prepared to leverage our operations, information technology, and communications capabilities and expertise to assist your administration&#8217;s vaccination efforts. Our scale allows us to make a meaningful impact immediately in the fight against COVID-19, and we stand ready to assist you in this effort.”</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>I work in HR for a tech firm. I understand that Biden is rolling out a new immigration plan today.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is your sense as to how the new administration will change business, corporate and startup founder immigration to the U.S.?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—Free in Fremont</strong></p>
<p>Dear Free:</p>
<p>Today is a historic day. The pace of change is accelerating now, especially in Washington. At the time of this writing, Biden is expected to imminently launch a new legislative proposal for comprehensive immigration reform. As the world sits back and watches, we are focusing great collective attention on upgrading our political, sociological and technological structures so that each human has the chance to succeed.</p>
<p>One of the things I adore about my practice of supporting international professionals with U.S. immigration is bearing witness to the process of individual transformation; it is an honor to support people in their personal journey from living in a world of effects to becoming the cause.</p>
<p>The immediate focus of the proposed legislation is centered around a solution for Dreamers (who are in the U.S. without documentation) as well as supporting the rights of refugees and asylum-seekers and children. For more of my recent thoughts on this topic, check out my recent <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/053-looking-ahead-to-the-biden-administration/">podcast</a> explaining many of the changes. The draft bill is expected to span hundreds of pages, so please follow this Dear Sophie column for more updates as I track and explore the details, especially related to tech immigration.</p>
<p>Innovation will be supported by many new immigration opportunities coming into greater focus. Biden’s campaign platform celebrated how “Immigrants are essential to the strength of our country and the U.S. economy.” The Biden team has prioritized immigration as a key focus within COVID, with an immediate goal of rewriting most Trump-era rules. For context, Trump issued more than 400 immigration-related executive orders and proclamations during his term.</p>
<p><strong>H-1Bs: </strong>Although H-1Bs have been in the news a lot regarding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/dear-sophie-whats-up-with-h-1b-pay-to-play/">new wage rules changing the order of the lottery</a> and litigation, the lottery is still happening this spring, and if you want to sponsor candidates, the time to act is now, regardless of what is happening in Washington. If your company is planning on sponsoring individuals for an H-1B visa — whether they’re already living in the U.S. or are living abroad — I suggest that you continue to prepare for the upcoming H-1B registration period.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is testing a new video Q&amp;A feature that allows creators to more directly respond to their audience&#8217;s questions with either text or video answers, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. The feature works across both video and livestreams (TikTok LIVE), but is currently only available to select creators who have opted into the test, we understand.</p>
<p>Q&amp;As have become a top way creators engage fans on social media, and have proven to be particularly popular in places like Instagram Stories and in other social apps<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/download-yolo-app/"> like Snapchat-integrated YOLO</a>, or even in smaller <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/f3-a-stories-style-qa-app-targeting-gen-z-teens-raises-3-9m/">startups</a>.</p>
<p>On TikTok, however, Q&amp;As are now a big part of the commenting experience, as many creators respond to individual comments by publishing a new video that explains their answer in more detail than a short, text comment could. Sometimes these answers are meant to clarify or add context, while other times creators will take on their bullies and trolls with their video responses. As a result, the TikTok comment section has grown to play a larger role in shaping TikTok trends and culture.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Q&amp;As are also a key means for creators to engage with fans when livestreaming. But it can be difficult for creators to keep up with a flood of questions and comments through the current live chat interface.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="71ZidAA5Pg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/f3-a-stories-style-qa-app-targeting-gen-z-teens-raises-3-9m/">F3, a Stories-style Q&#038;A app for Gen Z teens, raises $3.9M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;F3, a Stories-style Q&#038;A app for Gen Z teens, raises $3.9M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/f3-a-stories-style-qa-app-targeting-gen-z-teens-raises-3-9m/embed/#?secret=71ZidAA5Pg" data-secret="71ZidAA5Pg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Seeing how creators were already using Q&amp;As with their fans is how the idea for the new feature came about. Much like the existing &#8220;reply to comments with video&#8221; feature, the Q&amp;A option lets creators directly respond to their audience questions. Where available, users will be able to designate their comments as questions by tapping the Q&amp;A button in a video&#8217;s comment field, or they can submit questions directly through the Q&amp;A link on the creator&#8217;s profile page.</p>
<p>For creators, the feature simplifies the process of responding to questions, as it lets them view all their fans&#8217; questions in one place.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no limit to the number of questions that a creator can receive, though they don&#8217;t have to reply to each one.</p>
<p>The feature was first spotted by social media consultant <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/">Matt Navarra</a>, who posted screenshots of what the feature looks like in action, including how it appears on users&#8217; profiles.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>During the test, the new Q&amp;A feature is only being made available to creators with public Creator Accounts that have more than 10,000 followers and who have opted into the feature within their Settings, TikTok confirmed to TechCrunch. Participants in the test today include some safe-listed creators from TikTok&#8217;s Creative Learning Fund program, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tiktok-creator-fund-200-million-us/">announced last year</a>, among others.</p>
<p>TikTok says the Q&amp;A feature is currently in testing globally, and it aims to roll out it to more users with Creator Accounts in the weeks ahead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The massive shift to remote work due to COVID-19 has resulted in a huge reduction in emissions from vehicles and other sources, but it comes with costs of its own. A new study puts tentative carbon costs on the connectivity and data infrastructure that make working from home possible — and gives you an excuse to leave the camera off.</p>
<p>The researchers, from Perdue, Yale and MIT, attempted to analyze the carbon, land and water costs of internet infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to build a sustainable digital world, it is imperative to carefully assess the environmental footprints of the Internet and identify the individual and collective actions that most affect its growth,&#8221; they write in the paper&#8217;s introduction.</p>
<p>Using a single metric is too reductive, they argue: Carbon emissions are a useful metric, but it&#8217;s also important to track the sources of the power, the water cost (derived from what&#8217;s needed to cool and operate data centers) and the theoretical &#8220;land cost&#8221; needed to produce the product. If it sounds a little hand-wavy, that&#8217;s because any estimate along these lines is.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hDoTMvShcU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/work-from-home-is-dead-long-live-work-from-anywhere/">Work From Home is dead, long live Work From Anywhere</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Work From Home is dead, long live Work From Anywhere&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/work-from-home-is-dead-long-live-work-from-anywhere/embed/#?secret=hDoTMvShcU" data-secret="hDoTMvShcU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;In any calculation of this type at this global scale, you need to make a lot of assumptions and a lot of the data that you need are missing,&#8221; said lead study author, Yale&#8217;s Kaveh Madani, in an email to TechCrunch. &#8220;But it is a good start and best we could do using the available data.&#8221; (Madani noted that a lack of transparency in the industry, rather than a lack of statistical and scientific rigor, is the greater hindrance to the study&#8217;s accuracy.)</p>
<p>An example of their findings is that an hour of HD video streaming produces up to 440 grams of Carbon Dioxide emissions — up to 1,000g for YouTube or 160g for Zoom and video conferencing due to differing video quality. For comparison, the EPA says a modern car produces 8,887 grams per gallon of gas. If you&#8217;re taking an hour of video meetings a day instead of commuting 20 miles to work, you&#8217;re definitely in the green, as it were, by an order of magnitude or more.</p>

<p>But no one is arguing that the work from home shift or increase in digital consumption is a bad thing. &#8220;Of course, a virtual meeting is better for the environment than driving to a meeting location, but we can still do better,&#8221; said Madani.</p>
<p>The issue is more that we think of moving bits around as having marginal environmental cost — after all, it&#8217;s bits being flipped or sent along fiber, right? Yes, but it&#8217;s also powered by enormous data centers, transmission infrastructure and, of course, the wasteful eternal cycle of replacing our devices — though that last one doesn&#8217;t figure into the paper&#8217;s estimates.</p>
<p>If we don&#8217;t know the costs of our choices, we can&#8217;t make them in an informed way, the researchers warn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Banking systems tell you the positive environmental impact of going paperless, but no one tells you the benefit of turning off your camera or reducing your streaming quality. So without your consent, these platforms are increasing your environmental footprint,&#8221; Madani said <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2021/Q1/turn-off-that-camera-during-virtual-meetings,-environmental-study-says.html">in a Perdue news release</a>.</p>
<p>Leaving your camera off for a call you don&#8217;t need to be visible for makes for a small — but not trivial — savings in carbon emissions. Similarly, lowering the quality on your streaming show from HD to SD could save almost 90% of the energy used to transmit it (though of course your TV and speakers won&#8217;t draw any less power).</p>
<p>That doomscrolling habit, already a problem, seems even worse when you think that every flick of the thumb indirectly leads to a puff of hot, gross air out of a data center somewhere and a slight uptick in the air conditioning bill. Social media in general doesn&#8217;t use as much data as HD streaming, but the rise of video-focused networks like TikTok means they could soon catch up.</p>
<p>Madani explained that, puff pieces writing misleading summaries of their research aside, the study does not prescribe any simple remedies like turning off your camera. Sure, you can and should, he argues, but the change we should be looking for is systemic, not individual. What are the chances millions of people will independently and regularly decide to turn off their cameras or lower the streaming quality from 4K to 720p? Pretty low.</p>

<p>But on the other hand, if the costs of these services are made clear, as Madani and his team attempt to do in a preliminary way, perhaps pressure can be applied to the companies in question to make changes on the infrastructure side that save more energy in a day with an improved algorithm than 50 million people would with conscious decisions that they faintly resent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Consumers deserve to know more about what is happening. People currently don&#8217;t know what is going on when they press the Enter button on their computers. When they don&#8217;t know, we can&#8217;t expect them to change behavior,&#8221; Madani said. &#8220;[Policy makers] should step in, raise concerns about this sector, try to regulate it, force increased transparency, impose pollution taxes and develop incentive mechanisms if they do not want to see another unsustainable, uncontrollable sector in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>The change to digital has created some amazing efficiencies and reduced or eliminated many wasteful practices, but in the process it has introduced new ones. That&#8217;s just how progress works — you hope the new problems are better than the old ones.</p>
<p>The study was <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344920307072?dgcid=author">published in the journal Resources, Conservation and Recycling</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ironhack.com/en">Ironhack</a>, a company offering programming bootcamps across Europe and North and South America, has raised $20 million in its latest round of funding.</p>
<p>The Miami-based company (with locations in Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Lisbon, Madrid, Mexico City, Miami, Paris and São Paulo) said it will use the money to build out more virtual offerings to complement the company&#8217;s campuses.</p>
<p>Over the next five years, 13 million jobs will be added to the tech industry in the U.S., according to Ironhack co-founder Ariel Quiñones. That&#8217;s in addition to another 20 million jobs that Quiñones expects to come from the growth of the technology sector in the EU.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ironhack isn&#8217;t the only bootcamp to benefit from this growth. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/lambda-school-raises-74m-for-its-virtual-coding-school-where-you-pay-tuition-only-after-you-get-a-job/">Lambda School raised $74 million</a> for its coding education program.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lambda School raises $74M for its virtual coding school where you pay tuition only after you get a job&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/lambda-school-raises-74m-for-its-virtual-coding-school-where-you-pay-tuition-only-after-you-get-a-job/embed/#?secret=FIDVMd7V5C" data-secret="FIDVMd7V5C" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Ironhack raised its latest round from <a href="https://endeavor.org/">Endeavor Catalyst</a>, a fund that<a href="https://endeavorglobal.medium.com/announcing-the-closing-of-endeavor-catalyst-iii-dd17a0e1cd18"> invests in entrepreneurs from emerging and underserved markets</a>; Lumos Capital, which was formed by investors with a long history in education technology; Creas Capital, a Spanish impact investment firm; and Brighteye, a European edtech investor.</p>
<p>Prices for the company&#8217;s classes vary by country. In the U.S. an Ironhack bootcamp costs $12,000, while that figure is more like $3,000 for classes in Mexico City.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company offers classes in subjects ranging from web development to UX/UI design, and data analytics to cybersecurity, according to a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that practical skills training, a supportive global community and career development programs can give everyone, regardless of their education or employment history, the ability to write their stories through technology,” said Quiñones.</span></p>
<p>Since its launch in 2013, the company has graduated more than 8,000 students, with a job placement rate of 89%, according to data collected as of July 2020. Companies who have employed Ironhack graduates include Capgemini, Siemens and Santander, the company said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">First and foremost, thank you for subscribing to Extra Crunch.</p>
<p>I hope you feel like you’ve been getting value from the content our writers and guest contributors are creating, the events we’re producing and the podcasts we’re … podding. You truly are a member of our team.</p>
<h2>It’s time to kick it up a notch</h2>
<p>I began my career as an avid TechCrunch reader and remained one even when I joined as a writer, when I left to work on other things and now that I’ve returned to focus on better serving our community.</p>
<p>I know what it’s like to write, read and share the news of the day but my favorite part has always been spending time hanging out with some of you at events and gatherings. Unfortunately, the global predicament we’re in now with COVID-19 means we haven’t been able to connect in the ways that we’re used to.</p>
<h2>We’re adapting</h2>
<p>We’re going to be trying out some new things around here with the Extra Crunch staff front and center, as well as turning your feedback into action more than ever. We quite literally work for you, the subscriber, and want to make sure you’re getting your money’s worth, as it were.</p>
<p>I’ve been chatting with some of the folks in our community and <strong>I’d love to talk to you, too.</strong> Nothing fancy, <a href="https://elxde0ik7j1.typeform.com/to/Y1yIXgrH">just 5-10 minutes of your time</a> to hear more about what you want to see from us and get some feedback on what we’ve been doing so far.</p>
<p>These are just some of the things we’re discussing behind the scenes to bring all of you even more value:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discord server</li>
<li>Virtual meetups</li>
<li>Monthly workshops</li>
<li>Chats with writers</li>
<li>New perks</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would be so kind as to take a minute or two to <a href="https://elxde0ik7j1.typeform.com/to/Y1yIXgrH">fill out this form</a>, I’ll drop you a note and hopefully we can have a chat about the future of the Extra Crunch community before we formally roll out some of the ideas we’re cooking up.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your support. We’re looking forward to hanging out with you more, even if it’s just online for a little while longer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/">WhiteHouse.gov</a>, the official website for all presidential actions and efforts, is among the first things to be changed up under the freshly inaugurated President Biden. A fashionable dark mode appeared, as well as a large text toggle for straining eyes, and the webmaster has committed to making the whole site conform to the latest accessibility guidelines.</p>
<p>The look isn&#8217;t so very different from the previous administration&#8217;s site — they&#8217;re both fairly modern and minimal experiences, with big photos up front and tidy lists of priorities and announcements once you drill down into a category.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2098617" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/biden-darkmode-gif.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2098617" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2098617" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/biden-darkmode-gif.gif" alt="Animation showing dark and light modes on whitehouse.gov" width="400" height="567" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2098617" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> White House</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But one big design change implemented by the new administration that many will appreciate is the inclusion of a dark mode, or high contrast mode, and a large type toggle.</p>
<p>Dark modes have been around forever, but became <em>de rigeur</em> when Apple implemented its own system-wide versions <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/apples-ios-13-will-include-a-system-wide-dark-mode/">on iOS</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/02/macos-dark-mode/">and macOS</a> a while back. It&#8217;s just easier on the eyes in many ways, and at any rate it&#8217;s nice to give users options.</p>
<p>The WhiteHouse.gov dark mode changes the headline type from a patriotic blue to an eye-friendly off-white, with links a calming Dijon. Even the White House logo itself goes from a dark blue background to full black with a white border. It&#8217;s all very tasteful, and if anything seems like a <em>low-</em>contrast mode, not high.</p>
<p>The large type mode does what it says, making everything considerably bigger and easier to tap or click. The toggles, it must be said, are a bit over-prominent, but they&#8217;ll probably tweak that soon.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/es/">Spanish-language option</a>, no doubt welcome by the millions of Americans whose first language that is. This was not present on the previous White House/Casa Blanca page.</p>
<p>More forward-looking is the pledge in the accessibility section:</p>
<blockquote><p>This commitment to accessibility for all begins with this site and our efforts to ensure all functionality and all content is accessible to all Americans.</p>
<p>Our ongoing accessibility effort works towards conforming to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1, level AA criteria.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">The WCAG guidelines</a> are a set of best practices for designing a website so that its content can be easily accessed by people who use screen readers, need captions for audio or can&#8217;t use a mouse or touchscreen easily. The guidelines aren&#8217;t particularly hard to meet, but as many have pointed out, it&#8217;s harder to retrofit a website to be accessible than to design it for accessibility from the start. Government sites are required to be accessible, but have varying levels of conformity.</p>
<p>One thing I noticed was that many of the photos on the White House website have alt text or visible captions attached — these help visually impaired visitors understand what&#8217;s in an image. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2098612" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/accessibility-harris.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2098612" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2098612" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/accessibility-harris.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing the alt text of a photo of VP Kamala Harris and her family" width="1024" height="582" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/accessibility-harris.jpg 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/accessibility-harris.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/accessibility-harris.jpg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/accessibility-harris.jpg?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/accessibility-harris.jpg?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/accessibility-harris.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2098612" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> White House</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Normally that alt text would be read out by a screen reader when it got to the image, but it&#8217;s generally not made visible.</p>
<p>Unless the metadata was stripped from the previous administration&#8217;s site (it&#8217;s archived <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/">here</a>), none of the photos I checked had text descriptions there, so this is a big improvement. Unfortunately some photos (like the big header photo on the front page) don&#8217;t have descriptions, something that should probably be remedied.</p>

<p>Accessibility in other places will mean prompt inclusion of plaintext versions of governance items and announcements (versus PDFs or other documents), captions on official videos and other media, and as the team notes, lots of little improvements that make the site better for everyone who visits.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a small thing in a way, compared with the changes expected to accompany the new administration, but small things tend to pile up and become big things.</p>
<p>As Microsoft&#8217;s Isaac Hepworth <a href="https://twitter.com/isaach/status/1351945317822861312/photo/1">noted</a>, there&#8217;s still lots of work to do, and that&#8217;s why U.S. Digital Services hid a little message in the source code:</p>
