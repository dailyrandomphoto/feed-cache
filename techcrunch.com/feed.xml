										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You only get so many Hail Mary passes in consumer electronics. Even among the biggest companies. Take a look a Microsoft’s long-standing mobile phone ambitions. Even a $7.2 billion acquisition of the once-dominant Nokia couldn’t buy the company a place at the table with Apple and Samsung.</p>
<p>Some earlier false starts aside, Google’s mobile hardware ambitions have been &#8212; on the whole &#8212; more successful. But the Pixel line has never had the major hit the company needs to justify the resources spent on the category. The devices have largely felt like, at best, a showcase for some of the cool stuff Google is working on in mobile software and ML and, at worst, a kind of also-ran.</p>
<p>It’s frankly been strange to see the company struggle to make waves, though entering a field as crowded as smartphones was never going to be easy. And it’s doubly difficult to make a dent when, on the whole, flagship smartphones are all pretty good and continued dominance in the space is largely the result of forward momentum. Adding to Google’s troubles is a long-standing insistence that the true breakthroughs are all happening on the software side.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222347" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s an interesting thesis, to be sure, that Apple, Samsung and the like are essentially wasting their time waging a war of specs. There’s something to the idea, but in its current state, at least, it’s simply not possible to be hardware agnostic. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are, undoubtedly, growing in importance, but camera lenses, displays and processors all still matter. At least for now.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2219391" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Last May, it was revealed that key members of the Pixel team had left the company. It was part of a big rethink, one reaching back even further. This August, CEO Sundar Pichai noted that the company has been working on its own in-house silicon for four years. As far as Hail Mary passes go, weaning yourself off chipmakers like Qualcomm is a big one. And it needs a big phone to go with it.</p>
<p>Released this time last year, the Pixel 5 was the last vestige of the old way. Big changes don’t happen overnight &#8212; or even in a year when it comes to major electronics product lines. Unfortunately for Google, news of its minor restructuring got out ahead of the phone’s release, and even the company had to acknowledge that better days were ahead. The Pixel 6 isn’t make or break for the line, but after generations of uninspiring sales, it needs to prove that things are heading in the right direction.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And by those standards, the phone is a rousing success.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219387" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219387" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2219387" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0443.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0443.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0443.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0443.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0443.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0443.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0443.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0443.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0443.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219387" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>It stands in opposition to Google’s spec agnosticism as a testament that great software still requires great hardware. The Pixel 6 isn’t a cutting-edge, overclocked spec machine, by any stretch, but it stands as an example of what Google’s ever-impressive software can do when given the proper hardware.</p>
<p>From the moment you grab the Pixel 6 Pro, it’s clear there’s something different here. The handset feels more like something produced by Samsung than of its Pixel predecessors. It’s got a size and a heft reminiscent of the Galaxy line, an aesthetic quality only enhanced by the curved glass edges.</p>
<p>One of the things that honestly surprised me most the day of the announcement was how polarizing curved glass is in the online community. Here, its usage is primarily aesthetic, rather than attempting to jam in any kind of edge functionality, à la Samsung. The biggest argument I’ve heard against it is the risk of accidentally triggering the touchscreen when picking up the phone by the sides. It’s not a problem I’ve encountered, and honestly, I’m fairly curved screen-agnostic on the whole.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219381" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219381" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2219381" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219381" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The 6 Pro display is 6.7 inches, a QHD+ (3120 x 1440) OLED at 512 ppi. It’s nice, big and bright, with a max refresh rate of 120 Hz. The standard 6 sports a 6.4-inch display at 411 ppi and 90 Hz. You can’t really go wrong either way, but the Pro is a nice upgrade on that front. The front-facing camera is a pinhole design, obscured by the default wallpaper.</p>
<p>There’s also an in-screen fingerprint reader at the bottom, which unlocks the phone quickly. The display is covered with Gorilla Glass Victus, with Gorilla Glass 6 on the rear. The upper-third of the back is monopolized by a large, distinct camera bar. I like it from a design standpoint &#8212; it’s a nice change from the standard square the competition has all gravitated toward.</p>
<p>It’s a significant bump, which means the phone sits at an angle while on its back. The addition of the standard case largely negates this effect, however. The one other concern with the camera placement is that you may have to be a bit more mindful of where you place your hands while shooting in landscape mode. Again, I didn’t run into any issues on that front, and if you do, it’s easily corrected.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2222899,2222903,2222904,2222894,2222895,2222893,2222896,2222897,2222898,2222900,2222902,2222905"]</p>
<p>There’s a slight color difference in the glass above and below the camera bar. It’s really just a fun little flourish &#8212; something the company did with the power buttons on older Pixel units. It’s clear Google is still working to develop to distinguish itself from the lookalike competition. Thankfully, it’s just a subtle touch. The whole of the design language tastefully rides the line between boring and outlandish.</p>
<p>The camera system is probably the ultimate example of how good software and hardware play off each other. I was testing the Pixel 6 Pro at the same time as the Surface Duo, and particularly in mixed or low light, it really was night and day (so to speak), in spite of the Microsoft device having a solid camera rig.</p>
<p>Turns out developing your own camera system for several generations pays dividends. I really liked the shots I was able to capture on this thing. The 4x optical zoom on the Pro is a nice touch, as well. It can go up to 20x digital, but even with Google’s computational photography, you start to introduce noise into the image quickly.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2222892" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132512-3.png" alt="" width="1024" height="378" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132512-3.png 1786w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132512-3.png?resize=150,55 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132512-3.png?resize=300,111 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132512-3.png?resize=768,284 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132512-3.png?resize=680,251 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132512-3.png?resize=1536,568 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132512-3.png?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>In addition to the standard suite of Pixel camera features comes some cool new tricks. Magic Eraser is similar in principle to Photoshop’s Content Aware Fill tool. Rub your finger on top of an unwelcome background image and it will use the surrounding settings to fill up the spot, effectively “erasing” the object. It’s far from perfect. A close look will generally spot the inconsistencies, and the more complex the surroundings, the worse job it does, generally. Even so, it does an impressive job for a new feature built into the app.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2222889" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132252-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1101" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132252-1.png 1786w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132252-1.png?resize=140,150 140w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132252-1.png?resize=279,300 279w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132252-1.png?resize=768,826 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132252-1.png?resize=633,680 633w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132252-1.png?resize=1429,1536 1429w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132252-1.png?resize=47,50 47w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Ditto for Action Pan. This works similarly to Portrait mode, adding a faux blur effect to the background of an object. It works well with larger, more geometrically simple objects like a car. Something like a person riding by on a bike, on the other hand, gives it more trouble around the edges &#8212; much like Portrait. Long Exposure is effectively the opposite, blurring the moving objects, while keeping the background stationary.</p>
<p>Not gonna lie, my hermetic pandemic lifestyle hasn’t afforded me the opportunity to shoot many humans. Top of the list there are Face Unblur, which cleverly uses two cameras and face detection to create a composite sharper image on a moving object. We’re going to be digging into the real tone feature a bit deeper soon, but it’s a much welcome effort to better capture a wide range of skin tones. This, again, relies on facial detection, which can occasional be an issue.</p>
<p>Also impressive are the slate of text tools arriving on the Pixel. Live translate worked will in my limited testing, and is an impressive addition to texting. Assistant voice typing works well, though it ran into occasional issues (perhaps my annunciation), including the addition of emojis via voice. All welcome addition to existing features like Recorder, which has since added German and Japanese to the mix.</p>

<p>The real star of the show is Tensor, of course. Google has joined an increasing number of companies that have eschewed Qualcomm&#8217;s silicon dominance, in favor of their own chips. This one was four years in the making, and probably as good a sign as any that the company is committed to the Pixel line for the foreseeable future. This time out, the company credits the first-party SoC with powering a number of the new features core to the Pixel 6 experience. It notes in a recent blog post,</p>
<blockquote><p>With Google Tensor, we’re unlocking amazing new experiences that require state of the art ML — including Motion Mode, Face Unblur, Speech enhancement mode for videos and applying HDRnet to videos (more on these later). Google Tensor allows us to push the limits of helpfulness in a smartphone, taking it from a one-size-fits-all piece of hardware into a device that’s intelligent enough to respect and accommodate the different ways we use our phones.</p></blockquote>
<p>In our Geekbench tests, the system scored a 1031 on single-core and 2876 on multi-core. That&#8217;s a dramatic improvement over the <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">574 and </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">1522 average we saw for the Pixel 5 &#8212; but keep in mind, that system sported a middling Snapdragon 765G process. Not exactly flagship material there.

<p>Battery was one of the biggest sticking points with earlier models, but Google has addressed that here, big time. The 6 and 6 Pro feature 4,614 and 5,003mAh batteries, respectively — representing a solid upgrade from Pixel 5’s 4,080mA. That, in turn, was a nice jump from the Pixel 4. Google says you should be able to get through 24 hours on a charge &#8212; I found I was at around 26 hours with moderate use, so good news on that front.</p>
<p>After several years of middling Pixel hardware and sales, Google really needed a device to point the way forward for a floundering mobile division. Four years of processor development, six generations of software and some shiny new hardware all come together nicely in one package. Google has long insisted that the Pixel line is more than just an opportunity to highlight new Android software, and for once, that really rings true.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been half-a-decade since the original AirPods changed the game for Bluetooth earbuds. Mocked at launch by some for their long-stemmed design, it didn’t take long before they became virtually ubiquitous, the driving force in what was still an emerging category. They offered a form factor, design and user experience that tied the technology into a package that makes sense.</p>
<p>Of course, a lot can change in five years &#8212; especially in this industry. And frankly, I’m not sure I’ve seen a category come of age and capture the public imagination as quickly as Bluetooth earbuds. Every major hardware maker has at least one good or great pair of buds, and some, like Nothing, have popped up in their wake with the express mission of disrupting the status quo.</p>
<p>Apple’s line has been through its share of changes, too, of course. In 2019, a second-generation product added the H1 chip for hands-free “Hey Siri” and improved wireless functionality, a better battery and an optional wireless charging case. That same year, the company added a premium tier to the line, in the form of the AirPods Pro. The model adds active noise cancellation (plus a transparency mode), a standard wireless charging case and silicone tips &#8212; a long-standing request from Apple headphone devotees.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222606" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2222871" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>At the time of writing this, there are currently three AirPods buds models, plus the over-ear Max. Effectively every single model the company has sold since 2019 is currently availably for purchase on its site. Only the first-gen version has been discontinued. The newly introduced third-generation model best their predecessors with a new design, the addition of spatial audio, sweat and water resistance and an included MagSafe charging case (all shared features with the Pros).</p>
<p>They also get an added hour of battery life on the buds and six additional hours with the case, bringing the totals up to six and 30 hours of life, respectively. At $179, they’re in between the Pros ($249) and second-gen ($129), though a fair bit closer to the latter. With the Pros getting a little long in the tooth themselves, it’s not surprising that an updated standard AirPods have further blurred the lines between the two SKUs. Heck, the shorter stems and longer charger bring the design language far more in line with the Pros.</p>
<p>For the time being, the primary differentiators are: silicone ear tips, active noise canceling and, of course, pricing. The Pros are still priced at a premium and are, without question, the company’s best earbuds, along with being one of the best premium earbuds, period. But the last year or two have seen features like active noise canceling become increasingly ubiquitous among various price points.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2222876" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The AirPods 3 exist in a sort of limbo, as a notable step up from their predecessors in terms of features and sound quality and a step down from the Pros that were introduced the same year. Price point, I think, is the most compelling case here. Seventy dollars is not an insignificant premium to move from the AirPods to the Pros. But as someone who has regularly used the Pros for the past couple of years, switching to the AirPods for day to day use has been a noticeable step down.</p>
<p>The more contoured third-generation buds are unquestionably more comfortable than their predecessors, but the gulf between them and the Pros feels like night and day. That’s likely to be even more the case for people with smaller ears &#8212; having different-sized, removable tips is a lifesaver for some. The seal those tips provide also create passive noise canceling through a physical seal that effectively keeps in more audio frequencies and blocks out ambient noise.</p>
<p>As a long-time proponent of the silicone tip, I was surprised to hear that there are still people out there who prefer molded plastic. But I’ve since been able to confirm that at least one TechCrunch staffer fits the description, preferring to insert anything into their ear. Fair enough, I guess &#8212; and certainly I won’t begrudge a company for offering options, even if one seemingly makes the other feel outmoded.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2222874" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0544.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0544.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0544.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0544.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0544.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0544.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0544.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0544.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0544.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>As a resident of New York City’s biggest borough, much of my life is spent immersed in street noise &#8212; and for that matter, a constant barrage of construction from the comfort of my home. The Pros’ active and passive noise cancelation make a world of difference when a street sweeper or above-ground subway train pass me on the street, not to mention a parade of emergency vehicle sirens. There were times when the podcast I was listening to was drowned out in the cacophony of city life. Though, again, there are reasons to appreciate this from a situational awareness standpoint.</p>
<p>Wireless charging is a welcome update here. You can top off the case with a MagSafe or standard Qi charger. The former has the advantage of snapping together manually. Spatial audio, meanwhile, is a nifty feature. On a FaceTime call with multiple people, their voices are assigned locations based on where their boxes sit on the call. The effect is also novel in an app like Apple Music, which adjusts sound based on your location to the source (your phone, tablet, etc.) almost as if it were the speaker.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2222881" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-23-at-12.56.54-PM.jpg" alt="" width="970" height="1000" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-23-at-12.56.54-PM.jpg 970w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-23-at-12.56.54-PM.jpg?resize=146,150 146w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-23-at-12.56.54-PM.jpg?resize=291,300 291w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-23-at-12.56.54-PM.jpg?resize=768,792 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-23-at-12.56.54-PM.jpg?resize=660,680 660w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-23-at-12.56.54-PM.jpg?resize=32,32 32w" sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" /></p>
<p>The new AirPods also get support for the new Find My feature, which adds a Bluetooth beacon-style layer onto the existing functionality. That makes it easier to find the individual buds in close quarters. Anyone who’s had to rely on the beeping sound knows it can still be a headache to locate the buds in a messy room.</p>
<p>As ever, the earbuds work best with Apple products &#8212; as I tend to say in all of these reviews, your best bet is generally buying a pair of earbuds from the same company that made your phone. The pairing was certainly stronger on iOS, but the AirPods generally worked fine in use with an Android device.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2222872" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Watching the lines blur between the AirPods and AirPods Pro, it seems almost inevitable that the products will eventually merge into one. For now, the new generation is definitely a step up from their predecessors, and the $70 difference between them and the Pros is something to be mindful of. If you don’t care about active noise canceling and/or prefer modeled plastic tips, then the choice is easy. For a fully premium experience, however, well, that’s an easy choice, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, Google unveiled a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-partners-with-shopify-on-online-shopping-expansion/">partnership with Shopify</a> that gave the e-commerce platform&#8217;s over 1.7 million merchants the ability to reach consumers through Google Search and other services. Now, Microsoft is <a href="https://blogs.bing.com/search/2021_10/Microsoft-partners-with-Shopify-to-expand-product-selection-for-shoppers-this-holiday">announcing</a> a similar deal. The company recently said it&#8217;s teaming up with Shopify to expand product selection across its own search engine, Microsoft Bing, as well as within the Shopping tab on its Microsoft Edge browser and on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/microsoft-launches-a-personalized-news-service-microsoft-start/">newly launched news service,</a> Microsoft Start.</p>
<p>The integration is being made available to Shopify merchants through an updated Microsoft Channel app where they&#8217;ll be able to make a few adjustments to expand their reach across Microsoft&#8217;s network. Once set up up, merchants&#8217; products will show across the Shopping tab in Bing, Microsoft Edge, and Microsoft Start as free product listings.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223386" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223386" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2223386" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/msft-shopify.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="340" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/msft-shopify.png 700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/msft-shopify.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/msft-shopify.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/msft-shopify.png?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/msft-shopify.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223386" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223367" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Like Google, Microsoft&#8217;s advertising revenues may be impacted by Amazon&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/29/amazons-ads-business-nears-7-billion-a-quarter-posts-77percent-growth.html">growing</a> ads business over time.</p>
<p>Google has been scrambling to address this challenge with a revamp of its own Google Shopping service, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-partners-with-shopify-on-online-shopping-expansion/">it pitched to online advertisers</a> during its Google I/O developer conference this spring. The company then described its &#8220;Shopping Graph,&#8221; which would pull together information across websites, price reviews, and product data to help consumers find where to find items, who had the best price, and more. The company had also last year<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/google-switches-its-shopping-search-service-to-mostly-free-listings/"> made it free for merchants to sell their products across Google </a> — a change that Google touted had driven an 80% increase in merchants on Google, with the “vast majority” being small to medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p>Microsoft, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/microsoft-msft-earnings-q4-2021.html">has been seeing</a> its search advertising revenue <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/alphabet-facebook-rise-as-microsoft-ad-units-do-better-than-predicted.html">grow in recent quarters</a> as the overall advertising market rebounded. But Amazon has been rapidly increasing its market share. In the first half of 2021, Amazon reported $14.82 billion in ad sales, up 82% from the same period a year ago, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-battling-amazon-tries-an-e-commerce-makeover-to-win-back-advertisers-11632936601">The WSJ noted in a report</a> on Google&#8217;s e-commerce makeover.</p>
<p>As more consumers start their product searches directly on Amazon and not on the web, bypassing search engines and homepage portals, both Google and Microsoft&#8217;s revenue could take a hit. To make their respective offerings more competitive, a partnership with Shopify gives both tech giants more direct access to a host of online inventory to showcase and market, including many listings Amazon may not have.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shopify&#8217;s integration with Microsoft will also allow merchants to create new ad campaigns and view marketing performance via real-time reports in their Shopify store, Microsoft said when announcing the tie-up. The company also noted it had other &#8220;shopping enhancements&#8221; planned for the future, but didn&#8217;t detail what those new features may include.</p>
<p>Microsoft is one of many integrations Shopify has announced over the past year. It also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/spotify-partners-with-shopify-to-add-merch-to-artists-profiles/">just teamed up with Spotify</a> to allow artists to sell merchandise through their Spotify profiles <a href="https://news.shopify.com/scaling-social-commerce-shopify-introduces-new-in-app-shopping-experiences-on-tiktok">and has been working with TikTok</a> on e-commerce experiences.</p>

<p>Namely, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001676238/000119312521304909/d40379ds1.htm">the Braze IPO filing</a>. The New York City-based company focuses on customer engagement software. We&#8217;ll get into what that means in a little bit.</p>

<p>For background, Braze raised around $175 million while private, most recently raising a September 2018 round that put $80 million into its account and afforded Braze an $850 million post-money valuation. PitchBook and Crunchbase agree on the numbers.</p>

Sound good? Let&#8217;s do it.</p>
<h2>What does Braze do?</h2>
<p>In broad terms, Braze links with customer software systems to collect consumer data, automatically sorting consumers into segments. From there, the company&#8217;s software can send &#8220;contextually relevant&#8221; notes to consumers, personalized based on what Braze has learned about the person or persons in question. Those messages can be sent both inside of customer products or outside through third-party channels.</p>
<p>The underlying logic is that consumers expect customization today, and that data is the way to pull off the task. Braze makes lots of noise in its filing about how many companies&#8217; customer data is siloed inside individual applications today. In contrast, Braze offers a method of centralizing consumer data, which, in theory, allows for a more holistic view of a customers&#8217; consumer base. With that view in hand, customers can make better marketing decisions, with Braze helping companies get tuned messages out to end users.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, we&#8217;re talking about a software-as-a-service product, though the company does have a dusting of on-demand revenues, which we&#8217;ll get to in the next section.</p>
<p>Braze&#8217;s service has a large in-market footprint. The company claims in its S-1 filing that it powered &#8220;interactions with 3.3 billion monthly active users via our customers’ apps, websites and other digital interfaces in July 2021.&#8221; That figure was 2.3 billion in January 2020 and 1.6 billion in January 2019.</p>
<p>How does that rising usage of the Braze platform translate into revenue? Let&#8217;s find out.</p>
<h2>Is that a good business?</h2>
<p>Braze is a pretty good business.</p>
<p>The company has released data through the July 31, 2021, quarter. We should get an early look at its October 31, 2021, quarter in a following S-1 filing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New Zealand-based cybersecurity company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/emsisoft/">Emsisoft</a> has been quietly helping BlackMatter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> victims recover encrypted files, preventing “tens of millions of dollars” in ransom payments and potentially signaling the end of the BlackMatter for good.</p>
<p>BlackMatter, a successor to the DarkSide ransomware operation responsible for the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/colonial-pipeline/">Colonial Pipeline attack</a>, first emerged in July this year and was recently the subject of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/cisa-nsa-blackmatter-food-industry/">CISA warning</a> due to “multiple” attacks targeting organizations deemed critical infrastructure, including two in the U.S. food and agriculture sector. The ransomware as a service operation was also responsible for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/technology-giant-olympus-hit-by-blackmatter-ransomware/">a recent attack on Olympus</a>, which forced the Japanese tech giant to shut down its EMEA operations.</p>
<p>Emsisoft discovered earlier this year that much like DarkSide, which had a flaw in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/end-to-end-encryption/">encryption</a> mechanism that allowed Emsisoft to decrypt files, BlackMatter’s encryption process also had a vulnerability that allowed it to recover encrypted files without having to pay the ransom. Emsisoft did not reveal the existence of the flaw until now, fearing it would allow the BlackMatter group to immediately roll out a fix.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223299" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Knowing DarkSide’s past mistakes, we were surprised when BlackMatter introduced a change to their ransomware payload that allowed us to once again recover victims’ data without the need for a ransom to be paid,” Emsisoft CTO Fabian Wosar said <a href="https://blog.emsisoft.com/en/39181/on-the-matter-of-blackmatter/">in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Once it had discovered the vulnerability, Emsisoft alerted law enforcement, ransomware negotiations firms, incident response firms, national computer emergency readiness teams (CERTs), and trusted partners with information about its decryption capabilities. This allowed these trusted parties to refer BlackMatter victims to Emsisoft to recover their files rather than pay a ransom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since then, we have been busy helping BlackMatter victims recover their data. With the help of law enforcement agencies, CERTs and private sector partners in multiple countries, we were able to reach numerous victims, helping them avoid tens of millions of dollars in demands,&#8221; Wosar said. Emsisoft also contacted victims found through BlackMatter samples and ransom notes publicly uploaded to various sites.</p>
<p>But Wosar said the ransom notes that were leaked or made publicly available made it possible for anyone to communicate with the threat actors as though they were the victim. BlackMatter later locked down its site, making it far more difficult for law enforcement and security researchers to gather vital intelligence.</p>
<p>Emsisoft said it can still help BlackMatter victims who were encrypted before the end of September. Brett Callow, a threat analyst at Emsisoft, said this decryption campaign could be BlackMatter&#8217;s demise.</p>
<p>“This may well be the end of the BlackMatter brand,&#8221; he said. This is the second time their errors have cost their affiliates money, and the affiliates will likely not be too pleased about that. Unfortunately, even if the brand does end, the operators will likely return with a new one.&#8221;</p>
<p>“In the past, the risk/reward ratio was heavily skewed to ‘reward.’ This effort demonstrates the public-private sector collaboration can swing the needle, and that’s a key element to combatting the ransomware problem. The less profitable it is, the less incentive the threat actors have,&#8221; Callow told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Emsisoft says it’s also found vulnerabilities in about a dozen active ransomware operations. The company advises victims of ransomware to report attacks to law enforcement, who can collect valuable indicators of compromise for investigative purposes and refer victims to Emsisoft if a decryption tool is available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central banks control the circulation and supply of money globally, but the phenomenal rise of cryptocurrency poses a threat to their authority, control and power.</span></p>
<p>So central banks around the world are now producing their own digital currencies. In a groundbreaking move for the African continent, buffered by local activity and interest in cryptocurrency &#8212; after the U.S., it is the second-largest market for crypto trading &#8212; <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria joins that list this week.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After being in the development phase for the last three years, its central bank is piloting the first digital currency in Africa today.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2210974" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It joins 14 other countries now in the pilot stages with their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), including China, Sweden and South Korea, with a total of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/">81 countries</a> in other stages of exploring CBDCs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only five have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: the Bahamas, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, and Saint Lucia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The virtual money, dubbed the eNaira, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is backed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and issued by the country’s apex bank, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like most governments, Nigeria is introducing a virtual currency because it is more cost-efficient than physical cash, helps the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unbanked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have easier access to money, and can, in some way, limit illicit activities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>But despite the advantages that come with central bank-issued digital currencies, there are fears surrounding how they could be used by governments with a track record of surveilling or attempting to surveil their citizens.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>What we know so far about eNaira</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heading up to this pilot launch, CBN <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/nigeria-partner-bitt-inc-launch-192731934.html">picked Barbados-based Bitt Inc</a> in August to develop and roll out the digital currency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has a track record: It assisted the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) to design and launch DCash, the digital currency used by Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Saint Lucia &#8212; four of the five countries that have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched their own CBDCs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On September 27, the CBN <a href="https://punchng.com/enaira-website-goes-live-displays-cbn-digital-currency-features/">launched the eNaira website</a>, detailing necessary information on how Nigerians can access and use the virtual currency</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, Nigerians will have to download the eNaira mobile application on the Apple Store or Play Store. They can also opt to scan a QR code on the website to access the service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After registration, users must</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> register and create a wallet &#8212; called the Speed Wallet &#8212; to store, send and receive money. Several tiers of wallets are</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available on the platform catering to various users with or without bank accounts and different identification levels</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The website lists four main eNaira features: a unified payment system that allows customers to move money from their eNaira wallet; a bank account management feature that lets users check balances and transaction history;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a contactless payment service so users can make in-store payments by scanning QR codes; and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> P2P payments, in which users send money to each other via a linked bank account or card</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Cryptocurrency to give way to CBDCs</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin highlight the potential of money’s digital future despite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">being created</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outside the confines of the traditional global banking system. And its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sharp rise in adoption has led to a scuffle with legacy institutions in determining the future of money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The argument against cryptocurrencies has typically focused on concerns around fraud and volatility. That hasn’t stopped some countries, like El Salvador, from using bitcoin as a legal tender</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">thers that see bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a threat to their national banking and financial systems, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBDCs act as direct replacements for rising interest in something other than fiat.</span></p>
<p>“The concept of CBDCs has become a necessity for central banks. Money is a tool for controlling people. They do not want to allow the primary tool of control to be eroded because the entrance of privately issued cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum is a direct challenge to central banks’ authority everywhere in the world. CBDCs come in as their response, albeit weak ones,” Chimezie Chuta, founder and coordinator of Blockchain Nigeria User Group, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While cryptocurrencies are pretty independent, digital currencies hold the same value as their paper counterparts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Nigeria’s case, the eNaira will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be pegged</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the naira, with its value fluctuating against the U.S. dollar, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the naira does.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another significant difference between CBDCs and cryptocurrencies is that the former </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is subjected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to regulation and control &#8212; common themes at the heart of governments in China and Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2014, China has been working on a national digital currency (digital yuan), an effort championed by its central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC),</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a year after the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-05/china-s-pboc-bans-financial-companies-from-bitcoin-transactions">Chinese government banned banks and payments companies</a> from providing bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, China banned mining, initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrency trading platforms from converting legal tender into cryptocurrencies and vice versa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite the bans, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have gained significant traction in the Asian country since then, so it made <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-financial-payment-bodies-barred-cryptocurrency-business-2021-05-18/">tighter laws</a> this May by banning fintech companies from offering services around account openings, registration, trading, clearing and settlement to crypto platforms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up until now, China had targeted only local crypto platforms and had not barred individuals from holding cryptocurrencies in offshore exchanges</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that changed last month when the Chinese government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/china-says-all-cryptocurrency-related-transactions-are-illegal/">declared</a> all transactions involving cryptocurrencies (including mining) illegal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also stated that it was illegal for offshore crypto exchanges like Binance to provide services to people in mainland China.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whilst this is not a surprise as China has ‘banned’ crypto many times in the past, this time there is no ambiguity,” PwC crypto leader Henri Arslanian <a href="https://twitter.com/henriarslanian/status/1441463323342647296">tweeted</a>. “Crypto transactions and crypto services of all kinds </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are banned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in China. No room for discussion. No grey area.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some analysts have said these bans and restrictions by China </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are geared</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> toward the Asian country’s full release of the digital yuan in 2022</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s plausible, despite the Chinese government’s claims that it launched the digital yuan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to replace some cash in circulation in a country where WeChat and Alipay are responsible for four out of five payments </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">carried</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digitally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>More crypto crackdown and surveillance?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PBOC, with the help of the government, might be attempting to take back some online payments market share from the duopoly (Alipay and WeChat) with the digital yuan, whose trials and rollout started from April 2020 in Shanghai, Chengdu and Beijing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the eNaira, users can only access the digital yuan by downloading a mobile app developed and controlled by the central bank. So far, there are more than 7 million individual digital wallets and 1 million company wallets using the digital yuan. Transactions totaling $5.3 billion have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the trials, according to <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/china-digital-currency-yuan-cbdc-banks-cryptocurrency-lenders-investment-insurance-2021-8">Business Insider</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Nigeria isn’t a crypto mining country, its people are heavy crypto users. The West African country is second only to the U.S. for bitcoin trading, <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1947769/nigeria-is-the-second-largest-bitcoin-market-after-the-us/">according to Paxful</a>, as many Nigerians use the cryptocurrency to protect their savings against naira depreciation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, Nigerians <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jul/31/out-of-control-and-rising-why-bitcoin-has-nigerias-government-in-a-panic">traded</a> $2.4 billion worth of traceable crypto, per data from Chainalysis. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an astonishing figure, considering that in February, the Nigerian government via the CBN <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/nigerian-central-bank-orders-closure-of-cryptocurrency-accounts">banned cryptocurrency transactions</a>, prohibited banks from taking part in such transactions, and ordered them to close accounts of Nigerians using cryptocurrency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, similar to China, Nigeria’s following action tilted toward piloting its digital currency. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But unlike China, Nigeria is a cash-dominated society. It’s one of the main reasons (including the potential to improve financial inclusion) why smaller countries such as the Bahamas have rolled out digital currencies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For these purposes, the introduction of a digital currency in Nigeria makes sense on paper. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, m</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">any Nigerians have reservations about its usefulness, while others understand that it’s the government’s ploy to reduce incentives for people who want to use crypto. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then, there are other subtle factors to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be worried</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about: surveillance and a full-scale crackdown on crypto activities in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>Typically, governments use Financial Intelligence units to monitor financial transactions and collect information on suspicious or unusual monetary activity. But CBDCs might take things up a notch.</p>
<div class="" data-block="true" data-editor="d2l7g" data-offset-key="ernng-0-0">
<div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" data-offset-key="ernng-0-0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several publications have alluded that China’s government could use the digital yuan t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o advance surveillance of its people. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to its central bank, the PBOC, agencies operating digital yuan services </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to “submit transaction data to the central bank via asynchronous transmission on a timely basis,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” which will allow the bank to “track data and crackdown on laundering and criminal offenses.”</span></div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CBN has a similar </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">objective</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and has said before that the eNaira will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">minimize</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fraudulent activities and money laundering because of the “trackable unique ID of each eNaira</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span></p>
<p><span class="veryhardreadability"><span data-offset-key="ernng-2-0">“</span></span><span class="veryhardreadability"><span data-offset-key="ernng-6-0">Banks and telcos already have our necessary information via verification processes,” said Chuta. “But CBDCs will increase that monitoring and surveillance because now they can actually follow money flow in a digital environment and carry out a forensic analysis of each user’s transaction on the ledger that they are deploying.”</span></span><span data-offset-key="ernng-7-0"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, a report from a local press said Nigeria was in <a href="https://fij.ng/article/exclusive-presidency-meets-with-chinas-cyber-regulator-to-build-nigerian-internet-firewall/">talks</a> with China to build an internet firewall. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the publication, China’s “Great Firewall” is the center of the government’s online censorship and surveillance effort</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hough Nigeria lacks the resources to build such a firewall for surveillance, some believe the eNaira might have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been designed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the same purpose, albeit on a lesser scale</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“CBDCs are trackable and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it might come in handy for the government if they decide to carry out unwarranted surveillance,” a crypto user who withheld his name told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, as with the case of China, more crypto crackdowns could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be triggered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if, for instance, the adoption of eNaira does not take off as planned or if the government enforces the eNaira as the sole digital currency to be traded in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Case in point: China’s new orders made two of the world’s largest crypto exchanges &#8212; Huobi and Binance &#8212; halt new registrations for users, and Huobi says it will retire current accounts by the end of the year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear if the Nigerian government can exercise such powers. Still, should</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it ban offshore crypto platforms from servicing and employing Nigerians and succeed, peer-to-peer activities (which has made crypto thrive in Nigeria) will take a severe hit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The government, in general, poses a threat to crypto. It’s situations like this where someone has real-world power and [can] put you in jail for trading crypto,” said a growth lead at a Nigerian cryptocurrency exchange platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If a government </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decided to outlaw the use of crypto within their borders, crypto would be stifled such that at some point, it might not be worth it to use anymore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, though, it seems Nigeria and its apex bank have noble intentions with the eNaira. According to the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, the eNaira will lead to cheaper and faster remittance inflow and increase cross-border trade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For remittances, the eNaira </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is assumed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to provide a better alternative for Nigerians in the diaspora to send money home, in the long run increasing remittances into the country, which <a href="https://nairametrics.com/2021/09/06/diaspora-remittances-into-nigeria-fall-by-24-in-q1-2021/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20Nigeria%20reported%20about,to%20%2423.4%20billion%20in%202019.">reached $17 billion last year</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://saharareporters.com/2021/09/22/chinese-banks-set-establish-operations-nigeria">News</a> about Chinese banks expanding operations in Nigeria made the rounds last month and could prove pivotal to the effectiveness of cross-border trade between both countries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">China is Nigeria’s biggest trade partner (volume transacted between them has passed $20 billion this year, increasing from $19.2 billion in 2020). Three years ago, both countries tried a <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1346766/chinas-yuan-trades-in-nigeria-africa-top-economy/">currency swap agreement</a> for better trade and, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lthough nothing materialized, Chuta holds that the countries’ digital currencies can act as perfect substitutes.</span></p>
<div class="" data-block="true" data-editor="d2l7g" data-offset-key="b9ka3-0-0">
<div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" data-offset-key="b9ka3-0-0"><span class="qualifier"><span data-offset-key="b9ka3-0-0">“I think</span></span><span class="veryhardreadability"><span data-offset-key="b9ka3-1-0"> there can be interoperability that can be beneficial to both countries. When you want to transfer money from Nigeria to China, you would have to go through at least four different hops and it takes like three or four days,” said Chuta.</span></span><span data-offset-key="b9ka3-2-0"> “</span><span class="veryhardreadability"><span data-offset-key="b9ka3-3-0">But let’s say China and Nigeria’s CBDCs interoperate, it means that if I want to send money to a Chinese supplier, I </span></span><span class="adverb"><span data-offset-key="b9ka3-6-0">simply</span></span><span class="veryhardreadability"><span data-offset-key="b9ka3-7-0"> swap eNaira to Chinese yuan on my app and push it to the supplier who gets it at a fraction of the amount I would’ve </span></span><span class="adverb"><span data-offset-key="b9ka3-8-0">typically</span></span><span class="veryhardreadability"><span data-offset-key="b9ka3-9-0"> done with the traditional transfer bodies</span></span><span data-offset-key="b9ka3-10-0">.”</span></div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Nigeria’s central bank, the eNaira would also improve “payment efficiency, revenue and tax collection, and targeted social interventions.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will Nigeria’s apex bank achieve all this? It’s too early to say, since no country, either in pilot or fully launched mode, has achieved success at a massive scale yet. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eNaira’s staggered rollout is expected to take place across four cities in the country &#8212; Port Harcourt, Abuja, Kano and Lagos. But</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"> given how similar government-led initiatives have fared in the past, the odds of achieving full-scale rollout are slim.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="article__contributor-byline-wrapper">
<div class="contributor-byline__bio">This story was reported in partnership with video surveillance news site <a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/lorex-box?code=xybl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IPVM.</a></div>
</div>
<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. retail giants Home Depot and Best Buy have pulled the Chinese video surveillance technology makers Lorex and Ezviz from their stores over links to human rights abuses.</p>
<p>In a statement to TechCrunch, Home Depot said it&#8217;s &#8220;committed to upholding the highest standards of ethical sourcing and we immediately stopped selling products from Lorex when this was brought to our attention.&#8221; Best Buy said it was &#8220;discontinuing its relationship&#8221; with both Lorex and Ezviz.</p>
<p>Lowe&#8217;s, which did not comment, also removed Lorex from its shelves following inquiries from TechCrunch and <a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/lorex-box?code=xybl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video surveillance news site IPVM</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222929" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Lorex is a subsidiary of Dahua Technology, and Ezviz is a video surveillance camera brand owned by Hikvision. Dahua and Hikvision, both headquartered in China, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/eight-chinese-tech-firms-placed-on-u-s-entity-list-for-their-role-in-human-rights-violations-against-muslim-minority-groups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were added</a> to the U.S. government’s economic blacklist in 2019 after the companies were linked to China’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/02/china-surveillance-app/">ongoing efforts to suppress ethnic minorities</a> in Xinjiang, where most Uighur Muslims live.</p>
<p>The U.S. government says Beijing relies heavily on Hikvision, Dahua and other technology companies to supply the surveillance equipment to surveil the Uighur population. The Biden administration <a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/2020-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called</a> the human rights abuses in Xinjiang a “genocide,&#8221; and blamed Chinese video surveillance manufacturers of having &#8220;been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.”</p>
<p>United Nations watchdogs say Chinese authorities have detained over a million Uighurs in internment camps in recent years. China has long denied the allegations.</p>
<p>But as the sanctions neither cover Dahua and Hikvision subsidiaries like Lorex and Ezviz and don&#8217;t apply outside the federal government, consumers are still broadly free to buy the technology.</p>
<p>Until last week, Lorex listed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211014184354/https://www.lorex.com/pages/authorized-resellers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on its website</a> Home Depot, Best Buy, Lowe&#8217;s, Walmart and Costo as its five authorized national retail outlets.</p>
<p>When reached for comment, a Lorex spokesperson said: “Lorex is fully transparent with our retail partners about our ownership and have been since the acquisition in 2018. We are also regularly in touch with representatives of those companies in regard to various regulatory and compliance issues, including addressing any questions they have about the FCC’s proposed rulemaking.”</p>
<p>Lorex did not respond to follow-up emails after its products were removed. Lorex removed the logos of the five retail giants from its website, though it still lists the companies — except Walmart — as retailers of its technology.</p>
<p>Walmart and Costco, which still stock Lorex and Ezviz technology, did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Dolkun Isa, the president of the World Uyghur Congress, welcomed the &#8220;meaningful actions&#8221; by the U.S. government with bans on forced labor and sanctions for Chinese companies, but said that it&#8217;s &#8220;unacceptable that there are still American companies directly helping further the repression.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hikvision did not respond to requests for comment by TechCrunch and IPVM.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://selfbook.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Selfbook</a>, a hotel payment software startup, announced today that it has raised $25 million in a Series A round of funding led by Tiger Global Management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valia Ventures, Fin Venture Capital, early Stripe employee turned investor Lachy Groom and “strategic” angel investors also participated in the financing, which values the company at $125 million and brings its total funding raised to $30 million. The valuation represents a nearly “16x” increase from the company’s valuation when it raised a $2 million seed round last quarter, according to Khalid Meniri, co-founder and CEO of Selfbook. Investors such as Better Tomorrow Ventures, Abstract Ventures, TenOneTen Ventures and 9Yards Capital participated in this latest round, as well &#8220;with super pro rata.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selfbook claims that its software gives hotels a way to accept “one-click” payments directly on their websites while eliminating fraud and reducing chargebacks.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222709" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in September 2020 as a pivot from a consumer travel app to a B2B company, New York-based Selfbook describes itself as the “Shopify for travel” and says it operates at the intersection of hospitality and fintech. Hotels can implement its technology, according to Meniri, “with a single line of code” to improve their booking experience directly on their existing reservation systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selfbook launched with one hotel in April and has subsequently signed contracts representing nearly 90 hotels, with 15 so far having gone live. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its customers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">span a range of geographies and include Le Pigalle in Paris, Eden Rock St Barths and The LINE’s locations in Los Angeles, Austin, Texas and Washington, D.C. Selfbook is primarily focused on the U.S. and EU.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past six months, the startup has seen a “10x” increase in Selfbook users using single sign-on and digital wallets. Additionally, 67% of bookings were made using digital wallets on mobile. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selfbook claims that its software is the only payment technology for hotels that supports digital wallet use, including Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal and buy now, pay later. It also supports traditional debit and credit card payments. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides allowing for “one-click” payment, Meniri says Selfbook&#8217;s software also provides direct booking links and smart merchandising.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the software can also group multiple services such as restaurant reservations, spa appointments and activities into a “single payment flow.” This, the company says, can drive more upsells for the hotels and as a result, increase revenue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Selfbook has 50 full-time employees, up from only four employees at the beginning of the year. It plans to use its new capital in part to do more hiring in addition to expanding partnerships with fintech partners and existing hospitality systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above, Selfbook formerly operated as a B2C business that gave hotel guests a way to book reservations at over 3,000 hotels using its SIX Travel app. In order to facilitate those bookings, the company created its own “modern” transaction software after discovering there were no existing API partners with a simple hotel booking function on the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When the pandemic hit and deeply impacted the hospitality industry, we decided to democratize</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> our unique payment and transaction engine and improve the direct hotel booking process for all,” Meniri told TechCrunch. “We relaunched as Selfbook to offer our payment solution directly to hotels” with the goal of helping the hotel industry more easily recover from the negative effects of the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Tiger Global partner Alex Cook, Selfbook is not only modernizing the hotel booking experience, it has the potential to increase conversion for hotel operators and improve the booking experience for guests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for investor Groom, who is the former head of Stripe issuing, Selfbook aims to solve a very real pain point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyone who&#8217;s booked a hotel online knows how bad the state of payments in hospitality is,” he said in a statement. “Selfbook is a joy to use, and is obviously the future.”</span></p>
<p>Side note: After booking a hotel earlier this year through a third-party provider and having a nightmare experience to just cancel the booking, I can appreciate the need for this sort of technology. It was shocking to me that it was so complicated and difficult. So anything that can make directly booking with a hotel more convenient and safer, I&#8217;m all for.</p>
<p>Last week, we reported on Citcon, a mobile wallet payment provider, closing on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/citcon-raises-30m-to-make-paying-with-mobile-wallets-as-easy-as-paying-with-a-credit-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$30 million in funding</a> in a Series C round co-led by Norwest Venture Partners and Cota Capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Celeb video site <a href="https://www.cameo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cameo</a> is making its first acquisition. The company will buy Represent, a marketing and merch company that helps celebrities and brands set up individualized online storefronts. It&#8217;s a natural fit for Cameo, which invites fans to pay celebrities of all stripes for short, customized videos.</p>
<p>Represent counts Jennifer Lopez, Ed Sheeran, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matthew McConaughey and Kendall Jenner among the members of its pool of partnered talent, so Cameo will be bringing those relationships into the fold through the acquisition.</p>
<p>The company is also bringing Represent&#8217;s leadership on board and the acquisition will double the size of Cameo&#8217;s team in Europe. Cameo did not disclose the terms of the deal.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223304" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Cameo says that its users won&#8217;t see changes right away, but in the future they might be able to purchase &#8220;gift bundles&#8221; that would pair a traditional Cameo video with related merch. The company also hopes that weaving merch into its revenue streams will boost the fundraising efforts that many on-platform celebrities do to raise money for nonprofits.</p>
<p>Most of Cameo&#8217;s users visit the celeb video site to procure gifts for friends and loved ones to celebrate birthdays and other occasions. The company said it facilitated more than 1.3 million videos last year, with the company&#8217;s top 150 figures earning north of $100,000.</p>
<p>The company has also added a few new products, including Cameo Calls — short one-on-one video calls with celebrities — and Fan Clubs, sort of a VIP section of the site that helps dedicated fans stay in the loop on the talent they follow.</p>
<p>Cameo has raised money from a number of traditional sources like Google Ventures and SoftBank, but also from celebrity investors like Snoop Dogg and Tony Hawk. In March, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/celebrity-video-request-site-cameo-reaches-unicorn-status-with-100m-raise/">Cameo raised a $100 million Series C</a>, bringing the company&#8217;s valuation to upward of $1 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After social media company Snap reported earnings last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/facebooks-next-chapter-just-might-make-sense/">the value of its cohort of public companies fell sharply</a>.</p>
<p>Snap shed more than 20% of its value after telling investors that it expects a far smaller fourth quarter than the street anticipates. Privacy changes to technology platforms and weak advertiser demand thanks to supply-chain issues are likely to weigh on Snap&#8217;s Q4 top-line expectations.</p>
<p>Facebook stock fell around 5% on the Snap news on Friday.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223279" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>And then Facebook had a difficult weekend of coverage, a period that flowed into a <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/211025/p4#a211025p4">Monday-morning news dump</a> concerning the company as dozens of media organizations began reporting on a trove of documents released by a whistleblower. Facebook is in the midst of what is perhaps its most damning reporting cycle to date, a bit of a high-water mark given the social company&#8217;s history of scandal.</p>
<p>This morning, however, shares of Facebook are essentially flat, trading up or down 0.2% to 0.3%. Investors are shrugging off the reporting, it appears.</p>
<p>It would be easy to make a somewhat cynical comment that public-market investors were more concerned about potentially lackluster business results than they are about, say, the company&#8217;s inability to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/23/technology/facebook-india-misinformation.html">handle misinformation and political manipulation in India</a>. But a good chunk of today&#8217;s reporting deals with things that <em>do </em>matter in business terms, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/facebook-files-show-growth-struggles-as-young-users-in-u-s-decline">like Facebook&#8217;s slowly declining grip on younger users. </a>So, what&#8217;s going on?</p>
<p>It may be that today&#8217;s reporting was priced into Facebook&#8217;s stock already; the company, worth just under $326 per share this morning, is far from its all-time high of $384.33 that it set earlier this year, indicating that it has already given up quite a lot of value.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But it may be most fair to say that Facebook investors are simply reacting to <em>new</em> disclosures &#8212; like Snap&#8217;s bad news &#8212; more than historical documents outlining longer-term issues. That would explain why Facebook fell Friday and is flattish today.</p>
<p>Regardless of why Facebook&#8217;s shares are holding steady this morning, any gains in the wake of an ocean of negative reporting based on the company&#8217;s own descriptions of its problems &#8212; leaked documents are powerful for that very reason &#8212; must feel like a win inside of Facebook&#8217;s halls.</p>
<p>Facebook reports earnings today after the bell.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Car rental giant Hertz has placed an order for <a href="https://newsroom.hertz.com/2021-10-25-Hertz-Invests-in-Largest-Electric-Vehicle-Rental-Fleet-and-Partners-with-Seven-Time-Super-Bowl-Champion-Tom-Brady-to-Headline-New-Campaign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100,000 Tesla vehicles</a> to be delivered by the end of 2022 in the largest single purchase of EVs ever. The deal, which will push the car rental giant&#8217;s EV offerings to 20% of its global fleet, is reportedly worth $4.2 billion, according to sources <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/hertz-said-to-order-100-000-teslas-in-car-rental-market-shake-up?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cited by Bloomberg</a>.</p>
<p>Tesla Model 3 vehicles will show up in the Hertz rental inventory as early as next month in major U.S. markets and select cities in Europe, according to the rental company.</p>
<p>The order will likely represent a notable portion of Teslas manufactured and delivered over the next 14 months. The EV maker delivered 499,550 vehicles in 2020, with the vast majority of these being its most popular Model 3 sedan. Production and deliveries have risen this year. Tesla delivered 627,572 through the first three quarters of 2021. The company produced around 624,582 vehicles in that same nine-month time period.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223284" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Hertz also announced plans to install thousands of chargers throughout its network to support the increase in EVs, in addition to a “premium and differentiated rental experience” for customers renting a Tesla that includes educating drivers on how to use and charge the car. Customers who rent a Tesla Model 3 will also have access to Tesla&#8217;s supercharging stations, infrastructure that is already under pressure in some locations as sales of the Tesla EVs skyrocket.</p>
<p>Tesla shares rose more than 5% following the news, pushing the stock price to $960 shortly after the market opened. Hertz stock also saw an 11% increase, to around $27.</p>
<p>Like other companies in the travel and tourism industry, Hertz had a rocky pandemic, with decreased rentals pushing the company to file for bankruptcy protection in May last year. The deal with Tesla comes just four months after Hertz <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/business/hertz-bankrupcty.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emerged from bankruptcy</a>, amidst a remarkable rebound for the rental car industry. Investment firms Knighthead Capital Management and Certares Management took over Hertz earlier this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based <a href="https://www.y42.com/">low-code data platform Y42</a> today announced that it has raised a $31 million Series A funding round co-led by Atomico and Insight Partners. La Famiglia, which led the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/no-code-business-intelligence-tool-y42-raises-2-9m-seed-round/">seed round</a>, and Data Community Fund also participated in this round, which brings the company&#8217;s total funding to date to just under $34 million.</p>
<p>Y42 wants to provide its users with an end-to-end data platform that can replace the various tools they are using today to integrate, transform, orchestrate and visualize their data. And yes, that means it wants to be able to give its users a single tool that can, for the most part, replace existing services like Fivetran, Airbyte, dbt and Tableau.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223016" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132959.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223016" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2223016" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132959.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="591" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132959.jpg 1459w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132959.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132959.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132959.jpg?resize=768,443 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132959.jpg?resize=680,392 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132959.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2223016" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Y42</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223013" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;It is a very crowded market,&#8221; Y42 under and CEO Hung Dang said. &#8220;But this is why the way we&#8217;re trying to approach this is by having a very different hypothesis than most point-to-point tools out there. [&#8230;] I come into this game with the mindset that I don&#8217;t care how long it takes me to build this product, but if I have a clean slate, how would I build this product? We are taking all the best practices of the modern data stack of these point-to-point tools, but apply them to one consistent platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>This means Y42 wants to give business intelligence teams and data analysts a single tool that helps them bridge the gap between doing some basic data analysis and hiring multiple full-time data engineers who can maintain a modern data stack. That&#8217;s an area where the company is winning a lot of new customers, but it also means that Y42 has to be able to scale with those users as they build up their data practices, something Dang is optimistic the company can do (especially given some of the features it has on its roadmap for next year).</p>

<p>“Every business leader today knows they need to extract more value from their data, but the data talent to adopt and maintain a modern stack is scarce; demand for data engineers is growing 50% annually. Y42 unlocks this bottleneck and democratizes access to data tools beyond a select few. In that, they are creating a new category.” said Atomico partner Irina Haivas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dang also noted that a number of bigger players in the industry, including the likes of Snowflake, are very interested in partnering with Y42. That&#8217;s in part because the service functions a bit like a gatekeeper for new customers who may not even yet have a data warehouse in use. Since Y42 itself sits on top of Google Cloud, BigQuery was always a natural recommendation for these customers, but it&#8217;s obviously not the only one.</p>
<p>The company currently has about 70 employees, up from 25 in March. Its customers include the likes of <a href="https://www.lifemd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.lifemd.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616452120912000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHGF1J01xU9lwGPsAn0hLL6Cn0QYg">LifeMD</a>, <a href="https://thepetlabco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://thepetlabco.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616452120912000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEDUzlxtUx7seE8InbBS4ZyKEtOFw">Petlab</a> and <a href="https://www.everdrop.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.everdrop.de/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616452120912000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGHLzJlfl3V1yIw8lWpDtwEF7ZeVw">Everdrop</a>. Unsurprisingly, Y42 plans to use the new funding to accelerate the development of its platform, scale its team and expand its go-to-market efforts. Y42 has already started building out a US-based team, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After already targeting verticals like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/19/amazon-launches-an-alexa-system-for-hotels/">hotels</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/amazon-launches-an-alexa-service-for-property-managers/">apartment complexes</a>, Amazon <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-brings-alexa-senior-living-communities-and-healthcare">announced</a> today it&#8217;s now rolling out new solutions for healthcare providers and senior living centers. The solutions, which are a part of Alexa Smart Properties, are designed specifically to meet the needs of deploying Alexa devices at scale and will allow the facility&#8217;s administrators to create customized experiences for their residents or patients.</p>
<p>In senior living centers, the residents would be able to use Alexa devices to call their family members and other loved ones, as well as keep up with the goings-on at their community and other community news. The devices could also be used to make announcements, allow the residents to communicate with each other through direct audio messages, make voice and video calls, and they can streamline other center activities &#8212; like check-ins, maintenance requests, and various administrative tasks. Amazon believes this could help make facilities more efficient and productive.</p>
<p>Amazon says senior living communities include Atria and Eskaton will integrate with its new solution.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223267" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The market for using Alexa in senior living communities was already being explored by third-party providers, like K4Connect, which last year<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/k4connect-a-startup-bringing-tech-to-senior-living-centers-closes-its-21m-series-b/"> closed on $21 million in Series B</a> funding to bring newer technologies, including Alexa&#8217;s voice assistance, to older adults and those living with disabilities. Companies like K4Connect and others, including Lifeline Senior Living, Aiva, and Vocera, can now tap into Alexa Smart Properties&#8217; tools and APIs to make it easier for them to roll out their own, customized solutions and software.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223278" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223278" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2223278" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg 2550w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223278" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amazon had already piloted putting Alexa in patient rooms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/25/cedars-sinai-puts-amazon-alexa-in-patient-rooms-as-part-of-a-pilot-program/">in a test with Cedars-Sinai,</a> which allowed patients to use voice commands for performing basic tasks, like changing TV channels, as well as communicating with caregivers. The idea was that, by offloading some of the everyday tasks to Alexa, it could free up nurses to focus more on medical care.</p>
<p>With Amazon&#8217;s new solution for hospitals, patients will be able to use Alexa to communicate with care staff, control the devices in their room, and stay entertained with news and music. Healthcare providers can also communicate with their patients using Alexa features like calling and Drop-In, without having to enter the patient rooms. This could also help hospitals be more productive and conserve their medical supplies and protective equipment like gloves, masks, and gowns, notes Amazon. (PPE shortages had been an ongoing issue in some locations as Covid spiked during the pandemic.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cedars-Sinai is among those officially rolling out the Alexa Smart Properties solution, following its pilot program, and is joined by BayCare and Houston Methodist, Amazon says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Voice is intuitive for patients, regardless of age or tech-savviness,&#8221; said Peachy Hain, executive director of Medical and Surgical Services at Cedars-Sinai, in a statement. &#8220;Since it&#8217;s so easy to operate, patients can use Alexa to connect with their care team and stay entertained as soon as they settle in, while care providers can streamline tasks to make more time to care for those patients. It&#8217;s a total gamechanger for enhancing our hospital experience,&#8221; Hain added.</p>
<p>Though Amazon has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/03/amazon-responds-to-a-u-s-senators-inquiry-confirms-alexa-voice-records-are-kept-indefinitely/">struggled</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/alexa-user-gets-access-to-1700-audio-files-from-a-stranger/">with</a> privacy issues related to its use of voice recordings and transcriptions, the healthcare and senior living center solutions will not save the voice recordings and don&#8217;t require users to share personal info with Alexa to use the device, the company explains. Users can also mute the Echo&#8217;s microphone at any time with the button on top. Amazon also claims it safeguards protected health information received through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/amazon-alexa-launches-its-first-hipaa-compliant-medical-skills/">HIPAA-eligible Alexa skill</a> interactions.</p>
<p>Amazon has been working to bring Alexa to healthcare facilities for some time. A report <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/10/amazon-is-building-a-health-and-wellness-team-within-alexa.html">in 2018 by CNBC</a> had said the company was building out a healthcare team with Alexa in order to make the voice assistant useful in the industry. This included working through the complex HIPAA regulations that would be required to do so. The following year, Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/amazon-alexa-launches-its-first-hipaa-compliant-medical-skills/">announced</a> its first HIPAA-compliant medical skills and began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/25/cedars-sinai-puts-amazon-alexa-in-patient-rooms-as-part-of-a-pilot-program/">piloting</a> its devices in hospitals. Elsewhere across Amazon, the company has invested in healthcare solutions in other ways, including through solutions like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/medical/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Comprehend Medical</a>, a machine learning tool that gathers information from things like doctors’ notes and patient health records, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/04/amazons-2018-acquisitions-totaled-1-65b-led-by-pillpack-and-ring/">acquisitions</a> like online pharmacy PillPack.</p>
<p>Both of the new Alexa Smart Properties solutions will roll out in the U.S. starting next month, Amazon says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Make way for yet another &#8216;quick-commerce&#8217; player in Europe&#8217;s heavily heating on-demand grocery space: <a href="https://popmarket.gr/?lang=en">Pop Market</a> is a Greek startup which launched last week in Athens &#8212; taking orders via and app and touting 15min delivery times and a curated selection of &#8220;thousands&#8221; of items (including fresh fruit and vegetables).</p>
<p>The seed round, which Pop Market claims is the country&#8217;s largest seed raise to date, was led by Global Founders Capital and 468 Capital.</p>
<p>TechCrunch can confirm the startup has raised $3.5 million in seed financing to push its vertically integrated, dark store-based on-demand grocery model in a country where it says online grocery shopping remains largely untapped.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223234" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Pop Market cites data indicating that grocery retail in Greece was valued at €11.3BN in 2020 &#8212; yet points to <a href="https://convertgroup.com/insight/greek-egrocery-2020/">analyst estimates</a> suggesting less than 2% (approximately €163.3M) is currently online, which it suggests reflects a &#8220;huge gap&#8221; between customer expectations and what existing solutions in the market offer, as a result of poor customer experience (such as long delivery times, high prices and wrong or missing items).</p>
<p>Squeezing that gap by delivering a slicker grocery service to Greeks &#8212; fulfilled through its own network of city center dark stores &#8212; is Pop Market&#8217;s first focus. Although it also claims it has international ambitions. (Albeit, it will be going up against a large number of very well resourced competitors elsewhere in Europe &#8212; depending on where it might seek to expand.)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;On-demand delivery app Glovo is spinning up a B2B logistics unit for super speedy urban delivery&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/on-demand-delivery-app-glovo-is-spinning-up-a-b2b-logistics-unit-for-super-speedy-urban-delivery/embed/#?secret=rMbey3Mpc8" data-secret="rMbey3Mpc8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Even on home soil Pop Market has Delivery Hero-owned efood to contend with (and Delivery Hero is now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/gorillas-grabs-close-to-1bn-series-c-values-the-on-demand-grocery-delivery-biz-at-2-1bn/">an investor in Berlin-based dark store operator Gorillas</a>). <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/wolt-closes-530m-round-to-continue-expanding-beyond-restaurant-delivery/">Finland&#8217;s Wolt</a> is also active in the market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The biggest players in this market today are efood and Wolt. While both offer groceries, mostly through partnerships with traditional chains, the reality is that their roots are deep in the restaurant food delivery industry which largely affects how customers perceive them today,&#8221; suggests Pop Market co-founder Nick Telecki.</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes Pop special is that we are 100% focused on offering the fastest delivery of grocery, convenience and retail products. Being the only fully-dedicated &#8216;Quick-Commerce&#8217; platform in the market is the only way to truly offer an unparalleled customer experience and capture consumer mindshare. Just look at Germany as an example, where Gorillas and Flink have grown tremendously in such a short amount of time, despite the presence of giants like Takeaway (Lieferando) and Wolt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Telecki argues that for on-demand groceries Greece is underserved vs &#8220;heated battlegrounds&#8221; in Western Europe, adding that its first focus will therefore be on its home market.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that online grocery penetration is only 2% presents a massive opportunity for us,&#8221; adds founder &amp; CEO Takis Malavetas. &#8220;If you look Greece holistically, the delivery market is much more mature compared to many other countries in Europe. When it comes to groceries specifically, there continues to be big gap between customer expectations and what existing solutions in the market offer, often including long delivery times, high prices and wrong or missing items. That makes groceries the last but largest piece of the retail puzzle that has yet to transition online.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having said that, the industry&#8217;s growth in the last few years has still been phenomenal with the first six months of 2021 up 150% compared to the year before. The biggest change we&#8217;ve been seeing in this online shift is that customers are breaking away from the planned weekly trip to the supermarket and are looking for more-frequent, yet smaller purchases. Those are habits that continue to be underserved in the market and our focus is to cover those daily occasional needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pop Market&#8217;s co-founders have prior experience in on-demand grocery delivery, with<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Malavetas having previously been involved in </span>setting up Home Run and Convibo in the UK, while Telecki was a member member of Delivery Hero&#8217;s global strategy team until recently.</p>
<p>If the pair can scale a domestic business fast enough they may see a chance to exit to a larger giant like Telecki&#8217;s former employer. But asked about this the startup kept its cards close to its chest, saying only: &#8220;We’ll evaluate any opportunities as they come, but our ultimate goal is on building a strong consumer business with best-in-class retention.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the seed funding will be used to spin up Pop Market&#8217;s domestic sprint, with a plan for rapid expansion across Greece &#8212; building out its nascent network of dark stores (it has four currently), scaling the supply chain and growing the team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It seems like every website has a chatbot of some kind to help answer simple questions without having to wait for a customer service representative. However, sometimes in the course of connecting it may take awhile, and as your attention shifts to something else, your time expires and you have to start all over again.</p>
<p><a href="https://atomchat.io/en/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AtomChat</a> is developing conversational artificial intelligence software focused on improving sales team performance by converting more via asynchronous messaging in WhatsApp. To accelerate its product development and international expansion plans, it secured $3.15 million in seed funding led by Mucker Capital, with participation from Techstars.</p>
<p>Erick Holmann and Rene Mouynes started the Panama City, Panama-based company in 2019 after working together for more than 15 years automating credit initiation processes for Citi and sales processes for telecommunications companies in Latin America.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222533" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>AtomChat is their third startup, and their previous outbound sales company was the inspiration, Holmann told TechCrunch. Today, a majority of people in Latin America skip shopping on the web and instead use a combination of apps like WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger, where 3.5 billion monthly users send 20 billion messages each month, he added.</p>
<p>“We saw conversational commerce with messaging was going to be to sales what browsers were to the internet in the 1990s,” he added. “If you have a question about a car, you engage with the dealer via messaging. Automation is what everyone wants, but needs to be more focused on customer services and the big gap is on the human side. Customers want more one-on-one time and assisted buying.”</p>
<p>The company enables its customers to connect ongoing conversations that take place over days, weeks or months so that any customer service representative has the history versus having to start over each time. Some of its customers were able to triple sales in a span of two months after implementing AtomChat, Holmann said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Andres Barreto, managing director of Techstars Boulder, met the company when they were part of the accelerator program last year and decided to back them.</p>
<p>While tools available were created by companies from the United States thinking in terms of U.S. consumers, Latin America, instead, is one of those regions where e-commerce skipped the web and went right to messaging apps, he said.</p>
<p>“Erick and Rene understand the world outside the U.S. is changing and it is leapfrogging technologies that just don&#8217;t work in Latin America,” Barreto added. “There is now a vast majority of spending through messaging and super apps catching on which is a huge opportunity for them.”</p>
<p>The infusion of new capital will be deployed into technology development as the company continues to grow 15% in revenue month over month.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, AtomChat has racked up an enterprise customer list across 14 countries that includes Toyota, Hyundai, Ford, GNC and Avis. For example, it saw over 15 million customers engage with messaging and 140 million messages sent through the platform.</p>
<p>“We are just getting started,” Holmann. “We aren’t trying to reinvent the wheel for sales teams, but enable them to handle conversations in an efficient manner.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The reaction among TechCrunch staff was swift and, best I can tell, universal. I don’t recall the last time I saw so many colleagues legitimately excited for one specific new feature. MagSafe is back. Not the iPhone version (not to say that isn’t without its own charm) &#8212; the original. The laptop version. The version that Apple unceremoniously abandoned in 2017, with the arrival of the all-USB-C/Thunderbolt MacBook.</p>
<p>This is, I fully recognize, a strange place to begin a lengthy review of a new Pro-focused laptop. MagSafe is hardly the most important arrival on the 2021 MacBook Pro. That distinction almost certainly belongs to the new M1 Pro and Max chips. But the proprietary connector is an important microcosm. It’s a crowd-pleaser for longtime devotees who have stuck with the line through port feast and port famine.</p>
<p>The new model isn’t a kitchen-sink laptop &#8212; Apple doesn’t really do kitchen-sink devices. But, in addition to the new features, it finds the company returning some old favorites that many in the community no doubt feared were long gone. As the MacBook has evolved, features have come and gone. “Courage,” as the company infamously phrased it, when it dropped the headphone jack, back in 2016. That’s one of many instances where Apple was clearly ahead of the curve. But that’s the thing about courage. It doesn’t always wind up the way you’d expect.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222780" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2222861" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222861" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2222861" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0523.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0523.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0523.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0523.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0523.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0523.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0523.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0523.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0523.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222861" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>We as the consumers both demand change while complaining about it. We’re tough to please. Sometimes, as in the case of the headphone jack and the disk drive before it, mainstream consumer use catches up, and for many, the features are hardly missed. Other times, the manufacturer was hasty. The move from USB-A to USB-C was clearly a sign of inevitable progress. But losing MagSafe hurt.</p>
<p>The connector is, happily, back &#8212; in improved form. It’s joined by an SD card slot (support for <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">SD 4.0 standard, UHS-I and UHS-II SDXC cards)</span>, HDMI port and a row of function keys (replacing the beleaguered Touch Bar), which are all but gone from the current Mac lineup (with last year’s 13-inch MacBook Pro serving as the final holdout).There are three USB-C ports on-board &#8212; down from four on 13-inch. One never wants to lose any ports, but many will no doubt view the return of HDMI and MagSafe as a fair tradeoff. Your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>Apple has made a concerted effort to recapture the creative pros who, for years, have been fundamental to its computer lineup. And in many ways, the new Pro models represent the purest manifestation of that. They’re powerful, hulking machines that look to the future of the Mac, while bringing back some hits from the past.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With a year of hindsight, it seems entirely plausible that last year’s 13-inch MacBook Pro will go down as a kind of curiosity, like the 2016 MacBook before it. The device is sticking around in the lineup for the time being, as a 13-inch sibling to the newly announced 14- and 16-inch models. It’s a strange fit. The truth of it is that the 13-inch MacBook has more common DNA with the Air it was introduced alongside &#8212; a MacBook Pro Lite or MacBook Air+, perhaps. It was clear then that the distinction wasn’t as pronounced as we’ve come to expect between the two models, and the arrival of this year’s Pro models have only served to highlight the gulf.</p>
<p>The heart of the product is, of course, Apple’s latest silicon. We expected a new chip in the lead up to this month’s Unleashed event, but Apple managed to surprise us by dropping two, the M1 Pro and M1 Max. Both are effectively souped-up versions of the M1 (built on the same 5nm architecture), and for most users in most scenarios, the differences between the two variants will be negligible. Heck, for most users in most scenarios, the regular old M1 will get the job done. But the core demo that Apple is going after here isn’t most users. It’s the creator class, the people who regularly push their systems to the limit with 3D rendering, 8K video editing and other activities that might have seemed a near impossibility on a laptop a decade back.</p>

<p>Quickly:</p>
<ul>
<li>M1: 16 billion transistors, 8 CPU cores, 7/8 GPU cores, 68.25 GBps memory bandwidth, 16GB max memory</li>
<li>M1 Pro: 33.7 billion transistors, 8/10CPU cores, 14/16 GPU cores, 200 GBps memory bandwidth, 32GB max memory</li>
<li>M1 Max: 57 billion transistors, 10CPU cores, 24/32 GPU cores, 400 GBps memory bandwidth, 64GB max memory</li>
</ul>
<p>After Apple unveiled the Pro and Max, the immediate question was how the company would divvy up the two chips. Ultimately, I think the company did the right thing here, offering the Max as an upgrade for both systems, at $200. These things add up fast, of course, but welcome to the Apple.com shopping cart. The company sent along the M1 Max with a 10-core PU and 32-core GPU, 64GB of RAM and 2TB of storage.</p>

<p>Memory options range from 16 to 64GB (the latter of which can only be had with the Max) and 512GB all the way up to 8TB. This system is $4,100 as configured. Bump it up to 8TB of storage and you get all the way up to $5,899 (if you go for the 16-inch, meanwhile, you can move the needle over $6,000). That’s a $3,900 premium over the $1,999 entry price.</p>

<p>The benchmark gains bear out the leap in specs. GeekBench’s single-core test for Apple Silicon didn’t see a massive gain, from 1711 on the 2020 MacBook Pro to 1781, but the multi-core score saw an impressive jump from 7549 to 12674.</p>

The GFXBench Metal graphics test, meanwhile, shows off the new GPU, jumping from 3490 frames (at 54.3 fps) to 7717.5 in the Aztec demo, and from 4981 frames (77.4 fps) to 17981 (279.6 fps) in the offscreen version. The system still lags some Nvidia GPUs in the former, but impressively outperforms others in the latter. What may be most remarkable among these numbers is the fact that Apple is capable of seeing big performance numbers with significantly less power consumption than much of the competition.</p>

<p>The notion that the system doesn’t get hot is overstated &#8212; the bottom of the aluminum case gets toasty, but what is true is that you’re going to have to really push this system to get those fans to kick in. The battery life is beefy on this thing well. I was able to squeeze out 17:29 hours of Apple TV+ playback on a charge (the new Velvet Underground documentary is good. I know because I watched it A LOT). The reintroduction of MagSafe, meanwhile, brings fast charging, getting the system from zero to 50% battery in half an hour (with the 96 or 140W power adapter). The system can still be charged via one of the three USB-C ports (great for those times when you inevitably leave the proprietary plug at home), albeit not as quickly, topping out at 100W.</p>
<p>The MagSafe plug comes with a nice new braided cable, but otherwise looks and functions remarkably similarly to the quick detaching plug we all know and mostly love.</p>
<p>The MacBook also gets a design change to match its new internals. The 16-inch, for instance is thicker and heavier than its predecessor, bumping from 4.3 to 4.7 pounds and increasing from 0.64 to 0.66 inches thick. The 14-inch, meanwhile, weighs 3.5 pounds compared to the 13-inch’s three, while maintaining the same thickness as its smaller sibling.</p>
<p>As someone who’s been carrying around the 2020 Air (on those occasions I actually leave my apartment), that’s not an insignificant difference. While my wild speculation questions the future of the 13-inch MacBook (at least in its current form), it’s hard to imagine the thinner, lighter Air going anywhere.</p>

<p>The 14.2-inch display is big and bright, at 3024 x 1964. That comes in at 254 ppi to the 13-inch’s 227. Last year’s 500 nit brightness has increased to 1,000 nits sustained and up 1,600 peak brightness. That comes courtesy of a mini-LED array, with a 120Hz refresh rate (which adapts to suit the task, courtesy of ProMotion technology). The underlying tech is similar to what we saw on the most recent iPad Pro &#8212; and to date, a handful of laptops.</p>

<p>Thankfully, in this era of remote work, the FaceTime camera gets an upgrade, following in the footsteps of this year’s new iMac with a 1080p camera. That’s a nice upgrade from the 720p models we got on last year’s Pro and Air, which largely relied on computational photography and improvements from the M1 to improve things like white balance and reduce image noise. As you can see above, it’s a pretty dramatic improvement over the camera on the most recent Air.</p>

<p>The bezels have been decreased by 24% over previous models. It’s not quite an edge-to-edge display, but it’s getting there. Along with that change came, perhaps, the most controversial addition, the dreaded notch. For a spirited assessment of the notch, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apple-notched-the-new-macbook-pro/">read Devin’s piece</a>. I’m mostly notch-agnostic, which is to say, obviously full screen would be best, but I also understand why they’re a thing. It’s something Apple has maintained on the iPhone since the introduction of the iPhone X four years ago.</p>
<p>As the company noted at the event the other week, &#8220;it&#8217;s a really smart way to give you more space for your content, and when you&#8217;re in full-screen mode, you have that 16:10 window, and it looks great. It&#8217;s seamless.&#8221; I will say for certain that&#8217;s going to take some getting used to.</p>
<p>Other mobile companies have moved toward pinholes and, even in some cases, under-screen cameras. The latter has largely been a mess, dramatically impacting image quality. Something you definitely don’t want on your webcam in the era of the Zoom call. Effectively the inclusion of the notch means additional screen real estate up top where the bezel would otherwise be. Most of the time, it’s nothing a good, dark background can’t mask, or in the case of full-screen video, letter box bars.</p>
<p>It can, however, be a nuisance in full-screen mode, particularly in the case of apps with intensive menu systems. The menu bar automatically wraps around the notch. Developers don’t need to anything, it simply moves the menu bar items down so as not to be obscured. This was the case with Audacity, which has yet to even release an Apple silicon version, let alone develop for that brand new notch. The pointer, meanwhile, effectively passes under the notch when you scroll past.</p>
<p>If you need more than just a 14-inch display (don&#8217;t we all, sometimes?), the Pro chip is capable of supporting <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">two Pro Display XDRs. With the Max, you can run </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Pro Display XDRs and a 4K TV. The reintroduced HDMI port supports </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">4K60 and HDR video. </span></p>

<p>The keyboard has been something of a sore spot for the MacBook line over the last several years. Thankfully, the company eventually returned to a mechanism that worked last year, after horror stories of stuck keys and an eventual keyboard replacement program. The current configuration tends toward the softer side of the laptop keyboard spectrum, but it’s light years beyond the rocky missteps of a few years back.</p>
<p>Whether the Touch Bar qualifies as a “rocky misstep” itself is a question of perspective, but it seems pretty clear that it fell short of Apple’s expectations. Having a super thin touch display over the keys is an interesting idea in theory, but I don’t know many people who regularly interacted with it. It was one of those things you wanted to like, but ultimately never offered up enough reasons to justify its continued existence. Which is to say that I, for one, am not sad to see it go.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222863" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222863" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2222863" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0559.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0559.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0559.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0559.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0559.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0559.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0559.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0559.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0559.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222863" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>It’s too early to mourn its death completely, as it continues to hang on to the 13-inch MacBook for dear life, but, well, the future doesn’t look particularly bright for that input device. In its place, the full-height function keys are back, and leave it to Apple to position their return as a great new feature. As the company writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the first time, Magic Keyboard brings a full‑height function key row to MacBook Pro — with the tactile feel of mechanical keys that pros love.</p></blockquote>
<p>The keys include brightness, dictation, volume, Spotlight, Siri, Do Not Disrupt and music play back. It also maintains what was always the best part of the Touch Bar: Touch ID. This time it&#8217;s a full-size key, rather than the nub that you get on last year&#8217;s Air.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222860" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222860" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2222860" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0515.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0515.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0515.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0515.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0515.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0515.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0515.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0515.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0515.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222860" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Much like the return of MagSafe, the abandonment of the Touch Bar is a prime example of why the new MacBooks are the best in years. They build on the technologies and learnings of previous generations introduce some key breakthroughs and, perhaps, most importantly, listened to user feedback. That means moving on from what doesn’t work and doubling down on what does, and above all, not ever assuming you know what’s best for the consumer &#8212; particularly in the case of extremely particular creative pros.</p>
<p>Priced between $1,999 and $5,899, this is very much not the MacBook for everyone. For most consumers, the MacBook Air gets the job done &#8212; and then some. But if you’re someone who regularly finds yourself pushing your machine to the limits, the new Pro is a great marriage of the line’s best elements.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bild, which came out of private beta, is streamlining the design review process so that hardware product releases can be developed faster.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Pradyut Paul was a hardware engineering program manager at Apple, he saw firsthand the challenges of building and sharing hardware products using antiquated tools like email and spreadsheets.</p>
<p>It was after spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on expedited shipping after some designs were delayed that Paul realized there had to be a better way of engaging with other teams to develop hardware faster and validate more designs.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222724" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222724" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2222724" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Picture1-1.png?w=680" alt="Bild" width="680" height="462" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Picture1-1.png 745w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Picture1-1.png?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Picture1-1.png?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Picture1-1.png?resize=680,462 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Picture1-1.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222724" class="wp-caption-text">Bild co-founders Pradyut Paul and Avinash Kunaparaju. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bild</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222715" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>He left Apple and started <a href="https://www.getbild.com/">Bild</a> in 2020, with CTO Avinash Kunaparaju and COO Derrick Choi, to put this type of collaboration into the cloud so that teams across an organization would be able to more easily review design processes leading to faster product releases.</p>
<p>“We came up with the idea of moving the engagements to the cloud,” Paul told TechCrunch. “It is more than just back-and-forth, but there are so many stakeholders involved and the communication repository is essentially the inbox.”</p>
<p>Today, the company announced a $3 million seed round to build out its team in the areas of customer acquisition, sales and marketing and to continue product development, like building a self-service experience for new users. Tola Capital led the raise and was joined by Lux Capital, Shasta Ventures, Counterview Capital, Frontier Ventures and Techstars.</p>
<p>Users can use Bild’s web-based viewers to interact with 3D CAD, board files, bill-of-materials, schematics, drawings and simulation data. Traditionally, this was accomplished via sharing of screenshots and face-to-face meetings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other companies are tackling some of the individual pain points, like design review management specifically for mechanical engineers or collaborating on files, but Paul believes that Bild is the only one taking into account all of those, but across an entire company.</p>
<p>“People don’t have the same teams, so it is difficult to provide visibility,” he added. “One of the things we look at is the future of hardware and how it will be more connected to software and how to create an environment of collaboration with both.”</p>
<p>Bild was in private beta testing with 25 companies, but with the announcement of the funding round, the software is now publicly available. It has converted some of the early customers to paying customers, but is still figuring out pricing strategies, Paul said.</p>

<p>Next up, the company is working on launching a visual disk and different ways to show visibility of CAD models to close the gaps between what it looks like in-person versus on the computer.</p>
<p>Akshay Bhushan, principal at Tola Capital, says the hardware market is a $50 billion to $70 billion industry that is still going through digitalization. Large companies, for example Autodesk, had walled off the space, but with more people working remotely, hardware and software is beginning to meld, he added.</p>
<p>“Bild is solving a problem every engineer would have and making pain points joyful,” Bhushan said. “Pradyut and Avinash are customer-obsessed and saw these problems that were also being recognized by the customer. All had different names for the same kind of email and process tracking and saw the value and the opportunity in what Bild is doing.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The Facebook Papers, a vast trove of documents supplied by whistleblower Frances Haugen to a consortium of news organizations has been released. The reporting, by <em>Reuters</em>, <em>Bloomberg</em>, <em>The Washington Post</em> and others, paints a picture of a company that repeatedly sought to prioritize dominance and profit over user safety. This was, however, despite a large number of employees warning that the company’s focus on engagement put users at risk of real-world violence.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/25/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-whistleblower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, for instance, claims that while Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg played down reports that the site amplified hate speech in testimony to Congress, he was aware that the problem was far broader than publicly declared. Internal documents seen by the <em>Post</em> claim that the social network had removed less than five percent of hate speech, and that executives — including Zuckerberg — were well aware that Facebook was polarizing people. The claims have already been rebutted by Facebook, which says that the documents have been misrepresented.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg is also accused of squashing a plan to run a Spanish-language voter-registration drive in the US before the 2020 elections. He said that the plan may have appeared “partisan,” with WhatsApp staffers subsequently offering a watered-down version partnering with outside agencies. The CEO was also reportedly behind the decision not to clamp down on COVID-19 misinformation in the early stages of the pandemic as there may be a “material tradeoff with MSI [Meaningful Social Interaction — an internal Facebook metric] impact.” Facebook has refuted the claim, saying that the documents have been mischaracterized.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223237" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-knew-about-failed-police-abusive-content-globally-documents-2021-10-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><em>Reuters</em></a> reported that Facebook has serially neglected a number of developing nations, allowing hate speech and extremism to flourish. That includes not hiring enough staffers who can speak the local language, appreciate the cultural context and otherwise effectively moderate. The result is that the company has unjustified faith in its automatic moderation systems which are ineffective in non-English speaking countries. Again, Facebook has refuted the accusation that it is neglecting its users in those territories.</p>
<p>One specific region that is singled out for concern is Myanmar, where Facebook has been held responsible for amplifying local tensions. A 2020 document suggests that the company’s automatic moderation system could not flag problematic terms in (local language) Burmese. (It should be noted that, two years previously, Facebook’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-06-facebook-myanmar-bsr-report.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">failure to properly act to prevent civil unrest in Myanmar</a> was highlighted in a report from Business for Social Responsibility.)</p>
<p>Similarly, Facebook reportedly did not have the tools in place to detect hate speech in the Ethiopian languages of Oromo or Amharic. Facebook has said that it is working to expand its content moderation team and, in the last two years, has recruited Oromo, Amharic and Burmese speakers (as well as a number of other languages).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/25/technology/facebook-like-share-buttons.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, reports that Facebook’s internal research was well-aware that the Like and Share functions — core elements of how the platform work — had accelerated the spread of hate speech. A document, titled What Is Collateral Damage, says that Facebook’s failure to remedy these issues will see the company “actively (if not necessarily consciously) promoting these types of activities.” Facebook says that, again, these statements are based on incorrect premises, and that it would be illogical for the company to try and actively harm its users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/facebook-files-show-growth-struggles-as-young-users-in-u-s-decline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, meanwhile, has focused on the supposed collapse in Facebook’s engagement metrics. Young people, a key target market for advertisers, are spending less time on Facebook’s platform, with fewer teens opting to sign up. At the same time, the number of users may be artificially inflated in these age groups, with users choosing to create multiple accounts — “Finstas” — to separate their online personas to cater to different groups. Haugen alleges that Facebook “has misrepresented core metrics to investors and advertisers,” and that duplicate accounts are leading to “extensive fraud” against advertisers. Facebook says that it already notifies advertisers of the risk that purchases will reach duplicate accounts in its Help Center, and lists the issue in its SEC filings.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.axios.com/clegg-facebook-exec-bad-headlines-whistleblower-documents-9acbf8c8-94c1-4ce6-97f0-0cf03b1bc7c0.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1"><em>Axios</em></a> reported that Facebook’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-19-facebook-hires-tarnished-uk-politician-to-fix-its-reputation.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">Sir Nick Clegg</a> warned that the site should expect “more bad headlines” in the coming weeks. Between the material available in the Facebook Papers, another round of Frances Haugen’s testimony in the UK later today and rumors of more whistleblowers coming forward, it’s likely that Facebook will remain in the headlines for some time.</p>
