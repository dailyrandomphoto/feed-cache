										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the technology byproducts of the Covid-19 pandemic is that it has raised the game for businesses to have better digital tools in place to interface with customers, and their own work, to get things done. Today, a company called <a href="https://getjobber.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jobber</a>, which has built a platform doing just that for a particular segment of the market &#8212; home services professionals &#8212; is announcing a round of funding as it finds its business growing.</p>
<p>The Canadian startup has picked up $60 million in funding. The equity round being led by Summit Partners, with participation also from previous backers OMERS Ventures and Version One Ventures, and new investors Tech Pioneers Fund.</p>
<p>Jobber&#8217;s platform is focused around management software to help sole-traders and small home services businesses make appointments and organize their schedules, set up billing and manage their accounts, and market their services online. The funding round comes at a time when Jobber already some 100,000 customers across 47 countries and 50 service segments, including cleaning, electrical repairs, landscaping, plumbing and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That is but a small piece of the opportunity: Jobber estimates that home services and other tradespeople make up a workforce of some 5 million in the U.S. alone, contributing over $550 billion to the economy annually.</p>
<p>Jobber&#8217;s rise comes at a key moment not just in the macroeconomic sense but also in the world of technology.</p>
<p>A vast swathe of businesses in a number of sectors &#8212; for example, finance, HR, medicine, commerce, education, and more &#8212; have spent decades adopting digital services to get their work done, a trend that has seen a big acceleration in the last year and the added intricacies that the coronavirus has brought to the working world.</p>
<p>But within that trend, one of the last holdouts has been the small business owner, and specifically those that work in very &#8220;hands-on&#8221; areas like home services, with many of them using mobile phones but little else in the way of technology to advertise themselves or run their operations.</p>
<p>That has seen a notable shift in the last year. Consumers are more than ever before using the internet to do business &#8212; whether that involves discovering companies or paying for goods and services &#8212; and tradespeople have found themselves also turning in that direction, not just to meet the changing demands of consumers, but also to keep themselves safe and in business. On top of that, the population of tradespeople themselves is getting younger and more digitally-native, and they are adopting and using these tools more naturally than their predecessors.</p>
<p>Jobber&#8217;s growth, said CEO Sam Pillar (who co-founded the company with Forrest Zeisler, CTO) in an interview, is &#8220;being driven by a number of factors, not just the ages of homeowners but also the providers of these services.&#8221; He added that many of the kinds of services that home services people provide &#8212; home repairs, our housekeeping, are not typically the kind that disappear with a pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those two trends meant that home services professionals performed better than you would expect in the economy, and so did we,&#8221; Pillar said. &#8220;The younger generation of business owners starting or taking over companies are looking to figure out they will use to manage what is otherwise a mass of paper.&#8221; So offering them solutions that are user-friendly also makes a difference, he said.. &#8220;Even if they are comfortable with technology, they are busy,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Jobber&#8217;s funding comes as part of a bigger trend of startups building services for later adopters in the B2B world also getting a boost in their business &#8212; and attention from VCs.</p>
<p>They include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/hover-secures-60m-for-a-3d-imaging-platform-used-to-assess-and-fix-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hover</a>, building technology and a wider set of tools for home repair people to source materials, make pricing and work estimates, and run the administration of their businesses, which secured $60 million in November. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/gosite-snags-40m-to-help-smbs-bring-their-businesses-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoSite</a> in December raised $40 million for a platform to help all kinds of SMBs &#8212; key factor being that many of them are coming online for the first time &#8212; build out and run their businesses.</p>
<p>The connecting thread with all three is the fact that they are tapping not just into wider &#8220;digital transformation&#8221; trends, but that the need for their particular services has really come into focus especially in the last year.</p>
<p>“We believe the home service category is in the early stages of a significant digital transformation – and Jobber is paving the way for thousands of small and mid-sized services businesses that are working to incorporate digital tools in order to keep pace with customer expectations,” said Colin Mistele, Principal at Summit Partners, in a statement. “The Jobber team blends strong product vision, data-driven market perspective and a customer-centric approach—a powerful combination that we believe will support the company’s continued rapid growth. We are thrilled to partner with the Jobber team – and we are excited about the future of this category.” Mistele is joining the board with this round.</p>
<p>The company is not disclosing its valuation and had raised just $16 million before this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Moving forward, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/yelp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="yelp">Yelp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> users won&#8217;t just be asked whether a business has good food or accepts credit cards — the platform is also allowing them to share feedback on whether the staff is wearing masks and enforcing social distancing.</p>
<p>Yelp&#8217;s head of consumer product Akhil Kuduvalli Ramesh suggested that this is the next phase of how the company is trying to help local businesses, after allowing them to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/yelp-virtual-services/">highlight virtual services</a>, manage their waitlists in accordance with new regulations and indicate <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/yelp-adds-new-features-for-reopening-businesses/">the health and safety measures that they&#8217;re taking</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s one thing to see that a business claims to have strict mask-wearing and social distancing procedures, and another to hear other customers confirm that it&#8217;s true (or not). So Ramesh said it&#8217;s less about warning users away from certain businesses and more working &#8220;to continue to instill confidence in consumers to continue to connect with and support local businesses.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When users visit a business profile they&#8217;ll now be asked whether social distancing was enforced and whether the staff wore masks — Ramesh said other health and safety questions could be added in the future (and users can offer slightly more detailed feedback on safety measures by hitting the Edit button in a profile), but those are the ones that users seem to care about the most.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094963" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094963" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2094963" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg?w=680" alt="Yelp health and safety" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg 2808w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Compliant-and-Noncompliant-Health-Safety_Restaurant-Example.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094963" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yelp</p></div></p>
<p>When Yelp receives enough answers to offer present meaningful data (the company, understandably, isn&#8217;t disclosing the exact threshold), it will add a message in the health and safety section of the profile: “Social distancing enforced according to most users” with a green checkmark, or &#8220;Social distancing might not be enforced according to most users&#8221; with an orange question mark, with similar messages for mask-wearing.</p>
<p>In cases where the responses are mixed, but there&#8217;s still &#8220;significant&#8221; feedback indicating that these practices aren&#8217;t followed, the message will be attributed to &#8220;some users&#8221; instead.</p>
<p>Ramesh said that Yelp has already been collecting this user feedback, and at launch, only &#8220;a couple hundred&#8221; of the millions of businesses on Yelp will be marked with an orange label, &#8220;which also means that many businesses are doing the right thing.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094961" style="width: 425px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094961" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2094961" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GIF-of-Consumer-Feedback_Edit-Button-Flow.gif?w=415" alt="GIF of Yelp Consumer Feedback" width="415" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094961" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yelp</p></div></p>
<p>He noted that in cases of multi-location businesses, the health and safety data will be specific to each location. Also, the labels will be based on feedback from the past 28 days — so if a business gets an orange label but starts doing better, their profile should eventually be updated to reflect that.</p>
<p>In addition, Yelp says it&#8217;s adding new service offerings and safety measures that businesses can include on their profiles, including checking staff for symptoms, disposable or contactless menus, heated outdoor seating and covered outdoor seating.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One year in, the Covid-19 global health pandemic continues to have something of a dragging effect on many aspects of life, but today a key bellwether for how technology is developing underscored how the industry continues to march on. The number of patents granted in the US in 2020 totaled 352,013, representing a decline of just under 1% compared to the year before (the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/us-patents-hit-record-333530-granted-in-2019-ibm-samsung-not-the-faangs-lead-the-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">final tally</a> for 2019 was 354,428 patents granted).</p>
<p>At the same time, patent applications rose almost 5% last year, a sign of how future years will likely see a boost in numbers again, according to <a href="https://www.ificlaims.com/rankings-trends-2020.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">figures from IFI Claims Patent Services</a>, which tracks applications and trends in patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. As with previous years, IBM led the pack in terms of number of patents granted in the year, but Samsung, in aggregate, continues to hold the most patents of any company.</p>
<p>“Overall, U.S. patent activity was down slightly last year, despite the pandemic. This is a minor downward tick in what’s been a largely upward trajectory we’ve seen over the past decade, and it’s still 13 percent higher than what we saw in 2018,” said Mike Baycroft, CEO of IFI CLAIMS Patent Services, in a statement. “Another positive indicator is that published pre-grant applications saw a nominal increase in 2020. But we’ll have to wait at least another year before we can determine if the pandemic had any impact.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Patents, and lawsuits related to the infringing of them, have been part of a bigger theme for a number of years in the world of technology, with companies like Apple and Samsung, and Oracle and Google, using these against each other as an analogue for their larger commercial competition.</p>
<p>While the heyday of employing those tactics appear to be mostly over, at least for the moment, patents still play a vital role as an indicator of the way that tech is developing: they point to the pace of innovation, who is taking the lead in that on a foundational basis, and what kinds of areas are driving the future of tech in a more general sense.</p>
<p>In that regard, 2020&#8217;s numbers tell us that Samsung continues to keep a very wide margin when it comes to overall number of patents. The company now has <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">80,577 patents in total, up 5 percent more than in the year before. It has a very large margin still over the second-biggest patent holder. IBM currently holds 38,541 patents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">To be sure, in terms of activity in the last year, IBM leads the pack still when it comes to the most patents secured in 2020, with </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">9,130 grants, although this declined 1% compared to a year ago. Samsung was granted 6,415 patents at number two, with Canon Inc., Microsoft, Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor, LG Electronics, Apple, Huawei Technologies, and Qualcomm making up the rest of the top-10 list.</span></p>
<p>Google, Facebook, Amazon (number 11 at 2,244 patents), Google (17 with 1,817 patents) and Facebook (38 with 938 patents) all also made the top 50 patent recipients this year.</p>
<h2>Technology trends</h2>
<p>While the concept of patents has a long history that predates the rise of consumer electronics, they have seen an ineluctable shift away from physical systems and hardware, and towards the services that run on these, over time. In the last year, the top two most popular technology classes patented, IFI said, were electrical digital data processing and transmission of digital information &#8212; the generic names that underpin software and and how information and data are stored and processed.</p>
<p>Interestingly, IFI found that &#8220;computer systems based on biological models&#8221; was the fastest-growing technology on the list, up 67% last year compared to its growth between 2016 and 2020. The category points to the ongoing and huge interest in artificial intelligence, where areas like neural networking and other tech processes based on the mechanics of the human brain continue to be in hot demand, with Google, Microsoft and Intel all major patent winners in the area, IFI said. Alongside that aspect of AI, it said that machine learning, quantum computing, autonomous technology and 3D printing also saw big increases.</p>
<p>As a point of comparison, last year medical and biological technologies figured very strongly, with areas like <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">hybrid plant creation topping the list of trending technology, and CRISPR gene-editing and cancer therapies also figuring strongly. It&#8217;s interesting that in a year with a global health pandemic, and unprecedented medical research taking place in the race to find remedies and vaccines, we have seen little of that play out in patents granted, although I&#8217;m guessing the results would be different if considering what is being filed. It will be worth watching how this plays out in coming years, along with other trends that made themselves very prominent in the last year, such as e-commerce and cloud computing. </span></p>
<p>Interestingly, despite the regulatory and public perception setbacks faced by companies like Juul, electrical smoking devices still saw an increase of 55% in terms of patents filed last year. This indicates that there is still going to be a lot of development in the area as traditional smoking continues to be scrutinised and decline, but clearly the addiction does not.</p>
<p>Top 50 list for 2020, according to IFI Claims:</p>
<p>1 IBM 9130<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://launchub.com/">LAUNCHub Ventures</a>, an early-stage European VC which concentrates mainly on Central Eastern (CEE) and South-Eastern Europe (SEE), has completed the first closing of its new fund at €44 million ($53.5M), with an aspiration to reach a target size of €70 million. A final close is expected by Q2 2021.</p>
<p>Its principal backer is the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/european-investment-fund" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="european-investment-fund">European Investment Fund, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> corporates and a number of Bulgarian tech founders and investors.</p>
<p>With this new fund, LAUNCHub aims to invest in 25 startups in the next 4 years. The initial investment range will be between €500K and €2M in verticals such as B2B SaaS, Fintech, Proptech, Big Data, AI, Marketplaces, Digital Health. The fund will also actively invest in the Web 3.0 / Blockchain space, as it has done so since 2014.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>LAUNCHub has also achieved a 50:50 gender split in its team, with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/irinadimitrovacfa/">Irina Dimitrova</a> being promoted to operating partner while <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rayayu/">Raya Yunakova</a> who joins as an Investor, previously working for PiLabs in London and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mirela-yordanova-4168b951/">Mirela Yordanova</a> joins as an Associate, previously leading the startup community at Google for Startups Campus in London.</p>
<p>The investor is mining a rich view of highly skilled developers in the CEE countries where there are approximately 1.3 developers for every 100 people in the workforce. “Central and Eastern Europe&#8217;s rapid economic growth has caught the attention of Western investors searching for the next unicorn. The region has huge and still untapped potential with more and more local success stories, paving the way for the next generation of CEE tech founders.” said Todor Breshkov, Founding Partner at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/launchub" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="launchub">LAUNCHub Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>LAUNCHub Ventures competes with other investors like Earlybird in the region, but they tend to invest at a later stage and is more typically a co-investor with LAUNCHub.  Nearby Greece also features Greek funds such as Venture Friends and Marathon, but these tend to focus on their core country and diaspora entrepreneurs. Others include Speedinvest (usually focused on DACH) and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/credo-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="credo-ventures">Credo Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> more focused on the Czech Republic and CEE.</p>
<p>LAUNCHub partner and cofounder Stefan Grantchev told me: “Our strategy is to be regional, not to focus specifically on Bulgaria &#8211; but to look at all the opportunities in the region of South-Eastern Europe.”</p>
<p>LAUNCHub Ventures has backed companies including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Giraffe360 (Robotic camera for real estate listing automation, co-investment with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hoxton-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hoxton-ventures">Hoxton Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and HCVC)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fite (Premium direct to consumer digital live streaming for sports, followed-on by Earlybird)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GTMHub (The world’s leading and most intuitive OKR software, followed-on by CRV)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FintechOS (Banking and Insurance middleware for automation and digital innovation acceleration, followed-on by Earlybird and OTB)</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Cleanshelf (Enterprise SaaS management and optimization platform, followed-on by Dawn Capital)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roughly eight years ago, investors Mark Kvamme and Chris Olsen left Silicon Valley to open a venture firm, <a href="https://www.drivecapital.com/">Drive Capital</a>, in Columbus, Ohio. It wasn&#8217;t an easy decision. Leaving California wasn&#8217;t exactly fashionable at the time. In fact, While Olsen had grown up in Cincinnati, the Yale grad had landed at Sequoia Capital a couple of years out of college &#8212; a dream job &#8212; and had no interest in going anywhere. Meanwhile, Kvamme is a California native who attended UC Berkeley, grew up immersed in the world of startups (his dad was <a href="https://computerhistory.org/profile/floyd-kvamme/">also a VC)</a>, and cofounded four companies before himself landing at Sequoia, where among his deals, he led the firm&#8217;s investment in LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Even after a series of developments would lead them to take the leap, the early ride was bumpy. There was no venture community. Midwestern startups were still few and far between. More, Kvamme, first lured to Ohio by his longtime friend <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/22/937816320/former-ohio-gov-john-kasich-says-gop-is-afraid-of-trump">John Kasich</a> to take an economic development job that he thought would be temporary, was soon deemed a little too cozy with the state&#8217;s <a href="https://www.strictlyvc.com/2013/11/03/former-sequoia-partner-mark-kvamme-center-controversy/">power players</a>.</p>
<p>Looking back now, it&#8217;s a wonder they stayed. Yet it&#8217;s because they did that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kolumbus" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kolumbus">Columbus <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is primed for more VCs to join them, they convincingly argue. Indeed, Drive, which now manages $650 million and features nine investors, is receiving interest from 7,000 startups each year, and some of its portfolio companies are beginning to break out. The very first company to attract a check from Drive, an eight-year-old, Columbus-based hospital software maker called Olive AI, was assigned a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-01/hospital-software-maker-olive-ai-reaches-1-5-billion-value">$1.5 billion valuation</a> just last month in a funding round led by Tiger Global. Another investment, in the five-year-old car insurance startup Root, also appears promising. Root, which <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2020/10/28/588450.htm">went public in November</a>, currently boasts a market cap of $4.7 billion, and Drive owns 26.6% of the company. (Olsen says it hasn&#8217;t sold a share.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We talked late last week with Kvamme and Olsen about what they are building &#8212; and why VCs who may be thinking about leaving California for Austin or Miami might pay more attention. You can hear that conversation in <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/former-sequoia-vcs-move-to-the-midwest-starts-to-pay-off/id1498270180?i=1000504803510">full here</a>. In the meantime, following are some excerpts from our chat edited lightly for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Everyone is threatening to ditch California. What&#8217;s the argument for heading to Columbus? How did Mark convince you to join him, Chris?</strong></p>
<p>CO: The early case that Mark made is: there&#8217;s an enormous amount of money that&#8217;s spent on research here. In Silicon Valley, the venture dollars ratio to research dollars is massively too many VC dollars for too little research; the opposite is true here in Ohio. This is more what Silicon Valley looked like in the late 1990s.</p>
<p>At first, I was like, &#8220;Nope, not falling for it. There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m believing that data. It&#8217;s a terrible idea&#8221; to move. But I was very much a numbers guy &#8212; still am &#8212; and when I started looking at the data, [I could see the] economy of Ohio is bigger than Turkey. The economy of the Midwest would be the fourth-biggest economy in the world. It&#8217;s bigger than Brazil. It&#8217;s bigger than Russia. It&#8217;s bigger than India. And it has this legacy educational infrastructure that&#8217;s been producing more engineers than any other corner of the planet. It was kind of like, wait a minute. If this thesis is right, maybe emerging markets <em>are</em> the most compelling place for venture capitalists to invest. But maybe the most compelling emerging market is America, just outside of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p><strong>TC: I imagine that you had your pick of companies when you first launched Drive. Is that true and has that changed in this new COVID era, when everybody is striking deals online? Who is showing up that you didn&#8217;t see a few years ago?</strong></p>
<p>CO: It might surprise you but we actually didn&#8217;t have our pick of the companies when we first got here, largely because it was unusual to be a venture capitalist. In Ohio, there just aren&#8217;t a lot of them. And so a lot of entrepreneurs were in non-obvious places. Unlike in Silicon Valley, where you have entrepreneurs sign up on this superhighway of capital, where you go from Y Combinator to the seed investor and then to the A investor, that infrastructure didn&#8217;t exist here. What was a little bit surprising to us was how much we ended up having to work to originate investment opportunities here in the Midwest and not because people weren&#8217;t here but because that kind of activity just hasn&#8217;t been built yet.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve had to spend a lot of time going into the universities and putting new seed managers in business and helping them fundraise and sort of building all of this infrastructure from scratch so that the next entrepreneur is out here [versus moves away], and it works. In our first year, we had inbound interest from 1,800 [startups], then it went to about 3,000 and now it&#8217;s up to about 7,000, which is more than I&#8217;ve heard any other venture firms say that they see in California. And I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s because we&#8217;re great. I think that&#8217;s more [a reflection of the] scale of the opportunity that&#8217;s here now. One of the things that we would love to see more of is more venture capitalists coming here, because there&#8217;s certainly more opportunity than we can invest in.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You don&#8217;t worry that you&#8217;ve teed up the market for other VCs to come and steal your deals?</strong></p>
<p>MW: Not at all. I&#8217;m the old guy here, so I remember when Sequoia was started in 1972; my father worked with Don Valentine and National Semiconductor, and it was then Kleiner, Perkins, NEA, [just] a couple of firms. And what happens is you create this network effect. And the more capital, the more folks [who are building stuff in close proximity to you]. Right now, if we don&#8217;t invest in a Series A, there&#8217;s a couple of local folks, but primarily, [that capital has] got to come from the coasts.</p>
<p>CO: My attitude is, &#8216;Come on [over] because the worst thing that is happening right now is that I know for sure there are multibillion-dollar investments that are not getting made still because they&#8217;re based here. The problem that we have right now is [that] a Redpoint comes in and invests in one company in Ann Arbor, or Benchmark comes into this one company in Indianapolis, or, Sequoia comes in [for a deal here or there] but they aren&#8217;t making this their primary business. And until we see more venture capitalists showing up here saying, &#8220;This is all I do every single day,&#8221; I fear that that next opportunity that we&#8217;re missing won&#8217;t get its funding. We&#8217;re just out of whack in terms of the number of opportunities versus the number of venture capitalists here . . .</p>
<p>[Also] some of the very best investments in Silicon Valley are done with venture firms that can partner and then entrepreneurs have access to a larger Rolodex, a larger pool of capital, more diversity of thought &#8212; all the things that they need to grow their business.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re competing with other hotspots like Austin for attention. Make the case for Columbus specifically.</strong></p>
<p>MW: If you put a circle around Columbus, a one-day car drive, you&#8217;re talking about 60% of the GDP of American, over 50% or 60% of the population, and [access to] a huge percentage of all the top customers. Columbus is in the middle of it all. What we&#8217;re able to do then is easily travel to Chicago and Indianapolis and Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Cincinnati; it&#8217;s a quick flight to Minneapolis, and so on and so forth. And the Midwest is a spectacular place to build companies.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Drive&#8217;s team includes a director of engineering and several software engineers. Why?</strong></p>
<p>CO: One of the things you learn very quickly that&#8217;s different about the Midwest is, it&#8217;s not a city; it&#8217;s a nation. And you have to set up your infrastructure differently if you&#8217;re going to be successful investing into that nation [because] there&#8217;s just a lot of ground cover.</p>
<p>One of the things that we have been able to do is to look at venture capital and say, &#8220;Look, there are a lot of rote, repetitive tasks that venture capitalists do, and what if we could eliminate those tasks, so that we don&#8217;t need to hire the boiler room of Ivy League grads to cold call the entire phone book and annoy all the entrepreneurs and do all that kind of stuff. We can do more homework in an automated fashion.&#8221; So that was kind of the idea that we had. And so we built this software platform that we&#8217;re able to use now to not only identify which entrepreneurs have the highest probability of turning into an investment but also [who are] the people for our portfolio companies who have the highest probability of joining a certain startup, or, which venture capitalists have the highest probability of investing in that follow-on round of capital.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You had the chance to reinvent the VC model when you started your own firm. Are there any things that you did in setting up Drive that were different than what you&#8217;d experienced at Sequoia?</strong></p>
<p>MK: We were very fortunate to have worked at Sequoia. Sequoia is by far the best firm out there, in my opinion. And we often use the phrase, What would Sequoia do? And we built a lot of things around that. But we weren&#8217;t Sequoia, so there were many things that we had to do that Sequoia had maybe done 40 or 50 years ago  but today doesn&#8217;t have to do. That includes building a lot of these capabilities Chris had mentioned before, building some of the infrastructure, helping lawyers understand how to do Series A term sheets or finding headhunters.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also not in a situation where everyone is coming into the office [unlike at Sequoia]; they see a lot of wonderful companies that just ring them up. That&#8217;s why we had to be very focused on our outbound efforts. So I&#8217;d say that 60% to 70% of what we&#8217;ve done, we learned at Sequoia, but the rest we had to make specific to what we&#8217;re doing here at Drive.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How big a net are you casting geographically?</strong></p>
<p>CO: At this point, it&#8217;s massive. If you were to look at our portfolio, we have companies in Denver, Washington, Atlanta, Toronto, Austin. I think what we&#8217;re finding is that this opportunity is a broader phenomenon that we&#8217;re investing in.</p>
<p>Before we will invest into any of these cities, we&#8217;ve had to go in the same way we did into Columbus. And we&#8217;ve had to meet with the landlords, because landlords out here are not built for startups. They&#8217;re built for legacy companies, and they want to see five years of trailing financials, and they want a massive security deposit. And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t have that.&#8221; So too with the headhunters. There are phenomenal headhunters in Ohio. They&#8217;re totally different than the ones who are successful in Denver or in Atlanta because those talent networks are very localized.</p>
<p>But now that done that and we&#8217;ve been invested in an infrastructure and we&#8217;ve got a density of companies in a lot of the cities that I just mentioned, now we can help and we can be very different from a venture firm that&#8217;s just going to zoom in for quarterly board meetings. We&#8217;ve got a partnership now that&#8217;s expanded where we&#8217;re investing people resources, and we&#8217;re in the cities on a weekly basis.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pinduoduo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pinduoduo">Pinduoduo, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a rapidly growing Chinese e-commerce company, is weathering its PR storm after the death of an employee sparked criticism against the firm&#8217;s grueling working hours.</p>
<p>The employee, 21 years old, collapsed on her way home from work on a late night before New Year. The cause of her death has not been disclosed but internet users speculated that she had died from exhaustion.</p>
<p>Posts with the hashtag <a href="https://s.weibo.com/weibo?q=%23%E6%8B%BC%E5%A4%9A%E5%A4%9A%E5%91%98%E5%B7%A5%E7%8C%9D%E6%AD%BB%23&amp;Refer=SWeibo_box">#PinduoduoEmployeeSuddenDeath</a> have accumulated 300 million views on the Chinese microblogging platform Weibo. Separately, another Pinduoduo employee committed suicide on January 9 by jumping from his 27th-floor apartment. The local labor authorities are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/pinduoduo-china-idCNL1N2JF0BN">reported</a> to be reviewing working conditions at Shanghai-based Pinduoduo.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On Sunday, a former Pinduoduo employee <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1iT4y1N7AU">spoke out against</a> the firm&#8217;s stressful work culture in a video that went viral, adding to the public outcry against Alibaba&#8217;s biggest rival. He alleged that employees at Pinduoduo&#8217;s headquarters are required to work at least 300 hours a month (about 75 hours a week), whereas staff in the newly established grocery delivery department have a 380-hour minimum. The employee who fell on her way home worked on Pinduoduo&#8217;s grocery business in the Western province of Xinjiang.</p>
<p>People with knowledge told TechCrunch that employees working on certain projects at Pinduoduo might work over 300 hours a month, though the hours aren&#8217;t mandatory. Companywide, staff are required to work from 11 AM to 8 PM.</p>
<p>Pinduoduo cannot be immediately be reached for comment.</p>

<p>Long working hours aren&#8217;t unique to Pinduoduo in China. The string of incidents is reviving the debate around<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/12/china-996/"> </a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/12/china-996/">&#8220;996&#8221;</a>, a term that denotes employees working from 9 AM to 9 PM, six days a week, though it can refer to any other form of demanding work regime in China&#8217;s cutthroat internet industry.</p>
<p>Despite the public backlash and calls to boycott Pinduoduo, the company&#8217;s market position appears to remain firm. Its app downloads have remained stable since the first employee incident two weeks ago, with some days even seeing slight growth in installs, according to data analytics provider Jiguang. As of January 8, Pinduoduo had nearly 650 million installs.</p>
<p>Its shares, traded in New York, climbed from $144 on December 28 to $187 on January 5 and dropped slightly to $174 on January 11. A few venture capital investors of Pinduoduo contacted by TechCrunch declined to comment for this story.</p>
<p>The figures could be telling. Despite its efforts to attract more users in China&#8217;s wealthier cities, a substantial number of Pinduoduo users live in China&#8217;s low-tier cities and rural towns. The &#8220;996&#8221; culture of the megacity-based tech giants may be remote for them, while the deals on Pinduoduo, the e-commerce app famous for its &#8220;dirt cheap&#8221; goods, are tangible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Payments company <a href="https://www.checkout.com">Checkout.com</a> is raising once again. The company has closed a $450 million Series C round with Tiger Global Management leading the round — Greenoaks Capital and all existing investors are also participating.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with the company, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/checkout-com" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="checkout-com">Checkout.com <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> wants to build a one-stop shop for all things related to payments, such as accepting transactions, processing them and detecting fraud. It focuses on large merchants and tries to make its product as customizable as possible so that you integrate it as an infrastructure partner in your product.</p>
<p>The company’s fundraising story in particular is jaw-dropping. The startup was founded in 2012 in London. At first, it grew slowly and methodically. Every time it would generate a bit of revenue, it would hire more people. “We can hire one employee this month. Now we can hire two employees this month,” founder and CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/guillaume-pousaz" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="guillaume-pousaz">Guillaume Pousaz <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/what-makes-checkout-com-different-from-stripe/">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> when thinking about the early days of the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Checkout.com kept growing and growing until it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/02/a-quiet-london-based-payments-startup-just-raised-among-the-biggest-series-a-rounds-ever-in-europe/">raised</a> one of the biggest Series A rounds ever for a European company — $230 million at a $2 billion valuation. Just a year later, Checkout.com <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/checkout-com-the-uk-payments-startup-raises-another-150m-now-valued-at-5-5b/">added</a> $150 million in funding at a $5.5 valuation.</p>
<p>Checkout.com is now valued at $15 billion based on today’s funding round. According to the startup, it is now the fourth largest fintech company globally.</p>
<p>Checkout.com had 440 employees in January 2020. It finished 2020 with 940 employees. And this year, the company plans to hire an additional 700 people.</p>
<p>While Checkout.com didn’t actually need to raise to stay alive, Pousaz says VC firms are a form of validation. Suddenly, you can talk with big prospects if you’re backed by Insight, DST, Coatue, Tiger Global Management, etc.</p>
<p>And yet, the company needs a lot of money on its bank account to expand to more countries. “Today, we process billions every week,” Pousaz told me in December. “And when you process over a billion euros per week, your cash flow on your bank account increases significantly. So you need to be well capitalized for regulators.”</p>
<p>Technically, there isn&#8217;t a single bank account that holds the company&#8217;s cash. Checkout.com is regulated in the U.K., but also in France, Brazil, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc. And the company is working on adding India, the Philippines. And it turns out you need cash on your balance sheet in the Philippines if you want to get a license from the local regulator — it doesn’t matter if you have a ton of money sitting in your bank account in London. That&#8217;s why raising capital can be helpful.</p>

<p>But why do investors want to hand over more and more money? “At any point you have a lot of visibility on what your next year is going to look like,” Pousaz told me. “It’s something that investors like because you can show them your pipeline and all your customers in your pipeline. If you forecast on the pipeline, it gives you a good idea of how much you’re going to generate in the coming year.</p>
<p>“For instance, I could tell you right now that we’ll grow by at least 80% in 2021,” he added. And that’s only based on clients who are currently in the process of integrating Checkout.com. The company already tripled its payment processing volume in 2020 compared to 2019.</p>
<p>In many ways, Checkout.com tries to forecast like a public company. It isn’t focused on runway as it is EBITDA profitable. Instead, it tries to reinvest a lot of its revenue in the company. “We don’t generate $50 million in EBITDA, far from it. But we generate double-digit million dollars,” Pousaz told me.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company will open two new offices in the U.S. In addition to San Francisco, Checkout.com will have offices in New York and Denver.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.curve.com/">Curve</a>, the London-based fintech that combines multiple cards and accounts into one smart card and an app, has secured a Series C finding round of $95 million. The financing was led by IDC Ventures, Fuel Venture Capital and Vulcan Capital (the investment arm of the estate of Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Paul G. Allen), with participation from OneMain Financial, the US personal finance company, and Novum Capital. Several previous investors also participated. The fundraise brings the total investment in Curve to almost $175 million. Curve says it plans to use the funds to expand internationally, including to the US, and to deepen its European reach. It will also be pushing its Curve Credit product. </p>
<p>The startup is now claiming 2 million customers and now covers Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google Pay in 31 European markets. In December, Curve created a JV with <a href="http://Plaid.com">Plaid</a> to bring open banking to the UK, allowing users to connect and see their bank accounts in one place.  It also now has a subsidiary in Vilnius, Lithuania, in order to serve its EU-based following Brexit, and partnered with Samsung for its Pay Card.</p>
<p>However, it hasn’t all been plain sailing. Its ‘Go Back in Time’ feature which can roll-back purchase 14 to 90 days, has come under fire for potentially allowing customers to fall into a debt spiral. </p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch, Shachar Bialick, founder and CEO of Curve, said: “We tried to remove the friction customers have at the checkout. For instance, you might be out and not have an internet connection, or you want to switch the card to be charged, so you can pay, and then later go back in time and change the accounts that were used. And then what transpired is that customers were using this feature because they wanted to free up cash in their checking account during COVID times. In March, many of our customers asked us to be able to ‘go back in time’ from the debit cards to their credit cards for transactions they&#8217;ve made in January and in December, 2019, and because they need to free more cash in their checking account.” He said it’s also led to a new product allowing customers to split payments into installments.</p>
<p>Curve also came under fire this month for failing to file its accounts with Companies House in London. Bialick said: “We missed the filing and the reason for that is because we had a very tight fundraising and we have limited resources so we had to prioritize it over something else. But we&#8217;re already in the process of submitting [the accounts] this week.”</p>
<p>Bobby Aitkenhead, Managing Partner of IDC Ventures, said: “Curve’s pioneering approach to finance is more necessary than ever as we accelerate globally to a digital-first world.”</p>
<p>Rick Roberts, from Vulcan Capital, said: “Curve’s model is redefining the future of banking by bringing diverse financial products and solutions together into one digital wallet, for the benefit of banks and customers alike. Their friction-free offering is coming at the ideal time for American consumers, who are looking for safer payment options and greater financial control in the wake of the pandemic.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://zipmex.com/">Zipmex</a>, a digital assets exchange headquartered in Singapore, announced today it has raised $6 million in funding led by Jump Capital. The startup, which plans to become a digital assets bank, says the round exceeded its initial target of $4 million. Along with earlier funding, it brings the total <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zipmex" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zipmex">Zipmex <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has raised so far to $10.9 million.</p>
<p>The exchange is regulated in Singapore, Australia and Indonesia, and licensed in Thailand. It focuses on investors new to cryptocurrency with educational features, as well as high net-worth individuals, and says it has transacted over $600 million in gross transaction volume since launching at the end of 2019.</p>
<p>The funding will be used on hiring and to add more product offerings. In addition to its cryptocurrency exchange, Zipmex’s services also include ZipUp, its interest-bearing accounts, and its own ERC-20 token ZMT.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zipmex’s goal is to become the largest digital exchange in the Asia Pacific, where interest in cryptocurrency investing and blockchain technology is <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-the-western-world-should-understand-about-the-asian-crypto-market-2020-11-24">increasing quickly</a>. For example, DBG Group Holdings, Southeast Asia’s largest lender, <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cryptocurrencies/Singapore-bank-DBS-starts-currency-and-crypto-exchange">recently launched a crypto exchange</a>, though it is currently open only to professional investors.</p>

<p>But Zipmex is also up against a roster of competitors, including regional exchanges like BitKub in Thailand and Swyftx in Australia, as well as players like Luno, Coinbase and Binance which are targeting growth in the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<p>Zipmex chief executive officer Marcus Lim said the company’s ambition to become a digital assets bank sets it apart from other exchanges. &#8220;We currently offer customers to invest and earn interest on their digital assets,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;In the future, we are planning to roll out payments and lending and the investment into securitized tokens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other cryptocurrency startups that Jump Capital, an American venture capital firm, has invested in include BitGo and TradingView. Its parent company, trading firm Jump Trading, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-29/robinhood-s-free-crypto-trades-powered-by-chicago-s-jump-trading">powers Robinhood’s crypto trades</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://amazon.com/">Amazon</a> has begun the process of removing QAnon-related products from its platform.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the company said that the process may take a few days. Any sellers that attempt to evade the company&#8217;s systems and list products will be subject to action, including a blanket selling ban across <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> stores.</p>
<p>News of the ban <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/11/business/amazon-qanon.html">was first reported by The New York Times</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is shutting down the nation&#8217;s newest favorite conspiracy theory by removing products sold by QAnon adherents from its platform after supporters were prominently on display at the riot in the nation&#8217;s Capitol last week.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s ban of Q-related products follows the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-is-officially-offline-after-aws-suspension/">decision to remove Parler</a> from its web servers and cloud services platform.</p>
<p>The ban applies to any self-published books that promote QAnon or any clothing, posters, stickers, or other merchandise related to the Q conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>Amazon has policies that prohibit products that &#8220;promote, incite, or glorify hate or violence toward any person or group,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>A cursory search of the company&#8217;s platform on Monday revealed that the ban <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=WWG1WGA&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">isn&#8217;t being applied to all of the Q-related products for sale</a>.</p>
<p>Seven pages of Q-related products were surfaced under the search for &#8220;WWG1WGA&#8221; an acronym for the Q-related phrase, &#8220;Where we go one, we go all.&#8221;</p>
<p>The widely discredited Q conspiracy theory <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2021/01/07/the-making-of-qanon-a-crowdsourced-conspiracy/">was born from a stew of different conspiracy theories</a> that emerged from the 4chan message boards back in 2017.</p>
<p>Since its emergence, the conspiracy theory has grabbed the attention of conservative activists, and its supporters were highly visible among the group of rioters that stormed the Capitol building last week &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/qanon-congress-house-race-marjorie-taylor-greene/">even as at least one Q-believer joined Congress the same week.</a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="N0uJllra2O"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/qanon-congress-house-race-marjorie-taylor-greene/">A QAnon supporter is headed to Congress</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A QAnon supporter is headed to Congress&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/qanon-congress-house-race-marjorie-taylor-greene/embed/#?secret=N0uJllra2O" data-secret="N0uJllra2O" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">Amazon&#8217;s decision to ban the sale of Q-related goods comes many, many, many years after the movement was first linked to violence, as TechCrunch previously reported.</p>
<p>Criminal acts committed by believers have included <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/22/744244166/shooters-lawyer-he-wasn-t-trying-to-kill-a-mob-boss-he-was-under-qanon-delusion">the fatal shooting a mob boss</a> in Staten Island and blocking the Hoover Dam bridge in <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/man-pleads-guilty-terrorism-charge-blocking-bridge-armored/story?id=68955385">an armed standoff</a>.</p>
<p>The conspiracy’s followers have also interfered with legitimate child safety efforts by hijacking the hashtag #savethechildren, and exporting their extreme ideas into mainstream conversation under the guise of helping children. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook, </a>which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/facebook-qanon-ban/">previously banned QAnon</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/facebook-is-limiting-distribution-of-save-our-children-hashtag-over-qanon-ties/">limited the hashtag’s reach</a> in late 2020 because of the interference.</p>

<p>The Vision-S is back in a series of new videos released by Sony during 2021 <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which kicked off Monday. Two <a href="https://youtu.be/o_XWbHuwsfw">videos</a> show the Vision-S prototype driving on a private track and <a href="https://youtu.be/AtyojR38K0c">then public roads</a> in Austria. But it&#8217;s a third, longer video (included below) that sheds more light on how Sony designed and developed the prototype, its partners and some of the tech that&#8217;s under the hood.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094955" style="width: 1850px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-5.36.58-PM.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094955" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2094955 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-5.36.58-PM.jpg" alt="Sony Vision-S car" width="1840" height="1024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-5.36.58-PM.jpg 1840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-5.36.58-PM.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-5.36.58-PM.jpg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-5.36.58-PM.jpg?resize=768,427 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-5.36.58-PM.jpg?resize=680,378 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-5.36.58-PM.jpg?resize=1536,855 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-5.36.58-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1840px) 100vw, 1840px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2094955" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sony/screenshot</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Importantly, the Vision-S prototype also appears to be just the starting point for Sony, according to Frank Stein, president of automotive contract manufacturer Magna Steyr, one of Sony&#8217;s partners on the project. Stein, who is interviewed in the nearly 9-minute video, suggests that Sony and Magna&#8217;s partnership will continue, comments that might help quash speculation that the prototype was a mere dalliance.</p>
<p>The video, along with more information on its website, suggests that Sony and its numerous partners have been further developing the vehicle over the past year.</p>
<p>Sony increased the number of sensors on the vehicle to 40 to allow for 360-degree awareness and experimented with ways to increase their capabilities, according to Izumi Kawanishi, a senior vice president at the company who was featured in the video. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Sony also created a system to verify the safety and security of its connected vehicle, he said.</span></p>
<p>The dashboard-length display screen, shown below, has five playing card-sized tiles in the center labeled camera, settings, navigation, music and video.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094956" style="width: 1838px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-5.39.15-PM.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094956" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2094956 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-5.39.15-PM.jpg" alt="Sony Vision S car CES" width="1828" height="1028" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-5.39.15-PM.jpg 1828w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-5.39.15-PM.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-5.39.15-PM.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-5.39.15-PM.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-5.39.15-PM.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-5.39.15-PM.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-5.39.15-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1828px) 100vw, 1828px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2094956" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sony/screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>Video footage suggests several other features that have been added, or are in development, including a voice assistant, gesture control, entertainment such as video games, the ability to update the car&#8217;s software wirelessly, 5G connectivity and a driver monitoring system that uses an in-cabin camera. That camera, which Sony describes in more detail on its website, is particularly interesting.</p>
<p>The camera is used to identify and recognize the condition of the occupant. If it detects a sleeping passenger in the back seat, the car will automatically control the climate around that seat to a suitable temperature, according to Sony. The system continues to evolve through everyday use, learning the driver&#8217;s preferred temperature and music and driving routes. Actual driving data is used to make the space even more comfortable, the company says.</p>
<p>The video featured an array of partners on Vision-S, including Bosch and Continental, Hungarian automated driving startup AIMotive, software company Elektrobit Automotive, French automotive supplier Valeo, telecommunications giant Vodafone and German car parts maker ZF Group. The collection of partners, which also includes mapping company HERE, Nvidia and Blackberry/QNX and Qualcomm, leaves little doubt that this someday there will be a Sony car that consumers can buy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting closer to people is our corporate direction,&#8221; Izumi Kawanishi, a senior vice president at Sony said in the video. &#8220;I think that mobility serves as a tool to achieve it.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The backbone of Indonesia’s economy are small- to medium-sized businesses, which <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2020/07/17/smes-safeguard-economy.html">account for 60% of its gross domestic product</a>. Many still rely on manual bookkeeping, but the impact of COVID-19 has driven small businesses to digitize more of their operations. <a href="https://www.bukukas.co.id/">BukuKas</a>, one of several startups helping SMEs go online, announced today it has raised a $10 million Series A led by Sequoia Capital India.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bukukas" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bukukas">BukuKas <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> launched in December 2019 as a digital bookkeeping app, but is growing its range of services with the goal of creating an &#8220;end-to-end software stack&#8221; for small businesses. Eventually, it wants to launch a SME-focused digital bank.</p>
<p>The funding, which brings BukuKas’ total raised so far to $22 million, included participation from returning investors Saison Capital, January Capital, Founderbank Capital, Cambium Grove, Endeavor Catalyst and Amrish Rau.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As of November 2020, BukuKas had a registered user base of 3.5 million small merchants and retailers, and had crossed 1.8 million monthly active users. During that month, the platform also recorded $17.4 billion worth of transactions on an annualized basis, a figure corresponding to more than 1.5% of Indonesia’s $1.04 trillion GDP.</p>
<p>BukuKas was founded by chief executive officer Krishnan Menon and chief operating officer Lorenzo Peracchione, who met eight years ago while working at Lazada Indonesia.</p>
<p>Menon’s previous startup was Fabelio, an Indonesian online home furnishings store. Every two months, he would visit smaller small cities in Indonesia, like Jepara and Cirebon, to source furniture.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things that stood out was how different the Jakarta bubble is from the rest of Indonesia, all the way from the penetration of software to financial services,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. While talking to merchants and suppliers, Menon realized that &#8220;no one is building products with them as the center of the universe,&#8221; despite the fact that there are 56 million small businesses.</p>
<p>Peracchione said he and Menon had been brainstorming startup ideas for a while. &#8220;When he told me about the idea of solving cash flow visibility to SMEs, it immediately struck me,&#8221; Peracchione said. &#8220;My dad used to be a SME owner himself and during my childhood I experience first hand the struggles and ups and downs connected to running a small business.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two decided to start with digital bookkeeping after speaking to 1,052 merchants because helping them keep track of their business performance would generate data that would in turn enable access to more financial services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our vision expanded into providing an end-to-end software stack to digitize SMEs and help them across a wide range of activities as a prequel to building an SME-focused digital bank down the line,&#8221; Menon said.</p>
<p>In addition to digital ledger features, BukuKas also sends payment reminders to buyers through WhatsApp and automatically generates invoices, includes an an inventory management module and analyzes expenses to help businesses understand what is impacting their profit. The company plans to add digital payments this month. During the rest of 2021, it will also introduce more features to help businesses sell online, including tools for online store fronts, a promotions engine and social sharing.</p>
<p>&#8220;With COVID-19, SMEs are rushing to get digitized, but they lack the right mobile-first tools to sell online as well as to manage their business,&#8221; said Menon.</p>
<p>The app focuses on smaller Indonesian cities and towns, since about 73% of the merchants who use BukuKas are located outside of tier 1 cities like Jakarta. Its users represent wide range of sectors, including retailers, food vendors, grocery markets, mobile and phone credit providers, social commerce sellers, wholesalers and service providers. BukuKas acquired digital ledger app Catatan Keuangan Harian, which has 300,000 monthly active users, in September 2020 to expand its market share in Indonesia.</p>
<p>With its large number of SMEs, Indonesia is seen as a desirable market for companies helping the drive toward digitization. For example, India’s Khatabook, which was valued between $275 million to $300 million after its last round of funding in May 2020, recently launched BukuUang in Indonesia. Other startups in the same space include Y Combinator-backed BukuWarung, Moka and Jurnal, all of which offer tools to help SMEs bring more of their operations online.</p>

<p>Menon said BukuKas’ advantage is its team’s experience building businesses in Indonesia over the past seven years. For example, it launched a &#8220;Know Your Profits&#8221; module based on user feedback. It also offers a self-guided onboarding process, a simple user interface and an offline mode for users in areas with poor network connections.</p>
<p>&#8220;In general, individual features can be copied but we believe our &#8216;integrated end-to-end software stack approach,&#8217; coupled with our obsessive focus on simplicity, deep understanding of our users and a superior level of service will be key in differentiating BukuKas from competing offerings,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>BukuKas’ Series A will be used on user acquisition, its engineering and product teams in Jakarta and Bangalore and to introduce new services for merchants. The company may eventually expand into other Southeast Asia markets, but &#8220;in the short term consolidating and further expanding our leadership in the SME space in Indonesia is our top priority,&#8221; said Menon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In October, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/popsockets-is-working-on-magsafe-compatible-iphone-accessories/">broke the news</a> that PopSockets was developing its own line of MagSafe-compatible products that will support the new wireless charging capabilities of the iPhone 12 devices. Today, at the (virtual) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces-2021/">2021 Consumer Electronics Show</a>, the company formally introduced its upcoming products for the first time. The new line will include three MagSafe-compatible PopGrips, a wallet with an integrated grip and two mounts.</p>
<p>The first of these is the new PopGrip for MagSafe, which will magnetically attach to MagSafe-compatible cases for iPhone 12 devices.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2094941" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe.png?w=512" alt="" width="512" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe.png 512w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The design of this PopGrip clears up some confusion over how a PopGrip (the round, poppable dongle that people normally think of when they think of &#8220;PopPockets&#8221;) will work with a MagSafe device. Instead of attaching just at the base of the grip itself, the grip is integrated into a larger base that attaches to the case.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094933" style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094933" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2094933 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe2.png?w=512" alt="" width="512" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe2.png 512w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe2.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe2.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe2.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe2.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe2.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe2.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe2.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094933" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>PopSockets</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the grip has a swappable top so you can change the style of your PopGrip whenever you want without having to buy a whole new accessory.</p>
<p>This grip will also be compatible with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/popsockets" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="popsockets">PopSockets <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> PopMount 2 phone mounts, including the new PopMount 2 for MagSafe, introduced today.</p>
<p>The PopMount 2 for MagSafe will launch as two solutions: PopMount for MagSafe Multi-Surface and PopMount for MagSafe Car Vent. As described by their name, both products will magnetically attach to iPhone 12 devices either at home or while on-the-go.</p>
<p>For those who use the new PopGrip for MagSafe grip, they&#8217;ll be able to leave the grip on, then let the mount&#8217;s magnets attach to the base.</p>

<p>Also new is an updated PopWallet+ for MagSafe, which is a combination wallet and grip that lets users carry up to three cards and now attaches magnetically to MagSafe-compatible phone cases for iPhone 12 devices. The wallet has an elastic sock so you can extract your cards without having to remove the wallet from the back of the device, and it now includes a shield to protect credit cards from magnetic damage. The grip here is swappable, too.</p>

<p>There are also two versions of the PopGrip Slide becoming available. One, the PopGrip Slide Stretch will have expanding arms that attach mechanically to the sides of most phone cases, including iPhone 12 cases. You can slide this grip to the bottom of the phone to serve as a portrait stand or to attach MagSafe accessories, without having to remove the grip.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094942" style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094942" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2094942" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-Slide-Stretch-for-MagSafe.png?w=512" alt="" width="512" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-Slide-Stretch-for-MagSafe.png 512w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-Slide-Stretch-for-MagSafe.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-Slide-Stretch-for-MagSafe.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-Slide-Stretch-for-MagSafe.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-Slide-Stretch-for-MagSafe.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-Slide-Stretch-for-MagSafe.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-Slide-Stretch-for-MagSafe.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-Slide-Stretch-for-MagSafe.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094942" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PopGrip Slide Stretch for MagSafe</p></div></p>
<p>The PopGrip Slide for iPhone 12 is basically the same thing, but designed to fit the Apple Silicone cases for iPhone 12 devices, more specifically.</p>
<p>Among the first of the new accessories to hit the market will be the PopGrip for MagSafe and PopWallet+ for MagSafe in spring 2021.</p>
<p>The PopGrip Slide Stretch will launch March 21 on PopSockets.com and in select Target locations ahead of a broader rollout. The PopGrip Slide will launch May 1 on PopSockets.com and in Apple Stores. And the PopMount for MagSafe line will launch in summer 2021.</p>
<p>The company also announced a few other non-MagSafe products, including the PopGrip Pocketable, which streamlines the grip when collapsed so the surface is flat; the PopGrip Antimicrobial, which has an embedded silver-based treatment for protection; and the PopSockets x SOG PopGrip Multi-Tool, made in collaboration with SOG Speciality Knives, which includes a PopGrip with a detachable multi-tool.</p>
<p>The company didn&#8217;t share an exact time frame for these products besides &#8220;early 2021.&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>At CES this week, the company’s finally prepared to show off a bit more. “Today, we’re going to introduce a product that integrates AI and robotics,” CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said in an announcement video, “designed for adventurous creators.”</p>
<p>The drone is designed to carry Sony’s own imaging technology &#8212; specifically the Alpha series of mirrorless. And while it’s large compared to what we’re used to seeing on the consumer side from companies like DJI, Sony say it’s going to be the smallest drone on the market that can be equipped with its cameras.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/o_XWbHuwsfw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Along with the announcement, the company’s also debuting footage of the drone in action, along with video captured with its on-board camera. The drone was flown through snow and managed to capture some lovely, stable footage, all things considered. Also of note: The car in the video is the Vision-S concept the company unveiled this time last year.</p>
<p>The system looks to compete with some of the more pro-focused models. DJI has that market under lock &#8212; along with practically all drone categories. Though while DJI owns a majority stake in Hasselblad, Sony’s system looks like a proprietary, purpose-built design. That could certainly be a bonus from the standpoint of compatibility, though it doesn’t seem like you’ll be able to swap the Alpha out for different cameras.</p>
<p>The company is targeting a spring release for the system. No word yet on pricing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week and throughout the weekend, technology companies took the historic step of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">deplatforming the president of the United States</a> in the wake of a riot in which the US Capitol was stormed by a collection of white nationalists, QAnon supporters, and right wing activists.</p>
<p>The decision to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/">remove Donald Trump</a>, his<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/stripe-reportedly-joins-the-tech-platforms-booting-president-trump-from-their-services/"> fundraising</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/shopify-pulls-donald-trump-stores-off-its-website/">moneymaking</a> apparatus, and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/twitter-qanon-sidney-powell-michael-flynn-ron-watkins/"> a large portion of his supporters</a> from their digital homes because of their incitements to violence in the nation&#8217;s Capitol on January 6th and beyond, has led a chorus of voices to call for the regulation of the giant tech platforms.</p>
<p>They argue that private companies shouldn&#8217;t have the sole power to erase the digital footprint of a sitting president.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But there&#8217;s a reason why the legislative hearings in Congress, and the pressure from the president, have not created any new regulations. And there&#8217;s also a reason why &#8212; despite all of the protestations from the president and his supporters &#8212; no lawsuits have effectively been brought against the platforms for their decisions.</p>
<p>The law, for now, is on their side.</p>
<p><strong>The First Amendment and freedom of speech (for platforms)</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the First Amendment. The protections of speech afforded to American citizens under the First Amendment only apply to <em>government</em> efforts to limit speech. While the protection of all speech is assumed as something enshrined in the foundations of American democracy, the founders appear to have only wanted to shield speech from government intrusions.</p>
<p>That position makes sense if you&#8217;re a band of patriots trying to ensure that a monarch or dictator can&#8217;t abuse government power to silence its citizens or put its thumb on the lever in the marketplace of ideas.</p>
<p>The thing is, that marketplace of ideas is always open, but publishers and platforms have the freedom to decide what they want to sell into it. Ben Franklin would never have published pro-monarchist sentiments on his printing presses, but he would probably have let Thomas Paine have free rein.</p>
<p>So, the First Amendment doesn&#8217;t protect an individuals&#8217; rights to access any platform and say whatever the hell they want. In fact, it <em>protects</em> businesses in many cases from having their freedom of speech violated by having the government force them to publish something they don&#8217;t want to on their platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Section 230 and platform liability </strong></p>
<p>BuT WhAt AbOUt SeCTiOn 230, one might ask (and if you do, <a href="https://twitter.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1348334863385063424?s=20">you&#8217;re not alone</a>)?</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Canceling conservative speech is hostile to the free speech foundation America was built on.</p>
<p>There is no reason why social media organizations that pick &amp; choose which speech they allow to be protected by the liability protections in 47 US Code Section 230.</p>
<p>230 must be repealed</p>
<p>&mdash; Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) <a href="https://twitter.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1348334863385063424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Unfortunately, for Abbott and <a href="https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1347713461246169089?s=20">others who believe that repealing Section 230</a> would open the door for less suppression of speech by online platforms, they&#8217;re wrong.</p>
<p>First, the cancellation of speech by businesses isn&#8217;t actually hostile to the foundation America was built on. If a group doesn&#8217;t like the way it&#8217;s being treated in one outlet, it can try and find another. Essentially, no one can force a newspaper to print their letter to the editor.</p>
<p>Second, users&#8217; speech isn&#8217;t what is protected under Section 230; it protects <em>platforms</em> from liability for that speech, which indirectly makes it safe for users to speak freely.</p>
<p>Where things get complicated is in the difference between the letter to an editor in a newspaper and a tweet on Twitter, post on Facebook, or blog on Medium (or WordPress). And this is where U.S. Code Section 230 comes into play.</p>
<p>Right now, Section 230 protects all of these social media companies from legal liability for the stuff that people publish on their platforms (unlike publishers). The gist of the law is that since these companies don&#8217;t actively edit what people post on the platforms, but merely provide a distribution channel for that content, then they can&#8217;t be held accountable for what&#8217;s in the posts.</p>
<p>The companies argue that they&#8217;re exercising their own rights to freedom of speech through the algorithms they&#8217;ve developed to highlight certain pieces of information or entertainment, or in removing certain pieces of content. And their broad terms of service agreements also provide legal shields that allow them to act with a large degree of impunity.</p>
<p>Repealing Section 230 would make platforms more restrictive rather than less restrictive about who gets to sell their ideas in the marketplace, because it would open up the tech companies to lawsuits over what they distribute across their platforms.</p>
<p>One of the authors of the legislation, Senator Ron Wyden, thinks repeal is an existential threat to social media companies. &#8220;Were Twitter to lose the protections I wrote into law, within 24 hours its potential liabilities would be many multiples of its assets and its stock would be worthless,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/23/the-consequences-of-indecency/">Senator Wyden wrote back in 2018</a>. &#8220;The same for Facebook and any other social media site. Boards of directors should have taken action long before now against CEOs who refuse to recognize this threat to their business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others believe that increased liability for content would actually be a powerful weapon to bring decorum to online discussions. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-10/revoke-shield-for-twitter-and-facebook-but-for-the-right-reason?cmpid=BBD011121_OUS&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=210111&amp;utm_campaign=openamericas&amp;sref=AwwRcx4b">As Joe Nocera argues in Bloomberg BusinessWeek today</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230; I have come around to an idea that the right has been clamoring for — and which Trump tried unsuccessfully to get Congress to approve just weeks ago. Eliminate Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. That is the provision that shields social media companies from legal liability for the content they publish — or, for that matter, block.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The right seems to believe that repealing Section 230 is some kind of deserved punishment for Twitter and Facebook for censoring conservative views. (This accusation doesn’t hold up upon scrutiny, but let’s leave that aside.) In fact, once the social media companies have to assume legal liability — not just for libel, but for inciting violence and so on — they will quickly change their algorithms to block anything remotely problematic. People would still be able to discuss politics, but they wouldn’t be able to hurl anti-Semitic slurs. Presidents and other officials could announce policies, but they wouldn’t be able to spin wild conspiracies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Conservatives and liberals crowing for the removal of Section 230 protections may find that it would reinstitute a level of comity online, but the fringes will be even further marginalized. If you&#8217;re a free speech absolutist, that may or may not be the best course of action.</p>
<p><strong>What mechanisms can legislators use beyond repealing Section 230? </strong></p>
<p>Beyond the blunt instrument that is repealing Section 230, legislators could take other steps to mandate that platforms carry speech and continue to do business with certain kinds of people and platforms, however odious their views or users might be.</p>
<p>Many of these steps are outlined<a href="https://www.hoover.org/research/who-do-you-sue"> in this piece from Daphne Keller on &#8220;Who do you sue?&#8221; from the Hoover Institution</a>.</p>
<p>Most of them hinge on some reinterpretation of older laws relating to commerce and the provision of services by utilities, or on the &#8220;must-carry&#8221; requirements put in place in the early days of 20th century broadcasting when radio and television were distributed over airways provided by the federal government.</p>
<p>These older laws involve either designating internet platforms as &#8220;essential, unavoidable, and monopolistic services to which customers should be guaranteed access&#8221;; or treating the companies like the railroad industry and mandating compulsory access, requiring tech companies to accept all users and not modify any of their online speech.</p>
<p>Other avenues could see lawmakers use variations on the laws designed to limit the power of channel owners to edit the content they carried &#8212; including things like the fairness doctrine from the broadcast days or net neutrality laws that are already set to be revisited under the Biden Administration.</p>
<p>Keller notes that the existing body of laws &#8220;does not currently support must-carry claims against user-facing platforms like Facebook or YouTube, because Congress emphatically declined to extend it to them in the 1996 Telecommunications Act.&#8221;</p>
<p>These protections are distinct from Section 230, but their removal would have similar, dramatic consequences on how social media companies, and tech platforms more broadly, operate.</p>
<p>&#8220;[The] massive body of past and current federal communications law would be highly relevant,&#8221; Keller wrote. &#8220;For one thing, these laws provide the dominant and familiar model for US regulation of speech and communication intermediaries. Any serious proposal to legislate must-carry obligations would draw on this history. For another, and importantly for plaintiffs in today’s cases, these laws have been heavily litigated and are still being litigated today. They provide important precedent for weighing the speech rights of individual users against those of platforms.&#8221;</p>
<p>The establishment of some of these &#8220;must-carry&#8221; mandates for platforms would go a long way toward circumventing or refuting platforms&#8217; First Amendment claims, because some cases have already been decided against cable carriers in cases that could correspond to claims against platforms.</p>
<p><strong>This is really happening already so what could legislation look like</strong></p>
<p>At this point the hypothetical scenario that Keller sketched out in her essay, where private actors throughout the technical stack have excluded speech (although the legality of the speech is contested), has, in fact, happened.</p>
<p>The question is whether the deplatforming of the president and services that were spreading potential calls to violence and sedition, is a one-off; or a new normal where tech companies will act increasingly to silence voices that they &#8212; or a significant portion of their user base &#8212; disagree with.</p>
<p>Lawmakers in Europe, seeing the actions from U.S. companies over the last week, aren&#8217;t wasting any time in drafting their own responses and increasing their calls for more regulation.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe seizes on social media&#8217;s purging of Trump to bang the drum for regulation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/europe-seizes-on-social-medias-purging-of-trump-to-bang-the-drum-for-regulation/embed/#?secret=5Fx1LHlyR0" data-secret="5Fx1LHlyR0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In Europe, that regulation is coming in the form of the Digital Services Act, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">which we wrote about at the end of last year</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>On the content side, the Commission has chosen to limit the DSA’s regulation to speech that’s illegal (e.g., hate speech, terrorism propaganda, child sexual exploitation, etc.) — rather than trying to directly tackle fuzzier “legal but harmful” content (e.g., disinformation), as it seeks to avoid inflaming concerns about impacts on freedom of expression.</p>
<p>Although a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/europe-to-put-forward-rules-for-political-ads-transparency-and-beef-up-its-disinformation-code-next-year/">beefed up self-regulatory code on disinformation</a> is coming next year, as part of a wider European Democracy Action Plan. And that (voluntary) code sounds like it will be heavily pushed by the Commission as a mitigation measure platforms can put toward fulfilling the DSA’s risk-related compliance requirements.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers do also plan on regulating online political ads in time for the next pan-EU elections, under a separate instrument (to be proposed next year) and are continuing to push the Council and European parliament to adopt a 2018 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/12/europe-to-push-for-one-hour-takedown-law-for-terrorist-content/">terrorism content takedown proposal</a> (which will bring specific requirements in that specific area).</p></blockquote>
<p>Europe has also put in place rules for very large online platforms that have more stringent requirements around how they approach and disseminate content, but regulators on the continent are having a hard time enforcing htem.</p>
<p>Keller believes that some of those European regulations could align with thinking about competition and First Amendment rights in the context of access to the &#8220;scarce&#8221; communication channels &#8212; those platforms whose size and scope mean that there are few competitive alternatives.</p>
<p>Two approaches that Keller thinks would perhaps require the least regulatory lift and are perhaps the most tenable for platforms to pursue involve solutions that either push platforms to make room for &#8220;disfavored&#8221; speech, but tell them that they don&#8217;t have to promote it or give it any ranking.</p>
<p>Under this solution, the platforms would be forced to carry the content, but could limit it. For instance, Facebook would be required to host any posts that don&#8217;t break the law, but it doesn&#8217;t have to promote them in any way — letting them sink below the stream of constantly updating content that moves across the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;On this model, a platform could maintain editorial control and enforce its Community Guidelines in its curated version, which most users would presumably prefer. But disfavored speakers would not be banished enitrely and could be found by other users who prefer an uncurated experience,&#8221; Keller writes. &#8220;Platforms could rank legal content but not remove it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps the regulation that Keller is most bullish on is one that she calls the &#8220;magic APIs&#8221; scenario. Similar to the &#8220;unbundling&#8221; requirements from telecommunications companies, this regulation would force big tech companies to license their hard-to-duplicate resources to new market entrants. In the Facebook or Google context, this would mean requiring the companies open up access to their user generated content, and other companies could launch competing services with new user interfaces and content ranking and removal policies, Keller wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;Letting users choose among competing &#8216;flavors&#8217; of today&#8217;s mega-platforms would solve some First Amendment problems by leaving platforms own editorial decisions undisturbed,&#8221; Keller writes.</p>
<p><strong>Imperfect solutions are better than none </strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear to speech advocates on both the left and the right that having technology companies control what is and is not permissible on the world&#8217;s largest communications platforms is untenable and that better regulation is needed.</p>
<p>When the venture capitalists who have funded these services &#8212; and whose politics lean toward the mercenarily libertarian &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/micsolana/status/1348664592541634562?s=20">are calling for some sort of regulatory constraints</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidSacks/status/1348703472988745730?s=20">the power of the technology platforms they&#8217;ve created</a>, it&#8217;s clear things have gone too far. Even if the actions of the platforms<a href="https://twitter.com/sacca/status/1348704862863716353?s=20"> are entirely justified</a>.</p>
<p>However, in these instances, much of the speech that&#8217;s been taken down is clearly illegal. To the point that even free speech services like Parler <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/parler-reportedly-removed-posts-by-trump-affiliate-lin-wood-calling-for-execution-of-vp-mike-pence/">have deleted posts from their service for inciting violence</a>.</p>
<p>The deplatforming of the president brings up the same points that were raised back in 2017 when Cloudflare, the service that stands out for being more tolerant of despicable speech than nearly any other platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/17/cloudflare-ceo-calls-for-a-system-to-regulate-hateful-internet-content/">basically erased the Daily Stormer</a>.</p>
<p>“I know that Nazis are bad, the content [on The Daily Stormer] was so incredibly repulsive, it’s stomach turning how bad it is,” Prince said at the time. “But I do believe that the best way to battle bad speech is with good speech, I’m skeptical that censorship is the right scheme.</p>
<p>“I’m worried the decision we made with respect to this one particular site is not particularly principled but neither was the decision that most tech companies made with respect to this site or other sites. It’s important that we know there is convention about how we create principles and how contraptions are regulated in the internet tech stack,” Prince continued.</p>
<p>“We didn’t just wake up and make some capricious decision, but we could have and that’s terrifying. The internet is a really important resource for everyone, but there’s a very limited set of companies that control it and there’s such little accountability to us that it really is quite a dangerous thing.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Building on a policy that the company said has been in place since the Charlottesville protests back in 2017, <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-announces-capitol-safety-plan-for-the-inauguration/">Airbnb said it will take additional steps to beef up community protections for the DC metro area</a> ahead of the presidential inauguration.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/airbnb" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="airbnb">Airbnb <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> already removes people from the platform who are associated with violent hate groups <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2021/01/07/airbnb-says-it-canceled-some-hate-group-members-dc-reservations-and-plans-to-do-more/">ahead of specific events</a>, the company said.</p>
<p>And ahead of the inauguration, the company said it would use a seven-step plan to ensure that the DC metro-area isn&#8217;t overwhelmed with white supremacists, neo-Nazis, or &#8220;western chauvinists.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Airbnb said it would ban individuals identified as involved in criminal activity around the Capitol at last week&#8217;s riot. &#8220;When we learn through media or law enforcement sources the names of individuals confirmed to have been responsible for the violent criminal activity at the United States Capitol on January 6, we investigate whether the named individuals have an account on Airbnb,&#8221; the company said. &#8220;This includes cross-referencing the January 6 arrest logs of D.C. Metro Police. If the individuals have an Airbnb account, we take action, which includes banning them from using Airbnb.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s in addition to another sweep of existing reservations at locations around the Capitol in the days leading up to the inauguration to ensure that no one associated with hate groups slips through its dragnet.</p>
<p>The company will also tighten up booking requirements, with additional identity verification measures and other security checks to ensure that background checks are up-to-date.</p>
<p>As final steps, the company said that it is communicating with booking guests to inform them that if they&#8217;re bringing people who are associated with hate groups then they could face legal action from Airbnb. Hosts are also being told by the company that if they suspect anything about individuals staying on their properties that they should contact the company&#8217;s Urgent Safety Line.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Launched in South Korea five years ago, content discovery platform <a href="http://dable.io/en/">Dable</a> now serves a total of six markets in Asia. Now it plans to speed up the pace of its expansion, with six new markets in the region planned for this year, before entering European countries and the United States. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dable" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="dable">Dable <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announced today that it has raised a $12 million Series C at a valuation of $90 million, led by South Korean venture capital firm SV Investment. Other participants included KB Investment and K2 Investment, as well as returning investor Kakao Ventures, a subsidiary of Kakao Corporation, one of South Korea’s largest internet firms.</p>
<p>Dable (the name is a combination of “data” and “able”) currently serves more than 2,500 media outlets in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia. It has subsidiaries in Taiwan, which accounts for 70% of its overseas sales, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>The Series C brings Dable’s total funding so far to $20.5 million. So far, the company has taken a gradual approach to international expansion, co-founder and chief executive officer Chaehyun Lee told TechCrunch, first entering one or two markets and then waiting for business there to stabilize. In 2021, however, it plans to use its Series C to speed up the pace of its expansion, launching in Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, mainland China, Australia and Turkey before entering markets in Europe and the United States, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s goal is to become the &#8220;most utilized personalized recommendation platform in at last 30 countries by 2024.&#8221; Lee said it also has plans to transform into a media tech company by launching a content management system (CMS) next year.</p>
<p>Dable currently claims an average annual sales growth rate since founding of more than 50%, and says it reached $27.5 million in sales in 2020, up from 63% the previous year. Each month, it has a total of 540 million unique users and recommends five billion pieces of content, resulting in more than 100 million clicks. Dable also says its average annual sales growth rate since founding is more than 50%, and in that 2020, it reached $27.5 million in sales, up 63% from the previous year.</p>
<p>Before launching Dable, Lee and three other members of its founding team worked at RecoPick, a recommendation engine developer operated by SK Telecom subsidiary SK Planet. For media outlets, Dable offers two big data and machine learning-based products: Dable News to make personalized recommendations of content, including articles, to visitors, and Dable Native Ad, which draws on ad networks including Google, MSN and Kakao.</p>
<p>A third product, called karamel.ai, is an ad-targeting solution for e-commerce platforms that also makes personalized product recommendations.</p>

<p>Dable’s main rivals include Taboola and Outbrain, both of which are headquartered in New York (and recently called off a merger), but also do business in Asian markets, and Tokyo-based Popin, which also serves clients in Japan and Taiwan.</p>
<p>Lee said Dable proves the competitiveness of its products by running A/B tests to compare the performance of competitors against Dable’s recommendations and see which one results in the most clickthroughs. It also does A/B testing to compare the performance of articles picked by editors against ones that were recommended by Dable’s algorithms.</p>
<p>Dable also provides algorithms that allow clients more flexibility in what kind of personalized content they display, which is a selling point as media companies try to recover from the massive drop in ad spending precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, Dable’s Related Articles algorithm is based on content that visitors have already viewed, while its Perused Article algorithm gauges how interested visitors are in certain articles based on metrics like how much time they spent reading them. It also has another algorithm that displays the most viewed articles based on gender and age groups.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Noopl looks like one of the more interesting hardware startups to come out of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> day one. The Sacramento-based company has designed an accessory that it says can help drown out background noise for users in a loud environment.</p>
<p>The little accessory sports a Lightning plug (it&#8217;s currently iOS only), which connects to the bottom of an iPhone. The little dongle features a trio of microphones, coupled with an audio signal processor designed to reduce background noise.</p>

<p>The Noopl app launches when the device is plugged in, setting up a connection with a pair of AirPods Pro. It’s designed to utilize head tracking to determine the direction the wearer is facing, in order to offer clearer sound in that direction. The app can then be used to broaden the direction beam and adjust volume.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Steven Verdooner and Kevin Snow, building on technology from Sydney’s National Acoustic Laboratories (NAL).</p>
<p>“The genesis for the idea occurred when Verdooner was at a noisy restaurant with his father and both of them experienced challenges hearing each other, even with the father’s state-of-the-art hearing aids in ‘restaurant mode,’ ” it writes in a press release. “Realizing an immense opportunity to potentially help millions of people, Verdooner partnered with NAL and a small team of seasoned scientists and engineers to create Noopl. Hearing industry veteran, Tim Trine, was brought on in 2020 as President and CEO to create a scalable technology platform, commercialize products, and grow the company.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/whatsapp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="whatsapp">WhatsApp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has enjoyed unrivaled reach in India for years. By mid-2019, the Facebook-owned app had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/26/whatsapp-india-users-400-million/">amassed over 400 million users in the country</a>. Its closest app rival at the time was YouTube, which, according to the company’s own statement and data from mobile insight firm App Annie, had about 260 million users in India then.</p>
<p>Things have changed dramatically since.</p>
<p>In the month of December, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/youtube" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="youtube">YouTube <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> had 425 million monthly active users on Android phones and tablets in India, according to App Annie, the data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch. In comparison, WhatsApp had 422 million monthly active users on Android in India last month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Factoring in the traction both these apps have garnered on iOS devices, WhatsApp still assumes a lead in India with 459 million active users<sup>1</sup>, but YouTube is not too far behind with 452 million users.</p>
<p>With China keeping its doors closed to U.S. tech giants, India emerged as the top market for Silicon Valley and Chinese companies looking to continue their growth in the last decade. India had about 50 million internet users in 2010, but it ended the decade with more than 600 million. Google and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> played their part to make this happen.</p>
<p>In the last four years, both Google and Facebook have invested in ways to bring the internet to people who are offline in India, a country of nearly 1.4 billion people. Google kickstarted a project to bring <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/07/google-says-over-8-million-people-use-its-free-wifi-service-at-railway-stations-in-india/">Wi-Fi to 400 railway stations</a> in the country and planned to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/23/google-station-indonesia/">extend this program to other public places</a>. Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/17/save-free-basics/?_ga=2.76173149.954111183.1610362407-37075995.1609086401">launched Free Basics in India</a>, and then &#8212; after the program was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/08/india-blocks-facebook-freebasics-net-neutrality/">banned in the country</a> &#8212; it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/04/facebooks-express-wi-fi-launches-commercially-in-india/">launched Express Wi-Fi</a>.</p>
<p>Both Google and Facebook, which identify India as their biggest market by users, have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/17/google-ends-its-free-wi-fi-program-station/">scaled down on their connectivity efforts</a> in recent years after India&#8217;s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, took it upon himself to bring the country online. After he succeeded, both the companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">bought multibillion-dollar</a> stakes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/facebook-reliance-jio/">in his firm</a>, Jio Platforms, which has amassed over 400 million subscribers.</p>
<p>Jio Platforms&#8217; cut-rate mobile data tariff has allowed hundreds of millions of people in India, where much of the online user base was previously too conscious about how much data they spent on the internet, to consume, worry-free, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/09/netflixs-biggest-competition-isnt-sleep-its-youtube/">hours of content on YouTube</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/17/tiktok-education-edutok-india/">other video platforms</a> in recent years. This growth might explain why <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">Google is doubling down</a> on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/youtube-launches-its-tiktok-rival-youtube-shorts-initially-in-india/">short-video apps</a>.</p>
<p>The new figures shared with TechCrunch illustrate a number of other findings about the Indian market. Even as WhatsApp’s growth has slowed<sup>2</sup> in India, it continues to enjoy an unprecedented loyalty among its users.</p>
<p>More than 95% of WhatsApp’s monthly active users in India use the app each day, and nearly its entire user base checks the app at least once a week. In comparison, three-fourths of YouTube’s monthly active users in India are also its daily active users.</p>
<p>The data also showed that Google’s eponymous app as well as Chrome &#8212; both of which, like YouTube, ship pre-installed<sup>3</sup> on most Android smartphones &#8212; has also surpassed over 400 million monthly active users in India in recent months. Facebook&#8217;s app, in comparison, had about 325 million monthly active users in India last month.</p>
<p>When asked for comment, a Google spokesperson pointed TechCrunch to <a href="https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/digital/youtube-reaches-over-325-million-18-viewers-in-india/78906708">a report from Comscore last year</a>, which estimated that YouTube had about 325 million monthly unique users in India in May 2020.</p>
<p>A separate report by research firm Media Partners Asia on Monday estimated that YouTube commanded 43% of the revenue generated in the online video market in India last year (about $1.4 billion). Disney+ Hotstar assumed 16% of the market, while Netflix had 14%.</p>

<hr />
<h5><em><sup>1 For simplicity, I have not factored in the traction WhatsApp Business and YouTube Kids apps have received in India. WhatsApp and YouTube also maintain apps on KaiOS, which powers JioPhone feature handsets in India. At last count &#8212; which was a long time ago &#8212; more than 40 million JioPhone handsets had shipped in India. TechCrunch could not determine the inroads any app has made on this platform. Additionally, the figures of YouTube on Android (phones and tablets) and iOS (iPhone and iPad) will likely have an overlap. The same is not true of WhatsApp, which restricts one phone number to one account. So if I have WhatsApp installed on an iPhone with my primary phone number, I can&#8217;t use WhatsApp with the same number on an Android phone &#8212; at least not concurrently.</sup></em></h5>
<h5><em><sup>2 WhatsApp Business appears to be growing fine, having amassed over 50 million users in India. And some caveats from No. 1 also apply here.</sup></em></h5>
<h5><em><sup>3 Users still have to engage with the app for App Annie and other mobile insight firms to count them as active. So while pre-installing the app provides Google an unprecedented distribution, their apps still have to win over users.</sup></em></h5>
