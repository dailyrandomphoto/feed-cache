										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jan Bednar started <a href="https://www.shipmonk.com/">ShipMonk</a> with $70,000 in winnings from a string of student business plan competitions and launched the business that just closed on $290 million in new funding from a small warehouse with no air conditioning in the middle of Florida.</p>
<p>While Bednar&#8217;s new offices are still inside the warehouse his company operates, they now have air conditioning&#8230; and a $290 million financing round from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/summit-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="summit-partners">Summit Partners <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to grow its business.</p>
<p>The Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.-based ShipMonk provides a slew of shipping and logistics services for small to medium-sized eCommerce businesses and right now &#8212; given the continuing COVID-19 pandemic &#8212; business is good.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We help SMBs and mid-market direct to consumer companies manage their supply chains. Help get their products from suppliers to facilities and connect with all of their sales channels including B2B … order management, transportation management, reverse logistics,&#8221; said Bednar. </span></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s largest customers can book anywhere from $150 million to $250 million in revenue, but most of ShipMonk&#8217;s customers are actually small businesses pulling in between $1 million and $10 million on average.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s for these businesses that ShipMonk will fill its warehouses in Pennsylvania, California and Florida with 60,000 stock keeping units &#8212; managing around 50 different items for each customer it serves.</p>
<p>Bednar said ShipMonk would use the new cash to continue to upgrade its automation services and increase its staffing while also looking to expand internationally.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Profitable from the outset, ShipMonk just came off one of its best years, taking in upwards of $140 million in revenue. </span></p>
<p>Bednar began the business alone, but quickly brought on co-founders Kevin Seitz, who handles marketing for the business, and Bosch Jares, a fellow native of the Czech Republic (like Bednar) who serves as the company&#8217;s chief technology officer.</p>
<p>The story of how Jares joined the business is indicative of the type of hustle that&#8217;s allowed Bednar to grow a booming tech and logistics business from the Ft. Lauderdale beaches.</p>
<p>It was the Florida weather that sold Jares, a college student from one of the Czech Republic&#8217;s top technical institutions, on the move to ShipMonk. Bednar had posted an internship opportunity to work (unpaid, but offering room and board) at his company on a college job board in the middle of January. The applications came pouring in, but it was Jares, a programmer who had been working with computers since age 14 who took the slot.</p>
<p>The rest&#8230; is ShipMonk history. Jares built the bulk of the backend for the company&#8217;s initial services spending nearly 20 hours a day coding.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The thriftiness and hard work has won ShipMonk a booming business that has grown from 15,000 square feet of warehousing space into nearly 1 million square feet of storage space and a logistics service that spans the U.S. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Timing for the new round couldn&#8217;t be better, as National Retail Federation estimates are banking on a 20% bump in new online sales &#8212; which could reach $202 billion this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Friday alone raked in $9 billion in online purchases, according to data from Adobe Analytics provided by the company, and consumer spending is only going to continue to move online as the pandemic continues to threaten the health and safety of American consumers.  </span></p>
<p>ShipMonk&#8217;s technology integrates with shopping cart and marketplace platforms like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/shopify" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="shopify">Shopify <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to import orders across sales channels, which are then processed at the company&#8217;s warehouse locations. Customers can save up to 50% on their operational costs, according to the company.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe ShipMonk truly demonstrates the power of a bootstrapped, durable growth mindset. Jan identified a significant gap in the market and, together with the ShipMonk team, has scaled the business in a deliberate and capital efficient manner to address that need. The results have been impressive,” said Christopher Dean, a Managing Director at Summit Partners who is taking a seat on the company&#8217;s board. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Conferences have &#8212; for better or worse (and if you&#8217;ve ever been trapped in a cavernous CES exhibition hall, you might say worse) &#8212; become a significant cornerstone of how industries engage with their audiences, whether they are comics superfans, or iOS developers, or insurance brokers. This year has undoubtedly seen a huge shift in how those conferences exist. The Covid-19 health pandemic has drastically curtailed travel and how people spend time in crowded places, decimating the wider event industry, <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/events-industry-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated</a> to be worth more than $1 trillion annually before Covid, in its wake.</p>
<p>Today, however, comes news of a significant round of funding for a startup that is showing one way out of the mess. <a href="https://www.bizzabo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bizzabo</a>, which provides a platform to plan and run both virtual and in-person conferences, from its earliest stages of conception and handling sponsorships, through to managing interactions between attendees, and provisioning the conference itself, has closed a round of $138 million &#8212; funding it will use to drive the growth of its business, said CEO Eran Ben-Shushan (who co-founded the company with Alon Alroy and Boaz Katz) in an interview, after seeing that business boom this year, running conferences for large businesses and event planners. (Its customers include companies like Uber, Gainsight, Github, WeWork, Accenture and actually &#8212; disclosure &#8211;TechCrunch.)</p>
<p>Revenue has grown 100%, with the number of events organized through Bizzabo up 65%, he said, with the number of attendees registering for events with Bizzabo up 500% and overall usage is up 150x.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;With a vaccine likely and more hybrid events in the future, we anticipate even greater growth,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Bizzabo has been the category leader, experiencing hyper-growth both pre-pandemic and during the virtual transition, we are excited to continue to lead the market forward by doubling down on product, technology, and user experience, to help organizations unlock the power of hybrid experiences.”</p>
<p>He said that will include the building of more tech to integrate virtual and in-person experiences, and tripling its engineering, product and experience teams, adding two new offices in Europe for the Tel Aviv-New York startup.</p>
<p>This Series E is being led by Insight Partners, the VC known for its big growth investments; previous backers Viola Growth, Next47, and OurCrowd also participated. Viola led Bizzabo&#8217;s previous round, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/bizzabo-series-d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$27 million Series D </a>in April 2019. Ben-Shushan did not disclose the valuation in this round except to say that it has grown by 400% since then. The company has raised some $195 million to date, and for some further context on valuation, recall that Hopin &#8212; another platform to help manage events online &#8212; last month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/hopin-raises-125m-for-its-online-events-platform-on-the-back-of-surging-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised $125 million at a $2 billion+ valuation</a>.</p>
<p>Bizzabo started life in 2011 positioning itself as the &#8220;Salesforce for events.&#8221; Leaning heavily on cloud architecture and providing integrations into the many productivity and communication tools that an event organizer might use, the idea was to provide a platform to knit all that together and give organizers a way of using apps and online services to extend touch points between and with attendees. That could take the form of registration software to sign people up and collect payments for would-be attendees; chatrooms for people at specific sessions, better ways for exhibitors and sponsors to connect with visitors, and for those visitors to connect with each other during and after the event.</p>
<p>All of that changed this year when key in-person events <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/gmsa-cancels-mobile-world-congress-due-to-coronavirus-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">started to get cancelled</a>. At first these just disappeared into a black hole with virtually nothing to replace them, and then gradually, as the year went on, organisers started to look for virtual alternatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;The virtual conference market was almost non-existent&#8221; before 2020, said Ben-Shushan. &#8220;Pre Covid, a fraction of events were virtual, less than 2% of total events. March 2020 started the ‘virtual transition period’ in which live events were no longer possible in most parts of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>That move dovetailed with a bigger shift in workplace communications: a huge surge of video use spearheaded by the likes of Zoom, Google, Microsoft and many others that had built platforms for people not just to speak to each other over the internet, but to see each other, too. While videoconferencing has been around for years, much of it was based around very costly hardware and software packages used mostly by large corporates. The big innovation was leveraging the growth of faster internet, better basic computers and cameras, and the cloud to make videoconferencing something anyone can use.</p>
<p>Event organisers seized the moment and the bigger events, which had already been offering streams of their live events to those who could not attend in person, started to think of how to shift the whole experience online. That was a whole new set of demands on organisers and those participating in the conferences, but turned out to be just one more thing to add in and consider for the likes of Bizzabo. It hasn&#8217;t rebuilt its platform but has just continued to extend what it does within in.</p>
<p>For example, it didn&#8217;t offer streaming as a core part of its service, but it&#8217;s very much a part of it now, in partnership with <a href="https://corp.kaltura.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaltura</a>, which provides live streaming technology as a service.</p>
<p>Interestingly, while a lot of that been in effort to &#8220;make up the difference&#8221; and has resulted in some interesting approaches to provide new, and sometimes even better, bridges between people, some Bizzabo does not think the live event should be left for dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our data shows that although there are meaningful advantages to virtual events (higher reach, lower production costs), event organizers and attendees want to go back to live events,&#8221; said Ben-Shusan. &#8220;2021 will mark a new era in the event industry &#8211; the hybrid era that integrates experiences of remote and live participants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hybrid will indeed be the name of the game, it seems, even if we still may have a lot of question marks over how big that game will be after all this is over. Inevitably, some events may never come back.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 has permanently transformed the professional events category,” said Matt Gatto, a Managing Director at Insight Partners, who will join the Bizzabo board of directors, in a statement. “Bizzabo’s impressive growth and momentum began pre-pandemic and accelerated during it as they launched the industry’s first end-to-end event technology solution. Their pedigree in both in-person and virtual events and their impressive execution capabilities have them well-positioned to lead this rapidly evolving space. We are excited to partner with their leadership team and to support them in this new phase of growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sifting through the trillions of molecules out there that might have powerful medicinal effects is a daunting task, but the solution biotech has found is to work smarter, not harder. <a href="https://www.genesistherapeutics.ai/index.html">Genesis Therapeutics</a> has a new simulation approach and cross-disciplinary team that has clearly made an impression: the company just raised a $52 million A round.</p>
<p>Genesis competed in the Startup Battlefield at Disrupt last year, impressing judges with its potential, and obviously others saw it as well — in particular Rock Springs Capital, which led the round.</p>
<p>Over the last few years many companies have been formed in the drug discovery space, powered by increased computing and simulation power that lets them determine the potential of molecules in treating certain diseases. At least that&#8217;s the theory. The reality is a bit messier, and while these companies can narrow the search, they can&#8217;t just say &#8220;here, a cure for Parkinson&#8217;s.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founder Evan Feinberg got into the field when an illness he inherited made traditional lab work, as an intern at a big pharma company, difficult for him. The computational side of the field, however, was more accessible and ended up absorbing him entirely.</p>
<p>He had dabbled in the area before and arrived at what he feels is a breakthrough in how molecules are represented digitally. Machine learning has, of course, accelerated work in many fields, biochemistry among them, but he felt that the potential of the technology had not been tapped.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think initially the attempts were to kind of cut and paste deep learning techniques, and represent molecules a lot like images, and classify them — like you&#8217;d say, this is a cat picture or this is not a cat picture,&#8221; he explained in an interview. &#8220;We represent the molecules more naturally: as graphs. A set of nodes or vertices, those are atoms, and things that connect them, those are bonds. But we&#8217;re representing them not just as <em>bond</em> or <em>no bond</em>, but with multiple contact types between atoms, spatial distances, more complex features.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="G3ELdGfwPd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/atomwises-machine-learning-based-drug-discovery-service-raises-123-million/">Atomwise&#8217;s machine learning-based drug discovery service raises $123 million</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Atomwise&#8217;s machine learning-based drug discovery service raises $123 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/atomwises-machine-learning-based-drug-discovery-service-raises-123-million/embed/#?secret=G3ELdGfwPd" data-secret="G3ELdGfwPd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The resulting representation is richer and more complex, a more complete picture of a molecule than you&#8217;d get from its chemical formula or a stick diagram showing the different structures and bonds. Because in the world of biochemistry, nothing is as simple as a diagram. Every molecule exists as a complicated, shifting 3D shape or conformation where important aspects like the distance between two carbon formations or bonding sites is subject to many factors. Genesis attempts to model as many of those factors as it can.</p>
<p>&#8220;Step one is the representation,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but the logical next step is, how does one leverage that representation to learn a function that takes an input and outputs a number, like binding affinity or solubility, or a vector that predicts multiple properties at once?&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the work they&#8217;ve focused on as a company — not just creating a better model molecule, but being able to put a theoretical molecule into simulation and say, it will do this, it won&#8217;t do this, it has this quality but not that one.</p>
<p>Some of this work may be done in partnerships, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201019005182/en/Genesis-Therapeutics-Enters-AI-driven-Multi-Target-Drug-Discovery-Partnership-with-Genentech">such as the one Genesis has struck up with Genentech</a>, but the teams could very well find drug candidates independent of those, and for that reason the company is also establishing an internal development process.</p>
<p>The $52M infusion ought to do a lot to push that forward, Feinberg wrote in an email:</p>
<p>&#8220;These funds allow us to execute on a number of critical objectives, most importantly further pioneering AI technologies for drug development and advancing our therapeutics pipeline. We will be hiring more top notch AI researchers, software engineers, medicinal chemists and biotech talent, as well as building our own research labs.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Flagship Pioneering raises $1.1 billion to spend on sustainability and health-focused biotech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/flagship-pioneering-raises-1-1-billion-to-spend-on-sustainability-and-health-focused-biotech/embed/#?secret=LcGaSNB3wo" data-secret="LcGaSNB3wo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Other companies are doing simulations as well and barking up the same tree, but Feinberg says Genesis has at least two legs up on them, despite the competition raising hundreds of millions and existing for years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re the only company in the space that&#8217;s working at the intersection of modern deep neural network approaches and biophysical simulation — conformational change of ligands and proteins,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And we&#8217;re bringing this super technical platform to experts who have taken FDA-approved drugs to market. We&#8217;ve seen tremendous value creation just from that — the chemists inform the AI too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The recent breakthrough of AlphaFold, which is performing the complex task of simulation protein folding far faster than any previous system, is as exciting to Feinberg as to everyone else in the field.</p>
<p>&#8220;As scientists, we are incredibly excited by recent progress in protein structure prediction. It is an important basic science advance that will ultimately have important downstream benefits to the development of novel therapeutics,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Since our Dynamic PotentialNet technology is unique in how it leverages 3D structural information of proteins, computational protein folding &#8212; similar to recent progress in cryo-EM &#8212; is a nice complementary tailwind for the Genesis AI Platform. We applaud all efforts to make protein structure more accessible such that therapeutics can be more easily developed for patients of all conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also participating in the funding round were T. Rowe Price Associates, Andreessen Horowitz (who led the seed round), Menlo Ventures, and Radical Ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK government has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-authorises-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine">approved</a> the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine against COVID-19 for emergency use, following the recommendation of the national medicines regulator.</p>
<p>The UK is the first country to approve the vaccine for widespread use &#8212; paving the way for some of the most &#8220;high risk&#8221; citizens, such as elderly care home residents and front-line healthcare workers, to get the jab before the end of the year.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55145696">BBC</a> reports that the UK&#8217;s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has said the vaccine is safe to be rolled out from next week. Though it&#8217;s not yet clear exactly who will get the first doses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The request for emergency authorization was submitted by BioNTech and Pfizer to the MHRA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/pfizer-and-biontech-to-submit-request-for-emergency-use-approval-of-their-covid-19-vaccine-today/">last month</a> &#8212; as well as to regulators in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan and the U.S., none of which has yet given the go ahead.</p>
<p>In a statement, Albert Bourla, chairman and CEO of Pfizer, described the Emergency Use Authorization in the U.K. as &#8220;a historic moment in the fight against COVID-19&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This authorization is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win, and we applaud the MHRA for their ability to conduct a careful assessment and take timely action to help protect the people of the U.K.,” he said. “As we anticipate further authorizations and approvals, we are focused on moving with the same level of urgency to safely supply a high-quality vaccine around the world. With thousands of people becoming infected, every day matters in the collective race to end this devastating pandemic.”</p>
<p>The UK approval is based on trial data, including a worldwide Phase 3 clinical study carried out by BioNTech/Pfizer  which demonstrated an efficacy rate for the vaccine of 95% and raised no serious safety concerns.</p>
<p>The vaccine was also shown to be effective both in participants who had not previously contracted the SARS-CoV-2 virus and those who had &#8212; based on measuring efficacy seven days after the second dose.</p>
<p>Efficacy was also reported as consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics, with an observed efficacy in adults age 65 and over of more than 94%, the companies said.</p>
<p>UK prime minister Boris Johnson tweeted the news of the formal authorization this morning &#8212; writing that the vaccine will &#8220;begin to be made available across the UK from next week&#8221;. (A <a href="https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1334052433807482881">second tweet</a> anticipated how vaccination in general will &#8220;ultimately&#8221; enable a return to economic life as usual.)</p>

<p>&mdash; Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) <a href="https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1334052432603729921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The UK has ordered 40M doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, or enough vaccine for 20M people (as it requires two doses), though it will take time for the country to receive all the doses ordered.</p>
<p>&#8220;The delivery of the 40 million doses will occur throughout 2020 and 2021, in stages, to ensure an equitable allocation of vaccines across the geographies with executed contracts,&#8221; the companies wrote in a press release.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that the vaccine is authorized in the U.K., the companies will take immediate action to begin the delivery of vaccine doses. The first doses are expected to arrive in the U.K. in the coming days, with complete delivery fulfilment expected in 2021,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s National Health Service is gearing up for what NHS chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, described as &#8220;the largest-scale vaccination campaign in our country&#8217;s history&#8221;. Per the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55145696">BBC</a>, some 50 hospitals are on standby and vaccination centers in venues such as conference centres are also being set up.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1334072677053521920">comments</a> to journalists this morning, health secretary Matt Hancock said 800,000 doses of the virus will be available next week, with the bulk of the rollout coming in the new year. &#8220;We&#8217;ll deploy it at the speed that it&#8217;s manufactured,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Hancock said priority for the first batch of jabs will be given to &#8220;the most elderly&#8221; and people in care homes, including their carers. &#8220;Then essentially it comes down the age range. NHS staff are also high on that priority list, and also the clinically extremely vulnerable&#8230; those that are particularly vulnerable to coronavirus,&#8221; he added.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Help is on its way. </p>
<p>The MHRA has formally authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for Covid-19. </p>
<p>The NHS stands ready to start vaccinating early next week. </p>
<p>The UK is the first country in the world to have a clinically approved vaccine for supply.</p>
<p>&mdash; Matt Hancock (@MattHancock) <a href="https://twitter.com/MattHancock/status/1334030049788518401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The vaccine requires two doses taken 21 days apart. Speaking at a press conference today, officials from the MHRA and the UK&#8217;s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation confirmed full immunity comes seven days after the second dose, although they noted partial immunity can arise a number of days after taking the first dose.</p>
<p>In the press conference the MHRA&#8217;s CEO, Dr June Raine, said the public can have &#8220;absolute confidence&#8221; in the standards of checks carried out on the data which led to the vaccine&#8217;s approval &#8212; describing them as &#8220;equivalent&#8221; to those ongoing at international counterparts such as the US&#8217; Food and Drug Administration, which has not yet given the go ahead for use.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s speed was down to months of preparation, starting in the summer &#8212; such as mounting teams and building capacity so staff could work in parallel, she said.</p>
<p>Asked whether brexit had anything to do with the regulator authorizing the vaccine quicker than EU counterparts &#8212; something <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/02/hancock-brexit-helped-uk-to-speedy-approval-of-covid-vaccine?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Hancock has claimed</a> &#8212; Raine rather said it had benefitted from being able to use provisions under European law that exist until January 1 (when the brexit transition period ends).</p>
<p>The MHRA&#8217;s speedy approval was dependent on access to rolling data and expertise, she said &#8212; raising questions about whether the UK&#8217;s impending exit from the EU will slow down approval of additional COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our progress has been totally dependent on the availability of data in our rolling review and the rigorous assessment and independent advice we have received so I hope that clarifies the point about the European relationship,&#8221; Raine added.</p>
<p>JVCI officials said operational constraints associated with the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine&#8217;s requirement for very cold storage (-70 degrees) could lead to some &#8220;flexibility&#8221; in implementing the first phase of the vaccination program &#8212; which otherwise intends it to be offered to priority groups in the following order:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081597" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081597" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2081597" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-02-at-11.14.02.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="448" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-02-at-11.14.02.png 845w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-02-at-11.14.02.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-02-at-11.14.02.png?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-02-at-11.14.02.png?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-02-at-11.14.02.png?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-02-at-11.14.02.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2081597" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: MHRA/JVCI press conference slide</p></div></p>
<p>So it could mean, for example, that front line healthcare staff get bumped up if it&#8217;s easier to supply the vaccine to them as a result of cold storage facilities where they work. However the officials also noted that the vaccine is stable for a short period between 2-8 degrees &#8212; which they suggested will help with the challenge of distribution in care homes.</p>
<p>The UK is obtaining its supply of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine from within the EU &#8212; from a manufacturing facility in Belgium. It&#8217;s not clear whether the impending end of the Brexit transition period will pose any logistical challenges to a smooth future supply of the vaccine &#8212; by putting a brake on Hancock&#8217;s plan to roll it out at the pace it&#8217;s manufactured. This is because negotiations are ongoing between the UK and the EU over a possible post-brexit trade deal, with concerns of major border delays resulting from customs checks in the event of no deal.</p>
<p>Another remaining (non-UK specific) question is how long the vaccine&#8217;s protection lasts. Given how quickly the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine has been developed &#8212; in a matter of months &#8212; there&#8217;s no long term data available to answer that yet.</p>
<p>The same is true of COVID-19 vaccine candidates being developed by other companies.</p>
<p>“The Emergency Use Authorization in the U.K. will mark the first time citizens outside of the trials will have the opportunity to be immunized against COVID-19,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and co-founder of BioNTech in a supporting statement. “We believe that the roll-out of the vaccination program in the U.K. will reduce the number of people in the high-risk population being hospitalized.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our aim is to bring a safe and effective vaccine upon approval to the people who need it. The data submitted to regulatory agencies around the world are the result of a scientifically rigorous and highly ethical research and development program.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://monzo.com/">Monzo</a>, the U.K. challenger bank now with more than 4.8 million customers, has closed another £60 million in funding, priced the same as and effectively an extension of the its previous top-up round in June.</p>
<p>This saw Monzo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/monzo-confirms-60m-down-round/">valued by private investors at around £1.2 billion</a>, marked by industry observers as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/monzo-confirms-60m-down-round/">down round</a>. It was lower than the upstart bank&#8217;s previous &#8212; perhaps overheated &#8212; valuation, before the Coronavirus pandemic skewed leverage in favour of investors or forced a legitimate fintech market correction, depending on your perspective.</p>
<p>The new funding comes from a clutch of new backers including Deliveroo and Stripe investor Novator, Kaiser, and TED Global, as well as existing investor Goodwater. They join the likes of Y Combinator, General Catalyst, Accel, Passion, Thrive and Stripe, who all re-invested earlier this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It means Monzo has raised £125 million in funding since COVID-19 struck (an additional £5 million was quietly added during the last top up), and this current extension will be seen as good news for the bank as it looks to continue growing and increasing revenue lines beyond interchange fees.</p>
<p>To that end, Monzo shared some latest numbers with TechCrunch. In addition to approaching 5 million customers overall, it now has more than 60,000 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/monzo-business-bank-accounts/">business users</a> &#8212; up from 25,000 signups in June &#8212; and more than 100,000 customers across its paid-for current accounts, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/monzo-plus/">Monzo Plus</a> and Monzo Premium.</p>

<p>Adds Monzo CEO, TS Anil, in a statement given to TechCrunch: “We’ve raised £125 million this year, achieved strong organic growth and are now nearing five million customers, all while becoming the most switched to bank in the U.K. and the top rated for overall service. This news demonstrates the confidence that both our customers and investors have in Monzo”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it has been a challenging time for Monzo, as it, along with many other fintech companies, has had to weather the coronavirus crisis and resulting economic downturn. This included utilising the U.K. furlough scheme and subsequently making around 80 employees redundant in the Summer. In addition, there was a round of U.S. layoffs and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/monzo-to-shutter-las-vegas/">shuttering</a> of its Las Vegas-based customer support office.</p>

<p>Like some other banks and fintechs, the coronavirus crisis has resulted in Monzo seeing customer card spend reduce at home and (of course) abroad, meaning it is generating less revenue from interchange fees.</p>
<p>Separately, in May, Monzo co-founder Tom Blomfield announced internally that he was stepping down as CEO of the U.K. challenger bank to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/monzo-co-founder-tom-blomfield-moves-from-uk-ceo-role-to-president/">take up the newly created role of president</a>. He was replaced as U.K. CEO by then U.S. CEO Anil, who also joined Monzo&#8217;s board in replacement of Blomfield.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify is today launching its <a href="http://www.spotify.com/wrapped">2020 Wrapped</a> personalized experience &#8212; the company&#8217;s popular year-end review of users&#8217; favorite artists, songs, genres, and podcasts. This year, however, Spotify is making a few changes. For starters, Wrapped will be exclusively available on mobile for Spotify users, while a web experience will offer a version of Wrapped for non-Spotify users for the first time. To reflect Spotify&#8217;s continuing investment in podcasts, Wrapped will also this year include a deeper look into users&#8217; podcast listening habits. And it will include new features, like in-app quizzes, a &#8220;Story of Your 2020&#8221; dedicated to users&#8217; top song of the year, new Wrapped badges, personalized playlists, customization options for social sharing, and other additions.</p>
<p>The feature will launch in the Spotify mobile app for iOS and Android in global markets to give users their year-end insights. But non-users will get a taste of Wrapped with a web version, where Spotify will share its broader global listening trends, including the most-streamed artist, top three podcasts, and other popular music insights.</p>

<p>Spotify on Tuesday <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-12-01/the-trends-that-shaped-streaming-in-2020/">had shared</a> some of these trends, noting that Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny had claimed the top spot with more than 8.3 billion streams in 2020. The top three podcasts, meanwhile, were The Joe Rogan Experience, TED Talks Daily and The Daily.</p>
<p>This year, podcasts got more detailed in Spotify Wrapped, as well. Though the feature had included podcast insights <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/05/spotify-wrapped-expands-to-include-your-favorite-music-from-the-decade-plus-podcaster-metrics/">in prior years</a>, this aspect of the experience is being expanded in 2020 to include added metrics, like how many minutes users spent listening to podcasts in 2020 and the most &#8220;binge-worthy&#8221; podcasts of the year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081043" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081043" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2081043" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Podcast-binge-listen.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Podcast-binge-listen.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Podcast-binge-listen.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Podcast-binge-listen.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Podcast-binge-listen.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Podcast-binge-listen.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Podcast-binge-listen.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Podcast-binge-listen.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Podcast-binge-listen.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2081043" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>A new in-app quizzes feature, meanwhile, will allow users to guess before the trends Wrapped reveals. These quizzes will let Spotify listeners guess which were their top podcasts, top artists and even what decade&#8217;s songs they streamed the most. Users will also be able to see what new genres they discovered during the year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081045" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081045" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2081045" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Quiz-My-Top-Artist-Share-card.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Quiz-My-Top-Artist-Share-card.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Quiz-My-Top-Artist-Share-card.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Quiz-My-Top-Artist-Share-card.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Quiz-My-Top-Artist-Share-card.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Quiz-My-Top-Artist-Share-card.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Quiz-My-Top-Artist-Share-card.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Quiz-My-Top-Artist-Share-card.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Quiz-My-Top-Artist-Share-card.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2081045" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Stories, naturally, will make an appearance in this year&#8217;s Wrapped, too. The company was recently spotted as testing a Stories feature in its app &#8212; a continuation of tests Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/13/spotify-is-testing-its-own-version-of-stories-called-storyline/">began last year with Storylines </a>and again in January 2020, when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/spotify-test-lets-influencers-post-stories-to-introduce-their-own-playlists/">it first began to allow influencers to post Stories</a> to introduce their playlists. Now, those influencers<a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-stories-playlist-test-artists-202540428.html"> also include musicians themselves</a>, according to the latest tests.</p>
<p>In Wrapped, Spotify is introducing &#8220;Story of Your 2020,&#8221; which shows your top song from the year from its first stream to its 100th stream and several milestones in between.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081048" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081048" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2081048" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-Song-Story-of-your-song.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-Song-Story-of-your-song.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-Song-Story-of-your-song.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-Song-Story-of-your-song.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-Song-Story-of-your-song.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-Song-Story-of-your-song.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-Song-Story-of-your-song.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-Song-Story-of-your-song.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-Song-Story-of-your-song.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2081048" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Premium users will gain access to new badges this year based on how they listened. Some will earn the &#8220;Tastemaker&#8221; badge, if their playlists gained followers; others will earn a &#8220;Pioneer&#8221; badge for listening to songs first, before they hit 50,000 streams. The third badge, &#8220;Collector,&#8221; will be awarded to those who added some number of songs to their playlists this year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081044" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081044" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2081044" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Premium-badges.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Premium-badges.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Premium-badges.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Premium-badges.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Premium-badges.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Premium-badges.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Premium-badges.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Premium-badges.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Premium-badges.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2081044" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Along with Wrapped, users will get access to three new personalized playlists. One, called Your Top Songs, features users&#8217; favorite tracks from the year. Missed Hits, meanwhile, will recommend popular songs in 2020 that you didn&#8217;t listen to, but Spotify thinks you would like. And for listeners in the U.S., U.K., Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, a third playlist called On Record will introduce a mixed media experience that highlights users&#8217; top 2020 artists.</p>
<p>As always, a big part of Wrapped is the social sharing component. This year, users will be able to personalize their Wrapped sharing card by picking from among four color choices before posting it to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat or Twitter.</p>
<p>2020 Wrapped arrives today on iOS and Android. Later today, Spotify will also roll out its Wrapped creator experience for <a href="http://spotifyforpodcasters.com/">podcasters</a> and <a href="http://spotifyforartists.com/">artists</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.revolut.com">Revolut</a> has two new features this week. First, the company is launching a web app for its regular users — not just business users. Second, in the U.K., <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/revolut" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="revolut">Revolut <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has partnered with <a href="https://www.modulrfinance.com">Modulr</a> to let you receive your salary a day early.</p>
<p>Revolut has historically focused its efforts on its mobile app. If you have a business account with Revolut, you know that you can see your past transactions and access your account from a regular web browser. But the company’s 13 million customers couldn’t access their account from a computer.</p>
<p>Everyone can now head over to <a href="https://app.revolut.com/start">Revolut’s web app</a> and sign in to view their transaction history and cards. From this interface, you can freeze and unfreeze a debit card and control card features. The web app also supports account top-ups using a bank transfer, a card payment or Apple Pay (in Safari).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By default, Revolut sends a push notification so that you can authorize web browser access. But if you’ve lost your phone, you can also choose to receive a security code via email.</p>
<p>You’ll still have to use the mobile app to access some features, but it’s a start.</p>
<p>As for users living in the U.K., Revolut is doubling down on its partnership with Modulr to send your salary a bit early. Salaries made over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BACS">Bacs payment scheme</a> will arrive a day earlier than usual — most people are paid using this method in the U.K. This is all about optimizing payment infrastructure, and it could be particularly helpful before a long holiday weekend.</p>
<p>This should also benefit Revolut directly as many users have been using Revolut in addition to a regular bank account. Adding features that make it easier to ditch your bank account could boost the company’s usage numbers. And that could help the company grow its card interchange fees, subscription revenue and other sources of revenue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.ju.st/en-us">Eat Just</a> will start offering lab-grown chicken meat in Singapore after gaining regulatory approval from the Singapore Food Agency (SFA). The cell-cultured chicken will eventually be produced under Eat Just’s new GOOD Meat brand through partnerships with local manufacturers and go on sale to restaurants before it is available to consumers.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">While there are plenty of other companies working on lab-grown meats using various techniques, Eat Just describes the Singapore government’s review and regulatory approval as a &#8220;world first.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">No chickens were killed to obtain the cell line used to produce Eat Just’s cultured meat, global head of communications Andrew Noyes told TechCrunch. Instead, the process starts with cell isolation, where cells are sourced through methods that can include a biopsy from a live animal. After the cells are cultured, they are transferred into a bioreactor, fed with a proprietary mix of proteins, amino acids, minerals, sugars, salts and other nutrients and then harvested after they achieve enough density.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">The company said it went through 20 productions runs of cell-cultured chicken in 1,200-liter bioreactors to prove the consistency of its manufacturing process. Eat Just also said no antibiotics were used and that its cultured chicken has an &#8220;extremely low and significantly cleaner microbiological content than conventional chicken.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">Noyes said the company is already working with a restaurant to add its GOOD Meat chicken to their menu, and hopes to announce a launch date soon.</p>

<p>In Eat Just&#8217;s announcement today, chief executive officer Josh Tetrick said, &#8220;Singapore has long been a leader in innovation of all kinds, from information technology to biologics to now leading the world in building a healthier, safer food system.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">The government is currently engaged in an initiative, called &#8220;30 by 30,&#8221; to <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/strengthening-food-security-with-rd">produce 30% of the country’s food supply</a> locally by 2030. Spearheaded by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), the initiative was prompted because Singapore currently imports over 90% of its food, which makes it vulnerable to export bans or the logistics issues highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact. As part of &#8220;30 by 30,&#8221; the SFA and Agency for Science, Technology and Research has made $144 million SGD in research funding available.</p>
<p class="p1">Eat Just, whose other products include <a href="https://www.ju.st/en-us/products/consumer/egg/folded">a plant-based egg substitute</a>, announced last month it is partnering with Proterra Investment Partners Asia to launch a new Asian subsidiary. The partnership includes a factory in Singapore that received support from the government’s Economic Development board.</p>
<p class="p1">There are several factors driving demand for cultured meat and plant-based protein in Asian markets. The first is concerns about the safety of meat from slaughterhouses that gained momentum during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic also highlighted vulnerabilities in the production and supply chain that can be potentially be avoided with lab-produced meat and meat alternatives.</p>

As in previous years, App Store editors selected the winners based on factors like the app&#8217;s quality, creative design, usability and use of Apple technology, among other things. The &#8220;Best of 2020&#8221; winners this year include a number of apps that helped people transition to a life spent at home. For example, home workout app Wakeout! won iPhone App of the Year, while Zoom snagged the top spot as the iPad App of the Year.</p>
<p>Disney+, which helped families keep kids entertained during coronavirus lockdowns, won for Apple TV App of the Year. The streaming service had just won &#8220;best app&#8221; in Google Play&#8217;s User Choice category, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/google-plays-best-of-2020-awards-highlight-the-stressful-year-its-been/">announced on Tuesday</a> alongside its other Play Store winners.</p>

<p>Top games of the year highlighted our collective need for escapism, often to fantasy worlds. This year, the list of game winners included Genshin Impact (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/google-plays-best-of-2020-awards-highlight-the-stressful-year-its-been/">also a Play Store &#8220;best game&#8221; winner</a>) for iPhone Game of the Year; Legends of Runeterra as iPad Game of the Year; Disco Elysium as Mac Game of the Year; Dandara Trials of Fear as Apple TV Game of the Year; and Sneaky Sasquatch as the Apple Arcade Game of the Year.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, productivity app Fantastical won as Apple&#8217;s Mac App of the Year, a reflection of our new work-from-home lifestyles.</p>
<p>A relaxation and sleep app, Endel, won Apple Watch App of the Year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081433" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081433" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2081433" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1.png 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2081433" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Endel</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not surprising to see another relaxation app win a top app of the year accolade. Google just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/google-plays-best-of-2020-awards-highlight-the-stressful-year-its-been/">awarded</a> sleep app, Loóna, the title of best app of 2020 on Tuesday, as well.</p>
<p>2020 has been a tough year filled with stressful events, including not only the COVID-19 pandemic, but Trump&#8217;s impeachment and November&#8217;s contentious U.S. presidential elections, the biggest stock market crash since &#8217;87, protests and riots over racial injustice, wildfires in Australia and the U.S. West, the Weinstein verdict, Brexit, the deadly Beirut explosion, violence in Delhi, the Hong Kong protests, locust swarms in East Africa and deaths of prominent figures like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Kobe Bryant Chadwick Boseman and others.</p>
<p>As Apple explained in its announcement, apps are a reflection of culture. And this year, they reflected people&#8217;s focus on self-care and mental health, remote work and learning, staying connected with family and friends, interactive and social gaming, and more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081436" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081436" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2081436" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pokemon-go-app-trend-of-2020.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pokemon-go-app-trend-of-2020.png 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pokemon-go-app-trend-of-2020.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pokemon-go-app-trend-of-2020.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pokemon-go-app-trend-of-2020.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pokemon-go-app-trend-of-2020.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pokemon-go-app-trend-of-2020.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pokemon-go-app-trend-of-2020.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2081436" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pokémon GO</p></div></p>
<p>Apple selected a handful of apps to reflect these &#8220;app trends,&#8221; including self-care app Shine, remote learning app Explain Everything Whiteboard, family messaging app Caribu, charitable giving app SharetheMeal and the revamped Pokémon GO, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/30/niantic-is-updating-pokemon-go-and-other-titles-to-support-indoor-gaming/">shifted to support indoor gaming.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;This year, more than ever before, some of our most creative and connected moments happened in apps. This was thanks to the amazing work of developers who introduced fresh, helpful app experiences throughout the year,&#8221; said Phil Schiller, Apple Fellow, in a statement. &#8220;Around the world, we saw remarkable efforts from so many developers, and these Best of 2020 winners are 15 outstanding examples of that innovation,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>This year&#8217;s &#8220;Best of&#8221; winners will receive the first-ever physical App Store Best of 2020 award, featuring the App Store logo set into 100% recycled aluminum, with the winner&#8217;s name on the side.</p>
<p>Apple also unveiled the most downloaded apps and games of the year, which, unlike its &#8220;best of&#8221; editorial selections, are a showcase of real consumer demand.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, these lists included remote work must-haves like Zoom and Gmail; a number of escapist games and, not coincidentally, pandemic simulator Plague, Inc.; the viral hit Among Us! ,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/aocs-among-us-stream-topped-435000-concurrent-viewers/">which even AOC live-streamed</a>; kids&#8217; &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/22/with-kids-and-adults-staying-at-home-are-virtual-worlds-ready-for-primetime/">metaverse&#8221;</a> platforms like Minecraft and Roblox; and the usual set of top social apps &#8212; this year led by TikTok, not a Facebook-owned app.</p>

It’s home to one of the hottest startup scenes in the world with endless successful companies emerging from the region. From 2018 to 2019, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/israels-maturing-cybersecurity-startup-ecosystem/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over $1.4B in funding went to Israeli cybersecurity startups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

When was this thing actually going to be released?</span></p>
<p>The answer, it seems, is today. The MagSafe Duo just appeared on Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHXF3AM/A/magsafe-duo-charger">own store</a> and, with delivery estimates as soon as this week, it looks like they&#8217;re shipping them immediately.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/adam-nash" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="adam-nash">Adam Nash, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a Silicon Valley-born-and-bred operator and investor, is back at it again.</p>
<p>Today, on his <a href="https://adamnash.blog/2020/12/01/just-getting-started/">personal blog</a>, he announced that he has started a consumer fintech company that has already garnered initial funding from Ribbit Capital, along with other &#8220;friends and angels&#8221; who appear to have also pitched into the round, including Box CEO Aaron Levie, Mighty Networks founder Gina Bianchini, Superhuman founder Rahul Vohra, and Amy Chang, who sold her startup Accompany to Cisco in 2018.</p>
<p>Nash didn&#8217;t reveal many details in the post or <a href="https://twitter.com/adamnash/status/1333895950037782528">later on Twitter</a>, saying he&#8217;ll have more to say when the company is closer to launching. All we really know at this point is that he cofounded the company with Alejandro Crosa, an Argentinian software engineer who most recently spent five months at Slack but logged more than three years at both Twitter and LinkedIn before that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nash said on Twitter that the two met at LinkedIn, where Nash was himself VP of product management for four years beginning in 2007. It&#8217;s a good detail to know, considering that Nash has logged time at a wide variety of tech outfits over the years, making it hard to guess at whom he knows and from where.</p>
<p>A computer science graduate of Stanford, where he later nabbed a master&#8217;s degree, Nash began his career interning at NASA, HP, and Trilogy before landing his first big job as a software engineer at Apple in 1996 (when former PepsiCo exec, John Sculley, was briefly running the place).</p>
<p>After moving on to a bubble-era company that no longer exists, Nash tried his hand at VC for the first time, joining Atlas Venture as an associate. To get more operating experience, he then jumped to eBay, where he was a director; LinkedIn, where he met Crosa; then Greylock, where he spent just over a year as an entrepreneur-in-residence (EIR) before joining the wealth-management startup <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wealthfront" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wealthfront">Wealthfront <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as its president and CEO.</p>
<p>A little more than four years later,  in 2016, Wealthfront&#8217;s original CEO and founder, Andy Rachleff, reclaimed the role. But Nash didn&#8217;t disappear from the scene. Instead, he rejoined Greylock as an EIR for another year before joining Dropbox shortly after it went public in 2018 as its VP of product and growth, leaving that post back in February to start his own thing, <a href="https://adamnash.blog/2020/02/28/a-new-year-a-new-adventure/">he said on his way out the door</a>.</p>
<p>That Nash would start a <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aax-b20d" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="aax-b20d">fintech <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> company specifically isn&#8217;t surprising, considering his involvement with Wealthfront, as well as some of the personal investments he has made in recent years.</p>
<p>In 2018, for example, he wrote a check to <a href="https://learnlux.com/">LearnLux</a>, a five-year-old, Boston-based educational startup that helps employees better understand their 401k, health savings accounts, and stock options. He is also an investor in <a href="https://humaninterest.com/">Human Interest</a>, a five-year-old, San Francisco-based startup that offers automated, paperless 401(k) plans.</p>
<p>Nash is also riding a very big wave.  According to Pitchbook, consumer fintech is on pace to attract a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/fintech-vc-keeps-getting-later-larger-and-more-expensive/">record amount</a> of venture funding in 2020, at least in North America and Europe.</p>
<p>Either way, it&#8217;s notable that Nash is trying his hand at starting a company from scratch for the first time in his career, and we&#8217;ll let you know more about what he&#8217;s building as soon as he&#8217;s ready to share more.</p>
<p>The little that Nash is saying publicly for now is that he and Crosa believe there is &#8220;still a lot more to do in consumer fintech, and that through software we can help bring purpose to the way people approach their financial lives.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Massachusetts lawmakers have voted to pass a new police reform bill that will ban police departments and public agencies from using facial recognition technology across the state.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/S2963?=11302020">bill was passed</a> by both the state&#8217;s House and Senate on Tuesday, a day after senior lawmakers announced an agreement that ended months of deadlock.</p>
<p>The police reform bill also bans the use of chokeholds and rubber bullets, and limits the use of chemical agents like tear gas, and also allows police officers to intervene to prevent the use of excessive and unreasonable force. But the bill does not remove qualified immunity for police, a controversial measure that shields serving police from legal action for misconduct, following objections from police groups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lawmakers brought the bill to the state legislature in the wake of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/diversity-equity-inclusion-overview/">the killing of George Floyd</a>, an unarmed Black man who was killed by a white Minneapolis police officer, since charged with his murder.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A beginner&#8217;s guide to diversity, equity and inclusion&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/diversity-equity-inclusion-overview/embed/#?secret=vQ6eJpIA85" data-secret="vQ6eJpIA85" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Critics have for years complained that facial recognition technology is flawed, biased and <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/facial-recognition-has-always-troubled-people-of-color-everyone-should-listen/">disproportionately misidentifies</a> people and communities of color. But the bill grants police an exception to run facial recognition searches against the state&#8217;s driver license database with a warrant. In granting that exception, the state will have to publish annual transparency figures on the number of searches made by officers.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Senate voted 28-12 to pass, and the House voted 92-67. The bill will now be sent to Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker for his signature.</p>
<p>Kade Crockford, who leads the Technology for Liberty program at the ACLU of Massachusetts, praised the bill&#8217;s passing.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one should have to fear the government tracking and identifying their face wherever they go, or facing wrongful arrest because of biased, error-prone technology,&#8221; said Crockford. In the last year, the ACLU of Massachusetts has worked with community organizations and legislators across the state to ban face surveillance in seven municipalities, from Boston to Springfield. We commend the legislature for advancing a bill to protect all Massachusetts residents from unregulated face surveillance technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the absence of privacy legislation from the federal government, laws curtailing the use of facial recognition are popping up on a state and city level. The patchwork nature of that legislation means that state and city laws have room to experiment, creating an array of blueprints for future laws that can be replicated elsewhere.</p>
<p>Portland, Oregon passed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facial-recognition-ban-portland-oregon/">broad ban on facial recognition tech</a> this September. The ban, one of the most aggressive in the nation, blocks city bureaus from using the technology but will also prohibit private companies from deploying facial recognition systems in public spaces. Months of clashes between protesters and aggressive law enforcement in that city raised the stakes on Portland&#8217;s ban.</p>
<p>Earlier bans in Oakland, San Francisco and Boston focused on forbidding their city governments from using the technology but, like Massachusetts, stopped short of limiting its use by private companies. San Francisco&#8217;s ban <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/san-francisco-facial-recognition-ban/">passed in May of last year</a>, making the international tech hub the first major city to ban the use of facial recognition by city agencies and police departments.</p>
<p>At the same time that cities across the U.S. are acting to limit the creep of biometric surveillance, those same systems are spreading at the federal level. In August, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) signed a contract for access to a facial recognition database <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/clearview-ai-ice-hsi-contract-2020/">created by Clearview AI</a>, a deeply controversial company that scrapes facial images from online sources, including social media sites.</p>
<p>While most activism against facial recognition only pertains to local issues, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/facial-recognition-lawsuit-vance-janecyk-bipa/">at least one state law</a> has proven powerful enough to make waves on a national scale. In Illinois, the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) has ensnared major tech companies including Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet for training facial recognition systems on Illinois residents without permission.</p>
<p><em>Updated with comment from the ACLU of Massachusetts.</em></p>

The ship could be in the air <a href="https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-flight-test-program-update-ypreparing-for-first-rocket-powered-flight-from-new-mexico/">as early as December 11</a>.</p>
<p>This flight will be the third for Unity out of the future passenger spaceport, but the last two have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/virgin-galactic-flies-second-spaceshiptwo-test-at-new-mexico-spaceport-clearing-the-way-for-powered-spaceflight/">gliding flights</a>, not propulsive ones. This will be the first time Unity has hit the throttle in nearly two years — back when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/13/virgin-galactic-touches-the-edge-of-space-with-mach-2-9-test-flight-of-spaceshiptwo/">touched the edge of space at something like Mach 2.9</a>.</p>
<p>Since then the company and its aircraft have moved home, from Mojave, California to the spaceport in New Mexico, where it hopes eventually passengers will come and lounge before taking off on a brief visit to space.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The glides, in which Unity is taken to a high altitude by a carrier craft, the VMS Eve, and let go to perform a controlled descent to Earth, show that everything is bolted on tightly and ready for the more substantial rigors of rocket thrust.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AcHgkr9w7e"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/virgin-galactic-flies-second-spaceshiptwo-test-at-new-mexico-spaceport-clearing-the-way-for-powered-spaceflight/">Virgin Galactic flies second SpaceShipTwo test at New Mexico spaceport, clearing the way for powered spaceflight</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Originally this powered flight was intended to happen a bit earlier in the year, but COVID-19-related precautions led to delays. But weather permitting, next week should see Unity flying again.</p>
<p>This flight won&#8217;t be strictly for testing purposes, though: It will be taking up several payloads under NASA&#8217;s Flight Opportunities Program, which contracts with smaller launch providers to perform experiments in and near space. Other aspiring space-travel companies, like Blue Origin, have also taken up payloads for brief visits to the edge of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Of course COVID-19 is still a serious issue, so Virgin Galactic is limiting exposure by minimizing people on site: no media or guests, only essential personnel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announces its acquisition of Slack, Amazon brings the Mac mini to the cloud and Google Maps gets a newsfeed. This is your Daily Crunch for December 1, 2020.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Salesforce buys <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/slack" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="slack">Slack <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> for $27.7B</strong></p>
<p>The acquisition, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/slacks-stock-climbs-on-possible-salesforce-acquisition/">first reported last month</a>, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">now official</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This is a match made in heaven,&#8221; said Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff. &#8220;Together, Salesforce and Slack will shape the future of enterprise software and transform the way everyone works in the all-digital, work-from-anywhere world.&#8221;</p>
<p>This cash-and-stock deal should make Salesforce a more serious competitor in the enterprise communication market. It also seems that Slack (which went public last year) was an obvious target for a takeover, due to an underwhelming stock price and a net loss of $147.6 million during the two quarters ending on July 31 of this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/?rac=true&amp;f=CA-EN">Lightspeed POS</a> just <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lightspeed-announces-acquisition-of-upserve-to-further-omnichannel-revolution-of-american-restaurant-industry-301183066.html">announced</a> the acquisition of <a href="https://upserve.com/r">Upserve</a>, expanding Lightspeed&#8217;s presence in the restaurant industry.</p>
<p>The company already offers cloud-based point-of-sale software for restaurants and other businesses. It <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2019/lightspeed-pos-ipo-canada/">went public in Canada</a> last year before recently <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lightspeed-announces-initial-public-offering-in-the-united-states-301126459.html">debuting on the New York Stock Exchange</a> and acquiring another point-of-sale company, ShopKeep, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/lightspeed-to-acquire-point-of-sale-rival-shopkeep-for-440-million/">for $440 million</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/swipely" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="swipely">Upserve <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> acquisition is similarly sized — Lightspeed will pay $123 million in cash, along with stock that will bring the total deal size to around $430 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Upserve was founded back in 2009 as Swipely, one of several startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/05/11/swipely/">encouraging users to share their purchase information with friends</a>. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/21/swipely-series-b/">shifted its offerings</a> to business tools around payments, marketing and loyalty, eventually <a href="https://finovate.com/swipely-rebrands-upserve-focus-serving-restaurants/">rebranding as Upserve</a> as it became increasingly focused on the restaurant market. It also <a href="https://upserve.com/restaurant-insider/upserve-partners-vista-equity-partners-new-strategic-investment-fuel-next-phase-growth/">raised funding from Vista Equity Partners</a>.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, Upserve brought in $40 million in revenue during the 12-month period ending on September 30. The deal is also supposed to grow Lightspeed&#8217;s footprint by 7,000 locations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Combining forces with Upserve is a strategic next-step in Lightspeed&#8217;s vision of providing the most advanced commerce platform to high-performing businesses around the world,&#8221; said Lightspeed founder and CEO Dax Dasilva in a statement. &#8220;We believe this acquisition will accelerate the product innovation that has enabled Lightspeed customers to tackle the greatest challenge to their industry in decades and will add exceptional leadership to our teams in anticipation of the economic recovery of the global hospitality industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The announcement also claims that the combination of Lightspeed and Upserve&#8217;s teams and technologies will &#8220;enable the industry to more easily navigate the new dining needs made permanent by the COVID-19 pandemic.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Elon Musk would consider leveraging Tesla&#8217;s mega $554 billion market cap to buy a legacy automaker, but only if it was on friendly terms, the billionaire entrepreneur said Tuesday in a wide-ranging interview with Axel Springer CEO Mathias Döpfner.</p>
<p>Musk, who received an award Tuesday from the media giant, discussed his various interests and businesses, notably SpaceX and Tesla, both of which he leads.</p>
<p>Döpfner noted that Tesla&#8217;s valuation far exceeds the market cap of incumbent automakers like BMW, Daimler and VW, which along with others in the industry once dismissed Musk&#8217;s ability to make electric vehicles mainstream. When asked if it would be a serious option to buy one of the legacy automakers, Musk said it was possible, but only under certain conditions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think we&#8217;re definitely not going to launch a hostile takeover,&#8221; Musk said. &#8220;So I suppose if there was a friendly one, if somebody said, &#8216;Hey, we think it would be a good idea to merge with Tesla,&#8217; we certainly could have that conversation. But, you know, we don&#8217;t want it to be a hostile takeover sort of situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tesla today sits in an enviable position — although Musk said once again that its share price is too high. The company, which will join the S&amp;P 500 Index on December 21, is now the most valuable automaker in the world, surpassing rivals that produce far more vehicles annually.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GGJk0Tv5E5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/tesla-gets-a-spot-on-the-sp-500/">Tesla gets a spot on the S&#038;P 500</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Investors have sunk money into Tesla shares largely because they view it more as a technology company than an automaker, even though the vast majority of its revenues today come from car sales.</p>
<p>Musk noted that automakers largely dismissed Tesla in its early days.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we first unveiled the Roadster in 2007, I mean, it was just basically, they just said, &#8216;Oh, well, you&#8217;re basically a bunch of fools,&#8217; &#8221; Musk remarked, adding that rivals are now far friendlier than in the past.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://scale.com/">Scale AI</a>, the four-year-old data labeling startup, has discovered that selling the picks and shovels needed to develop and apply artificial intelligence is big business.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company, which created a visual data labeling platform that uses software and people to label image, text, voice and video data <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">for companies building machine learning algorithms, has raised another $155 million. The funding round, led by Tiger Global, pushes Scale&#8217;s post-money valuation to more than $3.5 billion. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Importantly, Scale is now a &#8220;break even&#8221; business and is set up to continue to add employees and expand into new markets in a sustainable way, Scale&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Alexandr Wang told TechCrunch. Scale will use the funds to grow its workforce from 200 people to about 350 by the end of next year. (Those employee numbers don&#8217;t include the tens of thousands of contractors it uses to label data.) </span>It&#8217;s also focused on new markets and adding products and platform capabilities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Scale got its start by supplying autonomous vehicle companies with the labeled data needed to <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">train machine learning models to develop and deploy robotaxis, self-driving trucks and automated bots used in warehouses and on-demand delivery. Legacy automakers such as General Motors and Toyota, chipmaker Nvidia and a slew of AV startups, including Nuro and Zoox, have used its platform.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">More recently, Scale&#8217;s customers have spilled over into government, e-commerce, enterprise automation and robotics. Airbnb, OpenAI, DoorDash and Pinterest are some of its customers. That pace of expansion has accelerated in 2020, according to Wang. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;One thing that we saw, especially in the course of the past year, was that AI is going to be used for so many different things,&#8221; Wang said. &#8220;It&#8217;s like we&#8217;re just sort of really at the beginning of this and we want to be prepared for that as it happens.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Part of that preparation means evolving beyond being just a data labeler. Earlier this year, the company quietly launched Nucleus, an AI development platform that Wang describes as the &#8220;Google Photos for machine learning data sets.&#8221; Nucleus provides customers a way to organize, curate and manage massive data sets, giving companies a means to test their models and measure performance among other tasks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Nucleus is the first product of our future, I would say,&#8221; Wang said. &#8220;We definitely see that the next biggest bottleneck for a lot of our customers is, &#8216;how are they going to have the suite of tools and suite of infrastructure that exists today for building out software?&#8217; None of that exists for machine learning.&#8221;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The plan is to continue to build out Nucleus into a fully integrated platform that helps more companies be able to do AI, Wang said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scale made its first acquisition to support Nucleus with the purchase of a four-person startup called Helia. The team, which has expertise in real-time video and neural network training, will support Nucleus.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The one thing that we were noticing across our whole customer base was that more and more customers, even beyond just the self-drive folks were wanting to do AI on real-time video. And so it was becoming this expertise that we knew just wasn&#8217;t going to go away.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today after the bell, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Salesforce-Announces-Strong-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2021-Results/default.aspx">reported</a> its third-quarter earnings for its fiscal 2021, a period that ended October 31, 2020. The CRM giant reported top-line revenue of $5.42 billion, up 20% from the year-ago period. Salesforce also had net income of $1.08 billion and earnings per share of $1.15.</p>
<p>Analysts had expected the company to earn $0.75 per share off revenues of $5.25 billion, according <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRM/analysis?p=CRM">to Yahoo Finance</a>.</p>
<p>Shares of Salesforce were off after-hours, falling around 3.6% at the time of writing. It was not clear if the company&#8217;s share price performance was due to its Q3 results, or its raised Q4 guidance, or its new fiscal 2022 expectations, or the newly announced <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/slack" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="slack">Slack <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> deal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Salesforce buys Slack in a $27.7B megadeal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/embed/#?secret=sAGCqMXvvO" data-secret="sAGCqMXvvO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">As TechCrunch reported moments ago</a>, Salesforce will buy Slack for $27.7 billion in a cash and stock deal that was fully priced into shares of the smaller company, which dropped a little over a point on the news, having risen by nearly 50% since the deal&#8217;s existence first leaked.</p>
<p>Holders of Slack will be rewarded for their patience. Now it&#8217;s up to Salesforce leadership to prove that the huge buy will help boost the company&#8217;s growth.</p>
<p>Salesforce told investors today that it anticipates Q4 fiscal 2021 revenues of $5.665 billion to $5.675 billion, which works out to growth of around 17% from the year-ago period. The company also anticipates that it will grow around 17% in Q1 of its fiscal 2022.</p>
<p>But Salesforce expects to grow 21% in all of its fiscal 2022. How does it intend to accelerate? Its projections include Slack:</p>
<blockquote><p>Full Year FY22 revenue guidance includes contributions from Slack Technologies, Inc. of approximately $600 million, net of purchase accounting, and assumes a closing date in late Q2 and Acumen Solutions, Inc. of approximately $150 million, net of purchase accounting, and assumes a closing date within Q2.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, Salesforce investors, after two anticipated quarters of 17% growth coming up, your company will accelerate up to 21% growth for the next fiscal year. Is that worth $27.7 billion?</p>
