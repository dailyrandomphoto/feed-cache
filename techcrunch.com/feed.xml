										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The rise and impact of influencers has been one of the biggest forces in how the modern online social landscape has evolved in recent times. Now, a company that&#8217;s tapping into that influencer juggernaut, and specifically how it is playing out in the world of marketing, is announcing a huge round of funding to keep riding that wave.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.mavrck.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mavrck</a>, which has built a platform for brands and media companies to source and engage with influencers for marketing campaigns, has raised $120 million in growth equity from a single backer, <span class="s1">Summit Partners</span>. Mavrck will use the capital to continue investing in its platform, and for business development. It is not disclosing valuation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We are going to use this investment to double down on our industry leading platform and double our team,&#8221; Lyle Stevens, the co-founder and CEO, said in an interview over email. &#8220;In doing so, we will become the most intelligent platform in the market with the petabytes of historical data we have&#8230; This data will power recommendation engines in the Mavrck platform that help connect enterprise marketers with the right creators, the right way, at the right cost.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248665" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">The company today already has some strong traction and momentum.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stevens said that the company&#8217;s &#8220;Influencer Index&#8221; &#8212; as its directory is called &#8212; currently lists &#8220;millions of contactable macro- and micro- influencers around the globe and across all major social platforms.&#8221; Some 500 brands and 5,000 marketers are already using Mavrck to connect with those influencers. And in all, since being founded 2014, Mavrck has connected brands with more than 3 million influencers and creators, reaching more than 240 million consumers, primarily through &#8220;native&#8221; sponsored content across various media including videos and photos, blogs and podcasts.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><span class="im">Stevens said that the core of Mavrck&#8217;s technology is based around patented algorithms and first-party opt-in data, which brands use to find and connect with influencers that speak to the audiences that the marketers are hoping to reach. It has build some 25 different search filters &#8212; covering areas like </span>audience demographics, historical performance, fraud risk &#8212; to whittle down the wider directory to those that match what they need. It then provides a platform for them to engage with each other to work through projects and eventually pay them. &#8220;We also have the technology for our customers to invite or import their existing influencer and consumer relationships to develop their own ambassador network,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Influencer marketing spend has become a very big business in the wider area of marketing, rising 55% in the last year, with two-thirds of brands now deploying an influencer marketing strategy in some way. It&#8217;s now estimated to be a $100 billion industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alongside this, Stevens notes that the creator economy is &#8220;expanding rapidly, as more and more people have turned to content creation as a secondary or primary source of income.&#8221; He cites figures from eMarketer that estimated that in 2020, 50 million people identified themselves as “creators”. And if you have a child, you might nod a little wearily in recognition at the results of a Harris Poll last year that found some 30% of children said their ambition was to become a &#8220;YouTuber&#8221; (only 11% said &#8220;astronaut&#8221;).</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to support this new creative class by connecting them to the world’s enterprise consumer brands, allowing them to turn their passion into a possibility to earn a living,&#8221; said Stevens.</p>
<p>The role of a company like Mavrck is not just to connect marketers with influencers, but also to take a pulse on where influencer content is making the greatest impact. Although it&#8217;s a very fragmented space &#8212; blogs, for example, can still power, especially with certain kinds of products and consumers &#8212; when it comes to single platforms with the biggest scale, social apps are still at the top of the heap.</p>
<p>Stevens notes that Instagram remains the most popular platform today for influencer content, helped by the social app&#8217;s shift in 2016 to displaying content algorithmically instead of chronologically.  But while Instagram still dominates, that is starting to shift. &#8220;The Tiktok &#8216;For You&#8217; Page algorithm appears to be taking market share from Instagram, as we have seen a 400% increase year over year in the number of creators being activated on TikTok by our brand customers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If that trend continues, we anticipate TikTok to dominate influencer marketing over the next five years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whichever platform ends up on top, Stevens believes that influencers and influencer marketing are not a flash in the pan, but are here to stay.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;If you think about the last purchase you made, odds are you were influenced or persuaded by what other people say and display online, versus what a brand said to you directly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those other people can be friends, like-minded strangers or creators you choose to follow online. This concept of social proof has become an essential brand building tool for consumer enterprises. In the wake of COVID and the corresponding changes in consumer buying behavior, consumer engagement with creators has increased 70%. As a result, brands are investing more in social proof to not only thrive, but stay relevant and survive.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">That&#8217;s enough to influence investors, too.</p>
<div class="yj6qo ajU">
<p class="p4">“At Summit, we have invested across the commerce segment – in both brands and the technologies that support their growth – and we believe strongly in the impact and potential of authentic brand relationships as a means to build value,” said Michael Medici, MD at Summit Partners, in a statement.</p>
<p class="p4">“Brands are increasingly seeking to harness the power of the very long tail of content creators to help drive brand awareness and influence purchase activity,” added Sophia Popova, principal at Summit Partners. “Mavrck’s platform is purpose-built to support brands in these efforts. We are delighted to partner with Lyle and the Mavrck team for this next phase of growth.” Both of them have joined the board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Whip Around, a New Zealand-based SaaS company that aims to make fleet inspection and maintenance a much easier process, just closed a $14 million Series B round. The startup will use the funds to expand its New Zealand-based team while growing its reach in the United States, where most of its business resides, according to the company.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“The market is in the early innings of a transition from paper-based manual processes to the digital solution that Whip Around provides,&#8221; said CEO Noah Hickey in a statement. &#8220;There is a significant opportunity to help streamline the transport industry and grow the company.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The funding round was led by Punakaiki Fund, a NZ VC firm, and Amplo, a Texas-based VC firm with multiple software businesses in its portfolio, including Intercom, Robinhood and Sharesies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248164" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Many fleets in the U.S. are mandated by federal regulations to inspect assets daily and retain inspection and maintenance records for up to five years, and doing this by hand and on paper costs fleet operators valuable time, according to a spokesperson for Whip Around. To solve for that, Whip Around aims to replace the paper-based fleet inspection process with a digital one that makes it easier to track progress over time, hold employees accountable and predict future maintenance needs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">We believe that the digitization of these compliance and maintenance processes will only become more mission-critical as the regulators look for ways to follow on from the <a href="https://www.eroad.com/understanding-eld-compliance/">[electronic logging device] mandate</a> and other increased reporting requirements being put on fleet operators,&#8221; the spokesperson told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Whip Around provides its software solutions to customers ranging from small independents to larger fleets, including Imperfect Foods, Belknap, PODS moving and storage and 1-800-GOT-JUNK?. It currently has a team of 70 in Auckland, North Carolina and Texas, and hopes to use the funding to add onto its product and engineering team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Self-driving trucks developer TuSimple has reached a deal to integrate its autonomous vehicle technology into DHL Supply Chain&#8217;s operations. As part of the deal, the contract logistics giant has reserved 100 autonomous trucks that are being co-developed by TuSimple and Navistar. The agreement with DHL pushes TuSimple&#8217;s total reservations order to 6,875 trucks, the first of which will be delivered in 2024.</p>
<p>TuSimple disclosed that is it already using its self-driving trucks to haul freight daily for DHL on a San Antonio-to-Dallas route. That route is part of TuSimple&#8217;s so-called autonomous freight network. The trucks are in autonomous mod, but always have two safety operators within cab, including one behind thee wheel, in case it is necessary to take over.</p>
<p>This autonomous freight network, or AFN, is a mapped network of shipping routes and terminals designed for autonomous trucking operations that will extend across the United States by 2024. TuSimple’s AFN involves four pieces: its self-driving trucks, digital mapped routes, freight terminals and a system that will let customers monitor autonomous trucking operations and track their shipments in real-time. For now, TuSimple will operate the trucks and carry goods for its customers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248288" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TuSimple&#8217;s long-term goal is to sell its autonomous trucks along with a supporting subscription service it calls TuSimple Path so customers can operate their own fleets. Right now, TuSimple has to be its own operator President and CEO Cheng Lu told TechCrunch. The long-term goal is to become a provider of the autonomous vehicles and supporting services.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the way we believe we can scale the number of vehicles,&#8221; Lu said.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">DHL is one of a growing number of companies that include UPS, carrier U.S. Xpress, Penske Truck Leasing and Berkshire Hathaway’s grocery and food service supply chain company McLane Inc. that have joined the TuSimple AFN. </span></p>
<p>The autonomous freight network, which launched in 2020, now extends from Arizona to Florida. The company is aiming to  to create a nationwide freight transportation network over the next few years. TuSimple is also eyeing an expansion in Europe and Asia. The company is testing its autonomous trucks in Sweden and at the deepwater port in Shanghai.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TuSimple previously said the network would be rolled out in three phases, starting with a focus on a service area in the Southwest where it already operates. Phase 1, which launched in 2020 and into 2021, covers service between Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio. It has since expanded to Florida.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.cockroachlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cockroach Labs</a>, makers of CockroachDB, has been raking in money this year. It started the year with a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/cockroach-labs-scores-160m-series-e-on-2b-valuation/"> $160 million Series E</a> on a $2 billion valuation and ended it with a $278 million Series F on a $5 billion valuation, more than doubling the company value in less than 12 months.</p>
<p>Greenoaks led the latest round &#8212; they were a participant in the prior round &#8212; with participation from Altimeter, Bond, Benchmark, Coatue, FirstMark, GV, Index Ventures, J.P. Morgan, Lone Pine Capital, Redpoint Ventures and Tiger Global. The company reports it has raised a total of $633 million with over $550 million coming across three rounds that began with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/cockroach-labs-scores-86-6m-series-d-as-scalable-database-resonates/">an $86.6 million round</a> in May 2020.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of capital, and it&#8217;s probably because the database market is growing in leaps and bounds. Company co-founder and CEO Spencer Kimball says that there has been a ton of follow-on interest in investing in the company since the January round, and that&#8217;s how this one came together so quickly after the last one. What&#8217;s more, he says that there was an alignment between the investors and the company.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248302" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;You want to have investors that understand the business from their own perspective. They&#8217;re asking us to invest as opposed to us trying to convince them that our business is the right one to invest in. That gives a very, I say, complementary [relationship where] their perspective ultimately adds to our perspective,&#8221; Kimball told me.</p>
<p>The company reports it has 200 paying customers, with the cloud side of the business growing at 500% over the last year and ARR tripling YoY from Q3 to Q3. While the majority of revenue still comes from the self-hosted version, the company expects the hosted version to continue to grow faster over time. They also offer<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/cockroach-labs-announces-serverless-version-of-sql-database/"> a serverless product</a> they launched in October in beta.</p>
<p>This is in line with a recent <a href="https://www.battery.com/opencloud-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Battery Ventures report</a>, State of the Open Cloud, that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/were-still-just-scratching-the-surface-of-the-clouds-potential/">we reported on last month</a>. The company found that cloud-native companies were getting far more revenue growth out of their hosted versions than self-installed.</p>

<p>The company currently partners with Amazon and Google on the cloud install side, with plans to support Microsoft Azure in 2022.</p>
<p>Cockroach has actually had a complicated history with Amazon, particularly when<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/09/aws-gives-open-source-the-middle-finger/"> Amazon played fast and loose</a> with open source licenses, and several companies like Cockroach, Elastic and MongoDB changed their approach to licensing to protect against Amazon&#8217;s encroachment.</p>
<p>Today, however, the company sees Amazon much more as a partner, using Amazon&#8217;s services in-house, hosting its SaaS version on Amazon and even having Amazon as a go-to market partner where Amazon sells Cockroach to its customers when appropriate.</p>
<p>The company is focussed on keeping the momentum going while expanding the product family, and the new cash should help. Kimball reckons he has at least 3-4 years of runway with this round, and it&#8217;s a hedge against an economic downturn and money getting tighter (although there is clearly no sign of that at the moment).</p>
<p>Kimball expects this could be the last round the company raises, although he left the door open to raise more if the right opportunity presented itself. As for the future, he says that from day one his goal has been to be a public company and that could be the next step.</p>
<p>&#8220;​​So that&#8217;s our expectation. Certainly our TAM (total addressable market) is big enough and our growth points to it. What we&#8217;re looking at now as a management team is what will it take to get there,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company hired a CFO this year, often the first step before going public, so all the signals are there &#8212; the big round, the flashy valuation, the growth trajectory, the new CFO &#8212; the company just needs to decide when the time is right.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Enterprise SaaS for measuring company carbon emission is hot. Only recently Planetly was acquired by OneTrust for an undisclosed amount. And there are plenty of other startups in the space such as Plan A, Watershed, and Emitwise, all with their own take on the market.</p>
<p>Now France-based <a href="https://www.sweep.net/">Sweep</a>, which targets carbon management in large enterprises at the FTSE 500 level, is aiming to pull ahead of the pack with a $22 million Series A funding round &#8211; one of the largest to date compared with others in the space. The Uk’s Balderton Capital led the round, with participation from New Wave, La Famiglia and 2050. The company has now raised a total of $27 million, less than a year since its launch. </p>
<p>Sweep is pushing at an open door. Last month, BCG <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/over-90-of-firms-aren-t-measuring-emissions-correctly-bcg-says">reported</a> that over 90% of companies aren’t measuring their emissions accurately and regularly. As ESGs and carbon ramp up the corporate agenda, companies are scrambling for solutions, especially in light of the <a href="https://www.ipe.com/news/possible-ifrs-sustainability-standards-board-announcement-at-cop26/10050496.article">coming sustainable reporting regulations</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248663" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Rachel Delacour, CEO and co-founder of Sweep said: “Our enterprise-grade tool is here to make carbon data collection, security and analysis seamless and automated, so companies focus on reducing their carbon footprint and contributing to global net-zero efforts.” <br />
 <br />
Bernard Liautaud, Managing Partner at Balderton Capital, has joined Sweep’s board of directors. “Sustainability is a huge priority for us at Balderton and Sweep&#8217;s mission and vision are perfectly aligned with our Sustainable Future Goals. When we looked at the market, we were incredibly impressed with the strength of Sweep&#8217;s team, and the thoughtfulness and maturity of their product.” </p>
<p>Sweep, now an official B-Corp, was one of the few companies selected to present at COP26 at the UK Cabinet Office’s Tech for Our Planet <a href="https://together-for-our-planet.ukcop26.org/tech-for-our-planet/">program</a>.</p>
<p>It also worked with French investment bank Bpifrance to measure the footprints of two companies it’s investing in: telecommunications firm Orange and education tech company Openclassrooms.</p>
<p>Delacour was previously the co-founder of BIME Analytics which was acquired by Zendesk for $45M. Speaking to TechCrunch she added: “Carbon is a network problem. In addition to tracking and analyzing the right data, a company needs to engage with all the stakeholders contributing to its footprint, from a partner selecting manufacturing materials to staff turning off machines at night. To reach their climate goals, companies must continually track all the activities that make up their total carbon emissions, including those falling into Scope 3. The bigger the network, the bigger the impact. That’s why we’ve built Sweep to connect all stakeholders across the value chain, so they can work together to take reduction action efficiently.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to online payments, the front end of the system has seen a massive amount of disruption in the last several years, with companies like Stripe, Adyen, PayPal, Square and others building APIs that make it very simple for online merchants to integrate easy payment services into their checkout flows. But when it comes to the backend, the rails other tech used to actually pass on payment information and make the transactions are more often than not decades old.</p>
<p>Now that, too is starting to change: today, a company called <a href="https://www.silverflow.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silverflow</a> that&#8217;s built a new take on one aspect of that, with an API to enable data-based payment processing, is announcing $17 million in funding to capitalize on interest that it is seeing for its technology among payment service providers. The company, based in Amsterdam, is also going to use the investment to fuel its expansion to the U.S.</p>
<p>The crux of what it is doing is providing a super-charged alternative to legacy processing systems, with a wider scope for additional services wrapped around the payments, by rebuilding them as data-based networks in the cloud.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248649" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Payments processing technology has changed over the last decade,&#8221; Anne Willem de Vries, the CEO, said in an interview. &#8220;The cost of bandwidth has gone down tremendously. Older networks were not designed as data systems; they were designed to be efficient. But those limitations are no longer there, and in the data cloud we can do more. So that gives us a good opportunity to innovate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Series A is being led by Coatue Management, with past backers Crane Venture Partners and INKEF Capital, as well as new backer Global Paytech Ventures, also participating. The round also includes endorsement (and cash) from individuals that have made names for themselves in the payments business, including Jason Gardner, the founder and CEO of Marqeta, and Gokul Rajaram, the former head of product for Square who is now a board member at Coinbase. Silverflow is not currently disclosing its valuation, nor too many details about its customer base &#8212; it targets payment service providers, acquirers and large merchants building their own payment services &#8212; except to note that Deutsche Bank is among a handful of current customers and that it will be adding three more customers soon.</p>
<p>Founded by De Vries, Robert Kraal (CBDO), and Paul Buying (CTO), De Vries and Kraal previously worked together at Adyen, the Dutch digital payments powerhouse, where the former was running card acquiring and processing services and the latter was the company&#8217;s COO.</p>
<p>Although the two conceded that Adyen is one of the few companies that&#8217;s been tackling the payment processing space with a new approach, by and large they could see that the rest of the industry was running on legacy systems, which were slow, prone to a lot of downtime, and generally not fit for purpose. In the modern world, transactions are essentially just one aspect payments; equally important is the data that comes with that transaction, useful for accounting, for business intelligence, analytics, and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p6">&#8220;We’ve built a brand new cloud native platform for payment companies,&#8221; said De Vries. &#8220;Payment service providers and the retailers using them want more insights into data, risk management, loyalty and more. We can deliver these new functionalities quicker and more easily than legacy providers. We are replacing those legacy payment processors in the payment stack.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p6">Starting first with Visa and Mastercard transactions, the plan will be to extend to all card issuers over time. And then, potentially, to other kinds of payments: it&#8217;s a very fragmented and highly localized space, but Kraal said that overall cards are still the biggest and most-used common ground among them.</p>
<p class="p2">&#8220;The Founder-market fit is the first thing we noted when looking at the Silverflow team,&#8221; said Michael Gilroy, a general partner at Coatue, in a statement. &#8220;The depth of experience within payments gives this team a unique perspective from which to solve a problem plaguing the industry – outdated infrastructure. The platform is built for the payments industry of today, and has the scalability, flexibility and usability its partners need.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Parliament has agreed its negotiating position on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">draft legislation</a> to put limits on how Big Tech can operate with the aim of rebooting competition and fair dealing in digital markets.</p>
<p>The proposal also takes aim at so-called &#8216;killer acquisitions&#8217; where powerful platforms buy up smaller rivals or startups to choke off alternative services before they have a chance to scale, limiting competition and consumer choice.</p>
<p>MEPs overwhelmingly backed the legislative plan in a plenary vote yesterday &#8212; while also adding their own tweaks, including pushing provisions intended to tackle damaging default settings.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248611" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The European Council, the body made up of Member States&#8217; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">representatives, decided its negotiating position last month &#8212; meaning action now moves to trilogue discussions between the EU&#8217;s co-legislators in January, overseen by the French who hold the rotating Council presidency.</span></p>
<p>France <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/future-eu/news/macron-presents-frances-eu-council-presidency-priorities/">has said</a> that passing the legislation package is one of its digital priorities for the Council presidency.</p>
<h2>Big backing for tackling big tech</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/docs_autres_institutions/commission_europeenne/com/2020/0842/COM_COM(2020)0842_EN.pdf">Digital Markets Act </a>(DMA) was presented as a draft proposal by the Commission <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">a year ago</a>, alongside the Digital Services Act (DSA) &#8212; a broader update of the bloc&#8217;s ecommerce rules which also contains some requirements solely aimed at larger platforms, along with provisions that apply across the board to the in-scope digital services.</p>
<p>So while the DSA is expected to require time for all side to reach a compromise (and won&#8217;t now face a plenary vote until January), the DMA has been moving at a fair clip through the EU&#8217;s co-legislative process &#8212; as regional lawmakers find plenty of common ground over the need to rein in Big Tech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With the DMA, the bloc&#8217;s lawmakers are responding to concerns that the biggest tech companies hold an overly commanding &#8216;gatekeeper&#8217; role over digital markets and Internet users which has led to abusive business practices that harm competition and exploit consumers.</p>
<p>The Commission drew on its experience of antitrust enforcement against tech giants like Google in shaping the draft proposal &#8212; which has faced a string of penalties in the EU in recent years.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">EU lawmakers&#8217; hope is that a list of upfront &#8216;dos and don&#8217;ts&#8217; for tech giants &#8212; combined with centralized enforcement by the Commission itself &#8212; will be able to reset digital markets and ensure they are fair and open. </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s notable that the text approved by a plenary vote of the Parliament yesterday received 642 votes in favour, 8 against and 46 abstentions &#8212; suggesting there is broad backing across the political spectrum for clipping the wings of Big Tech.</p>
<p>For a little comparative context, <a href="https://www.euroforum.de/edpd/eu-parliament-eprivacy-regulation/">back in 2017</a>, a plenary vote in the Parliament on a different piece of digital legislation &#8212; the ePrivacy Regulation &#8212; draw far less support, with of the (then) 618 MEPs only 318 voting for the draft proposal vs 280 voting against. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, the ePrivacy update remains stalled even now.</p>
<p>Progress on updating ePrivacy has been blocked by ferocious lobbying from a number of sectors &#8212; and also by tech giants such as Google who, in a July 31, 2019 memo which recently came to light via antitrust litigation in the US, can be seen congratulating itself on its &#8220;success&#8221; at &#8220;slowing down and delaying&#8221; the regulation, including by &#8220;working behind the scenes hand in hand with the other [tech giants]&#8221;.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s perhaps rather fitting that the giants that make up &#8216;GAFAM&#8217; (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft) are now facing bespoke legislation aimed at reducing their market power and &#8212; ultimately &#8212; shrinking how much resource they have to lobby against laws they&#8217;d prefer not to exist.</p>
<p>Certainly it looks like a smart move by the Commission to put the DMA and DSA into separate legislative packages.</p>
<p>That has made it harder for tech giants to resort to their typical astroturfing techniques &#8212; whereby they draw on an extensive, opaque network of industry associations and thinktanks they help fund, cloaking direct lobbying against tighter regulation of their own business models by projecting their talking points through a litany of worthy sounding third parties.</p>

<h2>MEPs target damaging defaults</h2>
<p>MEPs have tweaked the Commission proposal in a number of ways &#8212; expanding the scope of the DMA so it will also apply to web browsers, virtual assistants and connected TVs, in addition to the original blend of online intermediation services, social networks, search engines, operating systems, online advertising services, cloud computing, and video-sharing services &#8212; or rather the subset of those companies that meet the relevant criteria to be designated “gatekeepers”.</p>
<p>Parliamentarians also beefed up the criteria for being designated a gatekeeper &#8212; increasing the quantitative thresholds to €8BN in annual turnover in the European Economic Area (EEA) and a market cap of €80BN. Which may be intended to avoid fewer European tech giants from falling into scope (e.g. Spotify).</p>
<p>To be considered gatekeepers under the DMA a company must also provide a core platform service in at least three EU countries and have at least 45M monthly end users, and/or 10,000+ business users.</p>

<p>The parliament gave it fulsome support to the roster of changes voted on by the IMCO committee <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/ep-imco-dma-vote/">last month</a> &#8212; which also includes restrictions on killer acquisitions in the case of systematic non-compliance; additional requirements on the use of data for targeted or micro-targeted advertising (but not a full prohibition on tracking-based ads, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/">some MEPs have been pushing for</a>); and some interesting looking interoperability provisions.</p>
<p>MEPs want users to have the option to be able to uninstall pre-installed software applications that big tech bundles with a core platform service &#8212; and crucially want that to be possible &#8220;at any stage&#8221;.</p>
<p>A number of Google search engine rivals had been pressing MEPs to beef up the DMA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/europes-final-push-on-the-digital-markets-act-must-include-default-settings/">to tackle damaging default settings</a>.</p>
<p>And in a <a href="https://twitter.com/yegg/status/1471113867493265419">tweet</a> yesterday DuckDuckGo founder, Gabe Weinberg, said the parliament had taken &#8220;a big step&#8221; by introducing what he billed as &#8220;a choice screen mandate&#8221; to the DMA&#8217;s mix.</p>
<p>In recent years, the non-tracking Google search engine rival has been pressing for regulatory intervention to ensure <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/duckduckgo-presses-the-case-for-true-one-click-search-competition-on-android/">true &#8220;one-click&#8221; competition</a>, arguing that regulation must ensure tech giants don&#8217;t simply stack the deck by making it ridiculously convoluted for users to switch away from their own services.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re now looking forward to the final stage of talks. If done right, the DMA will let people more easily choose their search engine default,&#8221; Weinberg added.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement on the plenary vote, DMA rapporteur and MEP Andreas Schwab, said: “Today’s adoption of the DMA negotiating mandate sends a strong signal: The European Parliament stands against unfair business practices used by digital giants. We will make sure that digital markets are open and competitive. This is good for consumers, good for businesses and good for digital innovation. Our message is clear: The EU will enforce the rules of the social market economy also in the digital sphere, and this means that lawmakers dictate the rules of competition, not digital giants.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With e-commerce becoming increasingly globalized, a company called <a href="https://www.taxdoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taxdoo</a>, which builds API-based tools to help e-commerce companies with tax compliance and other accounting needs, is announcing a round of funding: $64 million, a Series B that the Hamburg-based startup will be using to expand further across Europe and to build what it describes as the financial operating system for e-commerce businesses.</p>
<p class="p5">&#8220;We&#8217;re already helping customers shave off hours of manual [sales tax] work, and with newer features like pro forma invoices for tax compliance, we’ve built a lot of adjacent features,&#8221; said CEO Christian Königsheim in an interivew. &#8220;The long-term vision is that we want to enable our customers to have their financial data accelerate their growth rather than holding them back. We want to give them competitive edge by automating tedious tasks, so that they don&#8217;t have to pay that much attention to compliance and regulation. We see this as a financial operating system for commerce.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Tiger Global &#8212; part of the VC&#8217;s very aggressive foray into backing European startups &#8212; with previous backers Accel, Visionaries Club, and 20VC also participating. Taxdoo last announced funding less than a year ago &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/taxdoo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a $21 million Series A</a> &#8212; so this brings the total raised by it now to $84 million. I understand from sources close to the company that the valuation is now just north of $350 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248616" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Co-founded by three economics PhDs &#8212; Matthias Allmendinger, Roger Gothmann and Christian Königsheim &#8212; the three were doing research into VAT. They saw how complex sales tax regimes were for average merchants to follow, but they also identified that there was probably a way to solve that with automation technology.</p>
<p>The three have been very hands-on with how the company has developed and grown that vision: I mentioned to Königsheim that when he was talking to me it sounded like he was reading out his company&#8217;s press release &#8212; <em>not</em> what you want to happen when you&#8217;re interviewing someone! But it turned out that he actually wrote that press release himself, hence the identical cadence and diction. (I joked that he might have others on the team dedicated to doing that kind of work these days, he replied that he saw it as his &#8220;victory lap&#8221; after working so hard on closing the round.)</p>
<p>Taxdoo very much made its name around providing a set of APIs that European e-commerce companies, or really any organization doing business online, could use to calculate VAT (sales tax) and to track it to meet accounting compliance requirements. It currently works with over 1,700 marketplaces, online merchants, and enterprises, integrating with the platforms that they use in turn to sell online. (These include ERP providers like Xentral, as well as e-commerce site builders like Shopify, payment platforms like Afterbuy and marketplaces like eBay and Amazon.)</p>
<p>As e-commerce has continued to grow, so too have both the complexity of accounting around it, and the scrutiny of the space by financial regulators.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the accounting side, one of Taxdoo&#8217;s tools, for example, allows companies to automatically query and pull out transaction data needed to calculate VAT (some transactions are exempt, so that makes it more complicated). Another can pull records and send them for individual filing across different countries or tax juridictions.</p>
<p>On the regulatory front, new rules coming into force have presented more opportunities for Taxdoo to expand its own scope of services. Its APIs now include, in addition to a wider set of VAT calculators, tools to manage accounting and invoicing. It also has opened its platform so that third-party developers can build their own tools on top of Taxdoo for customers to use to fit their specific needs (Xentral is an example of one of the developers building apps on top of Taxdoo to make it easier to use the two platforms together).</p>
<p class="p3">This is dry work, and for many definitely not the most visible part of building an e-commerce business, but it&#8217;s essential, and hard, to get right. This also makes the company an attractive partner &#8212; or even target &#8212; for ambitious fintech companies that are building one-stop shops to service online businesses with all of their payment and financial needs. (Case in point, Stripe has made acquisitions and launched a new suite of services aimed to help calculate sales tax for its customers. It seems that a logical next step would be to dive deeper into accounting around those tax calculations.)</p>
<p>“Taxdoo is tackling the largest pain points faced today by e-commerce merchants and marketplaces,&#8221; said John Curtius, partner at Tiger Global, in a statement. &#8220;Taxdoo&#8217;s team uniquely combines deep expertise in e-commerce, automation, tax, accounting, and finance — along with a pervasive customer centricity. We’re excited to support Taxdoo in building the Financial Operating System for e-commerce.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Activity around African venture capital firms raising funds continues to increase as we head towards the end of the year. I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n the latest development, Abuja- and Lagos-based <a href="https://venturesplatform.com/">Ventures Platform</a> is today announcing the first close of its $40 million pan-African fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund, founded by one of Nigeria’s most active early-stage investors, <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/kola-aina-vp">Kola Aina</a>, has made 69 investments since 2016</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Ventures Platform&#8217;s news is also coming a day after another pan-African VC firm 4DX Ventures secured the final close of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/4dx-ventures-closes-second-fund-with-60m-adds-dikembe-mutombo-as-senior-advisor/">$60 million fund</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aina, the firm’s founding and general partner, told TechCrunch on a call that when he started the firm, he used his own money for the first set of investments made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Subsequently, Ventures Platform experimented with an accelerator model, where it gave out standardized checks of $20,000 to pre-seed to seed-stage startups in exchange for 10% equity.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248348" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, the firm took outside capital for the first time and formed syndicates. Within this two-year period, some</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the startups it invested in included Piggyvest, Paystack, Kudi and Thrive Agric</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">wanted to perfect our style of finding high-performing companies early before they become obvious and backing them with everything we bring to the table from our experience as operators ourselves,” Aina told TechCrunch over a call. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We didn’t want to go out and try to fundraise when we didn’t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have evidence that we could make money out of this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year October, Ventures Platform became one of the local investors that cashed out from<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/"> Paystack’s $200 million+ exit to Stripe</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With a few other secondary exits under its belt, Aina said he felt this was the perfect time for the firm “to go to the market and raise its first institutional fund.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first close of Ventures Platform’s first institutional fund </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is undisclosed but</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Aina noted that “it is a sizeable amount</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, most of the limited partners (LPs) involved are Nigerian- and African-based, which speaks to the growth in capacity of local investors in funding the region’s most innovative companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade is one of the firm&#8217;s individual LPs which also includes Gbenga Oyebode. Others involved are organizations such as the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), UAC Nigeria (its first time allocating to a VC) and VFD Group; and global investors such as Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel and Adam Draper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">proud that for this first close, a large part of our capital came from local funding. I gave a TED Talk titled ‘who would own our future unicorns’ and I’m so proud of this because it seems Africans are answering loud and clear that we would own them too. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this was a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nice mix of Nigerian corporates, family offices, institutions, as well as global investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ventures Platform was deliberate about wanting local capital in this fund, said Aina. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For us, it was strategic, getting local capital for our first close. But the second close, as you will see, will be from global fund of funds and DFIs where we’ve got commitments. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, ultimately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as much as foreign capital is critical, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it’s in the interest of foreign capital to be in bed with local capital from a derisking standpoint.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ventures Platform sees itself as a thesis-centred fund. Aina said the fund’s thesis </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is centred</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around funding market-creating innovations that solve non-consumption and create innovative new ways to deliver goods and services or services to low-income markets. The firm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is focused</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on six core verticals: fintech, edtech, agritech and food science, healthtech and bioscience, enterprise SaaS and digital infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the pan-African firm relied on syndicate and proprietary capital funds in the earlier stages of its lifecycle, it couldn’t take on follow-on rounds in its portfolio companies which also includes the likes of Tiger-backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/tiger-global-backs-african-fintech-mono-in-15m-series-a-round/">Mono</a>, SeamlessHR, PayHippo and Migo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These startups have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cumulatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised more than $500 million in follow-on rounds, and Aina notes that his firm is keen on participating now that it has secured the first close of this fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a pretty robust pipeline of companies that we’ll be looking at across the continent, as well as our portfolio companies that have raised new rounds of financing. We’re looking for interesting companies that fit our thesis and what’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">compelling now is that we have a follow on capital to fund them,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ventures Platform </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on pre-seed and seed with an average check size of $50,000. But this new fund equips Ventures Platform to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">participate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Series A deals where it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be able to invest more than $1 million in a single company (including follow-on rounds)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Abuja-based venture capital firm is also deepening its activity in other countries outside Nigeria &#8212; Kenya’s MarketForce and Tambua Health, Zambia’s Union54 and Egypt’s MoneyHash to name a few. The firm plans to invest more in these regions and Francophone Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the firm’s 69 companies, 30% have passed through Y Combinator. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aina says that while part of this success can be attributed to Y</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">C being a partner, he believes his firm has a knack for picking quality companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only a few venture capital firms in the Nigerian and African tech ecosystem can boast similar YC stats with Ventures Platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For startups, being part of these firms’ portfolios represents a marker of success, but some VC critics believe these sorts of numbers are assured for firms that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">employ</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2012/01/24/the-3-key-limitations-of-spray-and-pray-seed-investors/">spray and pray</a>” tactics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aina defends his firm, saying that as an “early-stage discovery fund,” Ventures Platform’s role involves identifying many companies to back early and invest in subsequent rounds of a few. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> every fund has its strategy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because of the stage at which we invest, a key part of our strategy is to fund a large batch of companies at the pre-seed stage, and what you see is that the funnel would narrow as time goes on. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this new fund, we now can double down on our winners, which is good for the companies and also good for us at the point of exit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ventures Platform said it would onboard well-known figures across African tech as venture partners as part of a move to deepen its expertise further. The first and only disclosed partner for now is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/senisulyman">Seni Sulyman</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the former vice president of global operations at Andela and CEO of BlackOps, a talent marketplace for African venture builders and operators</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.re-cap.com/">Re:cap</a>, a non-dilutive funding platform in a similar vein to Pipe.com and Capchase but based in Europe, has closed a Seed financing round of $111.5 million, in a mix of growth capital and liquidity for the revenue-based financing platform. re:cap’s first product is now officially going live, following a pre-seed funding in May of this year.</p>
<p>The growth capital has come from pan-European VCs Felix Capital and Project A Ventures, with participation from existing investor Entrée Capital. The new capital will be invested into further expansion of the team as well as product and entering new European markets from its launch base of Germany. Initially focused on SaaS businesses, it has plans to move into other verticals.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Paul Becker (CEO) and Jonas Tebbe (CPO), who previously built the <a href="https://www.liqid.de/">LIQID</a> fintech startup.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248621" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>re:cap allows recurring revenue businesses to fund their growth, but without needing to dilute ownership via VC or taking on debt, with the ability to convert up to 50% of their ARR into instant, non-dilutive upfront cash. At the same time, institutional investors can invest directly in the recurring revenues of software companies.</p>
<p>Paul Becker, Co-founder and CEO of re:cap said: &#8220;Our funding platform will revolutionize the way software companies finance themselves today. But focusing on software companies is just the beginning: all financing solutions can be rebuilt with the information available in the digital age. Our ambition is for re:cap to become the European champion in this category.”</p>
<p>Joseph Pizzolato of Felix Capital said: “re:cap’s speed of execution in their first months has been tremendous. Both their financing solution and their technology with fully automated underwriting and transaction processing are setting standards. Based on their experience and expertise, the team around Paul and Jonas brings all the prerequisites to build a European category leader.”</p>
<p>“Today’s newly emerging tech players need money fast to finance and scale their business. re:cap has developed a great new digital funding platform for software companies to finance their business with the right investors quickly. We were the first major investor in Paul’s and Jonas&#8217; previous company, LIQID, and have great confidence in the team to build something game-changing”, said Uwe Horstmann, General Partner at Project A.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking to me over a call Becker added: “We operate in a similar fashion to Pipe, less so Capchase. The main difference is that we are live in Germany and we did it at a record pace. So speed for execution is important. We were able to get a lot of liquidity on the market at launch, $100M, so way more than other players when they launched. We basically have a mature product at launch, with deeper underwriting and automation, that works for institutional investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We mainly target on SAAS and software or companies with a tech component, but we’re also servicing consumer subscription companies. We mainly go after companies with recurring revenue models, enabling us to underwrite the companies. In Germany it is a little tougher to think about regulation and privacy, so if you don’t have that then you are screwed,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet giant Google announced today that it has made the first investment from its Africa Investment Fund in Ugandan super app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/the-motorcycle-ride-hailing-wars-in-nigeria-and-uganda-is-safebodas-to-lose/">SafeBoda</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The undisclosed investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comes two months after Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai announced the tech giant’s intentions to</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/google-confirms-1b-investment-into-africa-including-subsea-cable-for-faster-internet/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">commit $1 billion over the next five years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in “tech-led initiatives”, which includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/google-sets-up-50m-fund-to-invest-in-african-startups/">a $50 million Africa Investment Fund</a> targeted at early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. He made this known at the Google for Africa event in October.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before launching the fund, Google proved helpful in startups’ journeys via its Google for Startups Accelerator Africa program. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248609" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The accelerator </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">program has supported more than 80 startups in seed to Series A stages with equity-free mentorship and resources. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they have raised over $100 million in venture capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google also recently launched Black Founders Fund, a non-dilutive $3 million fund allocated to 50 startups yearly. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech startups and those from Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt and South Africa get looked at the most by venture capitalists. Last year, fintech startups accounted for 25% of the VC funding which flowed into Africa, while startups from the Big Four received more than half of the continent’s total funding. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VC firms and institutional fund managers who have spoken with TechCrunch recently say they want to bridge this funding gap by investing in overlooked regions and sectors on the continent. Nitin Gajria, t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he managing director of sub-Saharan Africa, Google, is one such and he expressed these sentiments </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">when the company announced the Africa Investment Fund in October. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are not restricting ourselves to certain verticals. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are focusing on investments where </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Google could add value,” the managing director said in October</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “If there are founders building interesting products solving real challenges in Africa, that would fall </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">squarely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within our investment thesis.”</span></p>
<p>Though Google’s investment in SafeBoda <span style="font-weight: 400;">serves as an early reminder of Gajria’s statement,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> startups from the Big Four markets will likely fill the fund’s portfolio in the next couple of years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ugandan startup launched as a two-wheel ride-hailing platform before embarking on a super app plan two years ago</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, it offers rides, parcel delivery, food and shop, payments, savings and other financial services to over 1 million customers in Uganda and its second market, Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company counts more than 25,000 drivers who have completed over 40 million orders in both markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SafeBoda has rarely announced any of its funding rounds since its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2017, but people who know the company’s dealings say it has raised over $20 million. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its investors include GoVentures of Gojek, Allianz X, Transsion Holdings, Beenext, Unbound and Justin Kan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SafeBoda said the investment from Google’s Africa Investment Fund will help “drive its growth in Uganda and Nigeria, scaling its transportation-led app to offer new payment and financial services solutions for its expanding set of customers: passengers, drivers and merchants.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“SafeBoda welcomes Google to their community and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to continue to drive innovation in informal transportation and payments in the boda boda (East Africa) or okada (West Africa) industry,” said co-founder </span>Ricky Rapa Thomson in a statement.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This vital industry is the lifeblood of Africa’s cities and powers economic development</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. SafeBoda </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is thrilled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that leading global companies such as Google see the importance of backing startups working towards these goals.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesperson told TechCrunch in a written statement that the investment in SafeBoda was made to “strengthen a relationship with a potential future partner that has strategically aligned vision of better logistics and transportation.” Asked about how many investments to expect in the coming year, the spokesperson said Google isn’t setting any expectations in that regard.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.labellevie.com">La Belle Vie</a> announced that it has raised a $28.2 million (€25 million) Series B round led by Left Lane and Quadrille Capital, with existing investor Capagro also participating. The company operates an online grocery store in the Paris area.</p>
<p>Online grocery delivery services and so-called quick-commerce startups are quite trendy. In fact, it has become an incredibly crowded space. In Paris alone, people can order groceries from Cajoo, Gorillas, Flink, Getir, Zapp and Gopuff (following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/after-acquiring-dija-and-fancy-instant-grocery-startup-gopuff-launches-in-the-uk-en-route-to-european-expansion/">Dija’s acquisition</a>) — I’m probably forgetting a name or two.</p>
<p>But La Belle Vie has been around since 2015. It has acquired quite a lot of experience when it comes to logistics, inventory management and unit economics.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248149" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>La Belle Vie originally started with a focus on fresh products, such as vegetables, fruits, meat, fish and cheese. You could order anything you would find in a local outdoor food market. And it’s true that supermarket chains have often neglected that segment with their online order service.</p>
<p>Over time, La Belle Vie has expanded its offering with packaged goods and many of the items that you would find in a supermarket. The company has signed a partnership with Système U.</p>
<p>In many ways, La Belle Vie feels like an online supermarket. There are offers and an editorialized selection of products. For instance, you can buy 12 oysters for €4.99 right now. This is the kind of offer you would find in the central aisle of a supermarket.</p>
<p>Right now, La Belle Vie offers 17,000 products, including 4,000 different fresh products. The company can deliver your order in less than 3 hours across the Ile-de-France region. It has 500 employees and processes 15,000 orders per week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While it feels perfectly fine to wait a couple of hours to get your groceries, La Belle Vie isn’t standing still. The company wants to compete directly with quick-commerce startups. It has launched a new brand called <a href="https://www.bamcourses.com">Bam Courses</a>.</p>
<p>The new service is limited to Paris and a selection of 2,500 products. Orders are dispatched from one of La Belle Vie’s seven distribution hubs in Paris and the company tries to deliver orders within 15 minutes.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very proud of the path [co-founder] Alban [Wienkoop] and I have taken. Since day one, we have been obsessed with profitability, with extremely tight control of our margins and supply chain, but also with the social aspect, with the employment of over 600 people on permanent contracts. La Belle Vie is a wonderful human adventure and we are thrilled to be supported in our growth by international and French investors that are as prestigious as they are experienced,” co-founder and CEO Paul Lê said in a statement.</p>
<p>Before today’s funding round, the company had raised a $6.2 million (€5.5 million) round in 2018 and and a $13.1 million (€11.6 million) round in 2020. Up next, the startup plans to expand to other major cities in France.</p>
<p>While Getir and Gopuff have been around for a while, most quick-commerce startups have been founded in the past year or two. The fact that La Belle Vie has been around for a while is a clear advantage as it has gained some experience over the past few years.</p>
<p>There’s a big question mark in the instant grocery delivery space. What happens if VC firms stop financing gigantic funding rounds, like Flink’s recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/flink-the-berlin-based-instant-grocery-startup-is-now-valued-at-2-85b-after-raising-750m-in-a-round-led-by-doordash/">$750 million round</a>? It’s hard to predict whether customers will stick around once promo codes dry up and service quality goes down. With its slow and steady approach, La Belle Vie has more visibility on its customer base and future performance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two years into a worldwide pandemic, outfits around the globe are wrestling with how to resume their in-person operations safely. Consider that Apple just <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-15/apple-delays-return-to-office-until-date-yet-to-be-determined">scrapped</a> its office-return deadline, while Google, which plans to require its workforce to return to its offices three times a week at some point next year, made it clear to employees yesterday that if they don&#8217;t get vaccinated, they will eventually lose their jobs. &#8220;Our vaccination requirements are one of the most important ways we can keep our workforce safe and keep our services running,&#8221; said Google in a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/google-employees-to-lose-pay-if-dont-comply-with-vaccination-policy.html">statement</a> to CNBC:</p>
<p>Still, even vaccinated individuals can become infected with variants of the highly contagious coronavirus. Enter <a href="https://phylagen.com/">Phylagen</a>, a low-flying, seven-year-old, San Francisco-based company that says it&#8217;s able to combine microbial genomics and data analytics to answer the question of whether a physical space has played host to someone with Covid-19.</p>
<p>How does it do it? In broad strokes, Phylagen employs a network of sensors, swabs, and sample collectors who put the materials into packages twice a week, then ship them to a centralized lab. Phylagen then promises data within 72 hours about whether sick people have carried germs inside a building &#8212; which it divides into floors and zones for tracking purposes &#8212; or whether the building&#8217;s air is safe to breathe.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247469" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company calls it &#8220;enterprise pathogen monitoring as a service,&#8221; and its feasibility has long fascinated founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicalgreen/">Jessica Green</a>, a former biology professor who is formally trained as both a civil engineer and a microbiome scientist.</p>
<p>It was a lonely obsession until recently, however. As Green explains it: &#8220;We spend 90% of our time indoors and know nothing about what we&#8217;re breathing in, even while during this very conversation, we&#8217;ll both emit millions of micro organisms and inhale hundreds and thousands of viruses, bacteria, and molds that [can have] really severe consequences for our health and well-being.&#8221; While she &#8220;knew this decades ago,&#8221; she adds, the public&#8217;s understanding has &#8220;come to fruition with this pandemic.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pIBhksbHy4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/charity_dean/">Disease-related risk management is now a thing, and this young startup is at the forefront</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Disease-related risk management is now a thing, and this young startup is at the forefront&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/charity_dean/embed/#?secret=pIBhksbHy4" data-secret="pIBhksbHy4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Phylagen wasn&#8217;t always so focused on the air we breath. From its earliest days until some time last spring, the company operated in what&#8217;s called the supply chain track-and-trace market, a segment that businesses use to ensure that their products have followed an expected path toward their final destination. (Detours can mean products have been tampered with, which can ruin a company&#8217;s reputation or even lead to deadly consequences, especially when it comes to pharmaceuticals.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Green suggests there was interest in the product as a means to track Covid as the pandemic took hold, but as it became clearer that the virus was spreading through aerosols and not surfaces, Phylagen pivoted completely to another application of Phylagen&#8217;s  technology. It began to use its learnings &#8212; and its ever-growing database of microorganisms &#8212; not for traceability applications, but instead to enter buildings, capture the microorganisms found there, then digitize the information and push it out to customers.</p>
<p>Apparently, there are a growing number of them. While Green declined to name specific clients, saying only that Phylagen is working closely with numerous big tech companies and commercial real estate companies, she said the business, cofounded by  Harrison Dillon &#8212; he previously cofounded the industrial biotech firm Solazyme &#8212; is going like gangbusters heading into 2022.</p>
<p>Revenue, she says, has grown 10 times year over year. The company has 40 employees up from 20. Phylagen plans to double headcount again, in fact, aided by strategic funding the company quietly raised this past summer from Johnson Controls, a publicly traded European conglomerate that produces fire, HVAC, and security equipment for buildings.</p>
<p>Altogether, Phylagen has raised $30 million to date, including from 3M, Breakout Ventures, and Cultivian Sandbox.</p>
<p>Of course, questions remain, including whether Phylagen can outmaneuver rivals that are springing up in the space.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are emerging competitors because this is the new normal,&#8221; acknowledges Green. &#8220;Everybody is going to be demanding healthy indoor air, and there are currently very antiquated ways of measuring indoor air quality, and no affordable, reliable ways to test for anything biological that&#8217;s air-related.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phylagen&#8217;s own processes may seem antiquated to those who don&#8217;t want to wait 72 hours for results from either the labs that Phylagen owns (it has one in San Francisco and another in Manhattan) or with which it partners. After all, given how quickly the coronavirus is still spreading, two or three days might sound to some potential customers like an eternity.</p>
<p>Green suggests that window will shrink soon enough. &#8220;In the next generation [of testing], everything will be automated and on site. Imagine a CO2 sensor or Nest thermostat that gives information on temperature and relative humidity. There is a clear path to being able to detect DNA and RNA that is airborne in a similar way, and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re working toward.&#8221;</p>
<p>Certainly, if Phylagen fulfills its potential, its opportunities look, well, significant. For one thing, Phylagen can test for much more than Covid-19 and says that allergens are also on its road map.</p>
<p>Beyond its commercial possibilities, there is also the home. Already, early investor 3M appears to be champing at the bit to develop data-driven consumer products. It even began selling a <a href="https://news.3m.com/2021-09-27-Scotch-Brite-TM-and-Phylagen-Introduce-the-First-Consumer-Home-Cleanliness-Test-Kit">home cleanliness kit</a> in September using Phylagen&#8217;s technology, though judging by the kit&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09C7BHYF4?tag=commconn_us_45_101393-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A3JWKAKR8XB7XF">price</a> on Amazon &#8212; it costs roughly $180 &#8211;it&#8217;s too expensive for most homeowners to consider at this point and is more of a trial balloon.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Green insists that the company remains entirely focused for now on its enterprise customers, in part because it doesn&#8217;t have time to consider other products, not anytime soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main thing to take away from that [3M] product is that we can really make any menu of organisms that we want to test for,&#8221; she says. &#8220;But the most relevant and the largest market opportunity and the biggest market need right now is the commercial building space.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more a function of what we&#8217;re able to keep up with,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;Right now, We&#8217;re racing to meet demand.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In August, Reddit raked in a hefty $410 million financing led by Fidelity, valuing it at $10 billion. It had plans to close out the round, a Series F, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/reddit-is-raising-up-to-700m-in-series-f-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at $700 million at the time</a>.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s CEO Steve Huffman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/technology/reddit-new-funding.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told the New York Times</a> that Fidelity&#8217;s investment would give it more time to decide when and how to go public.</p>
<p>Now the news is out that the 16-year-old site has confidentially submitted a draft registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to go public, the company <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/reddit-announces-confidential-submission-of-draft-registration-statement-related-to-proposed-public-offering-301446048.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> Wednesday evening.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248561" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Reddit has not yet determined how many shares to offer or the price range for its initial public offering.</p>
<p>There were signs that the well-financed company was readying for an IPO. In March, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/reddit-is-raising-up-to-700m-in-series-f-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the hiring of its first-ever CFO, Drew Vollero, who previously worked on Snap’s IPO.</p>
<p>Reddit has raised $1.3 billion in funding so far, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/reddit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public information</a>.</p>
<p>The content aggregating behemoth has faced mounting challenges such as presenting itself as a home for communities while trying to police hate speech. A subreddit earlier this year played a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/sec-issues-statement-on-past-weeks-turbulent-market-activity-prompted-by-reddit-fueled-gamestop-run/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pivotal role</a> in massive market rallies for companies like GameStop and AMC.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In 2019, Tencent&#8217;s leading role in Reddit&#8217;s $300 million Series D stoked fears that censorship would befall the community site. My colleague Jon at the time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/12/tencent-reddit-nononono/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disputed the speculation</a>.</p>
<p>The hype on Reddit has contributed to its financial success. In Q2, Reddit broke <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/reddit-is-raising-up-to-700m-in-series-f-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$100 million in advertising revenue</a>. At last count in August, the site attracted 50 million daily visitors and hosted 100,000 active subreddits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As crypto investors widely know, China has declared all <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/china-says-all-cryptocurrency-related-transactions-are-illegal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency transactions illegal</a> and outlawed crypto mining activities. Lately, a court decision further reasserted the government&#8217;s attitude to stifle any bitcoin mining activity possible.</p>
<p>On December 15, the court of Beijing&#8217;s Chaoyang District heard a contract dispute over delayed returns from bitcoin mining and ruled that the service contract was &#8220;void&#8221;, according to a <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/xjlqO0s6jXjtIVGgqu0bqQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notice</a> from the court.</p>
<p>The plaintiff took to the court after the defendant, a mining company it contracted, failed to pay it 278.1654976 Bitcoins, which is worth roughly $18 million as of December 15.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248537" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This marks the first time a Beijing court has declared bitcoin mining contracts null, the notice said. Following the ruling, the court urged relevant authorities in Sichuan, an energy-rich province where mining mentioned by the case took place, to &#8220;purge&#8221; any such remaining activity.</p>
<p>The court ruling, while not surprising, could discourage overseas companies from doing business with Chinese crypto firms. Though China has deemed all crypto transactions, trading and investment illegal, many crypto firms still keep engineering and operational forces in the country while touting services to overseas customers.</p>
<p>China began weighing crypto mining bans as early as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/china-considers-ban-crypto-mining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019</a> and started to seriously ramp up enforcement in 2021. Virtual <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">currency mining is &#8220;energy-intensive, produces high carbon emissions and contributes little to the economy,&#8221; said a September <a href="http://www.news.cn/english/2021-09/24/c_1310207561.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notice</a> from the National Development and Reform Commission, China&#8217;s state planner, and such activities &#8220;should be eliminated.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The signed contract, the Beijing court said, &#8220;is void because it undermines social and public interests.&#8221; As such, its related rights and interests &#8220;should not be protected by the law&#8221; and the parties involved &#8220;should bear the consequences&#8221; of their actions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After months of NFT mania and Facebook&#8217;s recent name change to Meta, it&#8217;s fair to say that &#8220;metaverse&#8221; chatter has reached a fever pitch. And while crypto investors are buying up avatars and digital swaths of land in hopes that a digital universe will spring up around these projects, it&#8217;s unclear which projects &#8212; if any &#8212; will stand the test of time.</p>
<p>Institutional investors are also making their bets on the NFT &#8220;metaverse.&#8221; Crypto startup <a href="https://jadu.ar/nft/hoverboards">Jadu</a>, which has made millions of dollars selling pixelated NFT jetpacks and hoverboards, has scored $7 million in venture funding from General Catalyst with additional funding from Coinbase Ventures, The VR Fund, Sound Ventures and Guy Oseary, among others.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s virtual accessories can be used with other 3D avatars including Larva Labs&#8217; Meebits and other wildly pricey NFTs like CyberKongz and DeadFellaz. The avatars can be viewed and raced around in the company&#8217;s AR app The Mirrorverse, which the company hopes to eventually turn into a full-fledged Pokémon GO-like game.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248461" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Over the weekend, the company sold 6,666 NFT hoverboards for $4.4 million worth of the Ethereum cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The NFT space has attracted plenty of ridicule throughout the year, though proponents believe that the digital goods are more than meet the eye and allow creators to get attention and bankroll projects that they might otherwise have a tough time financing. Jadu CEO Asad J. Malik says that appetite for NFTs is overwhelming, but that they&#8217;re focused on building their broader platform for the time being.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can milk people right now, like there&#8217;s enough interest if we want we could say we&#8217;re releasing some avatar and we&#8217;re going to do like 1 ETH mints, and we can probably like make $20-30 million like that, but that&#8217;s not sustainable and that&#8217;s distracting,&#8221; Malik tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We have enough money, we&#8217;re going to build out the AR stuff. That&#8217;s really what we want to get ahead of everyone else on, like actual good AR gameplay, and NFTs are just kind of a process of being able to do that.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bessemer's Tess Hatch, Sequoia's Shaun Maguire and Hemisphere Ventures' Lisa Rich shared their thoughts on the active year that just passed and on what's coming next.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Investors are excited about the opportunities in the space market that are being unlocked by exit events and continued interest and private investment in the biggest and most successful space companies, including SpaceX. During a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> panel discussion on the growth-stage investment outlook for startups, Bessemer&#8217;s Tess Hatch, Sequoia&#8217;s Shaun Maguire and Hemisphere Ventures&#8217; Lisa Rich shared their thoughts on the active year that just passed and on what&#8217;s coming next.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve shared highlights from the discussion below, followed by a video of the full discussion, &#8220;Backing the Brightest.&#8221;</p>
<p>First, in terms of the year that just passed, SPACs obviously played a big role in space startups and generating liquidity for investors.</p>
<p>Hatch:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s bringing liquidity back to the investors that invested in those space companies years ago, I think looking back, Skybox, which was one of the first venture backed companies that had an exit was sold to Google for about half a billion dollars in 2014, after it was created in 2010. And not many venture capitalists were investing in space at the time, but they heard half-a-billion four years later— those are good ROI and a short time horizon for my LPs. Then basically every VC invested in one or two space companies, but from 2014 until this year, there weren&#8217;t many liquidity events in the industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maguire:</p>
<blockquote><p>You know, I think direct IPOs are still the gold standard, and a lot of the most marquee companies will try to do that. But SPACs are a very powerful tool in the toolkit, and it&#8217;s great to have another path toward liquidity. And in general, I think SPACs are better suited for deep tech companies than for like, enterprise SaaS companies, just where there&#8217;s oftentimes it&#8217;s hard to tell long-term stories with a traditional IPO process, whereas it&#8217;s much easier with SPACs.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>And now, there’s the Mobile Eccentric Droid (MobED). The four-wheel, Segway-style device is a platform in the strictest sense. That is to say, it’s open to a wide range of different applications &#8212; and you can also, quite literally, put stuff on top of it. It’s effectively a mobile wheelbase designed for a wide range of environments on which roboticists can build autonomous and controlled robotic applications on top of.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_BI8usSuo7I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Judging from the <a href="https://youtu.be/_BI8usSuo7I" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brightly-colored YouTube video</a> the company released ahead of CES (where the system will be on display), potential applications include package delivery, the transportation of small infant humans and teleconferencing. Other potential applications for MobED include mobility for people with walking difficulties.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have developed the MobED platform to overcome the limitations of existing indoor guide and service robots while maximizing its usability in cities by dramatically improving the platform&#8217;s overall mobility,&#8221; Hyundai Motor Group Robotics Lab head <span class="xn-person">Dong Jin Hyun said in a release</span>. &#8220;We are also looking ahead to assess how potential users of MobED will further expand their needs and use for this type of technology.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The system weighs 110 pounds and is capable of speeds up to 19 miles an hour. The built-in battery should last around four hours, per Hyundai’s estimation. The “eccentric” bit reference to the system’s control mechanism.</p>
<p>Per Hyudai:</p>
<blockquote><p>The eccentric mechanism-based posture control system also stabilizes the body attitude by adjusting the height of each wheel according to the ground environment. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The MobED&#8217;s 12-inch pneumatic tires further help to absorb bumps and vibrations. </span></p></blockquote>

<p style="margin: 0cm;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Wuxiaworld, which has grown through word-of-mouth, claims it is now the largest English-language Asia fantasy platform in the U.S. in terms of the number of users. The fans have translated more than a hundred thousand Chinese and Korean fiction chapters into English. Approximately 30% of its users are from the U.S and Canada, while 30% and 20% are from Southeast Asia and Europe. The rest are scattered across the globe. </span></span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247737" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p style="margin: 0cm;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #0e101a;">The announcement comes nearly seven months after Kakao Entertainment&#8217;s <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kakao-entertainment-acquires-tapas-and-radish-media-two-leading-us-based-storytelling-platforms-301288196.html">two U.S-based storytelling platform acquisitions</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/serial-fiction-app-radish-acquired-by-kakao-entertainment-for-440m/">Radish</a> and </span><a href="https://tapas.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #4a6ee0;">Tapas Media.</span></a></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0cm;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Wuxiaworld was founded in 2014 by Jingping (JP) Lai, a former American diplomat and passionate fan of Chinese fantasy martial arts novels, or Wuxia, who started translating Chinese martial arts fiction into English out of his love for these works. Wuxiaworld does not have physical offices, although it is headquartered in Hong Kong, Lai said. It will continue operating 100% work-from-home as it has been since its founding, with founder Lai remaining CEO of the Asia fantasy storytelling platform, Lai told TechCrunch. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Wuxiaworld expects to launch more content in its platform with Kakao Entertainment&#8217;s broad access to the best original stories and intellectual properties in Korea&#8217;s fast-growing online serial fiction market and Radish&#8217;s strong marketing team (in the U.S.), Lai said. Wuxiaworld also has partnerships with Chinese digital publishers that can create additional synergies. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Wuxiaworld has millions of page views daily in over 100 countries via its website and app with a majority male audience. In contrast, Radish’s audience is primarily female-driven, which perfectly complements to diversifying Kakao Entertainment’s web fiction portfolio in the U.S. market, according to its statement. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #0e101a;">“Wuxiaworld is a truly gem of a company. Supported by strong word-of-mouth and an active community, 85% of Wuxiaworld’s total revenue comes through content purchased by a monthly subscription model. The company continues to grow impressively, with annual year-over-year profit growth of up to 40%,” said global strategy officer of Kakao Entertainment and CEO of Radish and Seungyoon Lee, who led the acquisition of Wuxiworld. </span></span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Wuxiaworld&#8217;s subscription system allows users to read ongoing episodes free, but all completed episodes are paywalled. It also offers a monthly ad-free subscription model that enables users to read various completed series for free each month and a novel-specific sponsorship program that lets readers access the next chapters of ongoing episodes. </span></p>
<p>Kakao Entertainment’s popular martial arts and fantasy fiction contents such as “The Second Coming of Gluttony” and “Overgeared” already account for approximately 5% of the Wuxiaworld library among the top-grossing intellectual properties, driving almost a quarter of its revenue.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Both companies [Kakao Entertainment and Radish] are committed to creating high-quality mobile fiction, which forms the basis for their strong market leadership in the U.S. and Korea,” Lai said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kakao Entertainment, which owns a slew of collections of Korean web fiction, will accelerate its business growth in English-speaking markets with Radish’s expertise in delivering mobile novels to U.S. consumers and Wuxiaworld’s commitment to translation excellence, as per its statement. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Radish and Kakao Entertainment hopes to further realize Wuxiaworld&#8217;s infinite growth potential to reach a new and wider demographic in the U.S. market,&#8221; Lee said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Following the acquisition, Kakao Entertainment now has three storytelling platforms: Radish, Tapas and Wuxiaworld. Having launched across Asia and Europe this year, the company plans to expand further in international markets next year, aiming to triple its transaction from overseas in the next three years. Kakao Entertainment announced last week <a href="https://kr.ambafrance-culture.org/kakao-job/">its webtoon service launch in France</a> as early as this month. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kakao Entertainment opened offices in Thailand and Taiwan earlier this year. It also entered Indonesia in 2017 and Indian in 2020. Its sister company Piccoma, formerly known as Kakao Japan, provides web cartoons and novels in Japan.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">South Korea’s two largest internet giants Kakao and Naver compete in the storytelling platform market. In May, Naver has also completed an acquisition of Wattpad, a Canada-based web novel platform.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="Text__text___3eVx1j Text__dark-grey___AS2I_p Text__regular___Bh17t- Text__large___1i0u1F Body__base___25kqPt Body__large_body___3g04wK ArticleBody__element___3UrnEs" data-testid="paragraph-0">Electric vehicle startup Canoo is ending its deal with Dutch automotive manufacturing company VDL Nedcar to serve as its contract manufacturer in Europe, according to a <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-065494/ea152435ex99-2_canoo.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Wednesday</a>. <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-065494/ea152435ex99-1_canoo.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A separate filing</a> reveals that Canoo will also be exploring a new deal with VDL Groep, another Dutch auto manufacturing company, to produce vehicles in the U.S.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">“We appreciate the months of effort VDL Nedcar invested to provide us with a contract manufacturing option, but we have concluded that building in America is better aligned with our mission and current focus to invest in the communities and states that are investing in hi-tech manufacturing alongside us, creating American jobs and innovation,&#8221; said Tony Aquila, Canoo&#8217;s CEO, in the filing. &#8220;The support from Oklahoma and Arkansas will allow us to achieve SOP earlier and with less risk on many fronts.”</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">As part of the breakup, VDL Nedcar will return Canoo’s prepayment of $30.4 million, and as part of the new partnership, VDL Groep will purchase $8.4 million of Canoo stock.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248350" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">The news comes about a month after<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/canoo-is-setting-up-headquarters-in-walmarts-hometown-picks-panasonic-as-battery-supplier/"> Canoo shared plans to move its headquarters and an advanced manufacturing industrialized facility to Bentonville, Arkansas</a>, where Walmart is also headquartered. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/ev-startup-canoo-is-gearing-up-for-production-in-oklahoma-factory/">During Canoo&#8217;s second-quarter earnings call</a>, Aquila had estimated VDL Nedcar would produce up to 25,000 units of the automaker&#8217;s lifestyle vehicle in 2023, but it appears those vehicles will now be manufactured in Arkansas.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">Canoo is also working on its &#8220;mega microfactory&#8221; in Oklahoma, which is expected to come online in late 2023 and will build Canoo pickup trucks and multipurpose delivery vehicles. Oklahoma committed $300 million in non-dilutive financial incentives to support Canoo&#8217;s facility and the next phase of its manufacturing. Canoo has not replied to requests for information about similar financial incentives offered by Arkansas, but it&#8217;s likely those incentives exist. The SEC filing states that Canoo will be able to better utilize the incentives from Oklahoma and Arkansas now that the startup and VDL Nedcar have ceased contract manufacturing discussions, and that it can better facilitate its ability to deliver vehicles ahed of Q4 without the 25% tariff that would have attached if the vehicles were manufactured in Europe.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">With the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/15/us/politics/biden-signs-infrastructure-bill.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1 trillion infrastructure bill officially signed into law</a>, which includes the Buy American Act, it&#8217;s possible Canoo will be chasing federal government contracts and other government incentives. The act restricts the purpose of non-domestic supplies, stipulates that the end product must be manufactured in the United States and applies to federal government contracts for products used in the U.S.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">“In addition, we will be 100% built in the heartland of America, and we have proudly achieved another major milestone of having sourced 96% of our parts from U.S. and Allied Nations,” said Aquila.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">By choosing a different manufacturing partner, Canoo hopes to reduce supply chain vulnerabilities, increase speed to market, more securely control the creation of additional innovation and IP, increase advanced manufacturing jobs in local communities and save thousands of dollars per unit by &#8220;eliminating warranty risks, tariffs and overseas shipping costs,&#8221; according to the filing.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">On Wednesday, Canoo also shared upgraded guidance on its refined manufacturing strategy and production roadmap for 2022 to 2025. Next year, Canoo aims to produce 3,000 to 6,000 units, up from 500 to 1,000 units. In 2023, it hopes to produce 14,000 to 17,000, up from 15,000 units. And its 2024 and 2025 targets are 40,000 to 50,000 units and 70,000 to 80,000 units, respectively.</p>
