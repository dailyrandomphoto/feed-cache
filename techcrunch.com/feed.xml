										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.revolut.com">Revolut</a> wants to foster usage in the U.S. with better free accounts. Like in other markets, Revolut offers both free and paid accounts in the U.S. When you pay for a subscription fee, you get higher fair usage caps and more features, such as insurance coverage and different card designs.</p>
<p>With today’s change, Revolut is making the free plan more attractive. When you open a Revolut account, you get your own account details and a free Revolut card. You can then send and receive money, spend with your card and access a wide range of financial products.</p>
<p>The company is upping the limit on free ATM withdrawals. Before today, you could withdraw up to $300 per month without fees on Revolut’s side. After that, Revolut used to charge 2% in fees. Free Revolut users can now withdraw up to $1,200 per month without fees.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218757" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Revolut is also becoming more attractive if you want to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. The company has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/revolut-partners-with-paxos-to-bring-cryptocurrency-trading-to-the-us/">partnered with Paxos</a> for cryptocurrency trading in the U.S. Before today, users would pay 2.5% in conversion fees after exchanging $200.</p>
<p>Now, users can trade up to $200,000 per month without paying any commission. But there’s some spread — you don’t get the same exchange rate when you buy and when you sell cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>One of Revolut’s key feature is the ability to exchange currencies in the app. You can create different sub-accounts and hold money in several currencies. Revolut promises low <a href="https://www.revolut.com/en-US/legal/standard-fees">exchange fees</a> with a 0.5% markup fee once you go above the $1,000 fair usage limit for free Revolut accounts.</p>
<p>Additionally, Revolut charges a flat fee to send money to a foreign bank account. That fee encourages your friends and family to use Revolut as well as you don’t pay it for Revolut-to-Revolut transfers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But sometimes you have to send money to a foreign bank account. Premium users didn’t have to pay that flat fee for their first international transfer each month. Now, Revolut is waiving the flat fee on international transfers for up to 10 international transfers per month.</p>
<p>Finally, free Revolut users in the U.S. can create up to five <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/revolut-launches-revolut-junior-to-help-you-manage-allowance/">Junior account</a>. Those accounts targeted toward kids aged 7-17 feature an integration with the main Revolut app on the parent’s side. It makes it easier to manage allowance and give some flexibility to your children.</p>
<p>With today’s move, Revolut is adapting its product depending on market conditions. The company is competing with other fintech companies in the U.S., such as <a href="https://www.chime.com">Chime</a> or <a href="https://robinhood.com">Robinhood</a>. That’s why it’s important to attract all sorts of users, including users who don’t want to pay a subscription fee to use basic banking features.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Not content with setting your feet a-tapping with its intuitive music sequencer aimed at amateur music makers, Artiphon today <a href="http://artiphon.com/downloads">announced an app</a> that adds video-making prowess to the Orba&#8217;s already impressive feature set. Appealing to your inner Video Jockey, <a href="https://vimeo.com/612035970/a659bd7305">the Orbacam demo video</a> makes it look easy, adding video filters and effects to your visual creative pursuits.</p>
<p>The idea of the Orbacam is to create quick and easy videos that Artiphon refers to as &#8220;Musical Selfies.&#8221; The results of the videos are fun, colorful, highly shareable music videos that sync automatically to whatever else you&#8217;re playing on the Orba. The app turns the already social media-magnet of a musical instrument into the perfect companion for Instagram Stories, TikTok or Snap creative pursuits.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2217154" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2217154" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2217154" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/6.-Orbacam-UI.gif" alt="Orbicam in Action" width="480" height="480" /><p id="caption-attachment-2217154" class="wp-caption-text">Orbicam in action. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Artiphon</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217129" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that music is always a multisensory experience, and we designed Orbacam as an auditory, visual and tactile experience that anyone can play immediately,” says Artiphon&#8217;s CEO and founder Mike Butera. “We’ve seen the power of synchronizing music with social content, but almost all of that is just pasting someone else’s song on your video. Now people can create musical videos that are entirely their own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Orbacam, the company made it easy to make music &#8212; what is new, is the ability to weave visual effects into the video export, without needing to do additional music mixing, audio routing or post-production. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app also enables you to use the microphone connected to your phone &#8212; or the one built into your phone &#8212; to sing or beat-box your way on top of the music you&#8217;re creating. It also gives users the option to import videos and photos from the phone&#8217;s camera roll. </span></p>
<p>For armchair musicians, the Orba takes some of the scary parts out of creating music. Part synthesizer, part looper, part MIDI controller, the palm-sized digital grapefruit already made it easy and intuitive to create music. Most impressively, Orba wasn&#8217;t even the company&#8217;s first shot at creating weird and wonderful music-making tools. In 2015, the company pre-sold $1.3 million worth of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/07/the-crowdfunded-artiphon-instrument-1-mixes-high-and-low-musical-tech/">the INSTRUMENT 1 musical instrument</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ever the sucker for creative hardware products making their way to market, we&#8217;ve been keeping an eye on Artiphon. The Orba originally saw the light of day following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/artiphon-orba/">a $1.4 million Kickstarter campaign</a>, along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/27/artiphon-seed-funding/">a cash injection from, among others, Warner Music</a>. We thought it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/this-99-gadget-helps-you-make-music-no-skill-required/">fun to play with when it launched</a> last year. We&#8217;re delighted to see the company add a companion app with more features, stretching its usefulness beyond the slightly gimmicky, if relatively affordable, offering.</p>
<p>If you already have an Orba, the free app is <a href="http://artiphon.com/downloads">available from Artiphon</a> today. If you don&#8217;t, you can <a href="https://artiphon.com/pages/orba-by-artiphon">pick up the Orba for $100</a> from a number of retailers, or direct from Artiphon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In April of this year, collaborative design powerhouse <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> launched a white boarding tool called <a href="https://www.figma.com/figjam/">FigJam</a>. A separate tool and brand from Figma, FigJam allows users to brainstorm and iterate together in an infinite white board experience, complete with voice service to chat it out in the very same tool.</p>
<p>For all intents and purposes, FigJam can be seen as an extension upstream for the design software company. Rather than focusing on designers and the parties working closely alongside them, like engineering and product management, through Figma, FigJam asks anyone in the organization to get involved and share their ideas.</p>
<p>Usage data indicates that the product is reaching non-designers in customer organizations, the company said. However, there has been a barrier concerning price, per Figma CEO and founder Dylan Field</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219434" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>So, starting in February 2022, FigJam will see a price cut. Pro plans will go from $8 per month to $3 per month per seat, and Org plans will go from $15 per month to $5 per month per seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;We kept coming back to this principle of &#8216;let&#8217;s not get in the way&#8217;,&#8221; said Field. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to block adoption based on price. So if we can be the most competitive pricing system and use it to emphasize development, but not try to make a crazy profit on this, I think it&#8217;s pretty powerful. Because that way, we get more people in the design process, which is aligned with our vision of making design accessible.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that it&#8217;s important to not think just about initial cost but incremental cost for these organizations.</p>
<p>There is also a free tier of FigJam that allows for unlimited personal whiteboards and three shared whiteboards.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="oEjrGYCN3C"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/figma-introduces-a-whiteboard-tool-called-figjam/">Figma introduces a whiteboard tool called FigJam</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Figma introduces a whiteboard tool called FigJam&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/figma-introduces-a-whiteboard-tool-called-figjam/embed/#?secret=oEjrGYCN3C" data-secret="oEjrGYCN3C" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Alongside the pricing update, Figma is doing even more to make FigJam accessible, including the introduction of &#8220;Open Sessions.&#8221; Open Sessions allow users to invite anyone to a jam session for a 24-hour window without a log-in. The company thinks of it as the digital equivalent to inviting someone to the office for a meeting or casual hang.</p>
<p>Figma has a robust plug-in community, and the company is looking to bring the same community-powered fun to FigJam. The product is introducing plugins, widgets and other tools to further build out the whiteboard tool.</p>
<p>These plugins and widgets range from productivity tools, like plugins that automate repetitive tasks, to widgets that let users play games like dice, or even embed content like videos and docs.</p>
<p>In fact, Donut has built out a widget for FigJam that pairs users in an org together for a jam session. Thus far, Donut has built exclusively for Slack, helping employees in separate departments get to know another in our remote, COVID world. (You can learn more about widgets and plug-ins coming to FigJam in <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/bringing-the-power-of-our-open-platform-to-figjam/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Field explained that there are considerable challenges in building for organizations as a whole, rather than for the designers and their adjacents exclusively.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to recalibrate internally about which people matter and make sure we&#8217;re building for the right folks,&#8221; said Field. &#8220;In FigJam, one of the parameters we really care about is this idea of a facilitator and worrying about their needs. This is someone who wants to make things better and is able to influence inside the organization. It&#8217;s a subset of Figma&#8217;s audience but it&#8217;s not the champion we typically see. And so the challenge is to worry about their needs and make sure we&#8217;re addressing them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus far, it&#8217;s working. Roughly two-thirds of Figma users overall identify as something other than &#8216;designer.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SOC Prime, a Boston-based early-stage startup that claims to have built the world’s largest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/advanced-threat-detection/">threat detection</a> marketplace, has secured $11 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>The company will use the investment, led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/dnx-ventures/">DNX Ventures</a> with participation from Streamlined Ventures and Rembrandt Venture Partners, to scale and accelerate the adoption of its marketplace that allows researchers to monetize their threat detection code to help security teams defend against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cyberattacks/">cyberattacks</a>.</p>
<p>SOC Prime describes its Detection as Code platform as like &#8220;Spotify for cyber threats.&#8221; This curates threat detection content from nearly 400 researchers and allows you to pull it into your existing SIEM and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/hunters-brings-in-30m-series-c-to-grow-xdr-security-tech/">XDR</a> platforms. Currently, the platform is home to more than 130,000 detections aligned with the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework, a curated knowledge base of known adversary threats, tactics and techniques.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219281" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company pays security researchers a bounty every time their content is used, and allows subscribers to rate the content to determine how big a payout they get. In September, researchers earned $700 on average, and the startup tells TechCrunch that top performers in the program earn over $20,000 annually.</p>
<p>With its Series A investment in the bank, the company plans to double the bounty size in the short-term, with plans to grow it by up to fivefold over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>“The power of the global threat hunting community is an untapped resource for security teams around the world,” said Andrii Bezverkhyi, founder and CEO of SOC Prime. “Our threat detection marketplace is fueled by the industry’s most diverse, bounty-driven threat hunting community, and we are committed to empowering them as they contribute timely, impactful detections that help organizations adopt a collaborative defense approach to more efficiently combat digital threats.”</p>
<p>SOC Prime was founded in 2015 by Bezverkhyi, alongside fellow Ukranians Oleksandr Bredikhin and Ruslan Mikhalov, as a way to help organizations establish basic security practices and improve threat visibility in the face of a global talent shortage and alert fatigue, the startup tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>In the last 12 months, the company grew its premium subscriber base by 50%, its monthly recurring revenue by 86% and its active customer base by 85%. Its customer base includes over 6,000 organizations using its freemium SaaS offering and over 70 paying customers, including enterprises, public sector organizations in the U.S. and EU, and security vendors.</p>
<p>The startup currently has over 80 employees in addition to the more than 300 vetted top threat researchers that create and monetize their threat detection code. By the end of 2022, the company plans to reach 140 employees and more than 900 vetted researchers.</p>
<p>Hiro Rio Maeda, managing partner at DNX Ventures, said: &#8220;Just like Netflix and Spotify changed the way that consumers access music and movies, we believe that SOC Prime will revolutionize the way that security teams access the threat detection content that is vital to defend their organizations.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Product developers want to use AI, but don't always have the right tools to do it without relying on data scientists.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://mage.ai/">Mage</a>, developing an artificial intelligence tool for product developers to build and integrate AI into apps, brought in $6.3 million in seed funding led by Gradient Ventures.</p>
<p>Founder Tommy Dang started the company at the end of 2020 after working together to build internal low-code tools at Airbnb. While collaborating with product developers, Dang and Wang saw that while product developers wanted to use AI, they didn’t have the right tools in which to do it without relying on data scientists.</p>
<p>“We worked with hundreds of developers who had great machine learning tools and internal systems to launch models, but there were not many who knew how to use the tools,” Dang told TechCrunch. “They didn’t work with machine learning extensively, so we decided to build tools for technical non-experts. We are like Stripe for AI, making it easier for developers to put AI into apps.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219626" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/607716/worldwide-artificial-intelligence-market-revenues/">market for AI tools</a> is expected to reach $126 billion by 2025, but most of those continue to be geared toward those with experience in AI. Mage’s technology is a low-code, cloud-based tool and user interface with a shared workspace similar to Figma. Users can add data by uploading a file, streaming data or connecting to a data warehouse. From there, they can build models and select from other use cases, like churn prevention, ranking and matching users. Following the model creation, users can review the model, improve on it and then download to a file, connect back to the data warehouse or deploy it into an API or app.</p>

<p>Joining Gradient in the round were Neo, Designer Fund and a group of angel investors, including Unity CEO John Riccitiello, Behance founder Scott Belsky, Lenny’s Newsletter author Lenny Rachitsky and James Beshara.</p>
<p>Darian Shirazi, general partner at Gradient Ventures, said via email that he found Mage while looking for an investment in the machine learning infrastructure space that didn&#8217;t require data engineering experience. He saw most of the companies funded recently were heavy infrastructure, and facilitated large jobs for data scientists and machine learning engineers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shirazi saw a market asking for technologies and systems that enabled non-data scientists to leverage AI and machine learning. Shirazi found that in Mage. He had met Dang while at UC Berkeley and later reconnected while Dang was at Airbnb. He believes that if “Mage succeeds in providing the easiest tools for leveraging AI and machine learning, they will transform how everyone does business.”</p>
<p>“There is a strong appetite from companies and individuals to leverage technologies and systems that are currently only accessible to domain experts such as data scientists, ML engineers and AI researchers,” he added. “The reality is that the number of applications for AI/ML are endless. There needs to be simple tools to allow anyone to leverage machine learning, without requiring a deep understanding of math, computer science or data science.”</p>

<p>He considers Mage&#8217;s “superpower” to be “the nexus of data quality tools and interoperability of ML models and features.” Shirazi expects the company to eventually have a marketplace of different models and tools for manipulating and combining data sets, like for marketing, sales, product and finance.</p>
<p>Mage is still in beta, but working with small businesses, and Dang said the company has plans for its self-service feature to go live in early 2022. Behind-the-scenes, the company is hiring for product design and engineering and intends to also use the new capital to build out additional AI tools and expand internationally.</p>
<p>Dang said the company wasn’t focused on revenue at the moment, but has amassed a group of paying customers from the beginning. These early clients are helping Mage by trying out the features, he added.</p>
<p>“Our next steps are to launch to general availability where you can onboard yourself,” Dang said. “The need for machine learning is a global need, and not many others emphasize making tools accessible. We have a community of developers that want to expand their skill set and grow their toolkits.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A rush of platforms have been built in the last several years that cater to the needs of knowledge workers, helping them find jobs (and employers find workers), managing the remuneration process regardless of location, and addressing their professional development. But that is not the whole story. Today, a startup called <a href="https://www.wonolo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wonolo</a> that has built a work-booking app for the other end of the employment spectrum &#8212; front-line workers and laborers &#8212; is announcing a major round of funding.</p>
<p>The company has picked up $140 million on the back of its own growth. Wonolo says that to date over 1 million people &#8212; retail workers, delivery people, administrative clerks, general laborers, event staffers and more &#8212; have used its platform to find work, with the thousands of companies using its services ranging from huge consumer brands like Coca Cola through to Uniqlo and Mutual of Omaha. It will be using the funding to continue expanding its platform in the U.S. with international being something it would also like to consider down the road.</p>
<p class="p4">Leeds Illuminate led the round, with &#8220;strong participation&#8221; also from 137 Ventures and G2 Venture Partners, with Franklin Templeton also in the round. Wonolo last raised funding well before the pandemic hit &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/19/wonolo-a-staffing-platform-for-blue-collar-and-labor-contractors-left-behind-by-silicon-valley-raises-32m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$32 million in 2018</a> &#8212; which speaks to the state of the company&#8217;s business and its margins, and the boost its business has seen in the last couple of years (including, specifically, the last 20 months). Wonolo has now raised more than $200 million, and Yong Kim, the company&#8217;s founder and CEO, said it is not disclosing its valuation except to say that it has &#8220;significantly increased&#8221; since the last round.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220123" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Wonolo&#8217;s rise and ethos speaks to a specific moment in the world of labor and employment. Front-line workers took on a new profile in the Covid-19 pandemic. After years of gradual neglect and disregard in favor of the shift to digitally native &#8220;knowledge workers&#8221;, they suddenly became heroes, people who were taking on jobs and getting things done at a time when many others were staying at home and avoiding contact with others, either by choice, or company or municipal mandates.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s opened the door to thinking more about what the needs of those workers might be, and how to provide services that cater to them specifically. And in the view of Wonolo that has a direct correlation to what it has built. In short, there are front-line workers in the world today who do not want to be tied to single companies &#8212; either because they don&#8217;t want to be doing the same job day in, day out; or because they need more time flexibility &#8212; and so Wonolo has built a platform to help them continue to get jobs in that context.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifty percent of the world is in front line work, and those people have been misunderstood and underexposed,&#8221; Kim said. &#8220;Now we have a moment to empower them and we want to be the company that stands for them and educates the world on the amazing job they are doing. We want to increase awareness of that workforce, and we want them to be more fulfilled in their jobs.&#8221; He added that there is currently a &#8220;tremendous demand for flexible working&#8221; among blue-collar and front-line laborers.</p>
<p>The company sits in an interesting crossroads in gig economy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the one hand, gig (or temporary, non-regular) working has found a strong current in the concept of &#8220;on demand&#8221;: companies staff up to meet a specific need in a specific time, whether they are built in themselves as &#8220;on demand&#8221; businesses like Uber or delivery companies; or if they are not those kinds of businesses but are trying to operate in more agile ways.</p>
<p>On the other hand, being a gig worker can have its own issues. Work consistently enough for a single company, and you will start to wonder why you too shouldn&#8217;t be afforded the benefits of more standard employees. This has played out in a number of countries with more requirements demanded of those employing the workers, and will likely continue to for years to come.</p>
<p>Wonolo, as a platform to encourage more gig working, does not offer anything equivalent to a &#8220;union&#8221; for those using its platform, but Kim says that it sees its role is as an enabler of better practices. It provides some guidance on adequate pay, and Kim notes that the marketplace also plays a role: if a job is priced too low, no one picks it up. And Kim says that some who are regularly working for a single company do sign on sometimes as full-time staff, although generally speaking the appetite among Wonoloers (as the workers are called) is to remain freelance. That in itself has presented a challenge for some employers, he added &#8212; one reason why they turn to using Wonolo to find workers in the first place.</p>
<p>“The world of temporary staffing is massive, generating over $500 billion in global annual revenue. We see Wonolo as the leader in disrupting this space and offering a tech-first, flexible solution that helps businesses and workers alike,” said Stephanie Nieman, MD at Leeds Illuminate, in a statement. “We are struck by how thoughtful Wonolo has been in building a business that puts workers first and is innovating with organizations to solve real labor problems across many industries.” Nieman is joining the startup&#8217;s board of directors with this round.</p>
<p>Longer term, it will be interesting to see what kinds of jobs fall into the Wonolo net, and I suspect that thinking of this as &#8220;front-line&#8221; will see that net widen. Kim said that teachers (specifically substitute teachers), nurses and other care staff, and even more technical jobs are all categories that it will be looking to incorporate into its platform over the years. Whether you see that as more skilled jobs turning into &#8220;blue collar&#8221; or if blue collar is rising in stature might depend on how you choose to view it, but the fact remains that it points to another big trend in labor: gig jobs appear to be gaining ground over full-time work, and so platforms like Wonolo&#8217;s to connect people with jobs will continue to play a role.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.valencesecurity.com/">Valence</a>, a Tel Aviv-based security startup that aims to help businesses better protect what Valence calls the &#8220;business application mesh,&#8221; today announced that it has raised a $7 million seed round, led by <a href="https://www.ylventures.com/">YL Ventures</a>. Stonemill Ventures, the <a href="https://www.stlcig.com/">St. Louis Cyber Interest Group</a> (STLCIG) and a number of angel investors, including a group of prominent CISOs, also participated in this round.</p>
<p>Founded by CEO Yoni Shohet (who also previously co-founded <a href="https://www.scadafence.com/">SCADAfence</a>) and CTO Shlomi Matichin, Valence helps businesses better understand the connections between the many enterprise SaaS and self-hosted applications they now use. Often, after all, a company may use APIs, automation tools like Workato or Zapier or SaaS marketplaces to get more value from their various tools. But at the same time, this network, which Valence dubs the &#8220;business application mesh,&#8221; often grows without a lot of governance, leaving the door open for a variety of security issues from the shadow connectivity, over-provisioned privileges and unmanaged third-party access that is the inevitable result of connecting all of these disparate systems.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219880" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Valence-logo-Full-color-Horizontal@3x.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219880" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2219880 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Valence-logo-Full-color-Horizontal@3x.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2219880" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Valence</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219876" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;When we started to talk to practitioners and talk to security customers and CISOs about this problem space, we realized that there&#8217;s this unhandled world of integrations between applications that is basically unmanaged and ungoverned by any type of security solution today,&#8221; Matichin told me.</p>
<p>What the team realized is that a lot of security tools today focus on how humans access corporate applications. Matichin argues that these tools don&#8217;t cover machine-to-machine connections very well, especially given the rise of automation and cloud migrations we&#8217;re seeing in the enterprise world right now. The connections between these applications are often set-and-forget &#8212; and depending on the company, there may not even be a formal vetting process either. Among other things, this leaves a company open to an unvetted third party having privileged access into the ecosystem of their corporate applications and data.</p>
<p>As Shohet noted, a lot of these networks are pretty centralized. By being able to scan the connections to a relatively small number of core systems, Valence can quickly detect potential issues like unvetted vendors and help its users disconnect these &#8212; or automate the process if needed. Some customers, he noted, are able to reduce their risk surface by dozens and sometimes even hundreds of applications within a few days of getting started with Valence.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s really hard right now in security is to define a very unique approach to solve something in a holistic way,&#8221; YL Ventures partner John Brennan said.&#8221; And so, while we as investors had in our minds these fragments of different problems, the risk you&#8217;re running security right now &#8212; especially with so many smart people starting a lot of interesting companies &#8212; is solving maybe a small problem in an interesting way. And what Yoni and Shlomi together did when they came to us is essentially evangelize and define and articulate a massive platform that could solve a lot of these problems with a very different approach. [&#8230;] <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">I think it&#8217;s fair to say, when I look across our whole portfolio, the early velocity of this company is truly remarkable and I think it is a testament to the two people running it.&#8221; </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you follow tech press, you&#8217;ve probably noticed more outlets covering the blockchain-based, play-to-earn trend, wherein individuals playing crypto-powered games can ostensibly earn a living off their gaming skills if they earn assets within the game or tokens that they can then sell for &#8220;real&#8221; money.</p>
<p>A Vietnam company called &#8220;Axie Infinity&#8221; has been driving the current conversation. It&#8217;s so popular that a startup in the Philippines that exists solely to lend money to players who want to get started in &#8220;Axie Infinity&#8221; (one needs first to buy its digital creatures) attracted a check from Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<p>A month later, &#8220;Axie Infinity&#8221; <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/10/05/investing-in-axie-infinity/">itself </a>announced funding from the firm.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219846" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Arianna Simpson of a16z on Yield Guild Games, the firm&#8217;s newest bet on crypto + gaming&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/arianna-simpson-of-a16z-on-yield-guild-games-the-firms-newest-bet-on-crypto-gaming/embed/#?secret=bl5GK3Rpdz" data-secret="bl5GK3Rpdz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The trend is no flash in the pan, say the cofounders of a new, early-stage venture firm called Patron. Instead, they believe games like &#8220;Axie&#8221; will be the biggest consumer on-ramp to what&#8217;s being called the decentralized &#8220;Web 3&#8221; era.</p>
<p>We emailed yesterday with Patron&#8217;s founders to learn more. One of them, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Brian Cho, spent the last seven years with Riot Games, leaving as its global head of business and corporate development. (He also logged two years with Andreessen Horowitz beginning in 2012.) His cofounder, </span>Jason Yeh, spent the last four years as the founder of his own investment firm in Berlin, Germany and before that, worked for<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> eight years at Riot Games, including as its </span>head of EU Esports.</p>
<p>They shared the many individuals who make up Patron&#8217;s new LP base, including a handful of investors from Andreessen Horowitz, along with Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures, Garry Tan of Initialized Capital, and Hans Tung of GGV Capital. They also shared a bit of their roadmap.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: You met at Riot Games. At what point did you decide you wanted to leave to do your own thing?</strong></p>
<p>BC: Yes, we initially met at Riot Games as colleagues and became close through co-investing in various deals over the past decade. Patron has been in the works conceptually for many years. However, it wasn&#8217;t until recently that the market&#8217;s needs provided us with the opportunity to successfully create the type of firm we originally wanted to build that led us to [do this].</p>
<p><strong>TC: You have capital commitments from a lot prominent VCs. Who wrote the first check? </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">BC: We purposely focused on getting individuals who would have skin in the game and a desire to help our companies reach a successful Series A milestone. </span>What we didn&#8217;t expect was how much positive impact our earlier individual LPs would have on our overall fundraising and our ability to win some of the most competitive seed deals in the market. We were able to raise the entire $90 million in four months.</p>
<p>Many of the LPs are people we&#8217;ve been close to for the better part of the past decade as colleagues or co-investors, so it made sense to get them on board first. Our first checks were our former bosses and mentors like Chris and Marc at a16z, Rick and Amish at FirstMark [where Yeh was an associate more than a decade ago], and the founders of Riot Games. Our average individual check size is north of $400,000, so many of the individuals wrote large personal checks into the fund.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are there any institutions involved? If Riot Games a backer?</strong></p>
<p>JY: Horsley Bridge Partners and Invesco are two of our most significant institutional leads in the fund. Riot Games is not an investor, as we wanted to prioritize individuals and institutions rather than strategics for fund one.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">TC: &#8216;Play to earn&#8217; is everywhere suddenly, thanks to &#8220;Axie Infinity.&#8221; How long have you been tracking this trend, and which other startups are interesting here and why?</span></strong></p>
<p>BC:I left Riot Games briefly four years ago to start a company in the NFT games space when Cryptokitties had first launched. It was, unfortunately, the wrong timing for us as consumers or investor interests were not strong back then, especially after the market bottomed out in 2018. That said, the most significant signal for us has been around products like &#8220;Axie Infinity&#8221; and &#8220;NBA Top Shot&#8221; that we can onboard non-crypto users onto the platform in the past year.</p>
<p>In addition, crypto-native products like BAYC and Punks have been driving more mainstream awareness. The 2.3 million-strong waitlist on Coinbase NFT marketplace and the deal flow we see from AAA and Web 2 game developers leaving to start companies in the space have all been fantastic signals.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How many investments have you made to date?</strong></p>
<p>JY: We&#8217;ve made four investments in the space, which are still unannounced but live squarely within our thesis.</p>
<p><strong>TC: W<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ill you be using the capital to buy tokens and equity? How are you thinking about these different modes of investment, and what are your LPs&#8217; expectations on this front?</span></strong></p>
<p>JY: Yes, and one of our first deals is a pure token deal. We evaluate these on a case-by-case basis, and our perspective is that it should be a thoughtful implementation for the type of startup or product that the founder should try to build. We&#8217;ve told our LPs that Web 3 and tokens will be a significant part of the fund given the strong convergence between gaming and Web 3, and it&#8217;s one of the reasons why they are excited to be investing in Patron.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">TC: Do you think there is any particular advantage to being based in Los Angeles, given what you are funding?</span></strong></p>
<p>JY: Yes, there is a strong intersection of arts, creatives, gaming, entertainment, and crypto in LA right now. That said, we&#8217;re a virtual native firm, and while we will have a presence in LA and SV, our coverage will be international, and we expect around half of our deals to come outside of the US.</p>
<p>I recently moved back to LA after spending most of the prior decade living in Berlin, and both Brian and I spent time working on opportunities in East and Southeast Asia during our time at Riot. We believe you can build global consumer businesses from any of these geographies.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">TC: In terms of check sizes, how are you thinking about the minimum investment you&#8217;ll make &#8212; and where&#8217;s the upper boundary?</span></strong></p>
<p>JY: We are taking the high conviction and concentrated portfolio model &#8212; meaning we aim for quality over quantity and look to lead or co-lead opportunities at the seed stage. This means that we&#8217;ll [write anywhere] from $1 to $4 million checks for the stage that we play in, with the goal of having a high ownership % early as a lead investor.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">TC: Where are you scouting around for interesting projects?</span></strong></p>
<p>JY: Our LPs have been some of the best sources of our deal flow and ability to win competitive deals. Of course, Twitter and Discord will be natural places for us to connect with founders. We also expect non-traditional areas like Web 3 native communities such as DAOs or closely-knit angel syndicates &#8212; which we are part of &#8212; to be a vital source of our future deal flow.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[RevOps developed a software stack that enables users to build “the knobs and switches” that make automated quote-to-cash approvals.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Building internal sales agreement software, often known as quote-to-cash, is an expensive and time-consuming process that <a href="https://www.revops.io">RevOps</a> wants to take off the plate of fast-growing startups.</p>
<p>Today, RevOps announced an oversubscribed $5 million follow-on seed round led by Caffeinated Capital, Coatue Management and Gradient Ventures. Angel investors, including Twilio’s Jeff Lawson and executives from Airtable, GitHub and Twilio, also participated. The round brings the company’s total seed funding to $6.7 million.</p>
<p>Company founders Adam Ballai and John Solis saw this problem firsthand while working at Twilio and PullString, respectively. Ballai led the team that built Twilio’s billing software to automate receivables, payables, reconciliations and pricing engines, while also launching hundreds of new products annually. However, much of the deal management was still being done via spreadsheet.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219509" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The essential revenue software stack&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/the-essential-revenue-software-stack/embed/#?secret=fyb53U0rZT" data-secret="fyb53U0rZT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>After Twilio, Ballai moved on to Stripe, and again saw that familiar spreadsheet. After meeting Solis, the pair did a study on the time it took to put these pricing deals together.</p>
<p>They found out that not only did it take hours to go through the approval process, but that many salespeople were often new to their positions and hadn’t yet have nailed down all of the ins-and-outs, like terms and conditions. They noticed much of that sales workflow could be automated as the salespeople worked in their company’s CRM.</p>
<p>RevOps developed a software stack that enables users to build “the knobs and switches” that make automated approvals, Ballai told TechCrunch. Users can also create a pricing calculator that already has terms and conditions baked in, as well as the ability to customize the payment structure of the deal. And, by taking a headless approach to deal management, users can integrate RevOps with other parts of the operations stack as they work with engineering.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company, founded in 2018, is already working with startups like Onna, Ketch, Stytch, Loom and Retool.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re experiencing rapid growth as a company, and RevOps is helping us operationalize our sales infrastructure so we can feel confident about scaling quickly in 2022 and beyond,&#8221; said Jonathan Krangel, Retool’s head of sales, success strategy and operations, in a written statement. &#8220;It&#8217;s on track to become a critical part of our go-to-market stack, not just integrating with our CRM but also with other platforms we rely on like Slack, Stripe and DocuSign.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ballai plans to use the funding to grow the company, including building out its executive team and investing in R&amp;D for further integrations and programs targeted to early-stage startups.</p>
<p>The new funding comes as the company experienced a 146% growth in customers between 2020 and 2021. Many of them are looking to scale their sales representatives, in some cases by five times, he said.</p>
<p>In addition to the funding announcement, RevOps also recently launched its agreement automation integration into the HubSpot marketplace so that those using the CRM can quickly quote prices and create deals.</p>
<p>“We try to tackle the right product that is going to be most effective, and we have an amazing team that created a repository of features,” Ballai added. “Our goal is to help people have choice on how they have their quote-to-cash, a space that has not had innovation.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.cockroachlabs.com/">Cockroach Labs</a>, the makers of CockroachDB, announced a public beta of a new serverless version of its SQL database today, giving developers an easier way to access database resources that scale up and down without having to explicitly define them.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Spencer Kimball says that the goal is to reduce complexity for developers, while providing a granular pricing structure. &#8220;[The serverless product] eliminates decision points upfront for the developer, which is quite important. But then the other thing that&#8217;s [a big advantage] is that you can be billed for fine-grained usage, so you only get charged for exactly what you use,&#8221; he told me.</p>
<p>The key thing is with a serverless approach to the database, is that it eliminates all of the capacity planning and everything associated with that for developers. That means they no longer have to predict the number of nodes or machine types that they will need to run their application Instead, they simply point to the Cockroach serverless database and it will provide the exact number of resources required to run the workload. That might not even be a full node if the workload doesn&#8217;t require that.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220129" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While this involves using shared resources, Kimball points out that when it comes to individual data, that will always be isolated on the back end. &#8220;The important part where your actual data is unencrypted is completely isolated to any particular developer or use case. So there is still isolation, but on the back end a lot of the data storage and retrieval organization tasks are being shared across a large number of machines and essentially what that allows us to do is efficiently use the resources,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says this ability to share resources efficiently has enabled the company to offer a generous free tier to developers to build their applications and not have to pay until it really begins to take off. What&#8217;s more, if you have bursty workloads, the resources will scale up and down for you automatically as needed, and you can dictate how much you&#8217;re willing to spend so the resources don&#8217;t outpace your ability to pay for them, an important point when you&#8217;re automating capacity in this way.</p>
<p>Kimball says the company doesn&#8217;t ask for a credit card until you cross the threshold of the free tier into a paid one, so you won&#8217;t be surprised with a bill if your application suddenly takes off. While he describes the free tier as generous, the exact details of these pricing tiers were still being worked out.</p>
<p>The serverless product is available in public beta today.</p>
<p>Cockroach Labs was founded in 2015 and has raised over $355 million, according to Crunchbase data.Its most recent funding was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/cockroach-labs-scores-160m-series-e-on-2b-valuation/">a $160 million Series E</a> at a $2 billion valuation in January.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The market for corporate data privacy products is heating up, with <a href="https://www.skyflow.com/">Skyflow</a> announcing a $45 million Series B this morning, just a day after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/tripleblind-secures-24m-for-a-new-approach-to-enterprise-level-privacy-preserving-data-sharing/">TripleBlind announced a $24 million round</a>.</p>
<p>Skyflow, which TechCrunch has covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/skyflow-raises-7-5m-to-build-its-privacy-api-business/">since its early-2020 seed financing</a>, offers an API-delivered service that stores personally identifying information (PII), among other sensitive data for customers.</p>
<p>When we last discussed Skyflow, the company had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/skyflow-raises-17-5m-more-to-help-companies-protect-your-personal-data/">just closed its $17.5 million Series A</a>, back in late 2020. It has since expanded its product mix to include a <a href="https://www.skyflow.com/post/introducing-the-fintech-data-privacy-vault">fintech-data-focused service</a> to help financial technology companies store credit card and other sensitive information. The company offers variations of its service for healthcare companies, as well.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219764" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Insight Partners led the new financing event, which included money from venture arms associated with AmEx and Santander. The startup has now raised $70 million, it said in a release.</p>
<p>Skyflow, like many API-delivered companies, wants to take a hard problem and abstract it into a single developer hook. Or, more simply, Skyflow wants to handle all the difficult privacy, encryption and data issues of storing PII and other forms of potentially radioactive data for its customers. (Skyflow uses a zero-trust vault built with polymorphic encryption, in case you are curious.)</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Skyflow <a href="https://twitter.com/anshublog">co-founder and CEO Anshu Sharma</a> emphasized that his company is working to ensure that it can handle data residency requirements and other related regulatory matters so that companies around the world can use its service without attracting the ire of any particular government.</p>
<p>The startup is seeing some success with its model thus far, claiming &#8220;8x growth&#8221; in the last nine months. From what base &#8212; and where that growth scales the company&#8217;s revenue run rate to &#8212; was not clear. Series B is roughly the point after which we demand harder metrics from startups; this will be Skyflow&#8217;s last round where we&#8217;ll chat about it without harder figures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup has around 65 staff today and is looking to roughly double that by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>Skyflow didn&#8217;t need to raise new funds when it closed its Series B. It has been less than a year since it raised its last round, after all. The company had capital still on its books from that prior investment &#8212; around $11 million, per Sharma. That data point matters because it implies that the company raised when it wasn&#8217;t forced to by a dwindling bank account, likely giving it leverage in its fundraising.</p>
<p>The company declined to share a valuation on the record, but given the $45 million raise, we expect that the company is now comfortably into the nine-figure range, though where it lands on that interval is not clear. PitchBook <a href="http://pitchbook.com">data indicates</a> that Skyflow was worth just under $100 million before it raised this round, so a valuation of $300 million to $500 million feels range-correct for its Series B, if we were the guessing type.</p>
<p>The issue of data privacy is not small. TripleBlind and Skyflow are not the only companies working on the matter, though they both have healthcare-facing products for sale. Certainly, with its new raise, Skyflow has the cash to make its case that it has built the right product for its target markets and thus will not find itself eventually subsumed into some larger technology shop.</p>
<p>Thinking one level up from the startups we&#8217;re discussing, companies are only accreting more data to themselves as time passes. If that weren&#8217;t the case, we wouldn&#8217;t see <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/databricks-raises-1-6b-at-38b-valuation-as-it-blasts-past-600m-arr/">Databricks scaling its revenues and valuation as rapidly</a> as it is. More data, more risk. More risk, more demand for privacy-focused software. In secular terms, startups focused on solving the data storage and security issues are running downhill.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overwatch Research, a company creating workflow software for medical research, announced a $3.5 million seed</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">round on Tuesday. This round of funding will help Overwatch expand its presence into the US, and get its clinical trial management software into more labs and drugmakers’ hands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overwatch Research is behind software, also called Overwatch, designed to run the ins and outs of preclinical trials, from data collection to task tracking. The interface isn’t dissimilar to project management software you might see at a desk job (something like Trello, for instance), but its tools are designed for lab experiments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experimental data can be shared in a central location. Study data can be visualized instantly, and lab-specific organizational tools, like spreadsheets tracking lab animals’ status, are all held in one place. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218329" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overwatch is CEO and co-founder Chris Armstrong’s approach to a problem he encountered during his career in prostate cancer drug development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seemed that we were still stuck in the same archaic method of managing studies,” Armstrong tells TechCrunch. “Everything was just spreadsheets and email trails. Things that in this day and age, I felt, should have been solved.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interviews with over 250 biotech and pharma companies confirmed Armstrong’s intuition that the problem wasn’t only confined to his own experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overwatch was founded in 2017 and has already raised a pre-seed round to build out its software’s capability. This current round, led by Frontline Ventures, will bring the company’s total amount of funding raised to $4.27 million total. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round also includes investment from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SV Angel, Techstart Ventures, and Michael Polansky (CEO of The Parker Group and Co-founder of Parker Institute for Cancer Immunology), as well as several investors already active in the intersection of data management software and clinical research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those investors include Zach Weinberg, the Co-founder of Flatiron Health (a major manager of real-world oncology data acquired by Roche in 2018), and Robert Fenton CEO of Qualio (a cloud-based data management system for life sciences companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overwatch didn’t disclose its valuation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big problem Overwatch is trying to tackle, per Armstrong, is the “reproducibility crisis” in clinical research. In short, when scientists try to recreate experiments and see if they get the same results, they find that this doesn’t happen as much as it should. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reproducibility crisis is best known in the world of </span><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aac4716"><span style="font-weight: 400;">psychology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But it’s also well-documented in preclinical research. A </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1002165#sec010"><span style="font-weight: 400;">major 2015 study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimated the irreproducibility rate in preclinical research could be about 50 percent, but </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1002165"><span style="font-weight: 400;">might also range</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from 18 percent to 89 percent (ironically, it estimating irreproducibility is an imperfect science). Either way, the study estimated that about $28 billion per year is spent each year on research that can’t be replicated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plenty of people have tried to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">understand why the reproducibility crisis exists. Explanations run the gamut from scientific fraud, to poor study design, shady statistical practices, and refusal to share data openly. For its part, the 2015 paper suggests poor research materials, study design and faulty data analysis are three major causes of the problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a lot of issues software alone to tackle, but Armstrong’s pitch is that Overwatch can at least make a dent in two of those three areas: study design and faulty data analysis. Overwatch’s approach to the problem is to smooth out the kinks in study design that can bias an experiment before it even starts. That’s done via a “study creation engine” that makes designing a study a matter of filling in the blanks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s basically a matter of a scientist going in and saying, ‘this is the type of model or type of study that I&#8217;m doing, and everything else is formatted as a consequence of that’,” Armstrong says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That formatting might suggest statistical tests that fit with certain study designs, and create systems designed to receive data in the proper format. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing to notice about Overwatch is the feel of the product. It’s a user-interface more like something you’d see on a personal computer, than in a lab. The design aspect, in addition to the clinical trials tools, is one way the company hopes to distinguish itself from existing research management software. Armstrong says it takes a one-hour demo to run through the product, and about five minutes on onboard new users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the major factors that’s lacking in software for life science is user experience as a whole. It seems like it&#8217;s about 10 to 15 years behind any other industry – scientists are still being forced to use horrible software that&#8217;s reminiscent of Windows XP, in terms of the interface,” says Armstrong. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User-friendly software for scientists, once thought to be a niche area, has yielded returns for at least for one company: Benchling, another platform that can track experiments, internlink data, and manage R&amp;D workflows. This year, Benchling has raised about $350 million, and was valued at $4 billion, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2021/04/14/biotech-rd-startup-benchling-hits-4-billion-valuation-as-the-company-starts-laying-the-groundwork-for-an-ipo/?sh=651b6ab03ac9">per </a></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real test, though, is whether Overwatch can actually sell to biotech and pharma companies, who will need to be convinced to let a startup’s software run their precious preclinical research processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Overwatch has closed 20 deals with biotech companies in the United States and 15 in Europe. The startup has closed one five-year license deal with a “top ten pharma” company. Armstrong says the company is currently speaking with three other major pharmaceutical companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also has at least one major academic partner: The Institute for Cancer Research, London. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This funding round will be focused on expanding Overwatch’s client base, and building out a sales and marketing team. At this point, nearly all client acquisition has come from word of mouth, says Armstrong. The company is also planning a move to Boston, Massachusetts, to shore up its US presence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The switch in the business now is going to be much more sales and marketing focus,” Armstrong says. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While investors continue to question whether crypto will swallow up more traditional VC opportunities down the road, it certainly appears that today the blockchain space is eating up the attention of Silicon Valley&#8217;s buzziest early investors.</p>
<p>Jesse Walden tells TechCrunch his crypto-centric VC firm <a href="https://variant.fund/">Variant</a> has raised a new $110 million early-stage fund, just over a year after the firm launched with a $22.5 million debut fund. Notably, Walden raised this fund alongside investor Li Jin who tells TechCrunch that she has joined Variant as its third general partner, merging her firm <a href="https://www.atelierventures.co/">Atelier Ventures</a> with Variant after deploying the entirety of her own creator economy-centric debut fund.</p>
<p>Jin and Walden overlapped during their time at Andreessen Horowitz, and, despite considerably different founding theses for their solo GP firms, found plenty of shared interest as they deployed their respective funds during the pandemic.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220045" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We realized that there was quite a bit of overlap and convergence in the themes that we were investing against &#8212; we, the passion economy, and Jesse, the ownership economy,&#8221; Jin told TechCrunch in an interview. &#8220;We co-led several deals together, we co-invested in several deals together, and it just became quite clear that the two theses were two sides of the same coin.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220071" style="width: 819px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220071" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2220071" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jin-Variant-1.jpg" alt="" width="809" height="511" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jin-Variant-1.jpg 2436w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jin-Variant-1.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jin-Variant-1.jpg?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jin-Variant-1.jpg?resize=768,485 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jin-Variant-1.jpg?resize=680,429 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jin-Variant-1.jpg?resize=1536,970 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jin-Variant-1.jpg?resize=2048,1293 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jin-Variant-1.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 809px) 100vw, 809px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220071" class="wp-caption-text">Image via Atelier</p></div></p>
<p>Jin has cultivated an outsized presence in the tech investor community in the past couple of years, building up her reputation for spotting trends in the creator economy space. She spent nearly four years at Andreessen Horowitz helping the venture giant source deals, before leaving last summer to start Atelier Ventures. Jin officially launched the $13 million fund this past February though she had been writing checks throughout much of 2020. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Throughout 2021, Jin has grown more outspoken in her views that technologies born out of the blockchain, like NFTs, may be the key to the next generation of creator monetization tools.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I raised my fund really as a traditional consumer Web2 fund,&#8221; Jin told us. &#8220;As I started deploying and spending more time in the ecosystem, I realized that crypto actually offered this really powerful toolset for aligning incentives between platforms and their participants.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>An upswing in cryptocurrency prices during the pandemic, teamed with surging interest in institutional NFT art sales and crypto gaming titles like NBA Top Shot and Axie Infinity made 2021 a massive year for crypto investment among the venture community. Andreessen Horowitz made waves earlier this year with the announcement of their largest vertical-specific fund yet, a $2.2 billion crypto fund. That growing stockpile of crypto-destined capital has made a16z impossible to ignore among smaller crypto funds looking to back the hottest companies.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Andreessen Horowitz triples down on blockchain startups with massive $2.2 billion Crypto Fund III&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/andreessen-horowitz-triples-down-on-blockchain-startups-with-massive-2-2-billion-crypto-fund-iii/embed/#?secret=qeAoyBYWxm" data-secret="qeAoyBYWxm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Atelier has had significant crossover with investments led by a16z, particularly on the crypto side of things. In addition to backing more traditional creator platform plays like Substack, Atelier&#8217;s portfolio of investments also includes NFT startup Yield Guild Games, DAO platform Syndicate, protocol XMTP and crypto publishing platform Mirror. </span>Variant has participated alongside bother Atelier and Andreessen in a handful of deals, but has also backed competitors as the firm has dug deeper into the emerging worlds of NFTs, DeFi and DAOs. Variant&#8217;s portfolio includes decentralized crypto exchange Uniswap, NFT platform Foundation and crypto wallet Phantom.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Variant brought on its second GP, Spencer Noon, who joined from a Miami-based crypto fund. Walden notes that many of the founders in the firm&#8217;s portfolio are also backers of the new Fund II itself &#8212; an effort Variant has made to leverage its network to stay competitive with bigger funds.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the space continues to expand, we obviously can&#8217;t hire 100 people in-house,&#8221; Walden tells TechCrunch. &#8220;And so we decided we need to take a network-driven approach, and in order to build a network that grows bigger, faster and adds more value to all stakeholders, we just looked to our thesis, which says that the way to grow bigger, faster is to give ownership to your users. So, who are our users? They&#8217;re the founders that we back and other builders in the space, and we have over 100 of them in the fund, meaning they own the fund itself.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you move around a city, you often end up farther away from some of your favorite restaurants and bakeries. <a href="http://www.shoplocale.com/">Locale</a> wants to keep you connected to the food you love, even if you live hours away now.</p>
<p>Locale, based in San Francisco, enables customers to order from dozens of businesses, including bakeries and restaurants, and get them delivered in one box for just a $5 delivery fee.</p>
<p>In addition to San Francisco, the company is now operating in Los Angeles. To keep up the pace, Locale secured a $2 million seed round led by Decent Capital, the family office of Tencent co-founder Jason Zeng. Other investors include Goodwater Capital and Esas Ventures.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219523" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>High school friends Jonathan Friedland and Chris Clark started Locale in 2020 and bootstrapped its way to hundreds of customers, and since being a part of Y Combinator’s three-month program, grew revenue by 100% year over year, Friedland said.</p>
<p>“We saw the crazy lines outside of popular bakeries, but when the pandemic hit, it wasn’t something you could do,” Friedland told TechCrunch. “We wondered why they weren’t on DoorDash, and the reason was two-fold: a bakery has to plan production days ahead of time, and every delivery sales takes away from retail customers. If a loaf of bread is $7, but you pay $15 for delivery, it doesn’t work for small-ticket items.”</p>
<p>Instead, their idea was to bundle businesses together and operate on a weekly model, so all of the bakeries and restaurants have one big order by Thursday for Saturday delivery rather than a bunch of separate orders. Locale employs hundreds of delivery contractors who don’t have to wait around for the food to be made, but go to Locale’s facility and pick up the deliveries that are on their route.</p>
<p>Their customers include more than 80 bakeries, restaurants and farms, enabling them to not only receive orders days ahead for better planning, but to expand their business’ delivery range to more than 100 miles, catering to loyal customers and reaching new customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Decent Capital’s Keyan Li, investment director, and Carley Phillips, investment analyst, told TechCrunch that the pandemic hit the restaurant industry, but as it moves to digitalization, both online and offline, Locale is providing a way for restaurants to find people.</p>
<p>“It is both an exciting and incremental market,” Li said. “People’s buying behaviors will stay, and they will do both food delivery online and also go into the shop. Locale is good for people who have left the metros, but still miss the city life and want to order something from their favorite place.”</p>
<p>And, Locale also gives smaller businesses a more even footing as large chain restaurants that already had similar infrastructure in place, Phillips said. She sees the trends going forward being more of a hybrid model of convenience and a seamless ordering experience as people move but still want to support local businesses.</p>
<p>The new capital comes as Locale expands farther into San Francisco and Marin County this month and adds a new “locale” in Los Angeles in November. The company broke even in its first 10 months of operation, doubled its revenue in the past three months and is already delivering more than 2,500 orders per month with an average order value of more than $105, Friedland said.</p>
<p>“We will continue to perfect the product, and as we expand, be able to deliver something that is just as top-notch a year down the line when we are in multiple locations,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Micromobility companies that aim to turn a profit have to juggle running a tight ship, adhering to constantly shifting local  regulations and getting as many riders on vehicles as possible. Boston-based Zoba, a micromobility fleet optimization startup, has developed a platform to help with that.</p>
<p>Zoba runs a behind-the-scenes logic layer of an operator’s fleet management software that uses AI to help decide where every vehicle in a fleet should be positioned, how to incentivize users with dynamic pricing and how to optimize operational efficiency.</p>
<p>“The way we approach this problem is we have a core platform that we&#8217;ve built, which is basically designed to help us understand your current market conditions, so we use machine learning to understand where demand will be for the systems, how that would be impacted by prevailing weather conditions and all the other sorts of very dynamic factors that happen in the market,” Joseph Brennan, co-founder of Zoba, told TechCrunch. “Then we feed that information into an optimization engine that is purpose-built to help us solve for these very large, complex optimization problems fast enough for them to be operationally relevant.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219172" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Zoba’s tech is plugged into the back end of over 150,000 vehicles across 150 cities globally, mainly in the U.S. and Europe. The startup works with very large operators, including Spin, and on Tuesday announced the close of a $12 million Series A round led by NTTVC, with participation from existing investor CRV.</p>
<p>Zoba intends to use the funds to scale its go-to-market functions, like customer support, sales and marketing, as it expands into new markets like India and Latin America. It also wants to expand into new verticals like delivery and maybe even autonomous ride-hailing in the future, says Brennan.</p>
<p>“We really think of ourselves as a deep tech company,” Brennan said. “The product is not done, it’s never going to be done. And so we will continue to invest heavily in terms of widening what we view as a pretty large technical lead between us and anyone else in this problem space.”</p>
<p>Zoba’s system is informed by historical data provided by the operators, such as where vehicles have been ridden or when they’ve been in maintenance. This information is then used to reconstruct demand histories in a way that can not only detail where rides have been in the past, but also predict where they will be in the future.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zoba also collects environmental information about the city that might drive near-term fluctuations in demand, like road networks and weather data.</p>
<p>“Weather is a really critical one,” said Brennan. “We’re using Tomorrow.io weather data, which is the best in class weather data that’s very granular and accurate, because we need to know for the next two hours, is it going to drop five degrees in temperature? Is it going to start to rain? This is the core of what’s flowing into our system.”</p>
<p>Most in-house fleet management platforms are less data driven and more intuition-based, with in local markets guessing at where demand might be, says Brennan.</p>
<p>“What we are trying to do is take that data which is an incomplete, heavily censored data set, and find some sort of truth about what demand actually looks like using models that we&#8217;ve been developing for years,” he said.</p>
<p>The company says by implementing its platform, shared micromobility companies have seen ridership increase by 20% to 50%, which helps to cover overhead costs like the vehicles themselves, warehouses and labor. Zoba also says it’s improved labor productivity by 20% by managing deployments, rebalances and battery swaps, and helps operators be better city partners by helping to manage zone constraints and keep vehicles off sidewalks.</p>
<p>“Zoba is truly unique in this market, in that they’ve spent a lot of time thinking about the industry’s problems, then building a new solution from the ground up to address fleet optimization,” said Ben Bear, CEO of Spin, in a statement. “Instead of relying on historical trends to determine demand, Zoba gives the ability to predict where our customers will need our services beforehand. That truly enables us to increase our revenues while reducing operational costs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Newfoundland-based <a href="https://www.colabsoftware.com/">CoLab Software</a>, which provides a web-based collaboration tool and issue-tracking platform for engineering teams, announced today that it has raised $17 million in Series A funding. New York-based investment firm Insight Partners led the funding round with participation from new and existing venture capitalists and angel investors from companies such as Xometry, Onshape, GrabCAD, Bosch, Tesla and Atlassian.</p>
<p>CoLab, which was founded in 2017, allows manufacturing teams to easily share and review design files while getting feedback in real-time. The platform currently has several Fortune 500 customers, including Hyundai Mobis, Schneider Electric and Johnson Controls.</p>
<p>The idea for CoLab originated while founders Adam Keating and Jeremy Andrews were building one of the world’s first hyperloop pods for SpaceX and working on the Model 3 program at Tesla. They say the teams that were building physical products were using tools 20 years behind teams that were building software products.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219783" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We became frustrated with just how slow and archaic things were,” CoLab co-founder and CEO Adam Keating told TechCrunch in an interview. “We became engineers to solve hard problems and create things but we ended up spending half of our time chasing down administrative work.”</p>
<p>Keating says they found that all of the processes were conducted manually and that the main record of communication within teams was through email. The pair then decided to build CoLab with the aim of helping innovative engineering companies improve collaboration within their teams. They acknowledge that the obvious choice for most founders at the time would have been to start a technology company in Silicon Valley. However, Keating and Andrews decided to start CoLab in Newfoundland and Labrador, the easternmost province in Canada.</p>
<p>CoLab’s short-term goal is to allow engineers to focus on creating and building by making their work as automated as possible. The company is doing this by investing in real-time abilities that allow design and manufacturing teams to collaborate efficiently.</p>

<p>The platform currently has three main features: Drive, Track and Reviews. The ‘drive’ feature lets users organize their work independently of their other file systems and share files securely. CoLab’s ‘track’ feature offers a birds-eye view of what’s happening within a team. Lastly, the ‘reviews’ feature lets users collaborate on designs, ranging from formal design reviews to informal peer checks.</p>
<p>CoLab currently consists of a 54-person team largely based in Newfoundland and across Canada. The company signed a gender diversity pledge in 2019 when its team was 10 percent female. Today, CoLab’s team is 33 percent female. With this latest round of funding, the company plans to double its workforce.</p>
<p>“We’re going to open 25 roles right away and then there will be a second group of 25 roles opening up just after the new year. The focus of that is going to be on helping us get CoLab into the hands of more engineering teams,” Keating said.</p>
<p>Additionally, some of the funding will be used for marketing purposes, as the company hasn’t spent much on that front to date. CoLab will use the last part of the funding to invest in upcoming products and features that are scheduled to launch later this year and early next year.</p>
<p>Further, as part of its funding release, CoLab also announced that Josh Fredberg, the managing director at Insight Partners, is joining CoLab’s board of directors.</p>
<p>“CoLab’s CoDesign tool is a game-changer for engineers around the globe,” said Fredberg in a statement. “Rarely do you see a product that so perfectly addresses a pain point that is both highly technical and widespread, but that’s what happens when you combine frustration with an entrepreneurial mindset. Adam, Jeremy and team are uniquely positioned to tackle a profession-wide problem with their category-leading platform.”</p>
<p>In terms of looking to the future, Keating says there is a bigger data model opportunity within CoLab that the company plans to leverage and that the company will continue to aim to give engineering teams a suite of tools that can help combine and automate their day-to-day activities.</p>
<p>“Long-term, it’s about plugging into each and every tool engineers have. We’d love to be plugged into Slack, Microsoft Teams and Jira so that when someone logs into CoLab, it’s their home base,” Keating said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no question that fintech has exploded in recent years. But along with that, we have also seen a related surge in funding into companies that provide the infrastructure that financial institutions &#8212; incumbents and fintechs alike &#8212; need in order to operate faster and more competitively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">São Paulo-based <a href="https://pismo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pismo</a> is one of those infrastructure providers. And today, the startup announced it has raised $108 million in a Series B funding round led by SoftBank. Interestingly, the financing also included “strong participation” from e-commerce giant Amazon and Silicon Valley-based venture firm Accel along with Falabella Ventures, PruVen and existing backers Redpoint eventures and Headline. With the latest raise, Pismo has now raised a total of $118 million in funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that Amazon has invested in a LatAm infrastructure provider for the financial services industry is notable. It appears that the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is investing time and energy in Latin America, and with that, is thinking about the payment methods and the infrastructure that consumers of Amazon services will have.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219797" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2016, Pismo has racked up a list of big-name customers, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banco Itaú (one of Brazil’s largest banks), BTG, Cora, N26 and Falabella. Its “platform” handles more than 4 billion API calls monthly and hosts more than 30 million accounts, which combined result in over $3.5 billion in transaction volume a month. For some context, at the beginning of this year, it was doing less than $1 billion per month in transaction volume, according to CEO and co-founder Ricardo Josua. It ended 2020 with less than 10 million accounts total. It’s growing at a rapid clip, adding about 2.5 million accounts monthly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a SaaS business, Pismo mostly makes money </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">by charging transaction fees. It charges per active account, so prices decrease based on volume. In other words, the more clients a customer has, the less they pay per account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pismo’s cloud-native core processing platform is aimed at giving banks, fintechs and other financial institutions “flexibility and agility,” said Josua. It does things like allow customers to launch products for cards and payments, digital banking, digital wallets and marketplaces. Pismo also claims to allow financial institutions to “take charge of their core data and use it intelligently.” Think of it as Latin America’s answer to Galileo.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are here to help these institutions to not be constrained and be ready for the next generation of payments and banking services,” Josua said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219947" style="width: 208px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219947" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2219947 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pismo.jpg?w=166" alt="Pismo" width="198" height="358" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pismo.jpg 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pismo.jpg?resize=83,150 83w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pismo.jpg?resize=166,300 166w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pismo.jpg?resize=375,680 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pismo.jpg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219947" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pismo</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s achieved great success in LatAm, the company plans to use its new capital to expand outside the region as well as to “accelerate the development” of technologies for banking, payments and financial markets infrastructure. Pismo already has customers in Asia and is planning to open offices in the United States (in Austin, Texas) and the United Kingdom (in Bristol).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All our major competitors are global players,” Josua said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also plans to invest in sales and go-to-market strategy. To this point, it has invested with no sales team and very little marketing effort, according to Josua.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, Pismo hired a former McKinsey partner, Vishal Dalal, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vishal-dalal-to-lead-international-expansion-of-pismo-one-of-the-worlds-most-advanced-financial-platforms-301232525.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to serve as its CEO of global operations</a>. Josua is no stranger to the financial space. He also founded <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/conductor-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conductor (now called Dock)</a>, which is widely considered to be LatAm’s first payments &amp; banking-as-a-service platform, and former executives of that company joined him to start Pismo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One year ago, the central bank [of Brazil] launched an instant payment solution. Banks and fintechs were scrambling,” Josua told TechCrunch. “Since we had built the technology for this new generation, we were ready and 100% real time and institutions were able to implement without a single line of code. It is a very simple product that we think will be spread everywhere, even in the U.S.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pismo also, unsurprisingly, plans to do more hiring &#8212; specifically it’s looking for more than 200 engineers. The startup has scaled from a team of 40 in March of 2020 and now has over 250 employees, 85% of which it says are technical talent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But just don’t call Pismo a fintech or a BaaS company. Josua prefers the term “techfin” to describe what the startup does.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are a technology company first and foremost,” he said. “We even provide the infrastructure for BaaS companies. Five of our clients are providing BaaS solutions to their customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its investors are bullish on the company&#8217;s potential, and not just in LatAm &#8212; but globally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex Szapiro, head of Brazil and operating partner at SoftBank, considers Pismo to be a company that “developed from scratch a world-class technology able to solve many of the problems in finance in a very scalable manner.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some of the largest banks and FIs in LATAM are already using Pismo not only for their digital attack initiatives but also for their core products, replacing outdated legacy providers,” he wrote via email. “At the same time, some of the most sophisticated fintechs are leveraging their products with their technology.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Szapiro believes that Pismo is in a unique position of being a &#8220;neocore&#8221; technology platform that is already running large-scale operations for financial institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The founders are outstanding and have great ambitions to make Pismo a truly global company,” he added in a written statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel partner Ethan Choi said his firm was looking for the “Galileo for LatAm” when it came across Pismo.  (Accel actually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/17/galileo-financial-raises-77-million-for-its-fintech-services-that-were-19-years-in-the-making/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invested in Galileo</a> before it sold to SoFi in October of 2019. )</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, he said, Accel was looking for a company that provides the core infrastructure for fintechs but also a company that understood the nuances of the local market’s banking ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Pismo, Accel found those things as well as a founding team that had helped build a “Gen1” version of Pismo today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We knew when we were looking, it needed to be a next-gen API-first, cloud-based platform,” Choi said. “And that’s what Pismo is. It’s the most robust platform of its kind we could find in the region, and as robust as any platform we’d see globally. It can help with everything you can list that a fintech needs to do.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK&#8217;s antitrust watchdog will take a close look at the music streaming market.</p>
<p>Today the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-plans-probe-into-music-streaming-market">announced</a> that it will be conducting a market study of music streaming as soon as possible, as its latest piece of work aimed at expanding competition in digital markets.</p>
<p>It uses market studies to identify competition and consumers issues &#8212; and, if needed, to look at how best to tackle problems.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220104" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The development could have implications for how mobile app stores and music streaming giants like Apple Music and Spotify can operate in the UK in the future &#8212; if the CMA decides it needs to step in and impose corrective measures.</p>
<p>The exact scope of the study is yet to be determined but in a letter to MPs the regulator said it will prioritize the work &#8212; writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;On 13 October, the Board considered initial proposals to carry out a markets project on music streaming. They agreed that work in this area aligned with the CMA’s prioritisation principles, and that it supported a strategic goal of the CMA to foster effective competition in digital markets, ensuring they operate in a way that promotes innovation and the consumer interest. On this basis, the Board agreed that there was merit in taking forward a market study. They also agreed, in the light of the concerns you have collectively expressed, that this work should be prioritised: that is, it should be the next market study that the CMA launches. CMA staff will now prioritise more detailed further work to refine and scope this project. This will again be considered by the Board, with a view to formally commencing the market study as soon as practically possible.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The move follows a <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/work/646/economics-of-music-streaming/">report by a parliamentary committee</a> this summer which identified concerns over the economics of the music streaming market &#8212; such as the possible dominance of major music labels and the potential for contractual agreements between them and streaming services which could stifle innovation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last month, in its response to the DCMS Select Committee report, the government asked the CMA to examine the economics of the market to dig into concerns around transparency and fairness.</p>
<p>In a statement today, Andrea Coscelli, CEO of the CMA, said: &#8220;The UK has a love affair with music and is home to many of the world’s most popular artists. We want to do everything we can to ensure that this sector is competitive, thriving and works in the interests of music lovers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the past decade, the music industry has evolved almost beyond recognition, with streaming now accounting for more than 80% of all music listened to in this country. A market study will help us to understand these radical changes and build a view as to whether competition in this sector is working well or whether further action needs to be taken.&#8221;</p>
<p>The CMA is building out its knowledge base on all things digital and is set to have an expanded role in overseeing the digital sphere as the government is in the process of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">reforming digital competition rules</a> to respond to concerns about the impact of tech giants.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uks-digital-markets-unit-starts-work-on-pro-competition-reforms/">Digital Markets Unit</a> has already been set up inside the regulator &#8212; pending legislation to establish its full powers. But the CMA has not been sitting on its hands waiting for the government to pass reforms.</p>
<p>It has previously conducted a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/03/uks-cma-launches-investigation-into-digital-advertising-and-its-potential-harm-to-consumers/"> study of the online advertising market</a> &#8212; which led to a raft of concerns being identified that appear to be informing the government&#8217;s reshaping of UK digital competition rules.</p>
<p>It has also stepped in and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">put a regulatory brake on Google&#8217;s plans</a> for phasing out third party tracking cookies &#8212; garnering commitments from the tech giant over how its planned &#8216;Privacy Sandbox&#8217; alternative will function. That investigation remains ongoing.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the CMA also opened <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/uks-cma-opens-market-study-into-apple-googles-mobile-duopoly/">a market study of Apple and Google&#8217;s dominance of the mobile ecosystem</a>. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/">Apple&#8217;s App Store is simultaneously under investigation</a> by the regulator.</p>
<p>On the music streaming front, European Union regulators are a little ahead of their counterparts in the UK &#8212; back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/europe-charges-apple-with-antitrust-breach-citing-spotify-app-store-complaint/">April</a> the Competition Commission charged Apple with an antitrust breach related to competition in the music streaming services market.</p>
<p>European music streaming rival, Spotify, had long complained about Apple&#8217;s T&amp;Cs being &#8216;unfair&#8217;, although the EU&#8217;s competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, claimed its case is not about Spotify &#8212; saying that rather it&#8217;s about the conditions that Apple imposes on all music streaming providers that are trying to reach customers via its App Store.</p>
<p>Since the EU has identified concerns it&#8217;s a fairly safe bet the CMA&#8217;s market study will also find some issues to be addressed.</p>
<p>But it remains to be seen what the UK regulator may suggest if it does find problems &#8212; with a range of possible outcomes available to it, such as making recommendations to government to change regulations or public policy; encouraging relevant businesses to self-regulate; taking consumer or competition law enforcement action against firms; or opening a more in-depth market investigation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most FMCG brands rely on a combination of owned and outsourced assets to carry out delivery operations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The variety of both models brings about a fragmented logistics cycle and FMCGs can lose significant value in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://illa.com.eg/">ILLA</a> is an Egyptian startup that provides full-stack delivery solutions to corporates and small businesses in the FMCG sector. And today, it is announcing the close of a $2 million funding round to scale across Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Having worked for over 15 years in the FMCG industry working for Coca-Cola, Clorox and others, I could see firsthand the kind of fragmentation that exists within logistics operations for big-name FMCG brands, and that called for a better approach than the existing solutions,&#8221; said Mahmoud El-Zomor, the startup&#8217;s CEO who founded the company in 2019.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219830" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon sensing a need for such a service, El-Zomor teamed up with his co-founders &#8212; Alaa Jarkas, Ahmed Sakr and Hossam Saraya &#8212; who have some background in the industry to build ILLA</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ILLA services </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are designed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for distributors, food and beverage chains, hotels, hypermarkets, manufacturers and other stakeholders involved in the FMCG industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has a unified platform and centralized operations team that handles middle-mile delivery logistics for FMCGs. The delivery provided by the company reduces friction between the brands and logistics suppliers as complete visibility of operations </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is assured</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its launch, the Egyptian startup has completed more than 250,000 transactions from over 65 clients</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some of these names include Coca-Cola, P&amp;G, Danone, Nestlé, Juhayna, and PepsiCo.<br />

<p><div id="attachment_2220094" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220094" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2220094" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC07765-copy-Copy.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="355" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC07765-copy-Copy.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC07765-copy-Copy.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC07765-copy-Copy.jpg?resize=300,156 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC07765-copy-Copy.jpg?resize=768,400 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC07765-copy-Copy.jpg?resize=680,355 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC07765-copy-Copy.jpg?resize=1536,801 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC07765-copy-Copy.jpg?resize=2048,1068 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC07765-copy-Copy.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220094" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ILLA</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Mohamed Emera, the company&#8217;s director of growth, ILLA is targeting the FMCG logistics head-on, which speaks to the company&#8217;s focus on disrupting the market in Egypt. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bigger picture is global, where fragmentation in supply chain is a $1 trillion market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That focus on the industry affords us leverage to dig deep into the problem and find solutions from within, that and the unique nature of delivery specific to FMCG gives us room for innovation that others cannot afford,&#8221; said the director.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the company digs deep to find more solutions from within, it also plans to use this investment to fuel growth in Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In addition, ILLA wants to &#8220;disrupt the traditional route-to-market for FMCG companies and SMEs while building more around its tech platform to deliver more value to its clients and drivers alike,&#8221; the CEO remarked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investors who led the round include Watheeq Financial Services and Golden Palm Investments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Others that participated are Loftyinc Capital Management, Kepple Africa Fund, Cubit Ventures, AUC Angels, Oqal Angel Network and Flat6Labs Cairo &#8212; it&#8217;s the accelerator&#8217;s third time investing in the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Khaled Zaidan of Watheeq Financial Services said, &#8220;With the onset of covid, the global supply chain management industry is suitable for modernization, and ILLA is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">uniquely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> positioned as an end-to-end execution platform.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Middle-mile logistics is one of the most underinvested segments of the global supply chain market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. ILLA has identified this massive opportunity in MENA and is offering a full-stack B2B supply chain management platform enabling FMCG brands to reach retailers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the lowest cost per case. Mahmoud and team are utilizing the trucking logistics shared economy and tech automation to innovate within a large and fast-growing market,&#8221; AJ Okereke, a partner at Golden Palm Investments, added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based on-demand grocery delivery and dark store operator <a href="https://gorillas.io/en">Gorillas</a> has grabbed &#8220;close to&#8221; $1 billion in Series C funds, in the latest sign of the searing investor interest driving activity in urban food shopping apps across the continent and beyond.</p>
<p>The round is being led by another food-focused on-demand delivery startup &#8212; German&#8217;s Delivery Hero &#8212; which<a href="https://www.deliveryhero.com/newsroom/delivery-hero-invests-in-gorillas/"> confirmed</a> it&#8217;s invested $235M in Gorillas to grab around 8% of the upstart grocery delivery startup.</p>
<p>Gorillas already passed a unicorn valuation back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/gorillacorn/">March this year</a>, even though it was only founded last year. It&#8217;s now being valued at $2.1BN, pre-money &#8212; and touts the Series C as largest funding raise of a non-listed business in the European grocery delivery sector.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220056" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Commenting in a statement, Kağan Sümer, CEO and founder, said: &#8220;The size of today&#8217;s funding round by an extraordinary investment consortium underscores the tremendous market potential that lies ahead of us. With Delivery Hero, we have chosen a strong strategic support that is deeply rooted in the global delivery market, and is renowned for having unique experience in sustainably scaling a German company internationally. We have the best team in our sector, leading partners, and financial resources to strengthen our market-leading position in <span class="xn-location">Europe</span> and beyond.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also participating in the round &#8212; which comes just seven months after Gorillas bagged a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/gorillacorn/">$290M Series B</a> &#8212; are existing investors Coatue Management, DST Global, <span class="xn-money">Tencent</span>, Atlantic Food Labs, Fifth Wall, Greenoaks, A*; along with new investors G Squared, Alanda Capital, Macquarie Capital<span style="font-size: 12px;">,</span> MSA Capital and Thrive Capital.</p>
<p>The startup operates a network of urban dark stores to fulfil orders for speedy grocery deliveries within the cities where it offers a service (it&#8217;s available in more than 55 cities at this point, including <span class="xn-location">Amsterdam</span>, <span class="xn-location">London</span>, <span class="xn-location">Paris</span>, <span class="xn-location">Madrid, New York</span>, <span class="xn-location">Milan</span> and <span class="xn-location">Munich</span>).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since its founding in <span class="xn-chron">June 2020</span>, Gorillas has scaled to operate more than 180 warehouses across its nine international markets, and says its last-mile couriers (who are employed on <a href="https://gorillas.io/en/blog/11-things-you-need-to-know-about-gorillas">fixed-term contracts</a>, rather than gig workers) delivered more than 4.5 million orders in the past six months alone.</p>
<p>The company says it&#8217;s now entering a new phase of its business following the period of rapid international growth &#8212; which will focus on building a scalable and robust business infrastructure at the same time as trying to accelerate future growth.</p>
<p>Specifically it said the Series C will be used to bolster its footprint in existing markets while investing further into operations, people, technology, marketing and finance infrastructures &#8212; to ensure it stays focused on customer experience.</p>
<p>For its part, Gorllias&#8217; lead investor for the round &#8212; Delivery Hero &#8212; said the investment underlines its own commitment to quick commerce (aka q-commerce) globally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gorillas has been setting new standards for the delivery industry by offering an efficient and sustainable alternative to traditional grocers. We have been following their stellar growth over the past few months, and we are beyond excited to be now part of their journey. Both of our companies place a lot of value on creating a strong sense of community and we are convinced that our investment will positively impact employees, consumers as well as our industry,&#8221; said Niklas Östberg, CEO and co-founder of Delivery Hero in a supporting statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Delivery Hero is on a mission to advance quick commerce globally and we see Gorillas as one of the leaders in Europe and the US,&#8221; he added. &#8220;The Gorillas team has an exceptional customer focus driving the highest retention rates we have seen in the industry. This has enabled them to reach over $300M revenue run-rate in only one year with continued double digit monthly revenue growth. We truly believe that investing in innovative q-commerce players will benefit the entire industry and set a new standard for what a great customer experience looks like.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the early pandemic, a few weeks before Gorillas was born, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/delivery-hero-ceo-shares-what-hes-learned-about-managing-logistics-during-a-pandemic/">TechCrunch discussed the grocery delivery market</a> with Östberg &#8212; who noted that it was seeing &#8220;a larger willingness&#8221; among its customer base to have more than hot meals delivered.</p>
<p>A year and a half later Europe&#8217;s landscape for on-demand delivery continues to be a highly volatile, high cash burn mix.</p>
<p>Other well-resourced local players in the convenience grocery space include the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/flink/">Berlin-based Flink</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/instant-grocery-startup-getir-makes-its-first-acquisition-to-expand-into-spain-and-italy/">Istanbul&#8217;s Getir</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/spains-glovo-inks-real-estate-tie-up-to-add-more-dark-stores-for-speedy-urban-delivery/">Barcelona&#8217;s Glovo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/zapp/">London&#8217;s Zapp</a>, to name a few &#8212; with plenty more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/londons-jiffy-scoops-28m-for-speedy-grocery-delivery/">upstarts scrambling to join the fray</a>.</p>
