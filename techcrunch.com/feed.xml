					<description><![CDATA[Perhaps these companies would have merely stayed private sans SPACs. If that's true, two cheers for blank-check companies?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are a number of ways to take a private company public: You can pursue a traditional IPO, sell a chunk of shares at a set price and start trading. You can direct list, and merely start to trade. You can host a hybrid auction-offering, like what Unity did.</p>
<p>Hell, Google showed us back in the day that a reverse-Dutch auction is possible, after which no one else deigned to try it.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the blank-check method: Instead of taking <em>your</em> company private, some rich people list a pile of hungry money instead, and then go hunting for a private company to merge with. If you consent, the money bucket and your actual company merge, renaming themselves after your operating entity. This is a SPAC-led debut.</p>
<hr />

<hr />
<p>And it&#8217;s what we&#8217;re discussing today, because there are a few upstarts going public via special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs, or blank-check companies) worth checking out.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>One deals with bitcoin, and one is a huge consumer-facing fintech that has <a href="https://www.sofistadium.com/">a stadium</a> named after itself. In the case of <a href="https://www.bakkt.com/">Bakkt</a>, the cryptocurrency-powering entity, a SPAC made some sense at first blush. <a href="https://www.sofi.com/">SoFi</a>, on the surface, seemed less obvious. (Bakkt is owned by Intercontinental Exchange, an exchange-focused, public company. It has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrynpollock/2020/03/19/bakkt-crypto-exchange-boosted-by-300m-from-microsoft-ice-during-crisis/?sh=15d362ab72c7">raised money from Microsoft</a> as well.)</p>
<p>This morning I want to dig through the two offerings&#8217; investor presentations to see what we can learn. After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/a-quick-peek-into-opendoors-financial-results/">viewing the Opendoor-SPAC presentation</a>, I had a few questions heading into the new deals. The first of which was whether SPACs were going to be used again to lift potentially-promising companies that lacked obvious, near-term growth stories to the public markets? If so, perhaps SPACs would wind up helping get more total companies public, which would not be a bad thing.</p>
<p>Especially given how many unicorns the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/with-5-new-unicorns-in-first-week-of-2021-are-we-in-for-a-stampede-this-year/">private markets are birthing</a> ahead of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/how-unicorns-helped-venture-capital-get-later-and-bigger/">the public market&#8217;s ability to IPO them all</a>; maybe SPACs would help close the liquidity gap?</p>
<p>So, does that very modest hypothesis fit with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bakkt" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bakkt">Bakkt <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and SoFi? And what can Bakkt tell us about Coinbase&#8217;s impending IPO and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/social-finance" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="social-finance">SoFi <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> about the state of consumer fintech? Let&#8217;s find out.</p>
<h2>SPAC me baby one more time</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ll start with Bakkt. You can read its release, including all the messy details of a SPAC-led combination <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210111005532/en/Bakkt-the-Digital-Asset-Marketplace-Launched-by-Intercontinental-Exchange-in-2018-to-Become-a-Publicly-Traded-Company-via-Merger-with-VPC-Impact-Acquisition-Holdings">here</a>. The piece you need to know is that the resulting, combined company will have an <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprisevalue.asp">enterprise value</a> of around $2.1 billion and more than $500 million in cash after all elements of the deal are closed.</p>
<p>So the market should soon have a publicly-traded, cryptocurrency-focused business that is loaded with cash. Fun!</p>
<p>Next we want to know how healthy Bakkt is as a business, which brings us to its investor presentation, which you can read <a href="https://www.victoryparkcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Bakkt-Management-Presentation.pdf">here</a>. The presentation stresses that Bakkt is backed by major companies, a plus for public investors who might still be skittish about bitcoin. It also stresses that Bakkt will handle a host of digital tokens instead of <em>just</em> cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Bakkt&#8217;s point that airline miles and other non-monetary rewards are <em>related</em> to decentralized cryptocurrencies in that they are digital tokens is worth considering. Bakkt views the breadth of its supported asset classes as both an advantage over its competitors, and something that it is expanding; equities trading is coming soon, which will users to view even more of their digitally-held assets in one place.</p>
<p>Then we get to the results section of the presentation, which includes what I think is the most egregious chart of all time:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095088" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095088" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2095088 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.05.28-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="319" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.05.28-AM.png 1248w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.05.28-AM.png?resize=150,70 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.05.28-AM.png?resize=300,141 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.05.28-AM.png?resize=768,361 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.05.28-AM.png?resize=680,319 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.05.28-AM.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095088" class="wp-caption-text">Akin to calling One America News Network &#8220;conservative,&#8221; this chart stretches the word&#8217;s definition somewhat.</p></div></p>
<p>Observe how competitors are denoted with <em>actual</em> data, while Bakkt bests them all with <em>projections. </em>Oof. So when it comes to what we can learn today from Bakkt about the impending Coinbase IPO I think that the answer is &#8220;not much.&#8221; Oh well.</p>
<p>We raise the above chart not merely to gently mock some of its embedded optimism, but also to note how nascent Bakkt&#8217;s consumer app really is. Per the company itself, it has yet to <em>really</em> launch:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2095090" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.07.26-AM.png?w=476" alt="" width="476" height="192" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.07.26-AM.png 476w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.07.26-AM.png?resize=150,61 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.07.26-AM.png?resize=300,121 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-9.07.26-AM.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px" /></p>
<p>This leads to the &#8220;results&#8221; shared being pretty heavy on speculation. Indeed, they are <em>nearly</em> <em>all speculation</em>. Check it out:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM has launched a new business unit to offer commercial customers — starting with FedEx — an ecosystem of electric and connected products, the latest effort in the company&#8217;s ambitious $27 billion bid to become a leading electric automaker.</p>
<p>The new business called BrightDrop, which officially launched Tuesday during the virtual 2021 <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> will begin with two main products: an electric van called the EV600 with an estimate range of 250 miles and a pod-like electric pallet dubbed EP1. BrightDrop has other products in mind and is tinkering with a few concepts, including <span style="font-weight: 400;">medium-distance vehicle that transports multiple electric pallets known as EP1 as well as a rapid load delivery vehicle concept, which was teased Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095107" style="width: 1926px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.39.01-AM.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095107" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2095107 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.39.01-AM.jpg" alt="" width="1916" height="968" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.39.01-AM.jpg 1916w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.39.01-AM.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.39.01-AM.jpg?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.39.01-AM.jpg?resize=768,388 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.39.01-AM.jpg?resize=680,344 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.39.01-AM.jpg?resize=1536,776 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-7.39.01-AM.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1916px) 100vw, 1916px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2095107" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> GM/screenshot</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just a vehicle play, however. GM has also developed a suite of software tools to offer an EV ecosystem for the commercial marketplace. It&#8217;s also setting up a dealership network to support sales and service and plans to help commercial customers set up charging infrastructure.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-weight: 400;">cloud-based software platform, which can be accessed on the web or by mobile app, will give users information to improve operations, including the best delivery routes and other fleet management features, according to GM. The electric van and pallet will have an array of connected features designed to give customers better ways to monitor and manage the vehicles, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">location monitoring, battery status and remote commands to lock and unlock. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095087" style="width: 4010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-mobile-asset-management-.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095087" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2095087 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-mobile-asset-management-.jpg" alt="" width="4000" height="2667" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-mobile-asset-management-.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-mobile-asset-management-.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-mobile-asset-management-.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-mobile-asset-management-.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-mobile-asset-management-.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-mobile-asset-management-.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-mobile-asset-management-.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-mobile-asset-management-.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4000px) 100vw, 4000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2095087" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> GM</p></div></p>
<p>BrightDrop is the latest &#8220;startup&#8221; to spin out of the automaker&#8217;s Global Innovation effort, an in-house organization that has led to the launch of <span style="font-weight: 400;">OnStar Insurance, OnStar Guardian and GM Defense. Travis Katz, who was an entrepreneur-in-residence at Redpoint Ventures, has been named CEO and president of BrightDrop. </span></p>
<p>The idea for BrightDrop was sparked by a team within the Global Innovation organization that was evaluating the growth of e-commerce and consumer demand for online delivery, which has been exacerbated by COVID-19.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more we learned about the demand and the challenges of delivery and logistics from that first mile to literally the last five feet, the more we saw the opportunity to leverage GM&#8217;s expertise in things like electrification, mobility applications, telematics, fleet management to help businesses move goods and services in a smarter and more sustainable way,&#8221; Pam Fletcher, vice president of Global Innovation at General Motors, said in a media briefing ahead of the announcement.</p>
<p>That opportunity is a substantial one, based on GM&#8217;s estimates. The automaker said that by <span style="font-weight: 400;">2025, the combined market opportunity for parcel, food delivery and reverse logistics in the U.S. will be more than $850 billion. Demand for urban last-mile delivery is expected to grow by 78% by 2030, leading to a 36% increase in delivery vehicles in the world&#8217;s top 100 cities, according to the World Economic Forum. At the same time, this increase in demand is expected to cause delivery-related carbon emissions to rise by nearly one-third.</span></p>
<h2>The EP1</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2095086" style="width: 4010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095086" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2095086 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg" alt="" width="4000" height="2278" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg?resize=1536,875 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg?resize=2048,1166 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BrightDrop-EP1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4000px) 100vw, 4000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2095086" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> GM</p></div></p>
<p>The business unit&#8217;s first product is called the EP1, <span style="font-weight: 400;">a propulsion-assisted, electric pallet developed to move goods over short distances. For instance, it might be used to shuttle goods from a warehouse to a delivery van. The pod will be available in early 2021.</span></p>
<p>The EP1 has a built-in electric hub motor that can travel up to 3 miles per hour. The pod&#8217;s speed will adjust depending on the operator&#8217;s walking pace.</p>
<p>The EP1, which GM says it&#8217;s designed to maneuver in tight spaces, can about 23 cubic feet of cargo space and carry a payload of up to 200 pounds. Inside the pod are adjustable shelves and lockable cabinet doors to allow for remote access to whatever goods are being transported.</p>
<p>FedEx recently completed a pilot program testing the EP1. <span style="font-weight: 400;">FedEx Express couriers were able to safely handle 25% more packages per day with the EP1s, according to GM.</span></p>

<p>The electric delivery van is a vehicle designed and built off of GM&#8217;s Ultium architecture — the heart of the company&#8217;s EV strategy. The first vans will be delivered to FedEx at the end of this year. <span style="font-weight: 400;">BrightDrop expects to make the EV600s available to more customers to order starting in early 2022.</span></p>
<p>The vehicle will be able to travel an <span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated 250 miles on a single charge. Its peak </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">charge rate will be up to 170 miles of EV range per hour via 120kW DC fast charging, according to GM</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>The inside is roomy with <span style="font-weight: 400;">600 cubic feet of cargo area and comes with a security system to keep goods safe. There is a 13.4-inch-diagonal, full-color infotainment screen, front sliding pocket doors, wide cabin walkways and a large auto-open cargo bulkhead door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The electric van comes standard with advanced driver assistance tech found in its consumer vehicles, including f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ront and rear park assist, automatic emergency braking and other warnings to keep the driver in the lane. The van also comes standard with a forward collision alert, following distance indicator, front pedestrian braking and  automatic high beams and HD Rear Vision Camera.</span></p>
<p>Customers can pump up the safety features and add options such as r<span style="font-weight: 400;">ear cross traffic braking, blind zone steering assist, reverse automatic braking, HD surround vision, rear pedestrian alert and enhanced automatic emergency braking.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">America is a land of paperwork, and nowhere is that more obvious than at the end of someone’s life. Advanced care directives have to be carefully disseminated to healthcare providers and strictly followed. Property has to be divided and transferred while meeting relevant estate laws. And of course, there are the logistics of a funeral, cremation or other option that has its own serious complexities, costs and choices.</p>
<p>The worst time to figure out how to die is when you die. The best time to figure it out is precisely when you don’t have to.</p>
<p>For New York City-headquartered <a href="https://lantern.co">Lantern</a>, the goal is to initiate those conversations early and give its users significantly better peace-of-mind, particularly in these dolorous times.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company offers essentially a “how-to” platform for beginning to prepare for end-of-life, offering checklists and monitoring to ensure that the vast majority of details are figured out in advance. In some cases, the startup will handle the underlying details itself, while in other areas like estate planning, it works with partners such as Trust &amp; Will, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/trust-will-raises-15m-as-digital-estate-planning-hits-mainstream/">which we have profiled a number of times on TechCrunch</a>.</p>
<p>Right now, the company has two plans: a simple free one and a $27 / year plan that tracks your progress on end-of-life planning and allows you to collaborate with family, friends or whoever else needs to be part of your decision-making. The company is in the process of adding other à la carte options for additional fees.</p>
<p>Last month, the company raised $1.4 million in a seed round led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/draper-associates-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="draper-associates-2">Draper Associates <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with a few other firms involved. Earlier, the company raised a pre-seed round of $890,000 from the likes of 2048 Ventures, Amplify and others, bringing its total fundraised to date to $2.3 million. The company is organized as a public-benefit corporation and was founded in September 2018 and first launched a year later.</p>
<p>For founders Liz Eddy and Alyssa Ruderman, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lantern-co" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lantern-co">Lantern <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was an opportunity to tackle a looming problem in a compassionate and empathetic way. “I started my first company when I was 15,” Eddy, who is CEO, said. That company focused on dating abuse and domestic violence education for high school and later college students. “I really fell in love with the pace and variety of starting something new, but also in creating conversations around topics that people really don&#8217;t want to talk about and making it more palatable and comfortable,“ she said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094851" style="width: 631px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094851" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2094851" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CoFounders_Lantern_3.jpg?w=621" alt="" width="621" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CoFounders_Lantern_3.jpg 3652w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CoFounders_Lantern_3.jpg?resize=137,150 137w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CoFounders_Lantern_3.jpg?resize=274,300 274w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CoFounders_Lantern_3.jpg?resize=768,841 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CoFounders_Lantern_3.jpg?resize=621,680 621w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CoFounders_Lantern_3.jpg?resize=1402,1536 1402w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CoFounders_Lantern_3.jpg?resize=1870,2048 1870w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CoFounders_Lantern_3.jpg?resize=46,50 46w" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094851" class="wp-caption-text">Lantern co-founders Alyssa Ruderman and Liz Eddy.

<p>Later, she joined local suicide prevention non-profit <a href="https://www.crisistextline.org">Crisis Text Line</a>, which has an SMS-based network of crisis counselors who are trained to calm people and begin their process of recovery. She spent more than six years at the organization.</p>
<p>As for Ruderman, who is COO of Lantern, she most recently spent two years at Global Citizen, a non-profit organization focused on ending extreme poverty. The two connected and incubated Lantern at startup accelerator Grand Central Tech.</p>
<p>The idea for better end-of-life planning came from personal experience. “I lost my dad when I was in elementary school,” Eddy said, “and saw firsthand how loss and grief impacts a family financially, emotionally, logistically, legally — every aspect.”</p>
<p>Today, many of these processes are offline, and the online products mostly available today are focused on individual elements of end-of-life planning, such as estate planning or selecting and purchasing a casket. Eddy and Ruderman saw an opportunity to provide a more holistic experience with a better product while also initiating these conversations earlier.</p>
<p>That pre-planning part of the product was launched just as the pandemic was getting underway last year, and Eddy said that “we had a sort of a really interesting launch where people were starting to come to terms with their own mortality in a way we hadn&#8217;t seen in a very long time.” Typical users so far have been between 25 and 35 years old, and many people start planning when they have a major life event. Eddy says that the death of a family member is an obvious trigger, but so is having a baby or starting a company.</p>
<p>One aspect that Eddy emphasized repeatedly was that having a will and pre-planning for end-of-life are not equivalent. “Even if you don&#8217;t have a dollar to your name after you pass away, there are a ton of other things that your loved ones, family members, whoever&#8217;s responsible has to consider,” she said.</p>
<p>From a product perspective, there are some nuances compared to your more typical SaaS startup. For one, the company needs to engage you regularly, but not too frequently. Unlike, say, a wedding which is a single event that then is over, your documents and directives need to be occasionally edited and updated as a user’s life circumstances change.</p>
<p>Beyond that, one of the largest challenges with a product that talks about death is building a connection with a user that doesn’t seem cold, and, well, Silicon Valley-like. “Even as a product that is entirely virtual, making sure that you really feel that human connection throughout” is a high priority, Eddy said. “We use a lot of empathetic language, and our imagery, all of the illustrations are done by illustrators who have lost someone in memory of the person who&#8217;s lost.”</p>
<p>Longevity startups may remain a thesis for some VC investors, but handling the end — no matter when — is an activity every person faces. Lantern might shine just a bit more light on what is otherwise a debilitating and scary prospect.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.cockroachlabs.com/">Cockroach Labs</a>, makers of CockroachDB, have been on a fundraising roll for the last couple of years. Today the company announced a $160 million Series E on a fat $2 billion valuation. The round comes just eight months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/cockroach-labs-scores-86-6m-series-d-as-scalable-database-resonates/">the startup raised an $86.6</a> million Series D.</p>
<p>The latest investment was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/altimeter-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="altimeter-capital">Altimeter Capital <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from new investors Greenoaks and Lone Pine along with existing investors Benchmark, Bond, FirstMark, GV, Index Ventures and Tiger Global. The round doubled the company&#8217;s previous valuation and increased the amount raised to $355 million.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Spenser Kimball says that the company&#8217;s revenue more than doubled in 2020 in spite of COVID, and that caught the attention of investors. He attributed this paradoxical rise to the rapid shift to the cloud brought on by the pandemic that many people in the industry have seen.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;People became more aggressive with what was already underway, a real move to embrace the cloud to build the next generation of applications and services, and that&#8217;s really fundamentally where we are,&#8221; Kimball told me.</p>
<p>As that happened, the company began a shift in thinking. While it has embraced an open source version of CockroachDB along with a 30-day free trial on the company&#8217;s cloud service as ways to attract new customers to the top of the funnel, it wants to try a new approach.</p>
<p>In fact, it plans to replace the 30 day trial with a newer version later this year without any time limits. It believes this will attract more developers to the platform and enable them to see the full set of features without having to enter credit card information. What&#8217;s more, by taking this approach it should end up costing the company less money to support the free tier.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we expect is that you can do all kinds of things on that free tier. You can do a hackathon, any kind of hobby project [&#8230;] or even a startup that has ambitions to be the next DoorDash or Airbnb,&#8221; he said. As he points out, there&#8217;s a point where early stage companies don&#8217;t have many users, and can remain in the free tier until they achieve product-market fit.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s when they put a credit card down, and they can extend beyond the free tier threshold and pay for what they use,&#8221; he said. The newer free tier is still in the beta testing phase, but will be rolled out during this year.</p>
<p>Kimball says that company wasn&#8217;t necessarily looking to raise, although he knew that it would continue to need more cash on the balance sheet to run with giant competitors like Oracle, AWS and the other big cloud vendors, along with a slew of other database startups. As the company&#8217;s revenue grows, he certainly sees an IPO in its future, but he doesn&#8217;t see it happening this year.</p>

<p>The startup ended the year with 200 employees and Kimball expects to double that by the end of this year. He says growing a diverse group of employees takes good internal data and building a welcoming and inclusive culture.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the starting point for anything you want to optimize in a business is to make sure that you have the metrics in front of you, and that you&#8217;re constantly looking at them [&#8230;] in order to measure how you&#8217;re doing,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;The thing that we&#8217;re most focused on in terms of action is really building the culture of the company appropriately and that&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve been doing for all six years we&#8217;ve been around. To the extent that you have an inclusive environment where people actually really view the value of respect, that helps with diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kimball says he sees a different approach to running the business when the pandemic ends with some small percentage going into the office regularly and others coming for quarterly visits, but he doesn&#8217;t see a full return to the office post-pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and pharmaceutical company Moderna have <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210112005245/en/Uber-and-Moderna-Collaborate-to-Raise-Awareness-and-Increase-Access-to-COVID-19-Vaccines">announced a partnership</a> around COVID-19 vaccination, which will include a number of different initiatives. To start, it&#8217;s only confirmed component is to provide users with credible, factual information about COVID-19 vaccine safety through Uber&#8217;s consumer app, but the companies have also discussed additional &#8220;options&#8221; including building ride scheduling via Uber directly into the immunization appointment booking process.</p>
<p>Still in its early days, the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program is already beset with challenges, including providing timely access to vaccines to swaths of the population who need it most. The inoculation program also has to contend with significant misinformation proliferating on social media about vaccine safety, and any app with the surface area of something like Uber has a chance to get positive messages and accurate information in front of a lot of people, so that&#8217;s good news on its own.</p>
<p>But one of the very real challenges to an effective vaccination campaign remains logistical, and getting people to make their initial and follow-up appointments for the first round of the Moderna vaccine, and its second shot booster, is a bigger challenge than many might suspect. I spoke to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/healthvana" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="healthvana">Healthvana <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO Ramin Bastani about their work with  LA County on creating an immunization record that integrates with Apple Wallet to provide patients with timely info and reminders about vaccination appointments, but integrating a ride-booking service or appointment reminder directly in the Uber app that most users already have on their phone anyway could be another very effective way to increase success rates for first and follow-up inoculation visits.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Uber has already <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/10-million-rides/">offered up free and discounted rides</a> to help lower the friction of actually going out and getting a vaccine, but a product-level integration could do a lot more than that by providing easy, user-friendly access. As noted, this is still just one of the options being discussed, but if Uber and Moderna are willing to commit it to print, that at least means they&#8217;re serious about trying to find a way. We&#8217;re holding them to account, too, so rest assured we&#8217;ll follow up on their progress as this collaboration develops.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The maker of a defunct cloud photo storage app that pivoted to selling facial recognition services has been ordered to delete user data and any algorithms trained on it, under the terms of an <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/01/california-company-settles-ftc-allegations-it-deceived-consumers">FTC settlement</a>.</p>
<p>The regulator investigated complaints the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ever-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ever-2">Ever <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> app &#8212; which gained <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/01/photo-app-ever-removed-its-spammy-sms-feature-after-apple-banned-it/">earlier notoriety</a> for using dark patterns to spam users&#8217; contacts &#8212; had applied facial recognition to users&#8217; photographs without properly informing them what it was doing with their selfies.</p>
<p>Under the proposed settlement, Ever must delete photos and videos of users who deactivated their accounts and also delete all face embeddings (i.e. data related to facial features which can be used for facial recognition purposes) that it derived from photos of users who did not give express consent to such a use.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Moreover, it must delete any facial recognition models or algorithms developed with users’ photos or videos.</p>
<p>This full suite of deletion requirements &#8212; not just data but anything derived from it and trained off of it &#8212; is causing great excitement in legal and tech policy circles, with experts suggesting it could have implications for  other facial recognition software trained on data that wasn&#8217;t lawfully processed.</p>
<p>Or, to put it another way, tech giants that surreptitiously harvest data to train AIs could find their algorithms in hot water with the US regulator.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The quick background here is that the Ever app shut down last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/ever-once-accused-of-building-facial-recognition-tech-using-customer-data-shuts-down-consumer-app/">August</a>, claiming it had been squeezed out of the market by increased competition from tech giants like Apple and Google.</p>
<p>However the move followed an investigation by <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/millions-people-uploaded-photos-ever-app-then-company-used-them-n1003371">NBC News</a> &#8212; which in 2019 reported that app maker Everalbum had pivoted to selling facial recognition services to private companies, law enforcement and the military (using the brand name Paravision) &#8212; apparently repurposing people&#8217;s family snaps to train face reading AIs.</p>
<p>NBC reported Ever had only added a &#8220;brief reference&#8221; to the new use in its privacy policy after journalists contacted it to ask questions about the pivot in April of that year.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/01/california-company-settles-ftc-allegations-it-deceived-consumers">press release</a> yesterday, reported earlier by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225171/ftc-facial-recognition-ever-settled-paravision-privacy-photos">The Verge</a>, the FTC announced the proposed settlement with Ever received unanimous backing from commissioners.</p>
<p>One commissioner, Rohit Chopra, issued a standalone <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1585858/updated_final_chopra_statement_on_everalbum_for_circulation.pdf">statement</a> in which he warns that current gen facial recognition technology is &#8220;fundamentally flawed and reinforces harmful biases&#8221;, saying he supports &#8220;efforts to enact moratoria or otherwise severely restrict its use&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Until such time, it is critical that the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/federal-trade-commission" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="federal-trade-commission">FTC <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> meaningfully enforce existing law to deprive wrongdoers of technologies they build through unlawful collection of Americans’ facial images and likenesses,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Chopra&#8217;s statement highlights the fact that commissioners have previously voted to allow data protection law violators to retain algorithms and technologies that &#8220;derive much of their value from ill-gotten data&#8221;, as he puts it &#8212; flagging an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/ftc-sells-kids-privacy-cheap/">earlier settlement with Google and YouTube</a> under which the tech giant was allowed to retain algorithms and other technologies &#8220;enhanced by illegally obtained data on children&#8221;.</p>
<p>And he dubs the Ever decision &#8220;an important course correction&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="U41WksBSL2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/ftc-sells-kids-privacy-cheap/">Children&#8217;s privacy costs just $170 million for Google in settlement with the FTC</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Children&#8217;s privacy costs just $170 million for Google in settlement with the FTC&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/ftc-sells-kids-privacy-cheap/embed/#?secret=U41WksBSL2" data-secret="U41WksBSL2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Ever has not been fined under the settlement &#8212; something Chopra describes as &#8220;unfortunate&#8221; (saying it&#8217;s related to commissioners &#8220;not having restated this precedent into a rule under Section 18 of the FTC Act&#8221;).</p>
<p>He also highlights the fact that Ever avoided processing the facial data of a subset of users in States which have laws against facial recognition and the processing of biometric data &#8212; citing that as an example of &#8220;why it&#8217;s important to maintain States&#8217; authority to protect personal data&#8221;. (NB: Ever also avoided processing EU users&#8217; biometric data; another region with data protection laws.)</p>
<p>&#8220;With the tsunami of data being collected on individuals, we need all hands on deck to keep these companies in check,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;State and local governments have rightfully taken steps to enact bans, moratoria, and other restrictions on the use of these technologies. While special interests are actively lobbying for federal legislation to delete state data protection laws, it will be important for Congress to resist these efforts. Broad federal preemption would severely undercut this multifront approach and leave more consumers less protected.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be critical for the Commission, the states, and regulators around the globe to pursue additional enforcement actions to hold accountable providers of facial recognition technology who make false accuracy claims and engage in unfair, discriminatory conduct.&#8221;</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ever-ai" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ever-ai">Paravision <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has been contacted for comment on the FTC settlement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Archer, a company that&#8217;s looking to develop an airline of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for use in urban transport, will work with automaker Fiat <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/chrysler-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="chrysler-2">Chrysler <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Automobiles (FCA) in a new partnership to benefit from the latter&#8217;s expertise in engineering, design, supply chain and materials science. Archer aims to start production of its eVTOLs at scale beginning in 2023, with an initial unveiling to occur early this year.</p>
<p>The new team-up will see FCA provide input that contributes to the design of Archer&#8217;s eVTOL cockpit, as well, another area where the automaker has ample expertise, since it has designed spaces for drivers for many decades in its automotive business. Archer&#8217;s aircraft will be powered by an electric motor, and will be able to fly for up to 60 miles at top speeds of 150 mph. The Archer eVTOL is designed to be quiet and efficient, with efforts from the FCA collaboration going towards lowering the cost of its manufacturing to make high-volume manufacturing achievable and sustainable.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Archer is looking to FCA to help it realize efficiencies in its process that can make bringing its eVTOL to market a sound business that can also be accessed affordably by end users. Palo Alto-based Archer is looking to ultimately scale production to the point where it <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/archer-taps-fcas-scale-and-expertise-to-accelerate-electric-vertical-take-off-and-landing-aircraft-evtol-production-301206056.html">can produce &#8220;thousands&#8221;</a> of its eVTOL aircraft per year, for use in future air taxi services serving cities globally.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Based in Palo Alto and led by co-founders Brett Adcock and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/adam-goldstein" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="adam-goldstein">Adam Goldstein, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and including industry executives like Chief Engineer Goeff Bower, who previously served int hat role at Airbus&#8217; Vahana eVTOL initiative, Archer launched out of stealth earlier this year with backing from Marc Lore, current President and CEO of Walmart&#8217;s ecommerce business (he was co-founder and CEO of Jet when it was acquired by the retailer).</p>

<p><a href="http://jedox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jedox</a>, a German startup that builds tools to help companies with their financial planning and analysis using data sourced from basic documents like Excel spreadsheets, has picked up a funding of over $100 million &#8212; it&#8217;s not specifying exactly how much &#8212; in a round being led by Insight Partners, with Iris Capital, eCAPITAL, and Wecken &amp; Cie (all previous backers) also participating. The company currently works with some 2,500 customers including big players like Microsoft, McDonalds, and industrial giant ABB.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s software was originally built to work on-premises or in the cloud, and mainly oriented towards financial planners. Over the last several years, Jedox has expanded that to a wider set of adjacent users, specifically in HR planning and procurement, and the plan with this funding is to expand Jedox&#8217;s applicability into an even wider set of use-cases and verticals. CEO Florian Winterstein &#8212; who joined the company in 2018 during its last fundraise &#8212; said that while Jedox the name doesn&#8217;t have any particular meaning, the company has landed on a focus on the &#8220;X&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We want to focus on more than just the finance department,&#8221; he said, and the company thinks of FPNA (financial planning and analysis) &#8220;as XPNA&#8221; as a result. Expanding beyond their original verticals &#8220;is what everyone in enterprise is doing right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company has raised around $150 million to date, and Winterstein said that Jedox is not disclosing its valuation with this round. But he confirmed that Insight took a majority investment, and that this funding comes on the heels of a lot of demand from financial and strategic investors to back the company. The company counts Microsoft and Salesforce (prolific strategic investors in the startup world) among its partners and sometime customers today &#8212; as well as acquisition offers from enterprise resource planning companies due to its traction and presence in the market.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been approached tons of times, maybe every month, by companies from our space, from others in the area of financial services, and those looking for better tools to integrate into a wider suite of enterprise services,&#8221; he said. He called those approaches &#8220;interesting&#8221; but also said the startup was equally considering an IPO route in several years &#8212; the route that its closest competitor, Anaplan, has taken, he points out. In any case, there are no plans for an exit anytime soon with growth going strong.</p>
<p>Jedox got its start way back in 2002 and in a way is a very typical European startup story. Winterstein notes that its efforts were all open source-based and that the company was &#8220;not commercial at all, a lot of tech geeks and German engineering types that were not overly experienced in go-to-market strategies.&#8221;</p>
<p>That started to change over time, with Winterstein coming in and the founders stepping away, and the company also making its own shift, away from the open source model among the many changes that have taken place. (The open source elements, however, as still alive and well, collected mostly around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_(OLAP_database)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Palo</a> open source standard.) Jedox, Winterstein, is all-in in cloud services now, with SaaS making up 75% of its revenues, and the remainder mostly being about professional services related to that.</p>
<p>(The focus on professional services ushered by Winterstein is notable, considering his track record. Before this role, he led and founded a number of companies, two of which have been acquired by IBM, which arguably leads and dominates the market of building tech with professional services wrapped around it.)</p>
<p>For a lot of tech watchers and especially those in enterprise, these days when people talk about modelling, thoughts often spring immediately to artificial intelligence and things like big data machine learning, and that&#8217;s not too much of a surprise: AI is really the flavor of the month at the moment.</p>
<p>A lot of that, however, can be misleading. I&#8217;ve heard more than one tech person complain about how a lot of what is pitched and peddled as AI is not really that.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s quite refreshing is the Jedox does not try do that itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I get kind of annoyed by ‘what is AI’,&#8221; he said when I brought this up. &#8220;It may be simple predictions and statistical modeling they are doing.&#8221; He is quick to say that &#8220;not everything we do is AI, and if you look at our customer distribution, roughly 100 of our 2,500 customers are really using AI. Others are using what others may call AI but in the definition of what AI actually is, it is not.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that Jedox is not without AI in its systems for modeling and giving a better picture of what might happen at a business when considering different factors, but that Jedox does not in all cases develop those algorithms itself.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;There are around 20-25 algorithms out there and we don’t think it’s necessary to create the next algorithm,&#8221; he said. Instead, the company taps AI services provided by the likes of Google, Microsoft and others to run its services on a backbone, built by Jedox, &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">that throws user or customer data on various AI services and our backbone to figure out which algorithm suits the data and use case of the customer best.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Companies like Palantir have really brought to light how modeling and predictive insights can be used to an organization&#8217;s advantage. Jedox&#8217;s unique selling point is that it&#8217;s doing something like this but on a more actionable basis for average workers.</p>
<p>“Jedox offers a differentiated approach to financial planning through its flexibility, familiar Excel-based interface and focus on the customer,” said Jeff Lieberman, MD at Insight Partners, in a statement. “We are excited to partner with Florian and the Jedox team to bring market-leading cloud planning tools to industry leaders in every vertical, across the globe.&#8221; Rachel Geller, another MD at Insight Partners, and Henry Frankievich, principal, will be joining the board of directors with the round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Technologists are getting better at coding biology and venture firms are flooding a new generation of startups with cash so that they can commercialize their technology bringing in the next wave of genetic innovation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tesseratherapeutics.com/">Tessera Therapeutics</a>, the Boston-based spinup from Flagship Pioneering, is the latest company to enter the mix with $230 million in new financing to build up its platform for better biological programming.</p>
<p>The round was led by Alaska Permanent Fund Corp., Altitude Life Science Ventures and the second SoftBank Vision Fund, with participation from the Qatari Investment Authority and other undisclosed investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last year, the company took the covers off of its gene writing service, which combined an array of different gene editing, manufacturing and synthesizing technologies to provide more tailored therapeutic instructions to genetic code.</p>
<p>By providing more instructions to genetic material, the company aims to increase the precision of therapies while expanding the number of potential pathogens or mutations they can target, the company said in a statement.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The thesis is similar to the approach taken by companies like Senti Bio, another early stage biotech company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/senti-bio-raises-105-million-for-its-new-programmable-biology-platform-and-cancer-therapies/">which raised $105 million earlier this month</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="P4o2nR0wmw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/senti-bio-raises-105-million-for-its-new-programmable-biology-platform-and-cancer-therapies/">Senti Bio raises $105 million for its new programmable biology platform and cancer therapies</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Senti Bio raises $105 million for its new programmable biology platform and cancer therapies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/senti-bio-raises-105-million-for-its-new-programmable-biology-platform-and-cancer-therapies/embed/#?secret=P4o2nR0wmw" data-secret="P4o2nR0wmw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The ability to write in the code of life will be a defining technology of this century and drive a fundamental change in medicine. Today’s support is a testament to Tessera’s outstanding team of scientists and our focus on bringing the extraordinary promise of Gene Writing to patients,” said Geoffrey von Maltzahn, CEO and Co-Founder of Tessera Therapeutics, and a partner at Flagship Pioneering. “We look forward to turning this powerful technology into a new category of medicines.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Part of a number of companies focused on gene therapies and gene editing technologies that have been developed under the Flagship Pioneering umbrella, Tessera Therapeutics focuses on the development of new therapies that will use messenger RNA, targeted fusogenic vectors, and epitgenetic controllers, according to Flagship Pioneering founder and chief executive, Noubar Afeyan, who also serves as the chair and co-founder of Tessera.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While Senti Bio is adding more programming to existing genetic material, Tessera uses mobile genetic elements, the most abundant genetic material in the body to create new vectors for writing and rewriting the human genome.</p>
<p>The company asserts that this represents a breakthrough in genetic engineering, that can build better therapies. That&#8217;s because the technology can target very specific sites in the genome to make any substitutions, insertions or deletions in genetic code. Tessera also said that its tech allows for more efficient engineering of somatic cell genomes without double stranded-breaks and with very little reliance on DNA repair pathways.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Gene Writing is inspired by and builds upon the shoulders of nature’s most prevalent class of genes: mobile genetic elements. Tessera’s computational and high-throughput laboratory platform has enabled the team to design, build, and test thousands of engineered and synthetic mobile genetic elements for writing and rewriting the human genome.</p>
<p>The company said it can also write entirely new sequences into the genome by delivering only RNA.</p>
<p>With the new round of funding, Tessera said it would look to further develop its tech, hire more staff and establish manufacturing and automation capabilities critical for its platform and programs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UK SpaceTech startup <a href="https://www.skyrora.com/">Skyrora</a> is currently the only private company capable of launching rockets from UK soil. On Christmas Eve at its testing facility in Fife, Scotland, the team performed a third-stage static fire engine test onboard a new vehicle that will ultimately carry satellites to their final destination. But what’s more interesting is that the vehicle can refire it&#8217;s engine several times in orbit and conduct multiple missions in a single trip. This makes it a “Space Tug” able to perform a number of maneuvers in space including the extraction of space junk or maintenance if are satellites already in orbit.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/skyrora-ltd" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="skyrora-ltd">Skyrora <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> went rough one of the early Space Camp accelerator programme from Seraphim Capital.</p>
<p>The Space Tug is the first &#8220;mission ready&#8221; vehicle of its kind to be developed in the UK and once in orbit it can navigate to any location under its own power, with the ability to make multiple stops etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Space Tug is powered by a 3D-printed 3.5kN engine and the first stage of is launch is fueled using an eco-friendly fuel (Ecosene) made in part from waste plastics</p>
<p>Volodymyr Levykin, CEO Skyrora commented: &#8220;We have been deliberately quiet about this aspect of our Skyrora XL launch vehicle as we had huge technical challenges to get it to this stage and we wanted to ensure all tests had a satisfactory outcome, which they now have. With the current climate and a real shortage of good news, we feel it is the right time to share this with the world… We aim not only to conduct efficient launches from UK soil in the most environmentally friendly way, but then also to ensure that each single launch mission has the possibility of conducting the level of work that would have historically taken multiple launches.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Tim Peake, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/astronaut" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="astronaut">Astronaut, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> commented: “It&#8217;s fantastic that companies such as Skyrora are persisting in their ambition to make the UK a “launch state”. By driving forward and constantly investing into their engineering capabilities, the UK continues to benefit from these impressive milestones achieved. In undertaking a full fire test of their third stage, which fulfils the function of an Orbital Manoeuvring Vehicle capable of delivering satellites into precision orbits, Skyrora is one step closer to launch readiness. This vehicle will also be able to perform vital services such as satellite removal, refuelling and replacement and debris removal from orbit.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the technology byproducts of the Covid-19 pandemic is that it has raised the game for businesses to have better digital tools in place to interface with customers, and their own work, to get things done. Today, a company called <a href="https://getjobber.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jobber</a>, which has built a platform doing just that for a particular segment of the market &#8212; home services professionals &#8212; is announcing a round of funding as it finds its business growing.</p>
<p>The Canadian startup has picked up $60 million in funding. The equity round being led by Summit Partners, with participation also from previous backers OMERS Ventures and Version One Ventures, and new investors Tech Pioneers Fund.</p>
<p>Jobber&#8217;s platform is focused around management software to help sole-traders and small home services businesses make appointments and organize their schedules, set up billing and manage their accounts, and market their services online. The funding round comes at a time when Jobber already some 100,000 customers across 47 countries and 50 service segments, including cleaning, electrical repairs, landscaping, plumbing and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That is but a small piece of the opportunity: Jobber estimates that home services and other tradespeople make up a workforce of some 5 million in the U.S. alone, contributing over $550 billion to the economy annually.</p>
<p>Jobber&#8217;s rise comes at a key moment not just in the macroeconomic sense but also in the world of technology.</p>
<p>A vast swathe of businesses in a number of sectors &#8212; for example, finance, HR, medicine, commerce, education, and more &#8212; have spent decades adopting digital services to get their work done, a trend that has seen a big acceleration in the last year and the added intricacies that the coronavirus has brought to the working world.</p>
<p>But within that trend, one of the last holdouts has been the small business owner, and specifically those that work in very &#8220;hands-on&#8221; areas like home services, with many of them using mobile phones but little else in the way of technology to advertise themselves or run their operations.</p>
<p>That has seen a notable shift in the last year. Consumers are more than ever before using the internet to do business &#8212; whether that involves discovering companies or paying for goods and services &#8212; and tradespeople have found themselves also turning in that direction, not just to meet the changing demands of consumers, but also to keep themselves safe and in business. On top of that, the population of tradespeople themselves is getting younger and more digitally-native, and they are adopting and using these tools more naturally than their predecessors.</p>
<p>Jobber&#8217;s growth, said CEO Sam Pillar (who co-founded the company with Forrest Zeisler, CTO) in an interview, is &#8220;being driven by a number of factors, not just the ages of homeowners but also the providers of these services.&#8221; He added that many of the kinds of services that home services people provide &#8212; home repairs, our housekeeping, are not typically the kind that disappear with a pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those two trends meant that home services professionals performed better than you would expect in the economy, and so did we,&#8221; Pillar said. &#8220;The younger generation of business owners starting or taking over companies are looking to figure out they will use to manage what is otherwise a mass of paper.&#8221; So offering them solutions that are user-friendly also makes a difference, he said.. &#8220;Even if they are comfortable with technology, they are busy,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Jobber&#8217;s funding comes as part of a bigger trend of startups building services for later adopters in the B2B world also getting a boost in their business &#8212; and attention from VCs.</p>
<p>They include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/hover-secures-60m-for-a-3d-imaging-platform-used-to-assess-and-fix-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hover</a>, building technology and a wider set of tools for home repair people to source materials, make pricing and work estimates, and run the administration of their businesses, which secured $60 million in November. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/gosite-snags-40m-to-help-smbs-bring-their-businesses-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoSite</a> in December raised $40 million for a platform to help all kinds of SMBs &#8212; key factor being that many of them are coming online for the first time &#8212; build out and run their businesses.</p>
<p>The connecting thread with all three is the fact that they are tapping not just into wider &#8220;digital transformation&#8221; trends, but that the need for their particular services has really come into focus especially in the last year.</p>
<p>“We believe the home service category is in the early stages of a significant digital transformation – and Jobber is paving the way for thousands of small and mid-sized services businesses that are working to incorporate digital tools in order to keep pace with customer expectations,” said Colin Mistele, Principal at Summit Partners, in a statement. “The Jobber team blends strong product vision, data-driven market perspective and a customer-centric approach—a powerful combination that we believe will support the company’s continued rapid growth. We are thrilled to partner with the Jobber team – and we are excited about the future of this category.” Mistele is joining the board with this round.</p>
<p>The company is not disclosing its valuation and had raised just $16 million before this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Moving forward, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/yelp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="yelp">Yelp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> users won&#8217;t just be asked whether a business has good food or accepts credit cards — the platform is also allowing them to share feedback on whether the staff is wearing masks and enforcing social distancing.</p>
<p>Yelp&#8217;s head of consumer product Akhil Kuduvalli Ramesh suggested that this is the next phase of how the company is trying to help local businesses, after allowing them to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/yelp-virtual-services/">highlight virtual services</a>, manage their waitlists in accordance with new regulations and indicate <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/yelp-adds-new-features-for-reopening-businesses/">the health and safety measures that they&#8217;re taking</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s one thing to see that a business claims to have strict mask-wearing and social distancing procedures, and another to hear other customers confirm that it&#8217;s true (or not). So Ramesh said it&#8217;s less about warning users away from certain businesses and more working &#8220;to continue to instill confidence in consumers to continue to connect with and support local businesses.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When users visit a business profile they&#8217;ll now be asked whether social distancing was enforced and whether the staff wore masks — Ramesh said other health and safety questions could be added in the future (and users can offer slightly more detailed feedback on safety measures by hitting the Edit button in a profile), but those are the ones that users seem to care about the most.</p>

<p>When Yelp receives enough answers to offer present meaningful data (the company, understandably, isn&#8217;t disclosing the exact threshold), it will add a message in the health and safety section of the profile: “Social distancing enforced according to most users” with a green checkmark, or &#8220;Social distancing might not be enforced according to most users&#8221; with an orange question mark, with similar messages for mask-wearing.</p>
<p>In cases where the responses are mixed, but there&#8217;s still &#8220;significant&#8221; feedback indicating that these practices aren&#8217;t followed, the message will be attributed to &#8220;some users&#8221; instead.</p>
<p>Ramesh said that Yelp has already been collecting this user feedback, and at launch, only &#8220;a couple hundred&#8221; of the millions of businesses on Yelp will be marked with an orange label, &#8220;which also means that many businesses are doing the right thing.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094961" style="width: 425px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094961" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2094961" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GIF-of-Consumer-Feedback_Edit-Button-Flow.gif?w=415" alt="GIF of Yelp Consumer Feedback" width="415" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094961" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yelp</p></div></p>
<p>He noted that in cases of multi-location businesses, the health and safety data will be specific to each location. Also, the labels will be based on feedback from the past 28 days — so if a business gets an orange label but starts doing better, their profile should eventually be updated to reflect that.</p>
<p>In addition, Yelp says it&#8217;s adding new service offerings and safety measures that businesses can include on their profiles, including checking staff for symptoms, disposable or contactless menus, heated outdoor seating and covered outdoor seating.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One year in, the Covid-19 global health pandemic continues to have something of a dragging effect on many aspects of life, but today a key bellwether for how technology is developing underscored how the industry continues to march on. The number of patents granted in the US in 2020 totaled 352,013, representing a decline of just under 1% compared to the year before (the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/us-patents-hit-record-333530-granted-in-2019-ibm-samsung-not-the-faangs-lead-the-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">final tally</a> for 2019 was 354,428 patents granted).</p>
<p>At the same time, patent applications rose almost 5% last year, a sign of how future years will likely see a boost in numbers again, according to <a href="https://www.ificlaims.com/rankings-trends-2020.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">figures from IFI Claims Patent Services</a>, which tracks applications and trends in patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. As with previous years, IBM led the pack in terms of number of patents granted in the year, but Samsung, in aggregate, continues to hold the most patents of any company.</p>
<p>“Overall, U.S. patent activity was down slightly last year, despite the pandemic. This is a minor downward tick in what’s been a largely upward trajectory we’ve seen over the past decade, and it’s still 13 percent higher than what we saw in 2018,” said Mike Baycroft, CEO of IFI CLAIMS Patent Services, in a statement. “Another positive indicator is that published pre-grant applications saw a nominal increase in 2020. But we’ll have to wait at least another year before we can determine if the pandemic had any impact.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Patents, and lawsuits related to the infringing of them, have been part of a bigger theme for a number of years in the world of technology, with companies like Apple and Samsung, and Oracle and Google, using these against each other as an analogue for their larger commercial competition.</p>
<p>While the heyday of employing those tactics appear to be mostly over, at least for the moment, patents still play a vital role as an indicator of the way that tech is developing: they point to the pace of innovation, who is taking the lead in that on a foundational basis, and what kinds of areas are driving the future of tech in a more general sense.</p>
<p>In that regard, 2020&#8217;s numbers tell us that Samsung continues to keep a very wide margin when it comes to overall number of patents. The company now has <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">80,577 patents in total, up 5 percent more than in the year before. It has a very large margin still over the second-biggest patent holder. IBM currently holds 38,541 patents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">To be sure, in terms of activity in the last year, IBM leads the pack still when it comes to the most patents secured in 2020, with </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">9,130 grants, although this declined 1% compared to a year ago. Samsung was granted 6,415 patents at number two, with Canon Inc., Microsoft, Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor, LG Electronics, Apple, Huawei Technologies, and Qualcomm making up the rest of the top-10 list.</span></p>
<p>Google, Facebook, Amazon (number 11 at 2,244 patents), Google (17 with 1,817 patents) and Facebook (38 with 938 patents) all also made the top 50 patent recipients this year.</p>
<h2>Technology trends</h2>
<p>While the concept of patents has a long history that predates the rise of consumer electronics, they have seen an ineluctable shift away from physical systems and hardware, and towards the services that run on these, over time. In the last year, the top two most popular technology classes patented, IFI said, were electrical digital data processing and transmission of digital information &#8212; the generic names that underpin software and and how information and data are stored and processed.</p>
<p>Interestingly, IFI found that &#8220;computer systems based on biological models&#8221; was the fastest-growing technology on the list, up 67% last year compared to its growth between 2016 and 2020. The category points to the ongoing and huge interest in artificial intelligence, where areas like neural networking and other tech processes based on the mechanics of the human brain continue to be in hot demand, with Google, Microsoft and Intel all major patent winners in the area, IFI said. Alongside that aspect of AI, it said that machine learning, quantum computing, autonomous technology and 3D printing also saw big increases.</p>
<p>As a point of comparison, last year medical and biological technologies figured very strongly, with areas like <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">hybrid plant creation topping the list of trending technology, and CRISPR gene-editing and cancer therapies also figuring strongly. It&#8217;s interesting that in a year with a global health pandemic, and unprecedented medical research taking place in the race to find remedies and vaccines, we have seen little of that play out in patents granted, although I&#8217;m guessing the results would be different if considering what is being filed. It will be worth watching how this plays out in coming years, along with other trends that made themselves very prominent in the last year, such as e-commerce and cloud computing. </span></p>
<p>Interestingly, despite the regulatory and public perception setbacks faced by companies like Juul, electrical smoking devices still saw an increase of 55% in terms of patents filed last year. This indicates that there is still going to be a lot of development in the area as traditional smoking continues to be scrutinised and decline, but clearly the addiction does not.</p>
<p>Top 50 list for 2020, according to IFI Claims:</p>
<p>1 IBM 9130<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://launchub.com/">LAUNCHub Ventures</a>, an early-stage European VC which concentrates mainly on Central Eastern (CEE) and South-Eastern Europe (SEE), has completed the first closing of its new fund at €44 million ($53.5M), with an aspiration to reach a target size of €70 million. A final close is expected by Q2 2021.</p>
<p>Its principal backer is the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/european-investment-fund" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="european-investment-fund">European Investment Fund, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> corporates and a number of Bulgarian tech founders and investors.</p>
<p>With this new fund, LAUNCHub aims to invest in 25 startups in the next 4 years. The initial investment range will be between €500K and €2M in verticals such as B2B SaaS, Fintech, Proptech, Big Data, AI, Marketplaces, Digital Health. The fund will also actively invest in the Web 3.0 / Blockchain space, as it has done so since 2014.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>LAUNCHub has also achieved a 50:50 gender split in its team, with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/irinadimitrovacfa/">Irina Dimitrova</a> being promoted to operating partner while <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rayayu/">Raya Yunakova</a> who joins as an Investor, previously working for PiLabs in London and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mirela-yordanova-4168b951/">Mirela Yordanova</a> joins as an Associate, previously leading the startup community at Google for Startups Campus in London.</p>
<p>The investor is mining a rich view of highly skilled developers in the CEE countries where there are approximately 1.3 developers for every 100 people in the workforce. “Central and Eastern Europe&#8217;s rapid economic growth has caught the attention of Western investors searching for the next unicorn. The region has huge and still untapped potential with more and more local success stories, paving the way for the next generation of CEE tech founders.” said Todor Breshkov, Founding Partner at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/launchub" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="launchub">LAUNCHub Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>LAUNCHub Ventures competes with other investors like Earlybird in the region, but they tend to invest at a later stage and is more typically a co-investor with LAUNCHub.  Nearby Greece also features Greek funds such as Venture Friends and Marathon, but these tend to focus on their core country and diaspora entrepreneurs. Others include Speedinvest (usually focused on DACH) and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/credo-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="credo-ventures">Credo Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> more focused on the Czech Republic and CEE.</p>
<p>LAUNCHub partner and cofounder Stefan Grantchev told me: “Our strategy is to be regional, not to focus specifically on Bulgaria &#8211; but to look at all the opportunities in the region of South-Eastern Europe.”</p>
<p>LAUNCHub Ventures has backed companies including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Giraffe360 (Robotic camera for real estate listing automation, co-investment with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hoxton-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hoxton-ventures">Hoxton Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and HCVC)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fite (Premium direct to consumer digital live streaming for sports, followed-on by Earlybird)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GTMHub (The world’s leading and most intuitive OKR software, followed-on by CRV)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FintechOS (Banking and Insurance middleware for automation and digital innovation acceleration, followed-on by Earlybird and OTB)</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Cleanshelf (Enterprise SaaS management and optimization platform, followed-on by Dawn Capital)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Office RnD (Co-working and flexible office space management, followed-on by Flashpoint Ventures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ferryhopper (Ferry ticketing platform for Southern Europe, co-investment with Metavallon)</p>
</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roughly eight years ago, investors Mark Kvamme and Chris Olsen left Silicon Valley to open a venture firm, <a href="https://www.drivecapital.com/">Drive Capital</a>, in Columbus, Ohio. It wasn&#8217;t an easy decision. Leaving California wasn&#8217;t exactly fashionable at the time. In fact, While Olsen had grown up in Cincinnati, the Yale grad had landed at Sequoia Capital a couple of years out of college &#8212; a dream job &#8212; and had no interest in going anywhere. Meanwhile, Kvamme is a California native who attended UC Berkeley, grew up immersed in the world of startups (his dad was <a href="https://computerhistory.org/profile/floyd-kvamme/">also a VC)</a>, and cofounded four companies before himself landing at Sequoia, where among his deals, he led the firm&#8217;s investment in LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Even after a series of developments would lead them to take the leap, the early ride was bumpy. There was no venture community. Midwestern startups were still few and far between. More, Kvamme, first lured to Ohio by his longtime friend <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/22/937816320/former-ohio-gov-john-kasich-says-gop-is-afraid-of-trump">John Kasich</a> to take an economic development job that he thought would be temporary, was soon deemed a little too cozy with the state&#8217;s <a href="https://www.strictlyvc.com/2013/11/03/former-sequoia-partner-mark-kvamme-center-controversy/">power players</a>.</p>
<p>Looking back now, it&#8217;s a wonder they stayed. Yet it&#8217;s because they did that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kolumbus" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kolumbus">Columbus <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is primed for more VCs to join them, they convincingly argue. Indeed, Drive, which now manages $1.2 billion and features nine investors, is receiving interest from 7,000 startups each year, and some of its portfolio companies are beginning to break out. The very first company to attract a check from Drive, an eight-year-old, Columbus-based hospital software maker called Olive AI, was assigned a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-01/hospital-software-maker-olive-ai-reaches-1-5-billion-value">$1.5 billion valuation</a> just last month in a funding round led by Tiger Global. Another investment, in the five-year-old car insurance startup Root, also appears promising. Root, which <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2020/10/28/588450.htm">went public in November</a>, currently boasts a market cap of $4.7 billion, and Drive owns 26.6% of the company. (Olsen says it hasn&#8217;t sold a share.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We talked late last week with Kvamme and Olsen about what they are building &#8212; and why VCs who may be thinking about leaving California for Austin or Miami might pay more attention.

In the meantime, following are some excerpts from our chat edited lightly for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Everyone is threatening to ditch California. What&#8217;s the argument for heading to Columbus? How did Mark convince you to join him, Chris?</strong></p>
<p>CO: The early case that Mark made is: there&#8217;s an enormous amount of money that&#8217;s spent on research here. In Silicon Valley, the venture dollars ratio to research dollars is massively too many VC dollars for too little research; the opposite is true here in Ohio. This is more what Silicon Valley looked like in the late 1990s.</p>
<p>At first, I was like, &#8220;Nope, not falling for it. There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m believing that data. It&#8217;s a terrible idea&#8221; to move. But I was very much a numbers guy &#8212; still am &#8212; and when I started looking at the data, [I could see the] economy of Ohio is bigger than Turkey. The economy of the Midwest would be the fourth-biggest economy in the world. It&#8217;s bigger than Brazil. It&#8217;s bigger than Russia. It&#8217;s bigger than India. And it has this legacy educational infrastructure that&#8217;s been producing more engineers than any other corner of the planet. It was kind of like, wait a minute. If this thesis is right, maybe emerging markets <em>are</em> the most compelling place for venture capitalists to invest. But maybe the most compelling emerging market is America, just outside of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p><strong>TC: I imagine that you had your pick of companies when you first launched Drive. Is that true and has that changed in this new COVID era, when everybody is striking deals online? Who is showing up that you didn&#8217;t see a few years ago?</strong></p>
<p>CO: It might surprise you but we actually didn&#8217;t have our pick of the companies when we first got here, largely because it was unusual to be a venture capitalist. In Ohio, there just aren&#8217;t a lot of them. And so a lot of entrepreneurs were in non-obvious places. Unlike in Silicon Valley, where you have entrepreneurs sign up on this superhighway of capital, where you go from Y Combinator to the seed investor and then to the A investor, that infrastructure didn&#8217;t exist here. What was a little bit surprising to us was how much we ended up having to work to originate investment opportunities here in the Midwest and not because people weren&#8217;t here but because that kind of activity just hasn&#8217;t been built yet.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve had to spend a lot of time going into the universities and putting new seed managers in business and helping them fundraise and sort of building all of this infrastructure from scratch so that the next entrepreneur is out here [versus moves away], and it works. In our first year, we had inbound interest from 1,800 [startups], then it went to about 3,000 and now it&#8217;s up to about 7,000, which is more than I&#8217;ve heard any other venture firms say that they see in California. And I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s because we&#8217;re great. I think that&#8217;s more [a reflection of the] scale of the opportunity that&#8217;s here now. One of the things that we would love to see more of is more venture capitalists coming here, because there&#8217;s certainly more opportunity than we can invest in.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You don&#8217;t worry that you&#8217;ve teed up the market for other VCs to come and steal your deals?</strong></p>
<p>MW: Not at all. I&#8217;m the old guy here, so I remember when Sequoia was started in 1972; my father worked with Don Valentine and National Semiconductor, and it was then Kleiner, Perkins, NEA, [just] a couple of firms. And what happens is you create this network effect. And the more capital, the more folks [who are building stuff in close proximity to you]. Right now, if we don&#8217;t invest in a Series A, there&#8217;s a couple of local folks, but primarily, [that capital has] got to come from the coasts.</p>
<p>CO: My attitude is, &#8216;Come on [over] because the worst thing that is happening right now is that I know for sure there are multibillion-dollar investments that are not getting made still because they&#8217;re based here. The problem that we have right now is [that] a Redpoint comes in and invests in one company in Ann Arbor, or Benchmark comes into this one company in Indianapolis, or, Sequoia comes in [for a deal here or there] but they aren&#8217;t making this their primary business. And until we see more venture capitalists showing up here saying, &#8220;This is all I do every single day,&#8221; I fear that that next opportunity that we&#8217;re missing won&#8217;t get its funding. We&#8217;re just out of whack in terms of the number of opportunities versus the number of venture capitalists here . . .</p>
<p>[Also] some of the very best investments in Silicon Valley are done with venture firms that can partner and then entrepreneurs have access to a larger Rolodex, a larger pool of capital, more diversity of thought &#8212; all the things that they need to grow their business.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re competing with other hotspots like Austin for attention. Make the case for Columbus specifically.</strong></p>
<p>MW: If you put a circle around Columbus, a one-day car drive, you&#8217;re talking about 60% of the GDP of American, over 50% or 60% of the population, and [access to] a huge percentage of all the top customers. Columbus is in the middle of it all. What we&#8217;re able to do then is easily travel to Chicago and Indianapolis and Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Cincinnati; it&#8217;s a quick flight to Minneapolis, and so on and so forth. And the Midwest is a spectacular place to build companies.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Drive&#8217;s team includes a director of engineering and several software engineers. Why?</strong></p>
<p>CO: One of the things you learn very quickly that&#8217;s different about the Midwest is, it&#8217;s not a city; it&#8217;s a nation. And you have to set up your infrastructure differently if you&#8217;re going to be successful investing into that nation [because] there&#8217;s just a lot of ground cover.</p>
<p>One of the things that we have been able to do is to look at venture capital and say, &#8220;Look, there are a lot of rote, repetitive tasks that venture capitalists do, and what if we could eliminate those tasks, so that we don&#8217;t need to hire the boiler room of Ivy League grads to cold call the entire phone book and annoy all the entrepreneurs and do all that kind of stuff. We can do more homework in an automated fashion.&#8221; So that was kind of the idea that we had. And so we built this software platform that we&#8217;re able to use now to not only identify which entrepreneurs have the highest probability of turning into an investment but also [who are] the people for our portfolio companies who have the highest probability of joining a certain startup, or, which venture capitalists have the highest probability of investing in that follow-on round of capital.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You had the chance to reinvent the VC model when you started your own firm. Are there any things that you did in setting up Drive that were different than what you&#8217;d experienced at Sequoia?</strong></p>
<p>MK: We were very fortunate to have worked at Sequoia. Sequoia is by far the best firm out there, in my opinion. And we often use the phrase, What would Sequoia do? And we built a lot of things around that. But we weren&#8217;t Sequoia, so there were many things that we had to do that Sequoia had maybe done 40 or 50 years ago  but today doesn&#8217;t have to do. That includes building a lot of these capabilities Chris had mentioned before, building some of the infrastructure, helping lawyers understand how to do Series A term sheets or finding headhunters.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also not in a situation where everyone is coming into the office [unlike at Sequoia]; they see a lot of wonderful companies that just ring them up. That&#8217;s why we had to be very focused on our outbound efforts. So I&#8217;d say that 60% to 70% of what we&#8217;ve done, we learned at Sequoia, but the rest we had to make specific to what we&#8217;re doing here at Drive.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How big a net are you casting geographically?</strong></p>
<p>CO: At this point, it&#8217;s massive. If you were to look at our portfolio, we have companies in Denver, Washington, Atlanta, Toronto, Austin. I think what we&#8217;re finding is that this opportunity is a broader phenomenon that we&#8217;re investing in.</p>
<p>Before we will invest into any of these cities, we&#8217;ve had to go in the same way we did into Columbus. And we&#8217;ve had to meet with the landlords, because landlords out here are not built for startups. They&#8217;re built for legacy companies, and they want to see five years of trailing financials, and they want a massive security deposit. And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t have that.&#8221; So too with the headhunters. There are phenomenal headhunters in Ohio. They&#8217;re totally different than the ones who are successful in Denver or in Atlanta because those talent networks are very localized.</p>
<p>But now that done that and we&#8217;ve been invested in an infrastructure and we&#8217;ve got a density of companies in a lot of the cities that I just mentioned, now we can help and we can be very different from a venture firm that&#8217;s just going to zoom in for quarterly board meetings. We&#8217;ve got a partnership now that&#8217;s expanded where we&#8217;re investing people resources, and we&#8217;re in the cities on a weekly basis.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pinduoduo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pinduoduo">Pinduoduo, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a rapidly growing Chinese e-commerce company, is weathering its PR storm after the death of an employee sparked criticism against the firm&#8217;s grueling working hours.</p>
<p>The employee, 21 years old, collapsed on her way home from work on a late night before New Year. The cause of her death has not been disclosed but internet users speculated that she had died from exhaustion.</p>
<p>Posts with the hashtag <a href="https://s.weibo.com/weibo?q=%23%E6%8B%BC%E5%A4%9A%E5%A4%9A%E5%91%98%E5%B7%A5%E7%8C%9D%E6%AD%BB%23&amp;Refer=SWeibo_box">#PinduoduoEmployeeSuddenDeath</a> have accumulated 300 million views on the Chinese microblogging platform Weibo. Separately, another Pinduoduo employee committed suicide on January 9 by jumping from his 27th-floor apartment. The local labor authorities are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/pinduoduo-china-idCNL1N2JF0BN">reported</a> to be reviewing working conditions at Shanghai-based Pinduoduo.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On Sunday, a former Pinduoduo employee <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1iT4y1N7AU">spoke out against</a> the firm&#8217;s stressful work culture in a video that went viral, adding to the public outcry against Alibaba&#8217;s biggest rival. He alleged that employees at Pinduoduo&#8217;s headquarters are required to work at least 300 hours a month (about 75 hours a week), whereas staff in the newly established grocery delivery department have a 380-hour minimum. The employee who fell on her way home worked on Pinduoduo&#8217;s grocery business in the Western province of Xinjiang.</p>
<p>People with knowledge told TechCrunch that employees working on certain projects at Pinduoduo might work over 300 hours a month, though the hours aren&#8217;t mandatory. Companywide, staff are required to work from 11 AM to 8 PM.</p>
<p>Pinduoduo cannot be immediately be reached for comment.</p>

<p>Long working hours aren&#8217;t unique to Pinduoduo in China. The string of incidents is reviving the debate around<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/12/china-996/"> </a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/12/china-996/">&#8220;996&#8221;</a>, a term that denotes employees working from 9 AM to 9 PM, six days a week, though it can refer to any other form of demanding work regime in China&#8217;s cutthroat internet industry.</p>
<p>Despite the public backlash and calls to boycott Pinduoduo, the company&#8217;s market position appears to remain firm. Its app downloads have remained stable since the first employee incident two weeks ago, with some days even seeing slight growth in installs, according to data analytics provider Jiguang. As of January 8, Pinduoduo had nearly 650 million installs.</p>
<p>Its shares, traded in New York, climbed from $144 on December 28 to $187 on January 5 and dropped slightly to $174 on January 11. A few venture capital investors of Pinduoduo contacted by TechCrunch declined to comment for this story.</p>
<p>The figures could be telling. Despite its efforts to attract more users in China&#8217;s wealthier cities, a substantial number of Pinduoduo users live in China&#8217;s low-tier cities and rural towns. The &#8220;996&#8221; culture of the megacity-based tech giants may be remote for them, while the deals on Pinduoduo, the e-commerce app famous for its &#8220;dirt cheap&#8221; goods, are tangible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Payments company <a href="https://www.checkout.com">Checkout.com</a> is raising once again. The company has closed a $450 million Series C round with Tiger Global Management leading the round — Greenoaks Capital and all existing investors are also participating.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with the company, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/checkout-com" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="checkout-com">Checkout.com <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> wants to build a one-stop shop for all things related to payments, such as accepting transactions, processing them and detecting fraud. It focuses on large merchants and tries to make its product as customizable as possible so that you integrate it as an infrastructure partner in your product.</p>
<p>The company’s fundraising story in particular is jaw-dropping. The startup was founded in 2012 in London. At first, it grew slowly and methodically. Every time it would generate a bit of revenue, it would hire more people. “We can hire one employee this month. Now we can hire two employees this month,” founder and CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/guillaume-pousaz" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="guillaume-pousaz">Guillaume Pousaz <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/what-makes-checkout-com-different-from-stripe/">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> when thinking about the early days of the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Checkout.com kept growing and growing until it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/02/a-quiet-london-based-payments-startup-just-raised-among-the-biggest-series-a-rounds-ever-in-europe/">raised</a> one of the biggest Series A rounds ever for a European company — $230 million at a $2 billion valuation. Just a year later, Checkout.com <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/checkout-com-the-uk-payments-startup-raises-another-150m-now-valued-at-5-5b/">added</a> $150 million in funding at a $5.5 valuation.</p>
<p>Checkout.com is now valued at $15 billion based on today’s funding round. According to the startup, it is now the fourth largest fintech company globally.</p>
<p>Checkout.com had 440 employees in January 2020. It finished 2020 with 940 employees. And this year, the company plans to hire an additional 700 people.</p>
<p>While Checkout.com didn’t actually need to raise to stay alive, Pousaz says VC firms are a form of validation. Suddenly, you can talk with big prospects if you’re backed by Insight, DST, Coatue, Tiger Global Management, etc.</p>
<p>And yet, the company needs a lot of money on its bank account to expand to more countries. “Today, we process billions every week,” Pousaz told me in December. “And when you process over a billion euros per week, your cash flow on your bank account increases significantly. So you need to be well capitalized for regulators.”</p>
<p>Technically, there isn&#8217;t a single bank account that holds the company&#8217;s cash. Checkout.com is regulated in the U.K., but also in France, Brazil, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc. And the company is working on adding India, the Philippines. And it turns out you need cash on your balance sheet in the Philippines if you want to get a license from the local regulator — it doesn’t matter if you have a ton of money sitting in your bank account in London. That&#8217;s why raising capital can be helpful.</p>

<p>But why do investors want to hand over more and more money? “At any point you have a lot of visibility on what your next year is going to look like,” Pousaz told me. “It’s something that investors like because you can show them your pipeline and all your customers in your pipeline. If you forecast on the pipeline, it gives you a good idea of how much you’re going to generate in the coming year.</p>
<p>“For instance, I could tell you right now that we’ll grow by at least 80% in 2021,” he added. And that’s only based on clients who are currently in the process of integrating Checkout.com. The company already tripled its payment processing volume in 2020 compared to 2019.</p>
<p>In many ways, Checkout.com tries to forecast like a public company. It isn’t focused on runway as it is EBITDA profitable. Instead, it tries to reinvest a lot of its revenue in the company. “We don’t generate $50 million in EBITDA, far from it. But we generate double-digit million dollars,” Pousaz told me.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company will open two new offices in the U.S. In addition to San Francisco, Checkout.com will have offices in New York and Denver.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.curve.com/">Curve</a>, the London-based fintech that combines multiple cards and accounts into one smart card and an app, has secured a Series C finding round of $95 million. The financing was led by IDC Ventures, Fuel Venture Capital and Vulcan Capital (the investment arm of the estate of Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Paul G. Allen), with participation from OneMain Financial, the US personal finance company, and Novum Capital. Several previous investors also participated. The fundraise brings the total investment in Curve to almost $175 million. Curve says it plans to use the funds to expand internationally, including to the US, and to deepen its European reach. It will also be pushing its Curve Credit product. </p>
<p>The startup is now claiming 2 million customers and now covers Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google Pay in 31 European markets. In December, Curve created a JV with <a href="http://Plaid.com">Plaid</a> to bring open banking to the UK, allowing users to connect and see their bank accounts in one place.  It also now has a subsidiary in Vilnius, Lithuania, in order to serve its EU-based following Brexit, and partnered with Samsung for its Pay Card.</p>
<p>However, it hasn’t all been plain sailing. Its ‘Go Back in Time’ feature which can roll-back purchase 14 to 90 days, has come under fire for potentially allowing customers to fall into a debt spiral. </p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch, Shachar Bialick, founder and CEO of Curve, said: “We tried to remove the friction customers have at the checkout. For instance, you might be out and not have an internet connection, or you want to switch the card to be charged, so you can pay, and then later go back in time and change the accounts that were used. And then what transpired is that customers were using this feature because they wanted to free up cash in their checking account during COVID times. In March, many of our customers asked us to be able to ‘go back in time’ from the debit cards to their credit cards for transactions they&#8217;ve made in January and in December, 2019, and because they need to free more cash in their checking account.” He said it’s also led to a new product allowing customers to split payments into installments.</p>
<p>Curve also came under fire this month for failing to file its accounts with Companies House in London. Bialick said: “We missed the filing and the reason for that is because we had a very tight fundraising and we have limited resources so we had to prioritize it over something else. But we&#8217;re already in the process of submitting [the accounts] this week.”</p>
<p>Bobby Aitkenhead, Managing Partner of IDC Ventures, said: “Curve’s pioneering approach to finance is more necessary than ever as we accelerate globally to a digital-first world.”</p>
<p>Rick Roberts, from Vulcan Capital, said: “Curve’s model is redefining the future of banking by bringing diverse financial products and solutions together into one digital wallet, for the benefit of banks and customers alike. Their friction-free offering is coming at the ideal time for American consumers, who are looking for safer payment options and greater financial control in the wake of the pandemic.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://zipmex.com/">Zipmex</a>, a digital assets exchange headquartered in Singapore, announced today it has raised $6 million in funding led by Jump Capital. The startup, which plans to become a digital assets bank, says the round exceeded its initial target of $4 million. Along with earlier funding, it brings the total <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zipmex" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zipmex">Zipmex <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has raised so far to $10.9 million.</p>
<p>The exchange is regulated in Singapore, Australia and Indonesia, and licensed in Thailand. It focuses on investors new to cryptocurrency with educational features, as well as high net-worth individuals, and says it has transacted over $600 million in gross transaction volume since launching at the end of 2019.</p>
<p>The funding will be used on hiring and to add more product offerings. In addition to its cryptocurrency exchange, Zipmex’s services also include ZipUp, its interest-bearing accounts, and its own ERC-20 token ZMT.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zipmex’s goal is to become the largest digital exchange in the Asia Pacific, where interest in cryptocurrency investing and blockchain technology is <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-the-western-world-should-understand-about-the-asian-crypto-market-2020-11-24">increasing quickly</a>. For example, DBG Group Holdings, Southeast Asia’s largest lender, <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cryptocurrencies/Singapore-bank-DBS-starts-currency-and-crypto-exchange">recently launched a crypto exchange</a>, though it is currently open only to professional investors.</p>

<p>But Zipmex is also up against a roster of competitors, including regional exchanges like BitKub in Thailand and Swyftx in Australia, as well as players like Luno, Coinbase and Binance which are targeting growth in the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<p>Zipmex chief executive officer Marcus Lim said the company’s ambition to become a digital assets bank sets it apart from other exchanges. &#8220;We currently offer customers to invest and earn interest on their digital assets,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;In the future, we are planning to roll out payments and lending and the investment into securitized tokens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other cryptocurrency startups that Jump Capital, an American venture capital firm, has invested in include BitGo and TradingView. Its parent company, trading firm Jump Trading, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-29/robinhood-s-free-crypto-trades-powered-by-chicago-s-jump-trading">powers Robinhood’s crypto trades</a>.</p>
