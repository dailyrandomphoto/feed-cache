										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Genomic data is considered to be the key to unlocking so-called ‘precision medicine’. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002195">Some estimates</a> suggest that by 2025, 500 million human genomes will have been sequenced, but only a fraction of it is being utilized for drug discovery and precision medicine.</p>
<p>One of the key startups to emerge in the space is Lifebit, which allows wider access to global biomedical data for drug discovery. It’s now raised a $60 million funding round led by Tiger Global Management. Existing investors Eurazeo, Pentech Ventures, and Beacon Capital also participated. </p>
<p>Lifebit says it has a patented technology for federating the data around genomic data, allowing researchers to get more insights while keeping the data secure. Privacy issues are regularly raised around genomic data. Let&#8217;s face it, it doesn’t get more personal than your genome.</p>
<p>The company says that rare disease patients are likely to receive an accurate diagnosis up to five times more often when human genetic data is involved in the diagnosis. That’s why these &#8216;Clinico-genomic&#8217; databases can be so transformative.</p>
<p>Lifebit has acquired clients across the public and private sectors including the Hong Kong Genome Project, and an AI-partnership with German pharma giant Boehringer Ingelheim. It also won the UK Government contract to power Genomics England.</p>
<p>Dr. Maria Chatzou Dunford, Lifebit CEO and former bioinformatics researcher said: “We believe all biomedical data that can be used to save lives, should be used. People are dying because of how this data is being handled, and making distributed highly-sensitive biomedical data usable while keeping it secure in-place and combining it with other data has never been possible, until now.”</p>
<p>Partner at Tiger Global, John Curtius, added: “We are confident that Lifebit&#8217;s innovative and industry-leading software solutions, paired with their customer-first approach, will drive rapid global adoption and accelerate breakthroughs in precision medicine.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lifebit competes with DNAnexus, Sevenbridges and Iqvia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Somehow the third quarter of 2021 is coming to a close. Instead of a period filled with family and friends and fun, in many parts of the world, the COVID era dragged on, leaving us largely working from home and executing more phone calls than impromptu brunches. Alas.</p>
<p>But in the last handful of quarters, COVID and its impacts have proven to be attractive periods for both startup fundraising and growth. The second quarter, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">saw huge sums of private capital disbursed around the world</a>, partially predicated on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/latin-americas-second-wave-of-digital-transformation/">underlying performance from startups themselves</a>, and partially thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/will-rising-interest-rates-scupper-the-startup-surge/">inexpensive capital bolstering venture coffers</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>

<hr />
<p>Now, with the third quarter wrapping up, The Exchange is prepping for a lengthy dive into global venture capital results. To kick that off, today we’re asking a series of questions: We want to understand how strong Europe’s third quarter was and if the region can match its prior &#8212; stellar &#8212; fundraising results. We’re interested in what’s going on with China’s venture capital market in the wake of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/">host of regulatory changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>We also want to know if the United States is holding onto its position as the leading global venture capital market, and where in the country capital is flowing the most freely. And we want to know where in Latin America we’re seeing the most fundraising acceleration, along with just how important mega-rounds are to recent, aggregate global totals; are big deals still setting the tone for global venture totals?</p>
<p>Today we&#8217;ll explore each question in brief, ahead of what we presume will be a long, multi-part dive into the data once Q3 comes to a close later this week.</p>
<h2>Did Europe’s venture scene keep raising record sums?</h2>
<p>Our first question for Europe will be whether it managed to match its impressive Q2 results. There are signs that it may have, as France <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2021/09/22/un-milliard-d-euros-leves-en-une-journee-du-jamais-vu-pour-la-french-tech_6095595_3234.html">recently celebrated</a> the slightly random but no less significant milestone of &#8220;1 billion euros raised in one day.&#8221; Our suspicion is that these deals were actually announced in close succession because none of the involved startups wanted to miss out on the spotlight after raising record amounts &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/marketplace-platform-mirakl-raises-555-million-at-3-5-billion-valuation/">$555 million</a> for marketplace platform Mirakl, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/sorare-raises-680-million-for-its-fantasy-sports-nft-game/">$680 million</a> for fantasy sports startup Sorare and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-22/softbank-invests-in-french-secondhand-site-vestiaire-collective">$209 million</a> for Vestiaire Collective.</p>
<p>As a follow-on, we&#8217;ll likely look into whether this has anything to do with Brexit: Is capital simply redirecting out of the U.K.? Our intuition is that it isn&#8217;t, since we are still hearing about a lot of activity in London and beyond. But capital that might have kept flowing in that direction could now be going to other places in Europe – so we&#8217;ll take a closer look at how widely distributed it is, and also at what&#8217;s going on with Euronext in terms of tech IPOs.</p>
<h2>What’s going on with China’s venture capital market?</h2>
<p>Recent regulatory shifts have remade China’s technology landscape. Tech giants have been brought to heel, and rule changes to edtech, social media, gaming and other varietals have shaken both tech companies and other industries in the country. Despite all that, it isn’t hard to find commentary discussing the possible positive impact on China’s economy thanks to the new set of rules.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A coalition of digital marketing firms and others has taken its lobbying against Google&#8217;s plan to phase out tracking cookies &#8212; by replacing them with alternative technologies which the tech giant claims will protect user privacy &#8212; to the European Union, lodging a formal complaint with the bloc&#8217;s antitrust regulators.</p>
<p>The self-styled &#8216;Movement for an Open Web&#8217; (MOW), as the opaque group pushing the complaint is now called (RIP &#8216;Marketers for an Open Web&#8217;), put out a <a href="https://movementforanopenweb.com/calls-on-eu-to-curb-googles-anti-competitive-behaviour/">press release</a> announcing the move today &#8212; and claiming it has provided the Commission with &#8220;evidence of Google’s technology changes, how they impact choice and competition&#8221;, and offered some &#8220;potential remedies&#8221;.</p>
<p>Google and the Commission have been contacted for comment on the complaint.</p>
<p>EU regulators finally opened an investigation of Google&#8217;s adtech this summer, announcing an in-depth probe in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-is-now-investigating-googles-adtech-over-antitrust-concerns/">June</a> that they said would include delving into the Privacy Sandbox proposal.</p>
<p>A UK probe of that was announced months earlier, in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">January</a>, and the issue remains a live one on the Competition and Markets Authority&#8217;s (CMA) desk &#8212; with Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">suggesting concessions this summer</a>.</p>
<p>MOW&#8217;s suggested remedies to EU regulators include requirements that Google should notify the EU ahead of time over any changes to its browser (Chrome/Chromium) &#8212; in order to &#8220;enabl[e] privacy and competition assessments to be made by the EU and data protection authorities in line with Google’s proposed remedy to the UK’s Competition and Market Authority and Information Commissioner’s Office&#8221;, as it puts it.</p>
<p>So here you can see the strange sight of a campaign which was kicked off by a bunch of marketers seemingly lobbying <em>for </em>user &#8216;privacy&#8217;; but of course they would say that wouldn&#8217;t they &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-is-now-investigating-googles-adtech-over-antitrust-concerns/">given the EU has already flagged &#8220;user privacy&#8221;</a> as one of the areas its antitrust investigation will be considering. (Additionally, the UK&#8217;s CMA and Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office are doing joint working on the Privacy Sandbox complaint.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Notably MOW&#8217;s website still does not disclose exactly who the members of this anti-Google-Privacy-Sandbox/pro-tracking-cookie group are &#8212; aside from the name of its director, James Rosewell (co-founder of UK mobile marketing company, <a href="https://51degrees.com/about-us">51 Degrees</a>).</p>
<p>Instead it writes that: &#8220;MOW is supported by businesses that between them have annual revenues of $40BN+. The name has been changed because more businesses, not just marketing companies, are realising the threat from Privacy Sandbox and the benefit of joining the MOW campaign.&#8221;</p>
<p>It may be the case that MOW has indeed evolved its membership to include entities with a genuine (rather than opportunistic) concern for user privacy. But given that it won&#8217;t disclose its membership it&#8217;s impossible to know&#8230;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="f8Qn7jYckh"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/youll-never-believe-what-this-email-thread-says-about-the-ad-funded-open-web/">You&#8217;ll never believe what this email thread says about the ad-funded &#8216;open&#8217; web</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;You&#8217;ll never believe what this email thread says about the ad-funded &#8216;open&#8217; web&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/youll-never-believe-what-this-email-thread-says-about-the-ad-funded-open-web/embed/#?secret=f8Qn7jYckh" data-secret="f8Qn7jYckh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Commenting on the complaint in a statement,<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Rosewell said: “The internet was originally envisaged as an open environment outside the control of any single body. Google maintains it is making these changes to protect privacy but if not properly policed, the move threatens digital media, online privacy and innovation.</span></p>
<p>“Solutions aligned to laws – not self-serving misuse of the web architecture by the members of Big Tech such as Google – are needed. More people, surrendering more personal data to fewer companies doesn’t improve anyone’s privacy while stifling competition and boosting their huge profits even further.”</p>
<p>Lawyer Tim Cowen, who is listed as a legal advisor to MOW and chair of the antitrust practice at Preiskel &amp; Co LLP, added: “We’re asking that the EU Commission create a level playing field for all digital businesses, to maintain and protect an open web. Google says they’re strengthening ‘privacy’ for end users but they’re not, what they’re really proposing is a creepy data mining party.”</p>
<p>Google has already delayed its timeline for implementing Privacy Sandbox &#8212; announcing back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/is-google-about-to-delay-its-depreciation-of-tracking-cookies/">June</a> that it would be taking longer to make the transition away from tracking cookies as a result of ongoing engagement with the UK&#8217;s antitrust regulator.</p>
<p>It has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">offered <em>not</em> to phase out tracking cookies</a> unless or until the UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority is happy that the transition to alternative technologies can be done in a manner that protects competition and privacy.</p>
<p>So MOW, presumably, scents blood &#8212; spying an opportunity to press the case for a wider, pan-European freeze on Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox play, rather than merely getting some UK-specific checks and balances.</p>
<p>Asked if he believes the Commission will be sympathetic to MOW&#8217;s complaint, <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik">Dr Lukasz Olejnik</a>, a privacy researcher and consultant, told TechCrunch: &#8220;The Commission currently has its own investigation, so I could envisage that this additional complaint could constitute a case in point. Technology anti-competition proceedings tend to be slow, so the investigation could simply accumulate things in a snowball manner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A long time ago, the European Data Protection Supervisor identified potential links between privacy and competition. Opinions and activities followed. However, it is true that EU Competition regulators are prioritising their own principles, rather than focusing on privacy,&#8221; he also told us.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, I doubt that any [world] competition regulator would be balancing competition with privacy. They should, I believe, consider it an internal aspect of society and technology. Perhaps it will happen to some degree? But while we do know that UK CMA and ICO are in contact, it is not known if the EC and EDPS are also in sync in relation to the latest investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given that Google has already proposed a number of legally binding commitments to the UK&#8217;s CMA around Privacy Sandbox, there are several interested entities in this story who may see a &#8216;quick win&#8217; if the bloc can be persuaded to swiftly adopt much the same framework, assuming the CMA also agrees to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that the most effortless action would be to take the commitments issued to CMA, copy-and-paste them, perhaps modify a bit and hand to the EU. I&#8217;m not sure if this would work out so easily. However, it is clear that Google wants to remove this potential roadblock as fast as possible,&#8221; agreed Olejnik.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite clear that consumer detriment may happen not only from market conduct but other aspects are notable. For example privacy and data protection standards,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix is expanding its mobile gaming push with the launch of three more gaming titles which will become exclusively available to Netflix members in select European markets. The company today is introducing a trio of casual games &#8212; &#8220;Shooting Hoops,&#8221; &#8220;Teeter Up,&#8221; and &#8220;Card Blast&#8221; &#8212; to Netflix members in Spain and Italy, as well as Poland, where <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/netflix-begins-testing-mobile-games-in-its-android-app-in-poland/">Netflix recently began marketing</a> its first members-only mobile games within its Android app.</p>
<p>Similarly, the new titles will be made available using the same model. Through a new &#8220;Games&#8221; tab inside the Netflix app, members will be directed to the games&#8217; listings on the Google Play Store for their region. Here, they&#8217;ll download and install the game as they would any other app. But when it comes time to log in, they&#8217;ll need their Netflix credentials to begin playing.</p>
<p>The new games will also be entirely free to play, without any advertising or in-app purchases. While the first two titles to launch within Netflix&#8217;s Games tab were tied to the popular series, &#8220;Stranger Things,&#8221; these new games have no connection to any Netflix movie or show. Instead, they are simple, casual games meant to appeal to a wide range of gamers. They represent Netflix&#8217;s increased investment focused on making mobile games a part of a broader entertainment offering that is now growing to include more than just streaming content.</p>
<p>The games will today arrive in Poland, where they&#8217;ll join the existing &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; titles. Meanwhile, Netflix members in Italy and Spain will gain access to both the trio of new games and the two existing &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; games.</p>
<p>The additions will officially launch today at 8 AM PT, which is 5 PM in Italy and Spain. That&#8217;s when the games will go live on Netflix&#8217;s service.</p>
<p>The company recently <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/FINAL-Q2-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">spoke</a> about its plans to expand into the gaming market during its Q2 earnings, saying it was in the early stages of exploring what this model may look like.</p>
<p>&#8220;We view gaming as another content category for us, similar to our expansion into original films, animation, and unscripted TV,&#8221; read Netflix&#8217;s <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/FINAL-Q2-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">shareholder letter,</a> adding that its initial focus would be on free games designed for mobile devices. &#8220;&#8230;Since we are nearly a decade into our push into original programming, we think the time is right to learn more about how our members value games,&#8221; the company explained.</p>

<p>In late August, Netflix made good on those statements when it shifted two &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; titles created by the Allen, Texas-based game studio <a href="https://bonusxp.com/">BonusXP</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/netflix-begins-testing-mobile-games-in-its-android-app-in-poland/">become Netflix exclusives</a>. These games, however, had been previously available on the Play Store and continues to be playable by those who already had them installed. But new gamers could now discover the two games &#8212; &#8220;Stranger Things: 1984&#8221; and &#8220;Stranger Things 3: The Game&#8221; from within the Netflix app.</p>
<p>That same model continues with the new releases.</p>
<p>&#8220;Card Blast&#8221; is licensed from U.S.-based <a href="https://rogueco.com/games/">Rogue Games</a>, while&#8221;Shooting Hoops&#8221; and &#8220;Teeter Up&#8221; come from Canadian developer <a href="https://frostypop.com/games">Frosty Pop</a>.</p>
<p>These developers aren&#8217;t credited on the Play Store listings, as the games themselves are published under Netflix&#8217;s Google Play account.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, after TechCrunch happened upon one of the new titles, Netflix confirmed the details about the launch plans and offered a statement about its mobile gaming expansion.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Starting today, Netflix members in Spain and Italy can play five mobile games on Android as part of our ongoing games rollout,&#8221; a Netflix spokesperson said. &#8220;These five games include &#8216;Stranger Things: 1984,&#8217;  &#8216;Stranger Things 3: The Game,&#8217; &#8216;Card Blast,&#8217; &#8216;Teeter Up,&#8217; and &#8216;Shooting Hoops,&#8217; which are all also available in Poland now. We’re still in the very early days, but we’re excited to bring these exclusive games as part of the Netflix membership &#8211; with no ads and no in-app purchases.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Earlier, Netflix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/netflix-begins-testing-mobile-games-in-its-android-app-in-poland/">explained</a> it chose Poland as the initial test market for mobile gaming because the country has an active mobile gaming audience, which made it seem like a good fit for this early feedback.</p>
<p>Today, the company notes that Italy and Spain were chosen as additional markets for similar reasons and because the European market, overall, is an important one for Netflix.</p>
<p>Netflix says it plans to launch games in other regions, including the U.S., at some point in the future, but could not say when. It also eventually aims to bring its games to iOS.</p>
<p>The suite of mobile games will be available within the Games tab in Netflix&#8217;s Android app in Poland, Italy, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">and Spain, starting at 8 AM ET/11 AM PT/ 5 PM CET today. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://heartcore.com/">Heartcore Capital</a>, one of the few VCs to focus on consumer technology, has raised a $200 million early-stage fund for those kinds of startups across Europe. Heartcore IV, the firm’s flagship investment vehicle, will be supported by Heartcore Progression Beta, a $50 million ‘opportunity fund’ for follow on rounds in consumer tech.</p>
<p>The firm said both vehicles were oversubscribed. Investors in the funds include Hermann Haraldsson (Boozt), Andrew Stalbow (Seriously), Phillip Chambers and Kasper Hulthin (Peakon), Paul Crusius and Marco Vietor (Audibene), Morten Strunge (Podimo, Mofibo), and Max-Josef Meier (Finn).</p>
<p>Most European VCs tech to be B2B/ SaaS focused, but Heartcore has specialized in consumer technology VC.</p>
<p>In Heartcore’s favour is the fact that there are 500 million consumers in the EU spending an annual $11 trillion, making it on-par with the US consumer market. It also has a larger middle class. And while B2B platforms must usually win the US or at least originate from there, the B2C market tends to be more local.</p>
<p>The pandemic has also acted as an accelerant for consumer technology, forcing po[ulations to take up digital services such as online groceries</p>
<p>Heartcore has had a 14-year history in consumer tech with its portfolio raising close to $1 billion in follow-on financing over the past 12 months, the company said.</p>
<p>Swedish consumer personal finance manager Tink’s recently sold to Visa for  $2.2BN, and Heartcore was the largest venture investor at the time of acquisition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It has also invested in virtual restaurants (Taster), open banking (Tink), quick-commerce (Weezy), fashion e-commerce (Boozt), cellular agriculture (Gourmey), digital health (Kaia Health, Natural Cycles) or subscription commerce (La Fourche, Italic).</p>
<p>Max Niederhofer, Heartcore Capital partner, told me: “Europe historically has been great at consumer tech. You’ve had Skype, Last fm, Spotify and Supercell. All of those are consumer companies. I think the thing that&#8217;s happening is that a lot of the consumer champions are domestic champions. Lando is huge in Germany. The biggest insurance tech company in France is actually a French company. So, as technology disrupts every consumer spend category, there&#8217;s a lot of big companies being built in Europe that are primarily domestic or  regional, and that&#8217;s where we feel there&#8217;s a lot of room to play.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startups have thrown a curve ball into the world of financial services, by building more flexible, cheaper and user-friendly tools to businesses and consumers, who in turn are walking away from older incumbents and taking their custom to newer providers. In the latest development, a startup called <a href="https://highnoteplatform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Highnote</a> is launching with ambitions to make waves in the world of card issuing, by making it easy for any company of any size to provide virtual payment cards to their customers. Founded by PayPal alums, the company is exiting stealth mode today and also announcing $54 million in funding to take its first steps.</p>
<p>The sum includes both a Seed round and a Series A, with Oak HC/FT both leading the Series A and co-leading the Seed with Costanoa Ventures. XYZ, SVB Capital, and WestCap also participated, alongside some notable individuals, including Bill Ready (the former COO of PayPal and current president of commerce and payments at Google) and Renaud Laplanche (the CEO of Upgrade).</p>
<p>Own-branded payment cards from retailers and other companies are far from being a novel idea at this point: they and their loyalty programs have been around for decades. There have even been other incredibly successful startups, like <a href="https://www.marqeta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marqeta</a>, that have been built on the premise of democratizing that opportunity.</p>
<p>The difference with Highnote is that the company believes that many of the currently solutions still take too long to provision, and ultimately are not that creative as products: there is a new opening in the market to virtualize the process, a la Apple Card, to make it something that a company of any size could introduce (not just an Apple), and to bring in significantly more flexibility into what it even means to provide credit to consumers these days.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is an incredible opportunity today to design a platform built for purpose, to fill the need for embedded finance, and to allow businesses to move more quickly,&#8221; said John Macllwaine, the ex-GM of PayPal subsidiary Braintree, who co-founded Highnote with Kin Kee, Braintree&#8217;s former director of architecture. &#8220;Marqeta is doing a great job illuminating the opportunities, but the platforms was built 10 years ago and it was designed for a certain use case. They are where they are,&#8221; he concluded with a small shrug. ¯&#95;(ツ)_/¯</p>
<p>The current vogue for embedded finance &#8212; where a variety of financial services, in themselves complex to build but easy to integrate from third parties by way of APIs &#8212; figures strongly here. Traditionally card services have been based around a very limited set of ideas.</p>
<p>If you are a retailer, the card is intended to encourage consumers to shop more with you (not anyone else); those who are not retailers (say, an airline) tie them in with loyalty points that can be redeemed with the brand, or businesses participating in the brand&#8217;s loyalty scheme. In each case, the brand tended to be big, and the basics of the card were constructed around payment limits, interest for unpaid balances and so on. To get one required filling out applications at the check-out counter, and the whole process taking weeks to complete (at which point you would get a physical card in the mail).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Highnote take on this is to lean on the concept of embedded finance to expand the range of things that can be built into a &#8220;payment card&#8221;, and to make that card a lot easier for any kind of business to procure.</p>
<p>Initially, the company is offering a variety of &#8220;cards&#8221; to its clients &#8212; virtual, physical and tokenized &#8212; and also giving them ways to let their customers manage those cards and their financial lives more intelligently, including by letting them open bank accounts, and to manage and monitor how their cards are being used. It also gives significantly more control to the companies themselves to monitor usage and spend across their networks.</p>
<p>Over time, you could imagine a number of different services being rolled in at the point of sale that also leverage the credit opportunity, including potentially buy now, pay later options, or other ways to pay flexibly. Yes, there are already BNPL companies that have expanded into cards; and yes companies focusing on payments also are building credit products. But what Highnote is offering is something different. It can be argued that brands have gradually been disintermediated from transactions online &#8212; the complex process is essentially outsourced to others, either by selling through marketplaces like Amazon&#8217;s, or by embedding the complex process built and powered by another company. What Highnote gives those brands is the promise of owning it, and the data associated with it, again.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the kind of market opportunity that you would expect from payments experts as founders &#8212; who ironically probably witnessed first-hand just how things have evolved &#8212; and that is why investors were keen to back them early on.</p>
<p>“We’ve backed many of the leading companies in the fintech space, but there is something really special about John, Kin, and their team,” said Matt Streisfeld, Partner at Oak HC/FT, in a statement. “We understand the many challenges enterprises currently face in embedding payments capabilities to drive customer engagement, loyalty, and revenue, as well as for consumers and SMBs that need access to wages and funds immediately. We see a massive opportunity emerging to whomever is able to crack the code. We’re building that at <span class="il">Highnote</span>, and as a result, we are thrilled to provide the support they need to continue their incredible velocity.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors’ BrightDrop continues its breakneck pace to market as the automaker takes aim at last-mile commercial and cargo delivery market segments. BrightDrop on Tuesday said it would add a second delivery vehicle to its lineup, with telecom giant Verizon as its first slated customer.</p>
<p>In addition, GM said it had completed the first production builds of its flagship EV600 van, of which at least 500 vehicles will be going to FedEx Express by the holiday period. It’s now the fastest vehicle program to market in the automaker’s history, GM said in a statement.</p>
<p>The automaker scored a second customer for the EV600 with Merchants Fleet, which in February said it would purchase 12,600 vehicles.</p>
<p>Verizon will use the new medium-sized EV410 vehicle as part of its field maintenance and servicing fleet. The two companies did not disclose the size of the order or other terms.</p>
<p>The new van will have over 400 cubic feet of cargo space and measure just under 20 feet overall in length. GM said the vehicle is ideal for maneuvering in crowded spaces, like urban areas, particularly in the online grocery delivery and telecom maintenance segments.</p>
<p>The automaker says that fleet managers will save $7,000 annually using EV600s compared with internal combustion engine vehicles.</p>
<p>The two vehicles each have an estimated range of 250 miles on the automaker’s Ultium battery platform, and weigh less than 10,000 pounds. The EV410 will join the EV600 in being manufactured at GM’s CAMI Assembly facility in Ingersoll, Ontario. GM said it is partnering with a U.S. supplier in Michigan for an initial low-volume production, as the CAMI plant undergoes conversions to ramp-up production of the EV600 starting in November 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2209149" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BrightDrop-EV600-Production-Assembly.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BrightDrop-EV600-Production-Assembly.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BrightDrop-EV600-Production-Assembly.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BrightDrop-EV600-Production-Assembly.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BrightDrop-EV600-Production-Assembly.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BrightDrop-EV600-Production-Assembly.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BrightDrop-EV600-Production-Assembly.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BrightDrop-EV600-Production-Assembly.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BrightDrop-EV600-Production-Assembly.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The introduction of BrightDrop at the beginning of this year signals General Motors’ strong interest in diversifying its market opportunities, as it seeks to lock-in the last-mile commercial and delivery segments. To get there, GM said it would invest around $1 billion CAD ($788 million) to convert the CAMI plant to the Canada’s first electric delivery van manufacturing facility.</p>
<p>The electric cargo and delivery segment is certainly a huge opportunity for GM and other automakers. Verizon is part of a slew of companies, including FedEx and UPS, that have said they would cut or even eliminate net emissions from their operations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Angle Labs, the company behind the <a href="https://www.angle.money">Angle Protocol</a>, has raised a $5 million funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz. The small team has been working on a euro stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Other investors in the round include Fabric VC, Wintermute, Divergence Ventures, Global Founders Capital, Alven, Julien Bouteloup and Frédéric Montagnon.</p>
<p>“I was playing around with <a href="https://compound.finance">Compound</a> and I realized that I was exposing myself to a huge euro/dollar foreign exchange risk. Basically, the euro lost 10% in value against the dollar in 2020,” Angle Labs co-founder Pablo Veyrat told me.</p>
<p>There are a handful of euro-based stablecoins already, but their market capitalization is ridiculously small when you compare those stablecoins against USD-based stablecoins, such as USD Coin (USDC), Tether (USDT) or DAI.</p>
<p>Instead of opening a bank account and storing a ton of EUR on this bank account, the team of engineers have designed a new protocol with three different stakeholders that are looking for three different things.</p>
<p>People who want a digital euro will be able to buy agEUR. At any point in time, one agEUR should be worth one EUR. In order to guarantee the value of Angle’s stablecoins over time, the protocol is designed to accept collateral against stablecoins, such as (wrapped) bitcoins, ethers and more (wBTC, wETH, etc.).</p>
<p>As an incentive, the protocol issues perpetual futures. This way, some traders will open leveraged positions expecting to generate returns on their investments. Traders cover the capital gains or losses for other protocol users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But that’s not necessarily enough to make sure that the Angle protocol remains over-collaterized. That’s why there is a third type of agents in the Angle protocol. People will be able to provide liquidity and accumulate interests on their deposits. Those deposits also act as collateral assets for the protocol.</p>
<p>The result is a sophisticated over-collaterized protocol that isn’t limited to EUR stablecoins — it could work with many different kind of underlying assets. The team will be starting with two new crypto assets, a EUR stablecoin and a USD stablecoin — agEUR and agUSD. They’ll be redeemable against a handful of collaterals and you can expect to see support for those assets in other DeFi protocols.</p>
<p>But Angle Labs already has plans to launch other stablecoins pegged to the Swiss Franc, the British Pound, the Japanese Yen or the Korean Won. The protocol is currently being tested and has been audited by Chainsecurity and Sigma Prime. If things go well, Angle should go live on the mainnet in October.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://rizefs.com/">Rize</a>, a fintech-as-a-service company that provides services to other firms, announced an $11.4 million Series A this morning. The funding event was led by <a href="https://www.alphaedison.com/">Alpha Edison</a> and <a href="https://morpheus.com/">Morpheus Ventures</a>. A number of the startup&#8217;s prior backers also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Rize is an interesting company in a competitive space; the market for building financial technology products for use by customers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/swan-raises-18-7-million-to-provide-embedded-banking-services/">enjoys a great</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/solarisbank-raises-224m-at-a-1-65b-valuation-to-acquire-contis-and-expand-its-api-based-embedded-banking-tech-in-europe/">number of players</a>. Rize hopes to compete by allowing its customers to leverage a single API for more than one account type, unifying its offering to a single developer hook.</p>
<p>More importantly, Rize has built something that it calls &#8220;synthetic accounts.&#8221; For those of us who last heard the word &#8220;synthetic&#8221; in a financial context attached to the phrase &#8220;CDO,&#8221; this may sound concerning. It&#8217;s not. Instead, synthetic accounts allow Rize to provide customers of its banking services a way to create a unified account for end users not tied to a single custodial account type. In practice, synthetic accounts allow Rize to offer end users (the customers of its customers) the ability to combine different custodial accounts (checking, brokerage) into a single experience.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:9564f49f-8d38-4c52-b26c-54667a3eb5d8">white paper from Rize</a>, by offering a single &#8220;synthetic account core,&#8221; its customers can create a more cohesive and programmable financial experience for end users. And the synthetic account system will allow Rize customers to add more services to their financial technology offerings as Rize itself expands its feature set.</p>
<p>Morpheus Ventures&#8217; Howard Ko brought up the company&#8217;s synthetic account work in a statement to TechCrunch, saying that it was that feature of its service that &#8220;attracted&#8221; his firm to the startup, as it &#8220;essentially abstracts all the plumbing required to develop a broad spectrum of fintech products and services that developers are looking to build into a simplified singular API connection.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an interview with senior leadership, Rize told TechCrunch that it has built a compliance management system into its product, likening compliance work to logistics in the e-commerce world &#8212; something critical that is both complicated and not a task that folks relish taking on. Rize wants to alleviate a chunk of that burden, potentially smoothing the path for businesses to select its offering over those of rival banking-as-a-service players.</p>
<p>Rize has completed the core banking pieces of its product &#8212; the startup we see today is the result of a B2B pivot from B2C roots &#8212; with brokerage support coming next. New capital should help the company expand its product mix.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Notably, Rize&#8217;s leadership told TechCrunch that it wound up raising its Series A earlier than it anticipated. The startup had expected slower market traction, it said, but greater-than-anticipated demand meant that Rize had larger human capital needs. So, external funds were the obvious choice.</p>
<p>Rize executed its B2B pivot with a team of around 15, expanding to just over 30 today. The company expects to have nearly 50 staff by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Eventually, there will be consolidation in the banking-as-a-service, or BaaS, space. But we likely won&#8217;t see that wave crest until there&#8217;s less white space for startups to eat into. And by the time that that occurs, startups like Rize will hope to be on the acquiring side of the equation. Let&#8217;s see how quickly Rize can scale both customer and revenue volume with this Series A.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.runx.dev/">RunX</a>, an early stage startup that wants to make it easier for developers to deploy cloud infrastructure, announced a $4.1 million seed investment led by Unusual Ventures and a group of individual angel investors.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Ankur Dahiya says that as organizations deploy modern applications built on microservices and Kubernetes, the complexity in managing cloud resources has grown. His company is attempting to build a solution to simplify all of the aspects related to managing those cloud resources, a capability that is currently only within reach of the largest software companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The company&#8217;s goal has been to give every company the same kind of infrastructure leverage as the tech giants like Google and Facebook, but without needing to invest in a giant infrastructure DevOps team,&#8221; Dahiya told me.</p>
<p>Dahiya spent 4 years at Flexport, while his co-founder CTO Nitin Aggarwal, spent time at Google, Lyft and Stripe. Both come from a background managing engineering teams and helping their organizations manage cloud infrastructure, so they have seen this problem first hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we are doing is we automate a bunch of the DevOps work involved in Kubernetes. So that&#8217;s your provisioning, monitoring, configuration, auto scaling and deployment. For all of that stuff, we have connected it together to make it like an out-of-the-box experience,&#8221; he said. The company does allow developers to tweak that out-of-the-box configuration if they wish, but they have found that for the most part, companies can use the standard configurations because they apply to the vast majority of users.</p>
<p>For starters, it has an open source offering called <a href="https://github.com/run-x/opta/">Opta</a>, and RunX is working with about a dozen beta/design partners. It eventually will charge for a product, but what shape that will take is still being worked out, probably an enterprise version with extra security built in, a cloud service or some combination.</p>
<p>The startup launched a year ago and the founders spent several months talking to developers before they began building the first version of the product in January, which they completed in the spring and began working with early companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, the company has 8 employees and the plan is to double that number by the end of next year. Like most technical startups finding employees, especially competent engineers is a challenge, but the company is attempting to build a diverse and inclusive startup nonetheless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Early on it&#8217;s extra hard. Most of the early people we&#8217;ve gotten from our networks. They were folks I worked with, folks in a closed network. It skews toward archetype, so it&#8217;s been a bit of a struggle,&#8221; he said. That said, he recognizes the importance of building a more diverse team and it&#8217;s something he&#8217;s working on as he recruits for open positions moving forward.</p>
<p>Right now the company is remote, and the plan is to continue that way, although once a quarter they are trying to fly everyone to one location for brainstorming, team building activities and shared meals, but he recognizes this could be more challenging as they grow. He&#8217;s thinking about hiring around hubs where people can meet more regularly, but it&#8217;s still something he and Agrawal are working out.,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the growth of ecommerce has left us browsing and shopping more than ever, that doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re actually buying all that much. In fact, <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/shopping-cart-abandonment">the Baymard Institute, as cited by Shopify, says</a> that about 70 percent of shopping carts are abandoned on desktop, with that number only going up on mobile and tablet.</p>
<p><a href="https://addtocarrot.com/">Carrot</a>, the latest venture out of Bobby Ghoshal and his cofounder Ramin Bozorgzadeh, is looking to make a dent in that number.</p>
<p>Carrot is a plug-in that saves the stuff you&#8217;ve put in your cart and automatically categorizes it.</p>
<p>The company is announcing the close of a $5.5 million seed round with investors that include Kindred Ventures, M13, Abstract, Designer Fund, Combine, Paris Hilton, Scott Belsky, Riverpark, and Nextview.</p>
<p>The &#8216;special sauce&#8217; of Carrot is the product&#8217;s ability to capture what you&#8217;ve put in your cart without any additional buttons or signals, regardless of the retailer. The tech captures the action of add to cart and saves that information in the plug-in, including price and retailer.</p>
<p>Carrot automatically categorizes carts based on the retailer itself, but also allows users to create their own folders. Let&#8217;s say, for example, you&#8217;re shopping for lamps across a handful of different retailers. You can create a lamps folder and compare prices and looks within Carrot.</p>
<p>The product also tracks pricing changes for items in a cart, giving users the chance to see when something goes on sale.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Carrot, users can create registries to send to their friends and family. The registry product is more of an extension of Carrot&#8217;s main use case, and hasn&#8217;t been built out as a full feature, yet. In other words, if you send a page of wish list items to your friends and family, there is no indication to them that someone bought one item or another, meaning you could end up with duplicates. But the team says they&#8217;re working on that functionality in the near future.</p>
<p>Ghoshal is a serial founder. He cofounded Candid, which raised over $150 million, and was head of design and growth at WeWork. Bozorgzadeh, for his part, was a founding engineer at WeWork, head of engineering at WeWork Labs, and an early engineer at Etsy.</p>
<p>Right now, Carrot is only available on desktop, but the company has provided a way for mobile shoppers to still save their carts. Ghoshal says that feedback from customers revealed that people wanted to text items to their cart, using a number provided by Carrot. The idea was that users were already texting themselves items they wanted to buy later.</p>
<p>Carrot makes money using an affiliate model, where the retailer pays out to Carrot for each customer that checks out after their first session.</p>
<p>Eventually, Carrot has plans to get into a SaaS model where brands can pay a monthly fee for access to features like competitive bidding and audience profiling. The team is also working on a single check-out option across multiple charts, which would generate revenue through interchange fees, etc. That said, revenue is not a priority for the company right now, as the focus is on scale.</p>
<p>Ghoshal sees the top challenges for the company being around scale, including getting people to talk about the way they&#8217;re using Carrot and sharing it with their friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then there are probably some platform challenges on Google that we need to think about,&#8221; said Ghoshal. &#8220;Ideally, we&#8217;d get featured on Google, but we don&#8217;t know if they intend to get into the space. There&#8217;s some risk there that we need to think about.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The robotic process automation (RPA) market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/rpa-market-surges-investors-vendors-capitalize-pandemic-tech-shift/">has been red hot</a> over the last year, and one of the market&#8217;s pioneers, <a href="http://blueprism.com">Blue Prism,</a> was sold to <a href="https://www.vistaequitypartners.com/">Vista Equity Partners</a> for £1.095 billion ($1.5 billion USD), according to <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/market-news/offer-for-blue-prism-group-plc/15151094">a filing</a> in Great Britain this morning. While we have seen a lot of RPA startups being acquired by larger vendors over the last year, this is the first deal involving one of the top three vendors in the space.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a complex deal in which Vista set up an entity called Bali Bidco Limited &#8212; which, according to the filing, is indirectly owned by Vista Funds &#8212; to make the purchase on its behalf. While it&#8217;s unclear why it used that financial mechanism, the end result is the private equity group is buying Blue Prism and folding it into another Vista property, <a href="http://tibco.com">Tibco</a>, which<a href="https://www.tibco.com/press-releases/2014/tibco-be-acquired-vista-equity-partners-2400-share-cash"> the firm acquired in 2014</a> for $4.3 billion.</p>
<p>Blue Prism, by its own admission in the filing, was facing tough times and has been exploring its options since its annual general meeting last March. &#8220;The Blue Prism Board has considered a range of strategic options given the strategic and operational headwinds facing the company, the significant risks in execution and the shareholder consultation feedback,&#8221; the company said in the filing.</p>
<p>One of those options was a sale, which it decided was the best approach for the company. Jason Kingdon, chairman and CEO at Blue Prism, sees this as the best path to put it on more solid footing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Combining with Vista and Tibco will ensure we remain at the forefront of the next generation of intelligent automation: We can expand the range of products we offer our customers, with Tibco&#8217;s global footprint and technologies; and, as a privately owned company, we will also have greater access to capital to pursue new growth opportunities via product investment and other potential M&amp;A,&#8221; Kingdon said in a statement.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Private equity firms can offer enterprise startups a viable exit option&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/private-equity-firms-can-offer-enterprise-startups-a-viable-exit-option/embed/#?secret=C3IvnkcqOY" data-secret="C3IvnkcqOY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>We dug into Blue Prism’s historical operating results to better understand its decision to sell. In the six months ending April 30, 2021, the company reported £80.4 million (approximately $108 million USD) worth of revenue, a figure that was up 24% compared to the year-ago period on a constant-currency basis. Over the same time horizon, Blue Prism reduced its operating loss from £53.8 million (approximately $73 million USD) to £20.9 million (approximately $30 million USD).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company was not growing particularly quickly for its level of unprofitability, despite making progress in stemming red ink. The value of Blue Prism had fallen before the deal was announced, indicating that public investors were unenthused with its performance; Vista is paying a premium for the company through Bidco, though less than what Blue Prism was worth earlier this year, before its most recent declines.</p>
<p>If you look at the company’s H1 2021 revenue and extrapolate that over a year, Blue Prism is selling for around 6.8x revenues. This is a useful figure because it indicates what the exit value of public software revenues may be in the European market from a company that is growing as slowly as Blue Prism is. Vista appears confident that the purchase and combination with Tibco will prove lucrative.</p>
<p>While Tibco, a legacy vendor founded in 1997, offers a broad range of automation services to connect data sources across a company, Blue Prism offers robotic process automation services, which help automate a set of mundane legacy tasks across an organization. The two should fit well together, at least on paper, as Blue Prism gives Tibco a leg up on the growing RPA market.</p>
<p>Last year, Gartner reported that the top three vendors in this space included UIPath, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/as-uipath-closes-above-its-final-private-valuation-cfo-ashim-gupta-discusses-his-companys-path-to-market/">a company that went public last year</a> to great fanfare, Automation Anywhere and Blue Prism. In a report last year, IDC estimated that the RPA market would reach $2 billion this year, a modest amount considering the hype circulating around it, but one which IDC expects to reach $5.9 billion by 2024.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of consolidation in the industry, with smaller companies being purchased by larger ones over the last year. Most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/salesforce-steps-into-rpa-buying-servicetrace-and-teaming-it-with-mulesoft/">Salesforce bought German startup</a> Servicetrace and combined it with Mulesoft, which is a similar kind of move to Vista buying Blue Prism and folding it into Tibco. Mulesoft and Tibco could be considered competitors.</p>
<p>The deal is still subject to Blue Prism shareholder approval, as well as the standard regulatory process. Blue Prism stock is off 2.12% on the news.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://arize.com/">Arize AI</a> is applying machine learning to some of technology’s toughest problems. To continue with its mission, the company announced $19 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>Battery Ventures led the round with participation from existing investors Foundation Capital, Trinity Ventures, The House Fund and Swift Ventures. The new round comes over a year after the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/tubemogul-execs-launch-arize-ai-for-ai-troublehsooting/">came out of stealth with $4 million in seed funding</a> led by Foundation Capital.</p>
<p>Arize was co-founded by CEO Jason Lopatecki, a former TubeMogul executive, and chief product officer Aparna Dhinakaran, who previously built machine learning infrastructure at Uber and  joined the company when Arize acquired her company Monitor ML, where she was CEO.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="u2WE9D0yRY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/tubemogul-execs-launch-arize-ai-for-ai-troublehsooting/">TubeMogul, Uber alums launch Arize AI for AI observability</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TubeMogul, Uber alums launch Arize AI for AI observability&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/tubemogul-execs-launch-arize-ai-for-ai-troublehsooting/embed/#?secret=u2WE9D0yRY" data-secret="u2WE9D0yRY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company touts itself as “the first ML observability platform to help make machine learning models work in production.” Its technology monitors, explains and troubleshoots model and data issues.</p>
<p>“At the beginning of the year, we talked to hundreds of businesses deploying machine learning and having the same problems,” Lopatecki told TechCrunch. “Most of their investment was going into building better models and getting them out, but no one had any software to help with the issues.”</p>
<p>Companies use data to build models that they use to automate decisions, but without visibility to see if the models are working or not, it’s difficult to determine if the models are accountable, fair and responsible when implemented in the real world, Dhinakaran added. Arize can be integrated into a company’s AI systems within 30 days to detect performance and bias issues and show customers how to fix it.</p>
<p>Between its seed and Series A rounds, the company secured enterprise customers like Adobe and Twilio. It also scaled its team and went from building a product to having it “massively deployed” in fintech, healthcare, insurtech, adtech and retail institutions.</p>
<p>The opportunity for the Series A came as the company was inundated, Lopatecki said.</p>
<p>“Being a second-time founder, you can feel when the product is taking off, and for us, we could spot where we have that influxsion,” he added. “We want to double down on the product side and get the solution out to more people and get it into more hands.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As such, the funding will go into product development, expanding industries and use cases and growing its team of 40. He expects to double that quickly, especially as the company continues to see 100% annual recurring revenue growth each quarter and a doubling of its customer base.</p>
<p>Dhinakaran forecasts that in five years, Arize’s technology will be deployed into every AI system.</p>
<p>“Every single top machine learning team is going to have that visibility on if their model is doing well and if it is unbiased,” she added. “It’s not just a red or green light of modeling, but enabling practitioners to serve up issues and fix them.”</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Dharmesh Thakker, general partner at Battery Ventures, is joining the Arize AI board. His firm mainly invests in business-to-business software, and Thakker, in particular, oversees infrastructure investments.</p>
<p>Every three months, the firm picks a new theme. In this case, his team had heard from portfolio companies that there wasn’t the tooling available for deploying models and monitoring them. They looked at about nine companies, including Arize, and the more they got to know the company, they decided it had the best vision and leadership.</p>
<p>He sees the future of machine learning observability being a combination of a well-designed product and instant gratification. Customers don’t want to wait, and even though another company might have all the features, because Arize AI focuses on observability and can quickly show value and vision is what makes them stand out.</p>
<p>“Being an engineer myself, I look for founders that have felt the same pain, and in this case, Jason and Aparna have felt the pain because observability was missing,” Thakker added. “We also look for leaders who can hire great people. Not only do they feel the pain, but they rallied this A-plus team around them.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Not every country has a Multiple Listing Service to aid in buying and selling a home. This often makes the process complicated as buyers weed through fake and duplicate listings and little pricing data, unlike in the United States.</p>
<p>Property technology startup <a href="https://nomadhomes.co/">Nomad Homes</a> is working to change that by creating a personalized real estate buying experience in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, a region that represents $20 trillion in real estate, company CEO Helen Chen told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“We are like Stitch Fix for real estate,” she added. “We are matching you to the best home for you. Instead of searching the old way by going through thousands of listings, you can take a &#8216;style quiz,&#8217; and we match you with properties.”</p>

<p>Today, Nomad Homes announced a $20 million Series A funding co-led by 01 Advisors, an investment fund co-founded by former Twitter executives Dick Costolo and Adam Bain, and The Spruce House Partnership. There was also a group of new and existing investors that participated, including Goodwater Capital, HighSage Ventures, Abstract Ventures, Partech, Class 5 Global, Precursor Ventures and Alta Park Capital.</p>
<p>Angel investors in the round included co-founder and former CEO of Zillow and Pacaso Spencer Rascoff through his firm 75 &amp; Sunny, Opendoor CEO Eric Wu, former Compass COO/CFO David Snider, Flyhomes CEO Tushar Garg, Landis co-founders Cyril Berdugo and Tom Petit and DST Global partner Saurabh Gupta.</p>
<p>The company has raised a total of $24 million since Chen, Dan Piehler and Damien Drap started the company in 2019 after bonding over finding a place to live in a new city. They have collective backgrounds in Blackstone, Addepar and Uber, while Chen also left the Stanford Graduate School of Business to start the company.</p>
<p>Nomad Homes is creating its own MLS for the region and applies technology to the expertise provided by local customer services experts to provide home buyers with all of the information they need, from the initial search to financing and signing all of the documents.</p>

<p>“Nomad Homes has built an incredible platform that is shaping the future of real estate across EMEA,” said Dick Costolo, managing partner of 01 Advisors, in a written statement. “What the team is building is increasing market liquidity and simplifying the consumer experience. We have invested in similarly transformative companies in the U.S. and are excited to partner with these founders and the entire team as they expand.”</p>
<p>After announcing its launch and seed round in 2020, the company’s platform is now online in Paris and Dubai. It is expanding into Southern Europe and building out its team in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>As transaction volumes grew over 16 times through the first half of the year, the Series A was an opportunity to accelerate into new markets and heavily invest in the technology and product to improve the experience for customers, Chen said. A portion of the proceeds will also go toward fintech products and doubling its team of 32 by year-end.</p>
<p>“We will continue to deliver the best customer experience and expand our offerings across more markets,” she added. “We are also excited about all of the investors around the table. They are multistage investors, and we have a tremendous amount to learn from them, especially Spencer from Zillow and Eric from Opendoor, who are both experts in the space.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a>, which has a network of data centers in 250 locations around the world, announced its first dalliance with infrastructure services today, an upcoming cloud storage offering called R2.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince, says that the idea for moving into storage as a service came from the same place as other ideas the company has turned into products. It was something they needed in-house and that led to them building it for themselves, before offering it to customers too.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we build products, the reason that we end up building them is usually because we need them ourselves,&#8221; Prince told me. He said that the storage component grew out of the need to store object components like images on the company&#8217;s network. Once they built it, and they looked around at the cloud storage landscape, they decided that it would make sense to offer it as a product to customers too.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought if we can build a storage solution that provides all the functionality that other storage solutions do, that takes advantage of our global network so it&#8217;s extremely performant and we can also then price it in a way that is very attractive to customers [we should do it],&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The R2 name is a little swipe at Amazon&#8217;s S3 storage product and obviously a play on the name. The difference, according to Prince, is that they have found a way to reduce storage costs by up to 10% by eliminating egress fees. Cloudflare plans to price storage at $0.015 per GB of data stored per month. That compares with S3 pricing that starts at $0.023 per GB for the first 50 TB per month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In terms of what costs look like in terms of data transfer costs, if you look at any of the cloud providers it&#8217;s free to put your data in, but it costs you something to pull that data back out,&#8221; Prince told me. He said one of the goals with this service was eliminating those costs associated with moving the data around, and the plan is to not charge for what the company called &#8220;infrequent access.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AZT12fBFrV"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/cloudflare-launches-cloudflare-pages-a-platform-to-deploy-and-host-jamstack-sites/">Cloudflare launches Cloudflare Pages, a platform to deploy and host JAMstack sites</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cloudflare launches Cloudflare Pages, a platform to deploy and host JAMstack sites&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/cloudflare-launches-cloudflare-pages-a-platform-to-deploy-and-host-jamstack-sites/embed/#?secret=AZT12fBFrV" data-secret="AZT12fBFrV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Prince sees this against a backdrop where the price of bandwidth has fallen over the years, yet the price of storage on Amazon and other cloud services has remained high. In his estimation, they can pass on some of those cost savings to customers. He says that he&#8217;s not trying to compete directly with startups like Backblaze and Wasabi, both of which he says are partners, but both are similarly trying to compete with Amazon and other large cloud providers in the cloud storage market.</p>
<p>The product is still being developed and the company has set up a waitlist for customers interested in participating in a beta when it&#8217;s ready for testing in the coming months.</p>
<p>Prince says that Cloudflare is looking at building other services beyond storage, and he sees his company eventually competing with the big three cloud vendors &#8212; AWS, Google and Microsoft. &#8220;I think that we really think we&#8217;re on the path to be the fourth major public cloud. And, and I think that our approach to it is actually much more differentiated than the other three, and so yeah, we will continue to build things out,&#8221; he said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Gem provides companies with marketing-like tools for proactive hiring: sending emails, hosting events, running branded email campaigns and ad spending to engage with talent.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Steve Bartel saw for himself how important hiring is. He was among the first hires at Dropbox and acted as hiring manager to grow the company to over 1,000 in less than five years.</p>
<p>He met co-founder Nick Bushak at MIT. Bushak was later at Facebook leading product engineering teams and also had a similar hiring experience there.</p>
<p>They both saw hiring approaches shift from asset-based to knowledge-based and decided to start their own company, <a href="https://www.gem.com/">Gem</a>, in 2017 to address these changes.</p>
<p>“You used to be able to measure the value of a company by its factories, raw materials and goods, but today, that is measured in people,” Bartel said. “Companies are competing harder than ever for top talent, and our vision is to be ‘Salesforce for hiring.’ ”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208815" style="width: 1450px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208815" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2208815 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/gem-1.png" alt="" width="1440" height="900" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/gem-1.png 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/gem-1.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/gem-1.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/gem-1.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/gem-1.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/gem-1.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208815" class="wp-caption-text">Gem dashboard. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gem</p></div></p>
<p>Recruiting is considered more like sales and marketing now, and instead of waiting for candidates to apply, companies are being proactive and going after people, he added. In addition, companies are realizing that their inbound application pool of people are not as diverse, equitable or inclusive.</p>
<p>Companies like LinkedIn provide the talent and WorkDay manages and tracks someone to hire, but Gem operates as the link between them, enabling companies to do that proactive hiring: sending hundreds of emails, hosting events, running branded email campaigns and ad spending to engage with talent.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We help customers hire the people they need up to five times faster,” Bushak said. “By providing the analytics that track the end-to-end process and track diversity, we can identify if there is any bias or drop-off during the interview process.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the company announced $100 million in Series C funding at a $1.2 billion valuation to accelerate its growth. The round was led by ICONIQ and included participation from existing investors Greylock and Accel and new investors Sapphire Ventures and Meritech Capital. The new capital brings the company’s total funding to $148 million.</p>
<p>The Series C was about “finding investors we loved,” Bartel said. The company did not need the money, but working with investors like ICONIQ and Sapphire will enable Gem to “double down on growth, expand into more markets and continue on the early success in enterprise as Gem considers international expansion and further product investment,” he added.</p>

<p>Matthew Jacobson, general partner at ICONIQ, said he met Gem through an existing relationship with Greylock while the company was going through its Series B. Jacobson and his team were doing some work on different products and tools in the marketing suite and thought Gem&#8217;s approach for managing interactions with candidates and tracking talent was unique.</p>
<p>“They are stellar, humble and super product-oriented,” he said. “When we look at the pain point, the sourcing that Gem enables its customers to do is something that historically, you would have to sign up on Monster.com for and wait for people to come to you. Also, the fact that companies in our portfolio are using Gem is a powerful statement.”</p>
<p>Gem is seeing adoption from large enterprises and is looking at an international expansion in the next year in Western Europe and parts of Asia Pacific. It intends to use the new funding to expand into new markets and on sales and marketing. It has already doubled employees in the first six months of 2021.</p>
<p>Of its more than 800 customers, the company touts over 100 fellow unicorns on that list, including Gusto, Sift and Cockroach Labs. It has tripled its revenue in the last year and doubled its customer base, Bartel said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Australia’s competition watchdog is the latest to push for legal powers to curb Google’s dominance in the adtech sector.</p>
<p>It has made the call as it published its <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/publications/digital-advertising-services-inquiry-final-report">final report</a> on an inquiry examining competition concerns in the digital advertising sector. In the report, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/google’s-dominance-in-ad-tech-supply-chain-harms-businesses-and-consumers">concludes </a>that new regulatory solutions are needed to address Google’s dominance and competition to the adtech sector &#8212; &#8220;for the benefit of businesses and consumers&#8221;.</p>
<p>The tech giant&#8217;s grip on first party data is a particular focus in the report, with the regulator floating the idea of special measures being needed to tackle Google&#8217;s dominance &#8212; such as data separation powers or data access requirements.</p>
<p>“We have identified systemic competition concerns relating to conduct over many years and multiple adtech services, including conduct that harms rivals. Investigation and enforcement proceedings under general competition laws are not well suited to deal with these sorts of broad concerns, and can take too long if anti-competitive harm is to be prevented,” said ACCC chair Rod Sims in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are concerned that the lack of competition has likely led to higher adtech fees. An inefficient adtech industry means higher costs for both publishers and advertisers, which is likely to reduce the quality or quantity of online content and ultimately results in consumers paying more for advertised goods,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>In a specific finding against Google, the ACCC found the tech giant has used its position to preference its own services (aka self-preferencing) and shield them from competition &#8212; with the watchdog giving the example of how Google prevents rival adtech services from accessing ads on YouTube (which it said gives Google&#8217;s adtech services an &#8220;important advantage&#8221;).</p>
<p>More generally, it found <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Google has a dominant position in key parts of the adtech supply chain &#8212; estimating that more than 90% of ad impressions traded via the adtech supply chain passed through at least one Google service last year. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google&#8217;s dominance is underpinned by multiple factors, per the ACCC&#8217;s analysis &#8212; including access to consumer and other data; access to exclusive inventory; and integration across its adtech services.</p>
<p>The report also highlights key acquisitions by Google &#8212; including of DoubleClick in 2007, AdMob in 2009, and YouTube in 2006 &#8212; which the regulator said had helped Google entrench its position in adtech.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Z1KohKlwHL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/googles-sundar-pichai-grilled-over-destroying-anonymity-on-the-internet/">Google&#8217;s Sundar Pichai grilled over &#8216;destroying anonymity on the internet&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google&#8217;s Sundar Pichai grilled over &#8216;destroying anonymity on the internet&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/googles-sundar-pichai-grilled-over-destroying-anonymity-on-the-internet/embed/#?secret=Z1KohKlwHL" data-secret="Z1KohKlwHL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The lack of transparency in the sector is another target, with the report highlighting opaque pricing and operation which it said compounds the complexity of the market, making it difficult for advertisers and publishers to understand how the supply chain is functioning and detect misconduct.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s competition watchdog highlighted similar concerns in its own <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/online-platforms-and-digital-advertising-market-study">adtech sector report</a> last year. And UK lawmakers are now working on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">digitally focused reform of domestic competition law</a>.</p>
<p>As well as calling for new legal powers to curb Google&#8217;s dominance in the advertising sector, the ACCC recommends that the industry establishes standards &#8212; such as requiring providers to publish average fees and take rates to enable their customers to easily compare fees across different providers and services.</p>
<p>It also recommends an industry standard to enable &#8220;full and independent verification of the services advertisers use in the supply chain&#8221;. And it flags Google&#8217;s refusal to participate in the publisher-led &#8216;header bidding&#8217; push &#8212; an industry initiative, developed around 2014/15, which tried to boost competition for publishers’ inventory but was stymied by lack of support from Google &#8212; highlighting that Google previously allowed its services to have a ‘last look’ opportunity to outbid rivals, in another critical observation.</p>
<p>“Google has used its vertically integrated position to operate its adtech services in a way that has, over time, led to a less competitive adtech industry. This conduct has helped Google to establish and entrench its dominant position in the ad tech supply chain,” said Sims.</p>
<p>“Google’s activities across the supply chain also mean that, in a single transaction, Google can act on behalf of both the advertiser (the buyer) and the publisher (the seller) and operate the ad exchange connecting these two parties. As the interests of these parties do not align, this creates conflicts of interest for Google which can harm both advertisers and publishers.”</p>
<p>Perhaps the really striking point here is that none of the ACCC&#8217;s findings feel especially new. Rather these are problems that regulators and lawmakers all over the world have been fixing on &#8212; and considering how best to fix.</p>
<p>The Australian watchdog&#8217;s report follows a major penalty levied again Mountain View in France <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/france-fines-google-268m-for-adtech-abuses-and-gets-interoperability-commitments/">this summer</a>, for instance, in a case also relating to self-preferencing in the adtech sector.</p>
<p>France&#8217;s competition authority also extracted a number of commitments from Google on interoperability in the adtech market.</p>
<p>The ACCC is recommending that the government Down Under creates rules to manage conflicts of interest; prevent anti-competitive self-preferencing; and ensure rival ad tech providers “can compete on their merits” &#8212; also echoing many of the concerns European Union legislators have similarly identified in a set of proposed ex ante rules aimed at tech giants like Google (aka, so-called &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; platforms).</p>
<p>And, as mentioned above, the UK is also planning to update competition rules to give regulators <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">bespoke powers</a> to tackle platform giants.</p>
<p>The country&#8217;s competition watchdog is also investigating a Google proposal to phase out third party tracking cookies (aka, Privacy Sandbox) and replace 3P cookies with a bundle of what it bill as &#8216;pro-privacy&#8217; alternatives &#8212; following adtech industry complaints. This <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">June</a> the tech giant offered not to go ahead with the plan unless the CMA is happy that the transition away from 3P cookies will not negatively impact competition.</p>
<p>While &#8212; over in Germany &#8212; legislators have already updated competition rules to target digital giants, passing an update to the law at the start of this year which gives antitrust regulator powers to intervene again Internet giants by, for example, banning self-preferencing.</p>
<p>The ACCC notes that it’s considering specific allegations against Google under existing competition laws. But the report emphasizes that new regulatory mechanism are essential to tackle its dominance.</p>
<p>“We have identified systemic competition concerns relating to conduct over many years and multiple ad tech services, including conduct that harms rivals. Investigation and enforcement proceedings under general competition laws are not well suited to deal with these sorts of broad concerns, and can take too long if anti-competitive harm is to be prevented,” said Sims.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Australia is also considering broader regulations for the digital sector &#8212; with a report on that due in a year’s time.</p>
<p>The ACCC said that report should also consider how to implement sector-specific rules for adtech &#8212; and whether they need to form part of a broader regulatory scheme to address &#8220;common competition and consumer concerns&#8221; the watchdog said it has identified in digital platform markets.</p>
<p>“Many of the concerns we identified in the adtech supply chain are similar to concerns in other digital platform markets, such as online search, social media and app marketplaces,&#8221; added Sims. &#8220;These markets are also dominated by one or two key providers, which benefit from vertical integration, leading to significant competition concerns. In many cases these are compounded by a lack of transparency.&#8221;</p>
<p>Consultation on that piece of work will kick off in the first quarter of 2022 &#8212; with the ACCC saying it will &#8220;take into account&#8221; overseas legislative proposals to deal with these issues.</p>
<p>The EU presented its plan for grappling with Big Tech in the Digital Markets Act proposal at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">end of last year</a>, along with a broader set of rules for digital platforms (the Digital Services Act) that aims to dial up accountability more generally across Internet services, targeting areas like illegal content or the sale of dangerous goods online.</p>
<p>While in Germany &#8212; which is pushing ahead of any pan-EU measures &#8212; the FCO has opened a raft of procedures against tech giants (including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/amazons-market-power-to-be-tested-in-germany-in-push-for-early-action-over-antitrust-risks/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/apples-app-store-to-face-scrutiny-in-germany-as-fco-opens-market-power-proceeding/">Apple</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/facebook-hit-with-antitrust-probe-for-tying-oculus-use-to-facebook-accounts/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/in-latest-big-tech-antitrust-push-germanys-fco-targets-google-news-showcases-fine-print/">Google</a>), looking at whether their market power is significant enough for their businesses to fall under scope of its new law. So the competition authority there could soon step in to curb market abuses.</p>
<p>Asia has also been taking an increasingly active stance against regulating tech giants. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/south-korean-antitrust-regulator-fines-google-177m-for-abusing-market-dominance/">Earlier this month</a>, for example, South Korea fined Google $177M for market abuse related to how it operates its smartphone operating system, Android. While, in China, the regime is turning its guns on all big tech &#8212; even homegrown companies.</p>
<p>And even on home turf, US tech giants &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/justice-department-will-reportedly-file-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-today/">Google</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">Facebook</a> &#8212; are facing regulatory challenges on a number of fronts, including over how they operate app stores, and on issues like self-preferencing and predatory market consolidation.</p>
<p>The tl;dr is there is now a global consensus that big tech must be cut down to size. The only questions are over how that happens &#8212; see, for example, Australia already pushing ahead with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers/">legislation for a news media bargaining code</a> that targets Facebook and Google &#8212; and how quickly digital markets can be rebooted.</p>
<p>Responding to the ACCC&#8217;s report, a Google spokesperson offered this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“Google’s digital advertising technology services are delivering benefits for businesses and consumers &#8212; helping publishers fund their content, enabling small businesses to reach customers and grow, and protecting people online from bad ad practices.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/australia/how-advertising-technology-helping-power-our-digital-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/australia/how-advertising-technology-helping-power-our-digital-economy/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1632912985073000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEPyE9gszORyunUq8CH6YVwyngsVw">Analysis by PwC Australia</a> for Google Australia found that three quarters of Google’s adtech customers are Australian small and medium businesses &#8212; and three in four businesses surveyed observed important benefits from using Google’s services including cost savings, time savings and business growth, compared to other services.</p>
<p dir="ltr">PwC also estimated that the existence and use of Google’s advertising technology directly supports more than 15,000 full-time equivalent jobs and contributes $2.45 billion to the Australian economy annually.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As one of the many advertising technology providers in Australia, we will continue to work collaboratively with industry and regulators to support a healthy ads ecosystem.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the pandemic continues to unevenly play out, the backdrop of our days has never felt more stagnant. While tech workers may turn to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/virtual-hqs-race-to-win-over-a-remote-work-fatigued-market/"> virtual HQs</a> or Twitter Spaces for spontaneous chats, high schoolers are searching for casual places online to riff and study with friends. And <a href="https://hi.fiveable.me/">Fiveable</a>, a Milwaukee-based startup, fits the growing demand.</p>
<p>Fiveable began years ago as a free, online learning community for high school students with the focus of helping them pass Advanced Placement (AP) exams. It grew in popularity as it livestreamed 5-hour “cram shops” focused on a specific subject, created study guides and managed a Discord with thousands of students. Now, it is evolving to become a social learning platform that helps any student navigate high school.</p>
<p>“We’re the hallways of the educational internet,” said Fiveable Co-founder and CEO<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adoamaral/"> Amanda DoAmaral</a>. “What do students do in the hallways of high school? They hang out with friends, they grab books, they figure out where they need to be next, they catch up &#8211; and a lot of what happens in Fiveable is that.”</p>
<p>DoAmaral’s vision, built alongside co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanho02/">Tán Ho,</a> fueled Fiveable’s latest financing event. The startup announced today that it has raised a $10 million Series A led by Union Square Ventures with participation from Owl Ventures and Progression Fund. Previously, Fiveable had raised more than $4.2 million from investors including BBG Ventures, Chelsea Clinton’s Metrodora Ventures, Emerson Collective, Beta Boom, gener8tor, Matchstick Ventures, Darrell Silver and Serena Williams.</p>
<p>The money will be used to help Fiveable grow its team to help it build more student-led online spaces.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Where you live, what teacher you get, what resources you have access to? All of those things end up amounting to whether or not you&#8217;re going to be successful,&#8221; said DoAmaral. &#8220;And so what we want to really be able to do is put that power back into student&#8217;s hands, so that their ability to navigate who want they to be is a lot more obvious for them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Fiveable’s focus is sharpening to be more student-directed </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/fiveable-hours-acquisition/">just months after it acquired Hours</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, a virtual study platform built by 16-year old Calix Huang. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Hours allows students to create study sessions where each person has a task list and shared timer and playlist, a multiplayer experience that Fiveable students were naturally flocking to before the companies even merged. The co-founders explained that the acquisition helped them understand the magic within studying groups, and will guide the product roadmap for future features. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When we first started, we were live streaming, we had some blogs and study guides,&#8221; said Ho. &#8220;But once we started opening up community spaces, that&#8217;s when all the students started rushing in and setting up <a href="https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique">pomodoro rooms</a>..24/7.&#8221; The magic of that engagement helped the startup figure out that it may need to focus less on teacher-led study sessions, and more on ways to bring students together in creative ways.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not doing so alone. One of Fiveable&#8217;s competitive advantages is that it has over 50 students as paid interns across all teams except its executive suite. Additionally, Fiveable’s current team is 50% women, 38% non-white, and 24% LGBTQ+. The diverse perspectives help Fiveable stay on top of study trends, customer research, and fresh perspectives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Establishing us for students as a space for not just for AP, but for all these other support systems, is definitely a challenge in front of us,&#8221; DoAmaral said.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2208960 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hours.png" alt="" width="846" height="441" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hours.png 3814w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hours.png?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hours.png?resize=300,156 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hours.png?resize=768,400 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hours.png?resize=680,354 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hours.png?resize=1536,801 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hours.png?resize=2048,1067 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hours.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 846px) 100vw, 846px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fiveable&#8217;s reach has grown immensely over the past year. Over 7.3 million students have come to the platform, with 3X year over year growth, per the startup. Its Discord community, launched in 2021, has over 25,000 users. And, when it was charging for access, it gave over 3,000 scholarships.</p>
<p>DoAmaral explained that because the startup is prioritizing growth over monetization right now, access to its platform is entirely free. Fiveable&#8217;s lead investor USV seems to be comfy with the potentially controversial choice considering two of its portfolio companies, Quizlet and Duolingo, similarly pursued bottoms-up growth and eventually made revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there&#8217;s a few categories that are as dynamic as K-12 education right now,&#8221; said Rebecca Kaden, partner at USV. &#8220;On one hand, that&#8217;s a challenge &#8211; it&#8217;s really hard to build products to keep up with a dynamic world, and to make sure you&#8217;re meeting students at scale where they are and how they&#8217;re thinking&#8230; on the other hand, that&#8217;s the opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added: &#8220;Fiveable is becoming the go-to platform and base for them to really live on and learn on, so navigating that line so that its opportunity amidst challenge is basically the kind of task of this business.&#8221;</p>
<p>In pursuit of growth, DoAmaral views the biggest challenge for Fiveable as one that any community has to reckon with: ensuring the integrity of the space from both an infrastructure, and community perspective.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toyota subsidiary Woven Planet Holdings has made its third acquisition in less than a year in its bid to invest in, develop and eventually bring future-of-transportation technologies like automated driving to market.</p>
<p>This time, it&#8217;s Renovo Motors, the automotive operating system developer based in Silicon Valley that made its first big splash in 2015, when it debuted a video of a self-driving DeLorean developed with Stanford doing autonomous doughnuts. Terms of the deal, which has closed, were not disclosed. Renovo, which will maintain its Silicon Valley office, will be integrated into Woven Planet&#8217;s 1,240-person operation.</p>
<p>Woven Planet, which earlier this year acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/toyotas-woven-planet-acquires-hd-mapping-startup-carmera/">mapping startup Carmera</a> and Lyft&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/lyft-sells-self-driving-unit-to-toyotas-woven-planet-for-550m/">autonomous driving unit,</a> Level 5, isn&#8217;t snapping up Renovo for its AV doughnut skills. The company <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">is interested in Renovo&#8217;s vehicle operating system and how it might help speed up its own efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Renovo developed an </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">operating system designed to run apps in vehicles related to automated driving, maps and other mobility services that might be delivered to riders. The</span> operating system, called AWare OS, works a lot like how Google’s Android allows app developers to launch services in the smartphone market. It can even be compared, in a way, to Amazon Web Services’ on-demand cloud computing platform. This middleware, which is designed to be flexible without compromising security, provides a platform that other companies can use to deploy software.</p>
<p>With just 30 employees, Renovo was a small player in the booming and now consolidating autonomous vehicle industry. And yet, its operating system did get the attention of a number of AV developers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/31/renovo-os-self-driving-cars-aipod/">such as Voyage</a>, which has since been acquired by Cruise. The company also attracted several investors, including Verizon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ve become increasingly aware that the IP that Renovo developed was being seen as core to what automotive manufacturers want to do in the future,&#8221; Renovo co-founder and CEO Chris Heiser said in a recent interview. &#8220;As we&#8217;ve built these relationships and tried to understand how do we get to scale — and like, capital S, huge scale — it became increasingly clear to us that we had to find a partner that had the resources and had the backing of an automaker and that had millions and millions of cars to launch on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Woven Planet sees Renovo&#8217;s OS as a means to help commercialize its own <a href="https://medium.com/tri-ad-techblog/introducing-arene-c0c3c887b52c">open vehicle development platform,</a> Arene, that it intends to bring to market by 2025.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Woven Planet Holdings, which folded in Toyota Research Institute &#8212; Advanced Development Inc. or TRI-AD, also includes an investment arm known as Woven Capital and Woven City, a testing ground for new technologies set in an interconnected smart city prototype. In February, Toyota broke ground at the Higashi-Fuji site in Susono City, Japan, at the base of Mount Fuji.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Woven Capital kicked off off its new $800 million strategic fund by announcing an investment into autonomous delivery vehicle company Nuro.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/uks-whitehat-rebrands-as-multiverse-raises-44m-to-build-tech-apprenticeships-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebranding</a> from White Hat and raising $44 million earlier this year, tech apprenticeship startup <a href="http://multiverse.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiverse</a> has raised another round of funding. The company today <a href="https://blog.multiverse.io/multiverse-closes-130m-series-c-apprenticeships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it has closed $130 million in a Series C round.</p>
<p>The funding had been rumored in recent weeks while the round was being closed.  D1 Capital Partners and BOND led this latest investment; Multiverse is not disclosing if there are other investors in the round. Those that have previously backed the company include General Catalyst (which led the startup&#8217;s last round), GV (formerly known as Google Ventures), Audacious Ventures, Latitude, SemperVirens, Index Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners. D1 is Daniel Sundheim&#8217;s firm, while BOND is the firm co-founded by Mary Meeker, two longtime figures in the worlds of investment banking and investing in general.</p>
<p>The company has confirmed that its new valuation is $875 million. As a point of reference, PitchBook <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/232702-39/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> at the time of its last round that the valuation was just under $164 million, while the FT put it at $200 million in the same period (Multiverse never confirmed those numbers, though.) The implication in any event is that it&#8217;s higher in multiples because the company has been expanding: Multiverse says that it has grown four-fold in the last year, and now has worked with some 5,000 people, counting both current apprentices and alumni.</p>
<p>Multiverse&#8217;s previous round was raised to help the London-founded startup &#8212; the head of the company is the well-connected Euan Blair, son of former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and barrister Cherie Booth Blair &#8212; expand into the US market. Perhaps given the huge hiccup that is the global Covid-19 health pandemic, that office in the end only opened last month, in New York.</p>
<p>The new funding is going to be used to continue that expansion, both in its home market and the US.</p>
<p>Its customer list numbers about 300 &#8212; I&#8217;ll point out that this is the same number it quoted when I covered the last funding round in January &#8212; with Google, Generation USA, MixPanel and Adyen among its newer clients, with Facebook, Morgan Stanley and the NHS among its older base.</p>
<p><a href="https://platform.multiverse.io/apprenticeships" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apprenticeships on the platform</a> currently range from roles in data science and adtech (&#8220;programmatic pioneer&#8221; is one) through to administrative and operational roles and they cover placements in tech companies, finance organizations and more, and are both on-site and remote. Prices charged to companies vary “but are broadly around the $15,000 mark,&#8221; I was told by Blair earlier this year. (And to be clear, the individuals applying don’t pay anything, and they will also be paid by the companies providing the apprenticeships.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The job market has changed drastically in the last 18 months, not least because of economic contractions, the changing nature of consumer habits, and the changing face of work in the face of a global public health crisis.</p>
<p>These have all caused massive reverberations. How people look for work, how they set themselves up for jobs that that they want, or even how they think about jobs &#8212; all of these have been impacted &#8212; and the same, of course, goes for employers.</p>
<p>Tech jobs are a particularly interesting area because many of them by their nature can be engaged with remotely, using the very digital tools that tech workers are building or helping maintain.</p>
<p>All of this has presented an interesting window of opportunity for Multiverse specifically, and more generally the concept of an apprentice, which sits somewhere between a more standard recent graduate/less experience jobseeker and someone who might still be studying and looking at internships to gain more experience.</p>
<p>“We want to build an outstanding alternative to university and college,” Blair told me earlier this year. Even the name speaks to how the people it targets do not typically fit into the traditional categories of candidates. There are “multiple universes” one can inhabit as a post-18 young adult, Blair said, hence the &#8220;Multiverse&#8221; name (which has nothing to do with &#8220;metaverse&#8221; in case you are wondering). Apprenticeships typically last 1.5 years.</p>
<p>But as the world of startups has demonstrated many times, windows of opportunity can indeed be lucrative, but sometimes they can also be very challenging to open &#8212; and this is likely one reason why Multiverse has raised this big round so soon after its last one. (Another could be competition. LinkedIn, as one example, also has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/linkedin-doubles-down-on-development-with-new-learning-hub-free-courses-and-new-search-fields-for-hybrid-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rethinking and repositioning itself</a> in the wider worlds of professional development and job-hunting. Apprenticeships sound like a very obvious area for it to build something.)</p>
<p>In the meantime, investors seem to think that being smaller and very focused will be to Multiverse&#8217;s, and jobseekers&#8217;, advantage.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe <span class="il">Multiverse</span> is expanding access to wage-growth and social mobility for employees from a broad range of backgrounds while creating substantial value for employers,&#8221; said Jeremy Goldstein of D1 Capital Partners, in a statment. &#8220;We are excited to invest and help <span class="il">Multiverse</span> scale its model globally.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup also has been trying to leverage its place in tapping people who might not fit into more traditional job channels, to bring more diversity into the wider talent pool, which has found a willing audience among organizations looking to bring more diversity and inclusiveness into their own ranks.</p>
<p>It claims that among the apprentices that it places into roles, 53% are people of color, while 36% are from economically disadvantaged communities.</p>
