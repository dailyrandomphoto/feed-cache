										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Practically every film production these days needs some kind of visual effects work, but independent creators often lack the cash or expertise to get that top-shelf CG. <a href="https://www.wonderdynamics.com/">Wonder Dynamics</a>, founded by VFX engineer Nikola Todorovic and actor Tye Sheridan, aims to use AI to make some of these processes more accessible for filmmakers with budgets on the tight side, and they&#8217;ve just raised $2.5 million to make it happen.</p>
<p>The company has its origins in 2017, after Sheridan and Todorovic met on the set of Rodrigo Garcia&#8217;s film <em>Last Days in the Desert</em>. They seem to have both felt that the opportunity was there to democratize the tools that they had access to in big studio films.</p>
<p>Wonder Dynamics is very secretive about what exactly its tools do. <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/04/vfx-startup-wonder-dynamics-2-5-million-seed-funding-nikola-todorovic-tye-sheridan-steven-spielberg-joe-russo-1234730142/">Deadline&#8217;s Mike Fleming Jr</a> saw a limited demo and said he &#8220;could see where it will be of value in the area of world creation at modest budgets. The process can be done quickly and at a fraction of a traditional cost structure,&#8221; though that leaves us little closer than we started.</p>
<p>Sheridan and Todorovic (who jointly answered questions I sent over) described the system, called Wallace Pro, as taking over some of the grunt work of certain classes of VFX rather than a finishing touch or specific effect.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are building an AI platform that will significantly speed up both the production and post-production process for content involving CG characters and digital worlds. The goal of the platform is to reduce the costs associated with these productions by automating the &#8216;objective&#8217; part of the process, leaving the artists with the creative, &#8216;subjective&#8217; work,&#8221; they said. &#8220;By doing this, we hope to create more opportunities and empower filmmakers with visions exceeding their budget. Without saying too much, it can be applied to all three stages of filmmaking (pre-production, production and post-production), depending on the specific need of the artist.&#8221;</p>

<p>From this we can take that it&#8217;s an improvement to the workflow, reducing the time it takes to achieve some widely used effects, and therefore the money that needs to be set aside for them. To be clear this is distinct from another, more specific product being developed by Wonder Dynamics to create virtual interactive characters as part of the film production process — an early application of the company&#8217;s tools, no doubt.</p>
<p>The tech has been in some small scale tests, but the plan is to put it to work in a feature entering production later this year. &#8220;Before we release the tech to the public, we want to be very selective with the first filmmakers who use the technology to make sure the films are being produced at a high level,&#8221; they said. First impressions do matter.</p>
<p>The $2.5M seed round was led by Founders Fund, Cyan Banister, the Realize Tech Fund, Capital Factory, MaC Venture Capital, and Robert Schwab. &#8220;Because we are at the intersection of technology and film, we really wanted to surround ourselves with investment partners who understand how much the two industries will depend on each other in the future,&#8221; Sheridan and Todorovic said. &#8220;We were extremely fortunate to get MaC Venture Capital and Realize Tech Fund alongside FF. Both funds have a unique combination of Silicon Valley and Hollywood veterans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wonder Dynamics will use the money to, as you might expect, scale its engineering and VFX teams to further develop and expand the product&#8230; whatever it is.</p>
<p>With their advisory board, it would be hard to make a mistake without someone calling them on it. &#8220;We’re extremely lucky to have some of the most brilliant minds from both the AI and film space,&#8221; they said, and that&#8217;s no exaggeration. Right now the lineup includes Steven Spielberg and Joe Russo (&#8220;obviously geniuses when it comes to film production and innovation&#8221;), UC Berkeley and Google&#8217;s Angjoo Kanazawa and MIT&#8217;s Antonio Torralba (longtime AI researchers in robotics and autonomy), and numerous others in film and finance who &#8220;offer us a wealth of knowledge when we’re trying to figure out how to move the company forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>AI is deeply integrated into many tech companies and enterprise stacks, making it a solid moneymaker in that industry, but it is still something of a fringe concept in the more creator-driven film and TV world. Yet hybrid production techniques like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/ilm-shows-off-the-new-stagecraft-led-wall-used-for-season-2-of-the-mandalorian/">ILM&#8217;s StageCraft</a>, used to film <em>The Mandalorian</em>, are showing how techniques traditionally used for 3D modeling and game creation can be applied safely to film production — sometimes even live on camera. AI is increasingly that part of the world, as pioneers like Nvidia and Adobe have shown, and it seems inevitable that it should come to film — though in exactly what form it&#8217;s hard to say.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sometimes you’ve just got to confirm an unannounced product to put the rumors to bed, I guess. That was Google’s strategy this afternoon, following earlier rumors <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-5a-5g-limited-release-us-japan">from Android Central</a> that a chip shortage had put the kibosh on the mid-budget phone.</p>
<p>In a comment to TechCrunch, a Google spokesperson noted, “Pixel 5a 5G is not cancelled. It will be available later this year in the U.S. and Japan and announced in line with when last year’s a-series phone was introduced.”</p>
<p>That time frame would put the device’s arrival around late-summer, meaning it won’t arrive in time for Google I/O in May, as some speculated. Interestingly, the company appears to be limiting the device&#8217;s availability to two countries &#8212; at least at launch. That could, perhaps, be due to earlier-reported component shortages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled">The Verge notes</a>, the company hasn’t been particularly precious when it comes to product announcements. The company took a similar approach ahead of the release of the Pixel. Either way, this isn’t exactly the standard big company approach to rumor denial, which is to either not answer or otherwise deflect.</p>
<p>Google may well be on edge about its Pixel line these days. The phone line hasn’t exactly taken the mobile world be storm, resulting in longstanding rumors that the company is looking to shake things up. That, in part, has seemingly been confirmed by some fairly high-profile exits.</p>
<p>Still, even while there have been issues on the premium side, the company’s budget &#8220;a&#8221; line has helped buoy its overall numbers. No word yet on specific specs, but the handset is not expected to be a radical departure from its predecessor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few companies have done better than Scale at spotting a need in the AI gold rush early on and filling that gap. The startup rightly identified that one of the tasks most important to building effective AI at scale — the laborious exercise of tagging data sets to make them usable in properly training new AI agents — was one that companies focused on that area of tech would also be most willing to outsource. CEO and co-founder Alex Wang credits their success since founding, which includes raising over $277 million and achieving break-even status in terms of revenue, to early support from investors including Accel&#8217;s Dan Levine.</p>
<p>Accel haș participated in four of Scale&#8217;s financing rounds, which is all of them unless you include the funding from YC the company secured as part of a cohort in 2016. In fact, Levine wrote one of the company&#8217;s very first checks. So on this past week&#8217;s episode of Extra Crunch Live, we spoke with Levine and Wang about how that first deal came together, and what their working relationship has been like in the years since.</p>
<p>Scale&#8217;s story starts with a pivot, and with a bit of rule-breaking, too — Wang went off the typical YC book by speaking to investors prior to demo day when Levine cold-emailed him after seeing Scale on Product Hunt. The Product Hunt spot wasn&#8217;t planned, either — Wang was as surprised to see his company there as anyone else. But Levine saw the kernel of something with huge potential, and despite being a relative unknown in VC at the time, didn&#8217;t want to let the opportunity pass him, or Wang, by.</p>
<p>Both Wang and Levine were also able to provide some great feedback on decks submitted to our regular Pitch Deck Teardown segment, despite the fact that Levine actually never saw a pitch deck from Wang before investing (more on that later). If you&#8217;d like your pitch deck reviewed by experienced founders and investors on a future episode, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">you can submit your deck here</a>.</p>
<h2>Knowing when to bend the rules</h2>
<p>As mentioned, Levine and Accel&#8217;s initial investment in Scale came from a cold email sent after the company appeared on Product Hunt. Wang said the team had just put out an early version of Scale, and then noticed that it was up on Product Hunt — it was submitted by someone else. The community response was encouraging, and it also led to Levine reaching out via email.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the side effects of that, one of the outcomes, was that we got this cold email from Dan,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We really knew nothing about Dan until his cold email. So like many great stories that started with a bold, cold email. And we were pretty stressed about it at the time, because in YC, they tell you pretty definitively, &#8216;Hey, don&#8217;t talk to a VC during the batch,&#8217; and we were squarely in the middle of the batch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wang and the team were so nervous that they even considered &#8220;ghosting&#8221; Dan despite his obvious interest and the prestige of Accel as an investment firm. In the end, they decided to &#8220;go rogue&#8221; and respond, which led to a meeting at the Accel offices in Palo Alto.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the last few days, we&#8217;ve published several articles recapping panels from last week&#8217;s TechCrunch Early Stage virtual conference.</p>
<p>Each story is based on an interview with a founder or investor who addressed some of the most common startup dilemmas. Predictably, they&#8217;re mostly focused on the <strong><em>how</em></strong> and <strong><em>why:</em></strong></p>
<p><i><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/how-to-get-into-a-startup-accelerator/">How do I get into an accelerator?</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/building-and-leading-an-early-stage-sales-team-with-zoom-cro-ryan-azus/">When should I hire a sales team?</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/four-strategies-for-getting-attention-from-investors/">What&#8217;s the best way to earn attention from investors?</a></i></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch reporter Natasha Mascarenhas interviewed Kleiner Perkins partner Bucky Moore to get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/series-a-how-to/">sector-agnostic advice for founders who are ready to raise a Series A</a>.</p>
<p>Their conversation isn&#8217;t a rehash of basic best practices — Moore says the pandemic has fundamentally changed the way he does business: &#8220;I actually believe that first meetings over Zoom are here to stay; I think it&#8217;s far more efficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to the eventual return of live TechCrunch events, but each Early Stage recap includes video and a complete transcript. As ever, full articles are available for Extra Crunch members.</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading — I hope you have a fantastic weekend.</p>

<p>Have you ever bought a pig in a poke?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a saying from medieval times: A farmer traveling on an unfamiliar road agrees to buy a baby pig in a bag from a passing stranger. Unfortunately, when the farmer gets back to their hut and opens the sack, there&#8217;s a kitten inside.</p>
<p>The risk of getting stuck with a counterfeit item when buying online is real, especially when it comes to sneakers, jewelry and other designer products. That&#8217;s why online marketplace StockX created a rigorous product verification and authentication process.</p>
<p>To date, its users have conducted more than 10 million transactions for sneakers, handbags, streetwear, watches and other high-end items that are often produced in limited quantities.</p>
<p>StockX&#8217;s prices are regulated and all transactional data is transparent, factors that have combined to help the platform reach a $2.8 billion valuation.</p>
<p>In a four-part series that dropped this week, Extra Crunch analyzes this &#8220;foundational new category of market&#8221; that began as a hobbyist&#8217;s sneaker price chart.</p>

<p>It appears that the slowdown in tech debuts is not a complete freeze; despite concerning news regarding the IPO pipeline, some deals are chugging ahead.</p>
<p>Alkami Technology joins a list that includes Coinbase’s impending direct listing and Robinhood’s expected IPO.</p>
<p>Texas-based Alkami Technology is a software company that delivers its product to banks via the cloud, so it’s not a legacy player scraping together an IPO during boom times.</p>
<p>Let’s dig into the latest SEC filing from the software unicorn.</p>

<p>Last year could well have been the dawn of alternative protein in China. More than 10 startups raised capital to make plant-based protein for a country with increasing meat demand. Of these, Starfield, Hey Maet, Vesta and Haofood have been around for about a year; ZhenMeat was founded three years ago; and Green Monday is a nine-year-old Hong Kong firm pushing into mainland China.</p>
<p>The competition intensified further last year when American incumbents Beyond Meat and Eat Just entered China.</p>
<p>Although some investors worry the sudden boom of meat-substitute startups could turn into a bubble, others believe the market is far from saturated.</p>

<p>For those who follow the space, LG will be remembered fondly as a smartphone trailblazer. For well over a decade, the company was a major player in the Android category and a driving force behind a number of innovations that have since become standard.</p>
<p>LG continued pushing envelopes — albeit to mixed effect. But in the end, the company just couldn’t keep up.</p>
<p>This week, the South Korean electronics giant announced it will be getting out of the “incredibly competitive” category, choosing instead to focus on its myriad other departments.</p>

<p>Electric cars and trucks seem to have everything going for them: They don’t produce tailpipe emissions, they’re quieter than their fossil-fuel-powered counterparts and the underlying architecture allows for roomier and often sleeker designs.</p>
<p>But the humble lithium-ion battery powering these cars and trucks leads a difficult life. Irregular charging and discharge rates, intense temperatures and many partial charge cycles cause these batteries to degrade in the first five to eight years of use, and, eventually, they end up in a recycling facility.</p>
<p>Instead of sending batteries straight to recycling for raw material recovery — and leaving unrealized value on the table — startups and automakers are finding ways to reuse batteries as part of a small and growing market.</p>

<p>Eghosa Omoigui, the founder and managing general partner of EchoVC Partners, has helped entrepreneurs navigate the first steps of starting a company and laying the right foundation early on.</p>
<p>Omoigui advocates for founders to develop their own All-22 tape — a tool used by professional football coaches that allows the viewer to see all 22 players on the field at the same time. It improves a coach’s line of sight, and, most importantly, helps avoid missing a critical motion or player.</p>
<p>The concept of this tool can — and should — be applied in the startup world as well, Omoigui said during the virtual TC Early Stage event. He explained what it means to have an All-22 tape and the steps founders should take to develop a skill set that will allow them to see and understand the playbook from all sides.</p>

<p>This year at Early Stage, TechCrunch spoke with Zoom Chief Revenue Officer Ryan Azus about building an early-stage sales team.</p>
<p>Azus is perhaps best known for leading the video-calling giant’s income arm during COVID-19, but his experience building RingCentral’s North American sales organization from the ground up made him the perfect guest to chat with about building an early-stage sales team.</p>
<p>We asked him about when founders should step aside from leading their startup’s sales org, how to build a working sales culture, hiring diversely, how to pick customer segments and how to build a playbook.</p>

<p>Katie Moussouris has been in cybersecurity circles since some of the world’s biggest tech companies were startups, and helped to set up the first vulnerability disclosure and bug bounty programs.</p>
<p>Moussouris, who runs consultancy firm Luta Security, now advises companies and governments on how to talk to hackers and what they need to do to build and improve their vulnerability disclosure programs.</p>
<p>At TC Early Stage, Moussouris explained what startups should (and shouldn’t) do, and what priorities should come first.</p>

<p>Product-led growth is all the rage in the Valley these days, and we had two leading thinkers discuss how to incorporate it into a startup at TechCrunch Early Stage 2021.</p>
<p>Tope Awotona is the CEO and founder of Calendly, which bootstrapped for much of its existence before raising $350 million at a $3 billion valuation from OpenView and Iconiq. And on the other side of that table (and this interview) sat Blake Bartlett, a partner at OpenView who has been leading enterprise deals based around the principles of efficient growth.</p>
<p>The two talked about bootstrapping and product-led growth, expanding internationally, when to bootstrap and when to fundraise, and how VCs approach a profitable company (carefully, and with a big stick). Oh, and how to spend $350 million.</p>

<p>Viewed from the outside, board selection and corporate governance can seem like a bit of a black box — particularly at a startup.</p>
<p>Generation Investment Management partner Dave Easton spoke at TechCrunch Early Stage about how to build a board as a founder, and, specifically, how to build a board you can live with. Easton’s experience serving on boards as both a full member and as an observer helped peel back the curtain on the murky topic of good governance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The planet-loving folks at the <a href="https://www.soalliance.org">Sustainable Ocean Alliance</a> started an accelerator a couple years back focusing on very early-stage companies, but this year they&#8217;re expanding the program to accept those that have already closed their first round. The mix of experimental and (comparatively) proven approaches may help diversify the accelerator&#8217;s growing network.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year, amidst the onset of a global pandemic and mounting urgency related to solving the ocean’s greatest challenges, we received unprecedented demand for the <a href="https://www.soalliance.org/ocean-solutions-accelerator/">Ocean Solutions Accelerator,</a>&#8221; said the accelerator&#8217;s co-founder, Craig Dudenhoeffer. &#8220;It became clear to us that now more than ever, ocean tech startups need powerful community support, mentorship and access to those unique opportunities that truly propel their businesses. We decided to double our efforts and run two accelerator cohorts in 2021 in order to support 21 incredible innovators.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/ocean-solutions-accelerators-third-wave-tackles-a-new-set-of-aquatic-challenges/">Last year&#8217;s cohort</a> included companies creating robotic fish, kelp-based foods, artificial reefs, aquaculture animal feed and other interesting and potentially breakthrough products. But one thing they all have in common with each other and those from previous years is they are nearly all <em>very</em> early stage.</p>

<p>Having a prototype and taking on a big problem or market is a great start, but it&#8217;s also where a lot of startups wash out. Companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/coral-vita-cultivates-2m-seed-to-take-its-reef-restoration-mission-global/">Coral Vita</a> have powered through repeated disasters (in their case hurricanes and of course the pandemic) to raise money and move toward scaling up.</p>
<p>But others in the sadly undervalued conservation space still have a long road ahead before VCs think it&#8217;s worth taking a risk on them. Few check writers will see the problems and potential solutions up close and personal and make a personal connection with the driven and occasionally idealistic young founders, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/in-the-accelerator-over-the-sea/">those that I saw do that in Alaska were convinced</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WzIA6hn81g"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/in-the-accelerator-over-the-sea/">In the Accelerator over the Sea</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This year the accelerator will have two sequential cohorts, an early-stage one in June for pre-seed companies and another in September for those that have raised a seed or A round and have &#8220;a strong MVP.&#8221; Applications for both are open until April 12th, with 21 spots available. That&#8217;s Monday, so better get to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;In expanding to two accelerator programs this year, we&#8217;re now able to provide highly curated content and tailored support to serve our entrepreneurs and meet them exactly where they&#8217;re at in their unique journeys to addressing our most critical ocean challenges,&#8221; said Dudenhoeffer.</p>
<p>While the organization is still small and the accelerator a relatively straightforward affair, the space that they are in is expanding and gaining credit among investors. Renewed attention and funding on climate change, ecological stewardship and alternative energy sources from the new Biden administration change the equations for startups and services in related industries; all of a sudden an idea that seemed wild a couple years ago makes perfect sense. With luck that means a bit of wind in the sails of entrepreneurs trying to save the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Efforts to unionize an Amazon warehouse in Alabama appear to have failed, Facebook takes down fake review groups and a monkey plays Pong with its brain. This is your Daily Crunch for April 9, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Amazon beats back union push</strong></p>
<p>Union organizers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/amazon-defeats-warehouse-union-push-challenges-expected/">lost a much-publicized election</a> at Amazon&#8217;s Bessemer, Alabama warehouse, with more than half of the 3,215 ballots cast ultimately voting against joining the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It’s easy to predict the union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that’s not true,&#8221; the company said in a blog post. &#8220;Our employees heard far more anti-Amazon messages from the union, policymakers, and media outlets than they heard from us. And Amazon didn’t win—our employees made the choice to vote against joining a union.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum suggested that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/rwdsu-head-says-rerun-election-very-likely-following-amazon-union-vote-loss/">there will &#8220;very likely&#8221; be a rerun election</a>, and his organization is demanding &#8220;a comprehensive investigation over Amazon’s behavior in corrupting this election.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ureeka founder Melissa Bradley explains how to prepare for a virtual pitch, allocate time, how to close meetings with a clear list of action items, and what to avoid.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Melissa Bradley wears many hats. She&#8217;s the co-founder of a startup called Ureeka, an investor at 1863 Ventures, and a professor at Georgetown&#8217;s business school. So it&#8217;s not an understatement to say that she understands the fundraising process from every angle. And moreover, she has both invested and fundraised for her own startup during this last year, where the landscape has shifted drastically. At TechCrunch Early Stage, she led a session on how to nail your virtual pitch meeting.</p>
<p>Bradley covered how to allocate your time during the meeting, how to prepare, how to close out the meetings with a clear list of action items, and what to avoid.</p>
<p>You can watch the session or check out the full transcript below, but I&#8217;ve also pulled out a few highlights from the talk just for you.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<h2>Conversation &gt; Pitching</h2>
<p>One of the greatest shifts in the pitch landscape during the pandemic was the nature of meetings themselves. Because investors and founders can take 30 meetings a day from the comfort of their home, it means that conversation has been prioritized over presentation. Adding to the need for conversation is the fact that investors aren&#8217;t &#8216;getting to know you&#8217; IRL as they would in the past, and so how you interact (not just the content of your pitch) is critically important.</p>
<p>Bradley explained that planning for extra time to answer questions and go deep on strategy is more important now than ever.</p>
<blockquote><p>Now is the time to really have a conversation and deeply engage the investor in your story and your vision. You want to be conversational in nature, but still formal in tone. So you want to be respectful; you want to avoid jargon; you want to make sure it&#8217;s clear what you&#8217;re talking about. But it&#8217;s really much more of a two-way conversation than we&#8217;ve probably seen before. I think again, pace yourself, be really clear in advance how much time you have. One-third of the time should be spent on your pitch, and the other two-thirds, you should be prepared to field questions and really have that conversation. Pace yourself. Don&#8217;t rush through. If you only have 30 minutes, it&#8217;s probably not the best time to do a demo. You might want to follow up with a recorded demo or make an offer to do a demo afterwards. <em><strong>(Timestamp &#8211; 6:03)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A batch of job listings along with some <a class="c-link" href="https://twitter.com/Shared_MM/status/1380118058149277696" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://twitter.com/Shared_MM/status/1380118058149277696" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Twitter whisperings</a> suggests that scooter companies such as Lime and Superpedestrian are gearing up to operate in London and New York City — two of the last remaining frontiers of shared-scooter services.</p>
<p>A review of job listings, company websites and LinkedIn shows that Lime and Dott are preparing to launch in London, while Lime, Superpedestrian and maybe even Spin are getting ready for New York. While the job posts don&#8217;t provide definitive proof that these companies have been awarded these coveted permits, it does identify which companies believe they will win.</p>
<p><a class="c-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/e-scooter-firms-get-the-green-light-to-start-trials-of-up-to-one-year-on-uk-streets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/e-scooter-firms-get-the-green-light-to-start-trials-of-up-to-one-year-on-uk-streets/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">London&#8217;s Department for Transport</a> and the NYC City Council approved their respective e-scooter pilots in the summer of 2020 as city dwellers sought socially distanced modes of travel. London’s pilot should have begun at the <a class="c-link" href="https://cities-today.com/london-set-for-uks-largest-e-scooter-trials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://cities-today.com/london-set-for-uks-largest-e-scooter-trials/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">start of 2021</a>, and <a class="c-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/the-scooter-battle-for-new-york-city-is-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/the-scooter-battle-for-new-york-city-is-on/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">NYC’s was originally meant to launch by March 1</a>, but neither city has even named which companies will be awarded concessions yet. Sources familiar with the dealings say London is holding up the announcement until after the mayoral race on May 6. The NYC Department of Transportation declined to comment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h3><b>Dott, Tier and Lime for London?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been speculation that Dott, Lime and maybe Tier will be sharing the streets of London once the pilot takes off. Information on Dott’s and Lime’s websites, LinkedIn profiles and hiring pages show that they&#8217;re hiring for positions in the city. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Sources in the industry told TechCrunch that Tier had a London-focused job posting listed on its page that has since been taken down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dott, which doesn’t already appear to have a footprint in the United Kingdom, is hiring a </span><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/dott/1e6c32b0-9d6d-48fc-b3f4-a35450badef5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.K.-based operations manager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to “set up operations from scratch within the U.K.” They’re also hiring a </span><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/dott/78ab7100-968b-425e-81c7-9db30ac85f27"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public policy manager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be the “voice for the Dott U.K. market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Dott&#8217;s website, a map showing service areas shows a little yellow flag over London. Clicking on the flag leads to a 404 “page not found” error page. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lime, a mobility company that appears to be swiftly taking over the world, already has a presence in London in the form of its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/03/lime-puts-jump-bikes-back-on-london-streets/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jump e-bikes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which made an appearance last summer. New job postings on LinkedIn suggests they&#8217;re preparing to expand. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ty0KRtyGNE"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/03/lime-puts-jump-bikes-back-on-london-streets/">Lime puts Jump bikes back on London streets</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lime puts Jump bikes back on London streets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/03/lime-puts-jump-bikes-back-on-london-streets/embed/#?secret=ty0KRtyGNE" data-secret="ty0KRtyGNE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s LinkedIn page reveals a call for a London-based </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2468099289/?refId=%2F4D1DeGAM%2By8FBOAHtY83w%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=Iu46GoQeCBTbKH0u65NHpg%3D%3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">general manager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whose responsibilities include building and implementing “the operational infrastructure to ensure market growth in the United Kingdom.” That gig was posted a week ago and they’re actively recruiting for it on LinkedIn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About a month ago, Lime also posted a London-based </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2364137536/?refId=%2F4D1DeGAM%2By8FBOAHtY83w%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=HKFaSrR3Lu9Vxr37yD23Yg%3D%3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">operations manager </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">role, for which it appears to still be recruiting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voi might also still be in the running based on its job postings on LinkedIn. On Thursday, the company added a call for an </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2495249822/?refId=iPEgNhvu8RWSo83rrvagLw%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=HH3H%2Bk7GnAOTXkBp9gKFeQ%3D%3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ambassador supervisor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a six-month position in London. It seems to be an on-the-ground sort of role, and the temporary nature of it could have something to do with London’s year-long pilot. It’s also possible the company is just looking for someone in a central city to manage the other U.K. cities where Voi operates.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird has already been in London’s Olympic Park since the summer, and it </span><a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/olympic-park-legalization-how-bird-brought-e-scooters-to-uk/#:~:text=You%20can%20ride%20Bird's%20e,of%20lobbying%20for%20legislative%20change"><span style="font-weight: 400;">actively lobbied for a change in London’s legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around scooters riding on roads or pavements. This presence could explain why Bird’s operating map highlights London, but to make matters more confusing, the company is hiring an </span><a href="https://www.bird.co/careers/?gh_jid=4258750003"><span style="font-weight: 400;">operations associate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ostensibly handle London city operations and general U.K. operations. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superpedestrian, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has four new job posts up between its website and LinkedIn. On the site, there’s a call for a </span><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/superpedestrian/88228461-304b-4ac0-9d84-b7eb0990b36d"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chief of staff who is ideally based in </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYC to support the CEO. Also listed is a </span><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/superpedestrian/9b94e33e-8fa6-48cc-afe6-fca8d3d933f2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">general manager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> position; duties include “being responsible for the growth and success of our scooter share in New York and New Jersey.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On LinkedIn, Superpedestrian has posted two positions based in NYC. The first, posted a week ago, is an </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2483019826/?refId=b4Z7U61diRhPUxiz9vlnaA%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=GDZHe%2FMrZ1Uti7TakXIkQw%3D%3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">operations associate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will handle things like scooter charging, safety inspections, deployment of scooters and scooter repair and assembly. The second is a </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2416394401/?refId=b4Z7U61diRhPUxiz9vlnaA%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=aqan4Jcv6XtRSJ9TclTeUQ%3D%3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scooter mechanic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, posted a month ago, but to be fair the post does include the caveat: “If we are awarded the privilege of operating in NYC…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin also posted (about a week ago) an </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2473930979/?refId=LILWlsW2LY6y82OAPBSdAQ%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=TLwut3hpFmcF77q54xx82A%3D%3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">operations lead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based in New York. The employee hired for the position will be tasked with “Spin’s day-to-day operations, managing drivers and mechanics and building a highly efficient operations team.” It’s not precisely indicative of the Ford-owned company winning NYC, but the job does appear to be involved with on-the-ground tasks. The post also hints that the new hire would be leading the build-out and deployment of Spin’s vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a huge presence in Europe but absolutely none in the United States as of yet, Voi has been hoping NYC would be its entry into the country. The company hasn’t posted any NYC-specific job ads, but its job board features a locations dropdown menu that includes NYC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, Bird is adding to the mess of guesses with two LinkedIn job posts based in New York. The </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2457588069/?refId=0S0DwtAk2i1eLYXaYYAQJA%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=KADK0VOiB%2F6YYHXJMc4yKQ%3D%3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">general manager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> position, posted four weeks ago but still actively recruiting, appears to require someone to be pretty locally involved. The </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2494000853/?refId=0S0DwtAk2i1eLYXaYYAQJA%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=gHjW6Ie6uSb7%2BkVFr%2FXcfQ%3D%3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">operations associate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> role, posted on Wednesday, is a bit more vague about whether the new hire would be on the ground in NYC or not. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://shorthand.com/">Shorthand</a>, the Australian startup behind a no-code platform that allows publishers and brands to create multimedia stories, has raised $10 million Australian (just under $8 million U.S.) from Fortitude Investment Partners.</p>
<p>CEO Ricky Robinson told me via email that this is Shorthand&#8217;s first institutional round of funding, and that the company has been profitable for the past two years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been lucky enough to grow to where we are today through an entirely inbound, organic model that leverages the beautiful content that our customers create in Shorthand to generate leads,&#8221; Robinson wrote. &#8220;But we&#8217;ve been testing other channels with some success and the time is right to ramp up those other marketing initiatives. That&#8217;s where we&#8217;ll be spending this funding, while also investing heavily in our product to keep Shorthand at the cutting edge of storytelling innovation for the web.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Those customers include the BBC, Dow Jones, the University of Cambridge, Nature, Manchester City FC and Peloton. For example, BBC News used Shorthand to create <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/extra/nxVbFidDbs/mission-jurassic">this story about searching for dinosaur fossils</a>.</p>
<p>The Shorthand website extols the virtues of &#8220;<a href="https://shorthand.com/features/scrollytelling">scrollytelling</a>,&#8221; where a reader can trigger interesting transitions and effects simply by scrolling through the story. Robinson suggested that this is a way to make stories feel interactive and engaging &#8220;without asking your audience to learn how to interact with it.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/kpOFXNR55wo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>As you can see in the demo video above, Shorthand offers a fairly straightforward drag-and-drop interface for adding different text and media elements, as well as effects. Robinson said that unlike other tools like Webflow and Ceros, Shorthand was designed to be used by editors and writers. And although Shorthand does support the use of themes and templates, he said that&#8217;s not enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need to provide flexibility without making writers get into the weeds of web design or making them use complicated design tools,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;The focus should be at the level of <em>story</em> design, not <em>web</em> design, and that’s really what sets Shorthand apart, and it&#8217;s why our customers are able to consistently produce highly engaging, award-winning content for their audiences.&#8221;</p>

<p>The company also says that demand has only increased during the pandemic, with usage quadrupling in the fourth quarter of 2020 and subscription revenue up 8.8% month-over-month in February of this year.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Open-source software gave birth to a slew of useful software in recent years. Many of the great technologies that we use today were born out of open-source development: Android, Firefox, VLC media player, MongoDB, Linux, Docker and Python, just to name a few, with many of these also developing into very successful for-profit companies.</p>
<p>While there are some dedicated open-source investors such as the Apache Software Foundation incubator and OSS Capital, the majority of open-source companies will raise from traditional venture capital firms.</p>
<p>Our team has raised from traditional venture capital firms like Speedinvest, open-source-specific firms like OSS, and even from more hybrid firms like OpenOcean, which was created by the founders and senior leadership teams at MariaDB and MySQL. These companies understandably have a significant but not exclusive open-source focus.</p>
<p>Our area of innovation is an open-source AutoML server that reduces model training complexity and brings machine learning to the source of the data. Ultimately, we feel democratizing machine learning has the potential to truly transform the modern business world. As such, we successfully raised $5 million in seed funding to help bring our vision to the current marketplace.</p>
<p>Here, we aim to provide insights and advice for open-source startups that hope to follow a similar path for securing funding, and also detail some of the important risks your team needs to consider when crafting a business model to attract investment.</p>
<h2>Strategies for acquiring open-source seed funding</h2>
<p>Obviously, venture capitalists find many open-source software initiatives to be worthy investments. However, they need to understand any inherent risks involved when successfully commercializing an innovative idea. Finding low-risk investments that lead to lucrative business opportunities remains an important goal for these firms.</p>
<p>In our experience, we found these risks fall into three major categories: market risk, execution risk, and founders’ risk. Explaining all three to potential investors in a concise manner helps dispel their fears. In the end, low-risk, high-reward scenarios obviously attract tangible interest from sources of venture capital.</p>
<p>Ultimately, investment companies want startups to generate enough revenue to reach a valuation exceeding $1 billion. While that number is likely to increase over time, it remains a good starting point for initial funding discussions with investors. Annual revenue of $100 million serves as a good benchmark for achieving that valuation level.</p>
<h2>Market risks in open-source initiatives</h2>
<p>Market risks for open-source organizations tend to be different when compared to traditional businesses seeking funding. Notably, investors in these traditional startups are taking a larger leap of faith.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">However the outcome of today’s vote count turned out, there was one thing we knew for certain: it wasn’t going to mark the end of the battle between Amazon and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. With voting having broken overwhelmingly in Amazon’s favor, the union was quick to challenge the results.</p>
<p>The RWDSU was quick to offer TechCrunch a statement from President Stuart Appelbaum after no votes broke the 50% threshold, noting, “We demand a comprehensive investigation over Amazon&#8217;s behavior in corrupting this election.”</p>
<p>Amazon, unsurprisingly, was quick to take a victory lap. In a blog post credited to “Amazon Staff,” the company writes:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Thank you to employees at our BHM1 fulfillment center in Alabama for participating in the election. There’s been a lot of noise over the past few months, and we’re glad that your collective voices were finally heard. In the end, less than 16% of the employees at BHM1 voted to join the RWDSU union. It’s easy to predict the union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that’s not true.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the company was quick to state that the election is “over,” the RWDSU is hopeful, both in terms of future organizing at the Bessemer warehouse and for what the movement will mean for unionizing efforts at Amazon, going forward.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AIQ7k0ThKS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/more-tech-workers-are-starting-to-unionize/">More tech workers are starting to unionize</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;More tech workers are starting to unionize&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/more-tech-workers-are-starting-to-unionize/embed/#?secret=AIQ7k0ThKS" data-secret="AIQ7k0ThKS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a press conference held earlier today, Appelbaum suggested that Amazon told workers that they would have to vote against the union if they wanted to keep their jobs.</p>
<p>“We believe a rerun election is going to be very likely,” the union president told media. “I think that if Amazon considers this a victory, they may want to reconsider it. At best, it’s a Pyrrhic victory. Look at what happened during this period. We exposed atrocious working conditions at Amazon for everybody to see.”</p>
<p>Appelbaum’s comments seem to refer, in part, to numerous reports of workers urinating in bottles over concerns about stringent quotas. In the midst of an aggressive social media campaign at the apparent behest of CEO Jeff Bezos, the company initially denied reports, before conceding they may apply to some drivers. Amazon was quick to deflect blame to broader industry issues, however.</p>
<p>“Amazon didn’t win—our employees made the choice to vote against joining a union,” the company added in its post. &#8220;Our employees are the heart and soul of Amazon, and we’ve always worked hard to listen to them, take their feedback, make continuous improvements, and invest heavily to offer great pay and benefits in a safe and inclusive workplace. We’re not perfect, but we’re proud of our team and what we offer, and will keep working to get better every day.”</p>
<p>A key part to the RWDSU’s challenge is a ballot box the company reportedly pressured the USPS to install, in defiance of a National Labor Relations Board ruling. Appelbaum said the box “creates the impression of surveillance.”</p>
<p>He added that the union has already been in communication with workers at other Amazon facilities, explaining, “We have already started talking to workers at other facilities, as well, before this election.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Amazon has offered the following statement about the ballot box, &#8220;We said from the beginning that we wanted all employees to vote and proposed many different options to try and make it easy. The RWDSU fought those at every turn and pushed for a mail-only election, which the NLRB&#8217;s own data showed would reduce turnout. This mailbox—which only the USPS had access to—was a simple, secure, and completely optional way to make it easy for employees to vote, no more and no less.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security researchers say APKPure, a widely popular app for installing older or discontinued Android apps from outside of Google&#8217;s app store, contained malicious adware that flooded the victim&#8217;s device with unwanted ads.</p>
<p>Kaspersky Lab <a href="https://securelist.com/apkpure-android-app-store-infected/101845/?/kaspersky/april8/index.html">said that</a> it alerted APKPure on Thursday that its most recent app version, 3.17.18, contained malicious code that siphoned off data from a victim&#8217;s device without their knowledge, and pushed ads to the device&#8217;s lock screen and in the background to generate fraudulent revenue for the adware operators.</p>
<p>But the researchers said that the malicious code had the capacity to download other malware, potentially putting affected victims at further risk.</p>
<p>The researchers said the APKPure developers likely introduced the malicious code, known as a software development kit or SDK, from an unverified source. APKPure removed the malicious code and pushed out a new version, 3.17.19, and the developers <a href="https://apkpure.com/apkpure/com.apkpure.aegon/versions">no longer list</a> the malicious version on its site.</p>
<p>APKPure was set up in 2014 to allow Android users access to a vast bank of Android apps and games, including old versions, as well as app versions from other regions that are no longer on Android&#8217;s official app store Google Play. It later launched an Android app, which also has to be installed outside Google Play, serving as its own app store to allow users to download older apps directly to their Android devices.</p>

<p>APKPure is ranked as <a href="https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/apkpure.com">one of the most popular sites</a> on the internet.</p>
<p>But security experts have long warned against installing apps outside of the official app stores as quality and security vary wildly as much of the Android malware requires <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/android-malware-system-update/">victims to install malicious apps</a> from outside the app store. Google scans all Android apps that make it into Google Play, but some have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/16/android-users-tricked-adware-apps/">slipped through the cracks</a> before.</p>
<p>TechCrunch contacted APKPure for comment but did not hear back.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Given the pandemic, huge changes are being wrought in tech events, something which used to be the lifeblood of the industry. Many a startup has pitched to win funding, and many a hackathon has formed teams that went on to greater things. It’s a sad fact that this era is over, at least until the pandemic has fully passed, but this could take some time. Two significant European events have now had to change in order to carry their brands into new realms.</p>
<p>European breakout success story <a href="http://Infobip.com">Infobip</a> (which has raised more than $200 million) was born out of Croatia. And so was the seminal developer conference <a href="https://shiftconf.co/">Shift</a>. With Infobip needing that engineering community, and Shift needing a more stable home in uncertain times, it seems only natural that Infobip would put developers front and center of their company strategy with the acquisition of Shift, and appointing its founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivanburazin/">Ivan Burazin</a> to the board as chief developer experience officer. Shift will now form the basis of Infobip’s all-new Developer Experience department.</p>
<p>As Burazin said: “The vision was always to become one of the largest developer conferences in the world, and also to strengthen Croatia’s connection to the world of software developers. So now with the backing of a unicorn and the freedom to keep working on independently, the vision seems to have finally become possible.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says Shift won’t disappear, but will now expand globally, first to the U.S. and then to Latin America and southeast Asia, initially in remote events.</p>
<p>Infobip CEO Silvio Kutić said: “Infobip is on a growth trajectory to expand rapidly into the B2C vertical, or more specifically Business-to-Developer (B2D) space. Having Ivan on board with his experience as the founder of Codeanywhere, a B2D SaaS company, and creator of Shift, the largest developer conference in the region, will be an asset to us going forward.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a key startup and founder/investor-oriented conference &#8220;Tech Open Air Berlin” is also changing.</p>
<p>Tech Open Air (TOA), was known for its technology and startup festival, which attracted upwards of 20,000 people in Berlin every summer, but it has now pivoted into a new brand: <a href="http://toaklub.com">TOA Klub</a>. This will now be a “cohort-based learning and doing platform.” The four-six weeks of online programs will be aimed at helping professionals progress in the tech industry.</p>
<p>TOA Klub will offer Founders Klub (for founders learning to startup); Investors Klub (for newbie investors); Crypto Klub (a “crash course in the crypto field”); and Co-Creators Klub (for founders looking to pivot and grow).</p>
<p>The first confirmed mentors and speakers include Rolf Schrömgens (founder, Trivago), Dominik Richter (founder, HelloFresh) and Jeannette zu Fürstenberg (founding partner, La Famiglia VC).</p>
<p>Nikolas Woischnik, founder of TOA said: “The world will come out of this pandemic having digitally aged by decades, not years. The complexity of our business environment has greatly accelerated. At TOA this gives our long-time mission of &#8220;making people, organizations and the planet futureproof&#8221; ever more purpose. With the launch of Klub, it is time for us to leverage technology to deliver on our mission in a more impactful and accessible way.”</p>
<p>I for one am glad these greats brands have found new homes, because I know the brands and the founders both carry huge respect in the European startup scene.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bain Capital Ventures managing director Sarah Smith talks about how to ensure the critical early hires are the right ones to grow a business.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">From building out Facebook&#8217;s first office in Austin to putting together most of Quora&#8217;s team, Bain Capital Ventures managing director Sarah Smith has done a bit of everything when it comes to hiring. At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/">TechCrunch Early Stage</a>, she spoke about how to ensure the critical early hires are the right ones to grow a business. As an investor at Bain Capital Ventures, Smith has a broad view into the problems that companies face as they search for the right candidate to spur organizational success.</p>
<p>In our conversation, Smith touched on a number of issues such as who to hire and when, when to fire, and how to ensure diversity from the earliest days.</p>
<hr />
<h3>What to consider when you first think about hiring</h3>
<p>When a company is making its first hires — and then evolving into a bigger organization — the processes and needs may change, but the culture should be consistent from the beginning, according to Smith. From there, an emphasis on good early managers is critical.</p>
<blockquote><p>I would really encourage you to take some time to think about what kind of company you want to make first before you go out and start interviewing people. So that really is going to be about understanding and defining your culture. And then the second thing I&#8217;d be thinking about when you&#8217;re scaling from, you know, five people up to, you know, 50 and beyond is that managers really are the key to your success as a company. It&#8217;s hard to overstate how important managers, great managers, are to the success of your company.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;ll talk a little bit about how to think about that, as there&#8217;s a lot of questions around helping people grow into management for the first time. You, as a founder, might be managing people for the first time, so how to think about setting up the company for success.</p>

<h3>How do you build culture in the new remote environment?</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/joby-aviation/">Joby Aviation</a> founder JoeBen Bevirt has spent more than a decade developing an all-electric, vertical take-off and landing passenger aircraft — an effort that was largely shrouded in secrecy until January 2020 when the company announced a $590 million Series C round of funding that was led by Toyota Motor Corporation (that round later expanded to $620 million).</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The buzzy announcements continued with Joby&#8217;s acquisition of Uber Elevate and then culminated in February with its bid to become a publicly traded company through a merger with Reinvent Technology Partners, a special purpose acquisition company from well-known investor and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Zynga founder Mark Pincus.</p>
<p>Joby is just getting started. The company plans to use capital generated via its public listing to fund the launch of passenger service, which is expected to begin in 2024. And Joby still must complete certification of its aircraft and develop manufacturing facilities, but it is already on its way to achieving both. The company is also planning to begin construction on a 450,000-square-foot manufacturing facility, designed in conjunction with Toyota, later this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The upshot: Bevirt has a lot to share. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re excited to announced that Bevirt and Hoffman will join us on our virtual stage at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=hoffman&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=hoffman&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a>. The virtual event, which features the best and brightest minds in the world of mobility, will be held on June 9. Bevirt and Hoffman will discuss building a startup — and keeping it secret while raising funds — the future of flight and, of course, SPACs.</p>
<p>The pair will join other speakers TechCrunch has announced, a list that so far <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/investors-clara-brenner-quin-garcia-and-rachel-holt-are-coming-to-tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">includes investors</a> <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/clara-brenner" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Clara Brenner</strong></a> of Urban Innovation Fund, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/quin-garcia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Quin Garcia</strong></a> of Autotech Ventures and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/rachel-holt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Rachel Holt</strong></a> of Construct Capital, as well as Starship Technologies co-founder and CEO/CTO Ahti Heinla. Stay tuned for more announcements in the weeks leading up to the event.</p>
<p>&#8220;We approach it (SPACs) as venture capital at scale,&#8221; Hoffman told TechCrunch in a February interview. So it&#8217;s not a &#8216;this-year thing,&#8217; it&#8217;s a next three years, next five years, next 10 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yes, Hoffman believes SPACs are here to stay. Although we plan to check in on his stance in June. &#8220;I think that it&#8217;s valuable to the market and valuable to society to have multiple, different paths by which companies can go public,&#8221; Hoffman said.</p>

<p>As for Bevirt, the move to go public marks Joby&#8217;s readiness to be more open with the rest of the world.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We think that this is a really exciting moment, where we stand on the threshold of really redefining mobility,&#8221; Bevirt said in a previous interview. &#8220;And we really want to bring the world along on our exciting journey. Previously, only a very exclusive set of investors has had access to be part of our journey, and it&#8217;s really exciting for us to be able to share that more broadly.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>We can’t wait to hear from Bevirt and Hoffman at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=hoffman&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=hoffman&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility</a> on June 9.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If we’ve said it once, we’ve said it 1,000 times. Startup Alley is ground zero for entrepreneurial opportunity. It’s where hundreds of savvy, exhibiting startups increase their brand recognition, connect with investors, grow their network, expand their customer base and garner invaluable media coverage.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleyplus&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> takes place on September 21-23, and we’ve added new features and experiences to help Startup Alley exhibitors make the most of the virtual expo area. Ready to make a minimal investment for maximum opportunity? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalley&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=TRUE">Buy a Startup Alley Pass for $199</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Play beat the clock:</strong> That super early-bird price remains in effect only until <strong>May 13 at 11:59 pm (PST).</strong> Get moving, and you’ll save $50.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here’s what’s new in Startup Alley this year, starting with yet another reason to get your exhibitor&#8217;s pass ASAP.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalley&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=">Startup Alley+</a>:</strong> TechCrunch will select 50 Startup Alley exhibitors to form an elite cohort. These founders receive — at no additional cost — access to a curated pre-Disrupt experience. You’ll compete in a pitch-off at Extra Crunch Live, attend a series of founder masterclasses and receive introductions to top early-stage investors. It’s specifically designed to provide more opportunities for exposure and growth before Disrupt even opens.</p>
<p>The timing matters because Startup Alley+ begins in July at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising</a> — and the cohort attends for free. If you want a crack at this opportunity, get your exhibitor pass now.</p>
<p><strong>The Startup Alley Crawl:</strong> Every tech category gets a dedicated, hour-long crawl. TechCrunch editors will select several startups from each category and interview the founders live from the Disrupt stage. We’ll list the specific times for each in the agenda closer to the event.</p>
<p><strong>From Startup Alley to Startup Battlefield:</strong> TechCrunch will award two stand-out startups a Startup Battlefield Wild Card. Those founders will get to compete in the thrilling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/">Startup Battlefield</a> for a chance to win $100,000.</p>
<p><strong>Everyone pitches:</strong> Every exhibiting startup is eligible for this opportunity. You’ll have two minutes to throw your best pitch across the plate and receive feedback from pitch-savvy TechCrunch staff. Talk about an opportunity to improve and impress. Your pitch session can have long-term benefits — as told to us by Jessica McLean, the director of Marketing and Communications at Infinite-Compute.</p>
<p>“Disrupt is a great avenue to network with potential investors. It carries a lot of street cred and talking about our CEO’s experience pitching in Startup Alley helps us make those connections and start important conversations.”</p>

<p>The two companies pledged to do more to tackle the insidious trade <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/facebook-and-ebay-pledge-to-do-more-to-tackle-trade-in-fake-reviews-after-pressure-from-uk-regulator/">last year</a>, after coming under further pressure from the regulator &#8212; which found that Facebook-owned Instagram was also a thriving hub of fake review trades.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook still full of groups trading fake reviews, says consumer group&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/06/facebook-still-full-of-groups-trading-fake-reviews-says-consumer-group/embed/#?secret=RKEZTgIZqm" data-secret="RKEZTgIZqm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The latest intervention by the CMA looks considerably more substantial than last year&#8217;s action &#8212; when Facebook removed a mere 188 groups and disabled 24 user accounts. Although it&#8217;s not clear how many accounts the tech giant has banned and/or suspended this time it has removed orders of magnitude more groups. (We&#8217;ve asked.)</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> We understand that the regulator has focused on the removal of groups trading misleading/fake reviews, rather than individual accounts &#8212; as banned or suspended users are able to create new profiles, whereas removing the group in which fake reviews are being traded is seen as a more effective way to impact and deter the activity.</p>
<p>Facebook was also contacted with questions but it did not answer what we asked directly, sending us this statement instead:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We have engaged extensively with the CMA to address this issue. Fraudulent and deceptive activity is not allowed on our platforms, including offering or trading fake reviews. Our safety and security teams are continually working to help prevent these practices.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Since the CMA has been raising the issue of fake review trading, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/06/facebook-still-full-of-groups-trading-fake-reviews-says-consumer-group/">Facebook has been repeatedly criticised</a> for not doing enough to clean up its platforms, plural.</p>
<p>Today the regulator said the social media giant has made further changes to the systems it uses for &#8220;identifying, removing and preventing the trading of fake and/or misleading reviews on its platforms to ensure it is fulfilling its previous commitments&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear why it&#8217;s taken Facebook well over a year &#8212; and a number of high profile interventions &#8212; to dial up action against the trade in fake reviews. But the company suggested that the resources it has available to tackle the problem had been strained as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated impacts, such as home working. (Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Facebook-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results/default.aspx">full year revenue</a> increased in 2020 but so too did its expenses.)</p>
<p>According to the CMA changes Facebook has made to its system for combating traders of fake reviews include:</p>
<ul>
<li>suspending or banning users who are repeatedly creating Facebook groups and Instagram profiles that promote, encourage or facilitate fake and misleading reviews</li>
<li>introducing new automated processes that will improve the detection and removal of this content</li>
<li>making it harder for people to use Facebook’s search tools to find fake and misleading review groups and profiles on Facebook and Instagram</li>
<li>putting in place dedicated processes to make sure that these changes continue to work effectively and stop the problems from reappearing</li>
</ul>
<p>Again it&#8217;s not clear why Facebook would not have already been suspending or banning repeat offenders &#8212; at least, not if it was actually taking good faith action to genuinely quash the problem, rather than seeing if it could get away with doing the bare minimum.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, essentially makes that point, saying: &#8220;Facebook has a duty to do all it can to stop the trading of such content on its platforms. After we intervened again, the company made significant changes &#8212; but it is disappointing it has taken them over a year to fix these issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue to keep a close eye on Facebook, including its Instagram business. Should we find it is failing to honour its commitments, we will not hesitate to take further action,&#8221; Coscelli added.</p>
<p>A quick search on Facebook&#8217;s platform for UK groups trading in fake reviews appears to return fewer obviously dubious results than when we&#8217;ve checked in on this problem in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/21/ebay-and-facebook-told-to-tackle-trade-in-fake-reviews/">2019</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/facebook-and-ebay-pledge-to-do-more-to-tackle-trade-in-fake-reviews-after-pressure-from-uk-regulator/">2020</a>. Although the results that were returned included a number of private groups so it was not immediately possible to verify what content is being solicited from members.</p>
<p>We did also find a number of Facebook groups offering Amazon reviews intended for other European markets, such as France and Spain (and in one public group aimed at Amazon Spain we found someone offering a &#8220;fee&#8221; via PayPal for a review; see below screengrab) &#8212; suggesting Facebook isn&#8217;t applying the same level of attention to tackling fake reviews that are being traded by users in markets where it&#8217;s faced fewer regulatory pokes than it has in the UK.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cleocap.com/">Cleo Capital</a>, a venture capital firm founded in 2018 by <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahkunst">Sarah Kunst</a>, is raising up to $20 million for its second fund, according to a source familiar with the matter. <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1855059/000185505921000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">A recent SEC filing</a> shows that Cleo Capital has already raised $6.7 million of that goal, bringing total assets under management to around $10 million. Kunst was unable to comment on her fundraising efforts.</p>
<p>That new AUM number is close to what Cleo Capital initially set out to do. When Kunst first launched her firm, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/28/cleo-capital-sets-10m-target-to-fund-female-entrepreneurs/">she targeted a $10 million close.</a> She ended up closing $3.14 million of that goal, and now, she’s back to double down.</p>
<p>Fund II’s $20 million target, if closed, would allow Cleo Capital, which invests in primarily pre-seed companies, to start leading rounds. The firm has already been writing $1 million checks and targets about a 15-20% ownership in its rounds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“One of the reasons why we are a pre-seed fund is because in seed, especially late-seed, you have everyone from family offices to TikTok stars and rolling funds competing for hot rounds,” she said. “No one is competing in pre-seed.”</p>
<p>There are firms such as Precursor and Hustle Fund that back pre-seed companies, and cut checks around $100,000 and $25,000 to start, respectively. Kunst sees the ability to write a $1 million pre-seed check as a “huge advantage.” Usually early-stage founders without family money or deep networks have to spend a big chunk of time raising their first round. It’s a lot of time to spend fundraising and not building a company. If a firm can cut a big pre-seed check, she thinks that Cleo is “buying back six months of a company‘s runway,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/as-covid-19-era-drags-on-vcs-look-beyond-zoom-calls-for-due-diligence-and-sourcing/">Like many firms</a>, Cleo Capital has turned to creative measures to diversify deal flow in the era of Zoom investing and pandemic business. For example, Cleo Capital<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/cleo-capitals-sarah-kunst-launches-a-fellowship-for-laid-off-workers/"> launched a fellowship program</a> for laid-off workers during COVID-19 to promote entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Matt Pauker, a repeat founder who has sold companies to Coinbase and HP Enterprise, was one of the advisors of that program. Pauker has joined Cleo Capital as a general partner presumably to line up with the timing of Fund II.</p>
<p>While the firm has no racial or gender investment focus, about 92% of its current investments are companies started by underrepresented founders.</p>
<p>The firm’s portfolio includes Planet FWD, mmhmm, Lunch Club and StyleSeat. As for new opportunities, Kunst says that Cleo Capital is looking at anything that helps the individual turn into a collective. With the growth of the creator economy and solo-entrepreneurs, people need to figure out the future of income, healthcare and benefits, Kunst explained.</p>
<p>“All of these things are hard for people to do as an individual,” she said. The majority of Cleo Capital’s portfolio is based outside of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Cleo Capital&#8217;s raise comes just over a week after two venture capital firms founded by Black venture capitalists announced new funds, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/harlem-capital-fund-ii/">Harlem Capital</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/closing-on-103-million-mac-venture-capital-is-changing-the-face-of-venture-capital/">MaC Venture Capital.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Efforts to unionize Amazon’s Bessemer, Alabama warehouse were defeated by a wide margin in the second day of vote counting. More than half of the 3,215 votes cast broke in favor of the retailer. The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which would have served as the workers&#8217; union, had the vote passed, was quick to challenge the results.</p>
<p>RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum said in a statement offered to TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amazon has left no stone unturned in its efforts to gaslight its own employees. We won’t let Amazon’s lies, deception and illegal activities go unchallenged, which is why we are formally filing charges against all of the egregious and blatantly illegal actions taken by Amazon during the union vote. Amazon knew full well that unless they did everything they possibly could, even illegal activity, their workers would have continued supporting the union.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That’s why they required all their employees to attend lecture after lecture, filled with mistruths and lies, where workers had to listen to the company demand they oppose the union. That’s why they flooded the internet, the airwaves and social media with ads spreading misinformation. That’s why they brought in dozens of outsiders and union-busters to walk the floor of the warehouse. That’s why they bombarded people with signs throughout the facility and with text messages and calls at home. And that’s why they have been lying about union dues in a right to work state. Amazon’s conduct has been despicable.</p></blockquote>
<p>This initial defeat represents a large setback in the biggest unionization push in Amazon’s 27-year history. What might have represented a sea change for both the retail giant and blue-collar tech workers has, for now, been fairly soundly defeated.</p>
<p>Amazon has, of course, long insisted that it treats workers fairly, making such union efforts unnecessary. The company cites such standards as a $15 an hour minimum wage, a factor the company initial pushed back on, but ultimately instated after pressure from legislators.</p>
<p>It was a hard-fought battle on both sides. A number of legislators threw their weight behind unionization efforts, in an unlikely alliance that ranged from Bernie Sanders to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/marco-rubio-says-he-stands-with-amazon-warehouse-workers/">Marco Rubio</a>. The conservative Florida Senator noted the company&#8217;s “uniquely malicious corporate behavior.” President Joe Biden also sided with the workers, calling himself, “the most pro-union president you’ve ever seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company will no doubt tout the results as vindication. It noted in an early statement, &#8220;[O]ur employees are smart and know the truth—starting wages of $15 or more, health care from day one, and a safe and inclusive workplace. We encourage all of our employees to vote.”</p>
<p>In a blog post following the news, the company noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s easy to predict the union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that’s not true. Our employees heard far more anti-Amazon messages from the union, policymakers, and media outlets than they heard from us. And Amazon didn’t win—our employees made the choice to vote against joining a union. Our employees are the heart and soul of Amazon, and we’ve always worked hard to listen to them, take their feedback, make continuous improvements, and invest heavily to offer great pay and benefits in a safe and inclusive workplace. We’re not perfect, but we’re proud of our team and what we offer, and will keep working to get better every day.</p></blockquote>
<p>Among the expected challenges from the union are lingering questions around ballot boxes reportedly installed by the company in violation of labor board terms.&#8221;[E]ven though the NLRB definitively denied Amazon&#8217;s request for a drop box on the warehouse property, Amazon felt it was above the law and worked with the postal service anyway to install one,&#8221; the RWDSU writes. &#8220;They did this because it provided a clear ability to intimidate workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bessemer warehouse, which employees around 6,000 workers, was opened at the end of March 2020, as the company looked to expand the operation of its essential workers during the impending lockdown. The conversation has surface variously longstanding complaints around the company&#8217;s treatment of blue-collar workers, including numerous reports that employees urinate in water bottles in order to meet stringent performance standards.</p>
<p>The company initially denied these claims during a social media offensive, but later clarified its stance in an apology of sorts, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/03/amazon-addresses-pee-bottle-denial-tweet/">appearing to shift the blame</a> to wider industry problems. The company also ran anti-union ads on its subsidiary, Twitch, before the streaming platform pulled them, stating that they &#8220;should never have been allowed to run.&#8221;</p>
<p>All told, 3,215 ballots were cast, representing more than half of the workers at the Alabama warehouse. In spite of Amazon winning more than half the votes, counting will continue. Challenges are likely to stretch on for weeks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital mortgage lender Better.com has raised a $500 million round from Japanese investment conglomerate SoftBank that values the company at $6 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing is notable for a few reasons. For one, that new $6 billion valuation is up 50% from the $4 billion it was valued at last November when it raised $200 million in Series D financing. It’s also up tenfold from its $600 million valuation at the time of its </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/better-com-raises-160m-series-c-at-600m-valuation-to-speed-up-mortgage-lending/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Series C raise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, it’s further proof that mortgage &#8212; a traditionally “unsexy” industry that has long been in need of disruption &#8212; is officially hot. For all its controversy, when SoftBank invests, people pay attention.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic and historically low mortgage rates fueled acceleration in the online lending space in a way that no one could have anticipated. That, combined with the general fervor in venture funding, means it’s not a big surprise that Better.com has raised $700 million in just a matter of months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment brings Better.com’s total funding raised to over $900 million since its 2014 inception. Other backers include Goldman Sachs, Kleiner Perkins, American Express, Activant Capital and Citi, among others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-to-invest-500-million-in-mortgage-startup-better-11617899907">Wall Street Journal</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank is buying shares from Better’s existing investors, and agreed to give all of its voting rights to CEO and founder Vishal Garg “in a sign of its eagerness” to invest in the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a one-on-one interview at LendIt Fintech’s USA 2020 virtual event in October, Garg told me that an IPO was definitely in the works.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ll do it when it’s right,” he said. “One of the core tenets of American capitalism is the ability for your customers to buy your stock.”</span></p>
<p>And in February, Bloomberg reported that the startup had tapped Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp. for a planned initial public offering in the U.S. But there&#8217;s been no further word since. It&#8217;s not unusual for companies to raise large sums before an IPO. Affirm did it <a href="https://finledger.com/2020/11/18/affirm-drops-s-1-revealing-sharply-rising-revenue-on-a-narrower-net-loss/">last year</a>, for example.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also last October, Varg told me that before the pandemic, Better was processing about $1.2 billion a month in loans. But as of October 2020, it was funding over $2.5 billion per month, and had gone from 1,500 staffers to about 4,000 worldwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When the pandemic started we were doing less than sort of like $50 million a month of revenue,” he said at the time. “We’re two-and-a half times that now.”</span></p>
<p>Since then, those numbers have gone up even more. A company spokesperson told me today that Better.com funded $14 billion in loan volume in the first quarter of 2021 alone and that it is currently funding over $4 billions in loans a month. For some context, Better.com funded $25 billion in loan volume in all of 2020. And, it currently has 6,000 employees &#8212; up 2,000 from last October.</p>
