										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chile’s </span><a href="https://www.buk.cl/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has developed a human resources management platform for Latin American companies, announced today that it has raised $50 million in a Series A funding round that values the company at $417 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few notable things about this financing. For one, it represents one of the largest (if not the) largest Series A rounds raised by a Latin American startup to date. Secondly, it makes Buk the third most valuable startup in Chile after Cornershop and NotCo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, Brazil and increasingly as of late Mexico, have received the bulk of venture dollars from venture investors. But more and more, other regions in Latin America such as Chile are also attracting global investor interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also of note is that Buk was bootstrapped for the first five years of its SaaS operations. Its first institutional investors include San Francisco-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">based Greenoaks, which led the Series A round, and SoftBank. Interestingly, a group of founders from unicorns such as Rappi, Kavak, Konfio, GBM, Ualá and Brex also put money in the round.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why global investors are flocking to back Latin American startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/why-global-investors-are-flocking-to-back-latin-american-startups/embed/#?secret=Tkm4KOyK1m" data-secret="Tkm4KOyK1m" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2017 by Chileans Jaime Arrieta, Santiago Lira, Teresita Morán, Felipe Sateler and Ricardo Sateler, Buk is building a cloud-based platform that it says allows companies to manage their human resources </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">end to end” &#8212; from the payment of salaries to professional development. Buk also includes tools like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">company climate surveys, performance evaluations, recruitment modules and attendance monitoring </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the mission to &#8220;build a happier workplace&#8221;.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buk CEO Jaime Arrieta said the company has been growing organically, and has historically been financing its growth with revenues from its sales. While Arrieta declined to reveal hard revenue figures, he told TechCrunch that Buk saw its annual recurring revenue (ARR) increase by 151% in September compared to September of 2020.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have been able to double our size year over year [without institutional funding],” he said. “However, our</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">excellent results, differentiated offering, and the comprehensiveness of our product, which distinguishes us</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">from competitors, attracted funds like Greenoaks and SoftBank, who wanted to invest in Buk to boost our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">growth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Buk has</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over 4,000 clients that hail from a variety of industries in Latin America, including educational institutions, investment banks, fast food chains, law firms and others.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It powers payroll for over 400,000 employees of Buk customers every month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buk’s infrastructure is hosted on AWS servers, which means it is able to access multiple tools across its technological ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">performs daily backups of its customers&#8217; information, allowing it to keep the service running even in the event of third-party data failures. Buk says it also offers a “friendly” programming language that has many facilities &#8220;to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly develop functionalities.&#8221;  </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212493" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212493" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2212493 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sin-título-7506-e1633436896228.jpg" alt="Buk Series A" width="2000" height="1334" /><p id="caption-attachment-2212493" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Buk</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buk also has a social good component. As the COVID-19 pandemic raged last year, the company launched Buk Starter, a free digital remuneration </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tool for companies with up to 20 employees. Today, the tool is used by 4,000 SMEs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital primarily to accelerate its growth in Mexico, consolidate the market in Colombia and Peru (Where it expanded in 2019 and 2020), double down on technology and product development and toward the acquisition of new companies at the regional level. Buk recently acquired CTRL, an assistance company in Chile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next several years, the company also aims to increase its market share in each of the countries where </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it operates. In September alone, Buk says it grew 7% in Chile, 20% in Colombia, and 23% in Peru month-over-month</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buk has more than 300 employees, and says that 50% of the company’s workforce are women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenoaks has previously also backed the likes of Kavak, Discord, Robinhood, Stripe, Rippling and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toast. SoftBank has backed companies like Slack, Uber, Rappi, Alibaba, Didi, Flipkart and Bytedance.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;HR software is the core source of truth for a company&#8217;s employee data, underpinning critical functions </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">like payroll, benefits, and people management,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neil Mehta, founder and partner at Greenoaks, in a written statement. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But until now, businesses in Latin America have relied </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily on homegrown solutions that don’t scale or imported software that&#8217;s poorly tailored to local </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">needs. Buk is building an HRIS suite made in and for Latin America, enabling more efficient workflows </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">throughout the full employee lifecycle, from recruiting to off-boarding. We think the company is poised to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> build the region&#8217;s #1 HR technology platform.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/yubico/">Yubico</a>, the maker of hardware security keys, has unveiled the YubiKey Bio, its first key to support biometric authentication for passwordless logins and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/two-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication</a> (2FA)</p>
<p>The launch of the YubiKey Bio comes as tech giants transition away from traditional password-based logins, a prime target for cyberattacks. Microsoft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/microsoft-now-lets-you-sign-in-without-your-password/">recently rolled out a passwordless sign-in option</a> to all consumer accounts, and Google this year <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/a-simpler-and-safer-future-without-passwords/">announced plans to eventually eliminate the password</a>.</p>
<p>The YubiKey Bio — first teased almost two years ago at Microsoft Ignite in November 2019 — jumps on the passwordless bandwagon by embedding a built-in fingerprint reader to the key. Yubico describes this as the “next logical step” for the company, particularly as most modern laptops still don’t feature built-in biometric security.</p>
<p>Once a fingerprint is enrolled on the device, the data is stored in a secure element, while the biometric subsystem runs independently of the key’s core security functionality. All communication between the secure element and the rest of the key is encrypted to help thwart replay attacks.</p>
<p>“With the launch of the YubiKey Bio Series, we are proud to raise the standard for biometric security keys, enabling simple and strong passwordless authentication for our enterprise customers and everyday YubiKey users,” said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/fireside-chat-with-stina-ehrensvard-yubico-disrupt-berlin-2018/">Stina Ehrensvärd</a>, CEO and co-founder of Yubico.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211790" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211790" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2211790" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/YKBIOC-overhead-macbook-left-finger.jpg?w=680" alt="YubiKey Bio" width="900" height="663" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/YKBIOC-overhead-macbook-left-finger.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/YKBIOC-overhead-macbook-left-finger.jpg?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/YKBIOC-overhead-macbook-left-finger.jpg?resize=300,221 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/YKBIOC-overhead-macbook-left-finger.jpg?resize=768,566 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/YKBIOC-overhead-macbook-left-finger.jpg?resize=680,501 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/YKBIOC-overhead-macbook-left-finger.jpg?resize=1536,1132 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/YKBIOC-overhead-macbook-left-finger.jpg?resize=2048,1510 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/YKBIOC-overhead-macbook-left-finger.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211790" class="wp-caption-text">YubiKey Bio (Image: Yubico/supplied)</p></div></p>
<p>The company also notes that while no security system is foolproof, a hacker with a fake print would need to get their hands on the user’s physical device to take advantage of that print, which dramatically reduces the threat to the average YubiKey customer. Yubico will allow users to use their PINs to login in case biometric authentication does not work due to variables in skin texture related to moisture or temperature.</p>
<p>Like Yubico&#8217;s other hardware security keys, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/yubico-reveals-new-yubikey/">such as the YubiKey 5C NFC</a>, the YubiKey Bio is a plug-and-play device; it doesn&#8217;t require any batteries, drivers, or associated software, and it will work across macOS, Windows and Linux machines. YubiKeys also support open security and authentication standards — FIDO U2F, FIDO2, and WebAuthn protocols — so they work on Macs, iPhones, Windows PCs, and Android devices, as well as apps and services that support FIDO protocols out-of-the-box.</p>
<p>The YubiKey Bio is out now in both USB-A ($80) and USB-C ($85) versions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tortoise is expanding its remote controlled delivery robots to convenience store chains across the U.S. through a new two-year strategic partnership with King Retail Solutions (KRS), an Idaho-based retail brand strategy company with a national footprint. Under the agreement, KRS will resell and distribute more than 500 of Tortoise’s sidewalk delivery vehicles to help its convenience store customers offer affordable, same-day last-mile delivery options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent partnerships with</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/axlehire-to-scale-tortoise-and-urb-e-zero-emissions-delivery-solutions-nationally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last-mile logistics supplier AxelHire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, grocery chain Shoprite and convenience store brand Choice Market demonstrate a major shift toward robotic delivery for Tortoise, one that allows it to bring its robots into an increasing range of markets. The company was initially founded in 2019 to remotely rebalance shared scooters into parking bays or toward demand, but the drop in micromobility usage during the pandemic caused Tortoise to pivot aggressively to delivery, an industry that only continues to grow as more customers expect their goodies to arrive within hours of ordering. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="MLBsmDuFkc"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/axlehire-to-scale-tortoise-and-urb-e-zero-emissions-delivery-solutions-nationally/">AxleHire to scale Tortoise and URB-E zero-emissions delivery solutions nationally</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AxleHire to scale Tortoise and URB-E zero-emissions delivery solutions nationally&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/axlehire-to-scale-tortoise-and-urb-e-zero-emissions-delivery-solutions-nationally/embed/#?secret=MLBsmDuFkc" data-secret="MLBsmDuFkc" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everybody’s waking up to this new reality that same-day is the new normal, and it’s just not sustainable on every possible front to have that consumer expectation be met with people making $20 an hour doing those deliveries,” said Dmitry Shevelenko, CEO and founder of Tortoise. “The math just doesn’t work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Especially when the cost of delivery is offloaded onto the customer. Whole Foods Market online shoppers in six metropolitan markets </span><a href="https://www.supermarketnews.com/online-retail/whole-foods-go-chainwide-new-grocery-delivery-fee"><span style="font-weight: 400;">will soon be charged $9.95</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for same-day delivery, a perk that used to come free from parent company Amazon’s Prime membership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Two years ago, for the average grocery CEO, e-commerce was maybe the eighth thing on their priority list,” said Shevelenko. “Right now, it’s number one for everybody.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Convenience store delivery is becoming a growing sector alongside the on-demand food and grocery delivery markets. Between the first and last weeks of 2020, convenience store online spending grew 346%, according to a </span><a href="https://trends.edison.tech/research/convenience-store-delivery-sales.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report by Edison Trends</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a consumer insights analytics company.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KRS offers convenience chain customers a range of solutions, from convenience store management and self checkout POS to app development, business intelligence and omnichannel ordering. The company will buy Tortoise’s delivery robots outright at a cost of around $5,000 each. It will then lease units to customers, most likely as a bundled purchase with other services. Tortoise and its several dozen-strong army of independent contractors will still be the ones driving the robot routes and charging a monthly fee based on miles driven. </span></p>
<p>Tortoise&#8217;s vehicles are best for deliveries that are no more than three miles from the store, based on battery life, but can handle five-mile deliveries in a pinch. If a retailer does at least three deliveries of this length per day, they could easily pay back the cost of the monthly lease, <span style="font-weight: 400;">especially if they factor in the marketing benefit of a branded robot spreading the word about a store’s offerings, said Shevelenko. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The robots move at an average speed of four miles per hour, which means they can reach a delivery destination 1 mile away in less than 20 minutes, and can complete about eight to 10 deliveries during normal delivery hours. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tortoise supplies retail customers with flexible APIs and web portals so retailers can customize the ordering experience. Consumers hankering for a bag of Doritos and a tub of Ben &amp; Jerry’s from their local convenience store usually won’t be given the option at the point of sale of choosing robotic delivery. Instead, after making the purchase, the consumer will get a text asking them if they’d like their treats delivered via robot. If they reply affirmatively, they&#8217;d get text updates or updates in the retailer’s app as the robot’s on its way. A unique link sent via SMS unlocks the container, and prerecorded messages on the robot itself will let the customer know when it’s been unlocked so they can access their goods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The beauty of Tortoise’s business model is that it’s flexible enough to serve multiple different use cases, from urban to exurban, last-mile to middle-mile delivery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The logic of our system is all the same; you&#8217;re just telling us which robot and where to drive it to,” said Shevelenko. “We actually love these types of opportunities working with a platform customer that can get us into a lot of different types of communities.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more communities Tortoise can place its delivery robots in, the faster it can achieve its longer-term goal of truly autonomous delivery robots. Characteristic of all its deployments is a strategy of being in markets before they start to allow commercial autonomous vehicles so that Tortoise is there already when those markets inevitably do legalize self-driving vehicles. Meanwhile, access to different use cases allows Tortoise to continuously collect data it will need to train its AI. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need A LOT of local routing data to do autonomy, and teleops is the most effective way to aggregate it,” said Shevelenko. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[ModernLoop automates many of the repetitive tasks recruiters do while also scheduling and balancing the interviewing workload so the right mix of people are involved and trained.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Anyone looking for a job, even in the past decade, knows how difficult it can be or has been — applications going into a black hole of a CRM, no response and follow-ups or the process being drug out for months.</p>
<p>Lydia Han and Christopher Triolo started <a href="https://www.modernloop.io/">ModernLoop</a> in December 2020 after seeing the problem of technical recruiting firsthand. Han, who was a product manager at Slack, also worked at Brex the same time that her sister was a technical recruiter there and heard about the pain points. Meanwhile, Triolo came up with the idea for the “charitable donations” platform on Facebook. They saw recruitment as an industry that needed products and technology to work together to provide better user experiences.</p>
<p>“Once you get a candidate in the pipeline, you have to convince them to take the job,” CEO Han told TechCrunch. “This process is the first impression someone has of the company, so you have to move them along in the process, put them in front of the right interviewers and be prepared to deliver on the experience.”</p>
<p>Recruiters have traditionally kept track of the hiring process manually with spreadsheets, but ModernLoop automates many of the repetitive tasks while also scheduling and balancing the interviewing workload so that not only are the right people involved, but also a diverse mix of interviewers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2211838" style="width: 2570px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211838" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2211838 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ModernLoop_product_image_techcrunch.png" alt="ModernLoop" width="2560" height="1720" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ModernLoop_product_image_techcrunch.png 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ModernLoop_product_image_techcrunch.png?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ModernLoop_product_image_techcrunch.png?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ModernLoop_product_image_techcrunch.png?resize=768,516 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ModernLoop_product_image_techcrunch.png?resize=680,457 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ModernLoop_product_image_techcrunch.png?resize=1536,1032 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ModernLoop_product_image_techcrunch.png?resize=2048,1376 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ModernLoop_product_image_techcrunch.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211838" class="wp-caption-text">ModernLoop dashboard. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> ModernLoop</p></div></p>
<p>The platform also trains interviewers with a shadowing experience and facilitates communication and coordination via Slack so people on the company and candidate side have all of the information needed for the interview.</p>
<p>ModernLoop was part of the Y Combinator Winter 2021 cohort and announced it raised $3.3 million in funding, led by Accel, that included Webb Investment Network, some of Han’s former leaders at Brex and a Zoom product lead.</p>
<p>U.S. Department of Labor statistics estimate there is already a <a href="https://www.daxx.com/blog/development-trends/software-developer-shortage-us#The%20US%20Tech%20Talent%20Shortage%20Statistics%20in%202020">global talent labor shortage of 40 million workers</a>, and that number will grow to over 85 million by 2030. The hiring sector is continuing to attract entrepreneurs who honed their skills in big tech and now want to solve this problem.</p>
<p>ModernLoop’s approach is one of the latest to receive investor attention. For example, in the past month, recruiting platform Gem <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/recruiting-platform-gem-gains-unicorn-status-with-100m-raise-to-change-the-way-companies-hire/">raised $100 million</a> to value the company at over $1 billion. Its co-founders are from Dropbox and Facebook. CodeSignal, specializing in technical assessment, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/codesignal-secures-50m-for-its-tech-hiring-platform/">brought in $50 million</a> — one of its co-founders is from Google.</p>

<p>Amit Kumar, principal at Accel, also saw the hiring process up close when he was part of the hiring committee while at Twitter. Teams would interview candidates, aggregate the data and provide it to the people making the ultimate decisions.</p>
<p>He says recruiting operations is difficult enough, but the process became much more complicated during the global pandemic. ModernLoop has “real authenticity with the space, the scrappiness and an early response that was resounding.”</p>
<p>“I admired Lydia and encouraged her to start a company and pursue entrepreneurship,” he said. “No one has shown love to recruiting operations folks. I haven&#8217;t seen before the kind of early response she was getting with customers, and we were closing 80% of conversations with a bare-bones product.”</p>
<p>In fact, early on, Han reverse-emailed some of the recruiters who had reached out to her for positions to talk to them about the idea of ModernLoop and inquire if they would be interested in the product.</p>
<p>ModernLoop’s customer list now includes Benchling, Chainalysis, Ramp, Primer.ai and VSCO. In particular, since Chainalysis started working with ModernLoop in March, the company grew from 200 to over 300 employees, Han said.</p>
<p>Now that the company has a product and paying customers, the new funding will go toward building up a team of engineers and expanding the customer base.</p>
<p>“We ourselves were founded in the heart of the pandemic, and with companies going remote and staying remote, the interviewing experience also needs to be remote,” Han said. “Also, the better trained your interviewers are, the better your company will be.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The latest Surface Pro is packed with new goodness. The screen is new and the chassis is new. It runs the latest Intel chipset and finally supports Thunderbolt 4. The Surface Pro 8 even packs Windows 11, which brings a host of new features. The signature kickstand works better, and the optional keyboard is improved. The only thing missing is the MicroSDXC slot, which didn&#8217;t make the cut for this version.</p>
<p>The Surface Pro 8 is a major update from previous models, and yet it&#8217;s still familiar. Microsoft finally updated the exterior of the Surface Pro, and it was about time. The company introduced the Surface Pro in 2013 and the casing had hardly changed through seven generations of products. For the Surface Pro 8, Microsoft utilized the wonderful body of the Surface Pro X, which it introduced in 2020. And it&#8217;s fantastic. The Surface Pro 8 is better than ever.</p>
<p>I have no reservations saying this: The Surface Pro 8 is the best 2-in-1 yet. I love it. The portable is a joy to use and a great solution for those looking for a convertible Windows machine.</p>
<h1>Review</h1>
<p>The Surface Pro 8 is impressive. Pop open the Kickstand and Windows 11 springs to life. There&#8217;s hardly a delay. Everything is snappy to load and respond. From Lightroom to Factorio, the Surface Pro 8 is fast with its 11the gen Intel Core CPUs.</p>
<p>The screen is lovely and among the best I&#8217;ve seen in a mobile device. Sadly, not all buyers will experience the best of this screen as Windows buries the 120hz option deep in the Control Panel. I cannot report on HDR support; I couldn&#8217;t get it to work.</p>
<p>Windows seems like the weak link with the Surface Pro 8. Even in this new Windows 11 form, the operating system remains one of the Surface Pro&#8217;s downsides. Windows 11 has some odd, seemingly anti-user quirks that I&#8217;ve been slow to normalize. I&#8217;m not too fond of the new start menu, and all mobile-first functions like widgets are haphazardly added.</p>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>The Surface Pro 8 runs the latest Intel chips inside the lovely anodized aluminum case of the Surface Pro X released in 2020. Thanks to the new chassis, fingerprints no longer stick to the surface. Edges are rounded, and it&#8217;s a more refined hardware experience than past models. It&#8217;s is thicker and heavier than its predecessor by 2mm and 100 grams. When asked why a Microsoft representative responded, saying the company feels the upgraded cooling and larger battery are worth the slightly thicker build.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Surface Pro 8 packs the best screen in any portable. The screen is impressive in both picture quality and touchscreen capabilities. It&#8217;s bright and crisp, dense with pixels and clarity. The screen has a refresh rate of 120 Hz, though users must activate this feature in an advanced menu under Display settings. It&#8217;s supposed to support HDR, too, though that feature doesn&#8217;t seem available at the time of testing. The screen now supports adaptive color adjusting. The Surface Pro 8 slyly adjusts the color temperature to match ambient light.</p>
<p>The 11.3-inch screen has a resolution of 2880 x 1920 with 267 pixels per inch (PPI). For comparison, the latest iPad Pro sports an 11-inch screen that runs at 2388 x 1668 at 264 PPI.</p>
<p>The screen is a big part of the draw to this new surface Pro. It&#8217;s lovely and makes everything from Slack to Photoshop shine anew.</p>
<p>Using the touchscreen is seemingly better, too. The new screen (or maybe Windows 11) feels more smooth when using a stylus or finger. In addition, it&#8217;s a joy to touch the screen &#8212; I know that sounds over-the-top, but that&#8217;s how I feel.</p>
<p>Microsoft released a new version of the Surface Slim Pen. This second version features a redesigned tip and reduced latency along with haptic feedback. The Slim Pen 2 is fun: It can provide tactical feedback as different types of brushes. Using a brush feels different than using a smudging stump. When a pencil is selected, the Slim Pen 2 returns a scraping sensation. The applications have to support this feature (and a few do now), but the result is radically different from past experiences.</p>
<p>And the Surface Slim Pen 2 hides and charges in a clever spot on the keyboard hinge. But again, this isn&#8217;t a new feature to the Surface line. Microsoft debuted this with the Surface Pro X in 2020.</p>
<p>Inside, an 11th generation Intel Chip powers the Surface Pro 2, and the active cooling keeps the performance stable. This time around, the Surface Pro doesn&#8217;t seem to scale performance as aggressively as past models.</p>
<p>My test machine is a Core i7 with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. It uses Intel&#8217;s Iris X Graphics. This machine retails for $1,599 plus the cost of the keyboard (bundled with or without the Surface Slim Pen 2). This model is the least expensive option with the Core i7 CPU. Spend more money, and you&#8217;ll get a Surface with more storage and RAM. Price continues to climb to $2,599, which features 32GB of RAM with a 1TB SSD.</p>
<p>Gone are the USB-A ports of old. Instead, Microsoft finally brought USB-C to the Surface Pro line, and they&#8217;re the latest Thunderbolt 4 flavor. In this configuration, the Surface Pro 8 can power multiple 4k displays, connect to an external GPU, or use a host of other data-intensive accessories. The USB-C ports can also recharge the Surface Pro, though Microsoft would prefer its recharged using the proprietary Surface Connect port.</p>
<p>The MicroSDXC slot is gone but the SSD is now user replaceable. I&#8217;m sad Microsoft ditch the MicoSDXC slot. It was a major selling point over an iPad Pro. The SSD is hidden behind a panel under the kickstand. Poke it out, and the SDD is easily accessible and secured with just one screw. Swapping the SSD should take less than a minute.</p>
<h2>Battery life</h2>
<p>The Surface Pro 8 is an all-day portable. Though I&#8217;ve only had my test machine for less then a week, I used it constantly and only had to plug it in all night. And I&#8217;m not a Microsoft app person. I use Chrome, Slack, and Xoom instead of Edge and Teams. This is significant. When talking about battery life, Microsoft made it clear it optimized its apps to extend the battery life.</p>
<p>Microsoft says the Surface Pro 8 can get 18 hours of battery life, and I didn&#8217;t hit that number. On average, I saw about 10 hours of battery life from using Chrome, streaming YouTubeTV, and taking video calls.</p>
<p>The Surface Pro 8 features a new active cooling design, and it still gets hot to the touch. Because of the heat, I found it uncomfortable to use as a tablet when editing media. Lightroom runs like a champ but Photoshop causes the Surface Pro 8 to heat up to uncomfortable levels.</p>
<h2>Webcam</h2>
<p>The Surface Pro 8 has a lovely webcam, and it&#8217;s in the right spot. Microsoft threw a little shade at Apple over the placement, too. In the announcement event, a Microsoft spokesperson said with a smile, &#8220;And a front-facing camera, not on the side, but centered &#8212; right where it belongs.&#8221; For some reason, Apple continues to put the camera in the iPad on the shorter side of the screen. This means, when the tablet is in laptop mode and connected to a keyboard, the webcam is shifted to the side &#8212; it&#8217;s an odd webcam experience.</p>
<p>The front-facing camera looks excellent. It features 1080p video and 5mp stills with advanced controls for white balance, exposure, and all the rest.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a comparison with the Surface Pro 8 and iPad Pro (2020).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2212117" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0759.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0759.png 6977w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0759.png?resize=150,50 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0759.png?resize=300,100 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0759.png?resize=768,255 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0759.png?resize=680,226 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0759.png?resize=1536,510 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0759.png?resize=2048,680 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0759.png?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2>Quick note on Windows 11</h2>
<p>I use a PC for two things: Gaming and media editing. I&#8217;m writing this review on a Mac because that&#8217;s my work environment. Windows is not my daily jam, and Windows 11 is not enticing me to drop Mac OS.</p>
<p>The new start menu is offensive to the user. It takes up a considerable amount of space in the middle of the screen and lacks justification for its size. A large chunk of the new Start Menu is white space. Worse yet, the Start Menu can hardly be customized like previous versions.</p>
<p>I guess the rest of the new Windows experience is acceptable. To me, someone who only uses the top layer of Windows, this new system feels much like the older one.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t use widgets on Mac OS, and I doubt I&#8217;ll use them in Windows 11. Right now on my test machine, these widgets are not customizable. I can&#8217;t add widgets though I can customize the pre-installed widgets. They&#8217;re also slow to load and refresh.</p>
<p>Look for our deeper dive on Windows 11 from a daily user.</p>
<h2>Surface Pro 8 vs the iPad Pro</h2>
<p>The Surface Pro 8 and iPad Pro are radically different, yet share a lot of the same target market. Where the Surface Pro 8 runs a full desktop operating system, the iPad Pro runs a mobile, though robust, version of the software running the iPhone.</p>
<p>Both the Surface Pro and iPad Pro have wonderful screens and the touchscreen capabilities are equally impressive. The two styluses work similarly too. Though the new Surface Pen features haptic feedback, the latest Apple Pencil and iPad Pro are seemingly more precise and more enjoyable to use.</p>
<p>Picking between the two requires shoppers to look at their use cases. The Surface Pro 8 is a better desktop replacement device, but some users might be better off with a mobile operating system for some tasks.</p>
<p>I have some advice.</p>
<p>Buy the Surface Pro 8 if&#8230;<br />
&#8211; If you&#8217;re looking for a desktop replacement device, complete with the ability to run proprietary software<br />
&#8211; If you need a portable device to run Microsoft&#8217;s enterprise applications<br />
&#8211; If you like to game and streaming Xbox games satisfies that need.<br />
&#8211; If you need a full-size detachable keyboard.</p>
<p>Buy the iPad Pro if&#8230;<br />
&#8211; If you&#8217;re looking for a device to edit media with mainstream applications (Like Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom)<br />
&#8211; If you need a high-end portable to run Google&#8217;s G-Suite<br />
&#8211; If you using the basic functions and apps of Microsoft Office 365<br />
&#8211; If you enjoy mobile-first games like those found on smartphones</p>
<h2>Worth it?</h2>
<p>The Surface Pro has never looked better than this latest version. Several key features are missing at launch, but the potential is there. This is a lovely kit with a beautiful display and outstanding build quality. The new stylus is a welcomed upgrade, and Intel&#8217;s latest makes the computer more reliable with performance.</p>
<p>The Surface Pro line has always existed in a weird spot, but this version pushes it close to a mainstream option. In the past, the performance had been just slightly lacking, and the hardware was barely good enough. With the Surface Pro 8, the performance is finally acceptable and the hardware is beautiful. The Surface Pro 8 is the best Windows 2-in-1 available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senior care can be a sensitive topic as many older people find themselves in situations where they need care, but are not to the point where they need the kind of around-the-clock care provided by nursing homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many older people still want some independence and to retain their dignity as they age and lose the ability to do some of the more basic tasks they were used to handling on their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of those older people live alone, with their spouse or with other family members. And for those needing in-home care, navigating options can be overwhelming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seth Sternberg founded </span><a href="https://www.joinhonor.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honor Technology Inc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup focused on in-home care for older adults, after selling chat service Meebo to Google for about $100 million in 2012. Sternberg worked at Google for a couple of years before facing some care challenges with his own mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at&#8217;s what got me on this idea of ‘how do we help older adults’,” Sternberg recalls. “When you dive on how society cares for older adults, you discover it’s really disorganized, and really fractured. No one knows where to turn. So we founded this space of non medical home care.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today, San Francisco-based Honor has announced that it has raised $70 million in Series E funding and $300 million in debt financing, bringing its valuation to over $1.25 billion, which compares to a valuation of $810 million at the time of Honor’s $140 million Series D round of funding in October of 2020. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baillie Gifford led the equity financing, which brings Honor&#8217;s total equity raised to $325 million since its 2014 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding news comes just two months after Honor revealed it had acquired global home care provider Home Instead in a move that greatly expands its senior care network. It did not reveal the purchase price but in a joint press release issued at the time, Honor said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the combined organization “represents more than $2.1 billion in home care services revenue and affirms itself as the largest player in the projected $500 billion home care industry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers &#8212; including funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., Prosus Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Thrive Capital, FMZ Ventures, Rock Springs Capital, Lighthouse Capital Markets and TriplePoint Capital also put money in Honor’s latest funding round in addition to Home Instead founders Paul and Lori Hogan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perceptive Advisors led the debt financing with a “significant” commitment from Ares Management funds.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We chose to take on more debt as growth capital rather than equity,&#8221; Sternberg said. &#8220;Based on our performance, new size and scale, debt financing is cheaper than equity financing.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its Series D funding round in October of 2020, Honor says it has added hundreds more caregivers — dubbed “Care Pros” —and expanded its care delivery platform to four new states. Its August acquisition of Home Instead, a franchisor of personalized, in-home care services, means that Honor now serves over 100,000 older adults around the world every month, and will be providing more than 80 million hours of care annually, according to Sternberg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, the company’s care professionals go into the homes of older adults and help them with ADLs, or activities of daily living, such as bathing, getting dressed and feeding themselves. On average, they spend about 20 hours per week in a client’s home.</span></p>

Co-founders Cameron Ring, Sandy Jen, Monica Lo and Seth Sternberg (CEO), alongside Home Instead CEO Jeff Huber.</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Honor launched in 2015, it was soon after named a &#8220;best startup of the year&#8221; at Disrupt amid a time where “no one” had been applying technology to help older adults, Sternberg said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honor began with the goal of matching seniors with professionals who could take care of them in their homes while providing family members relevant information needed to help stay on top of their care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, the startup shifted its model so that the people providing the care were actual employees, and not just contractors, with benefits. By helping its care professionals feel taken care of themselves, the company hoped to foster more loyalty and continuity of care through decreased turnover.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to acquiring Home Instead, Honor was in select markets and launched into eight states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were going market by market,” Sternberg said. “With us acquiring Home Instead, we are now literally everywhere in the country.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to further invest in its technology and expand it across the Home Instead network. It also plans to triple the size of its engineering and product team within the next year, notes Honor co-founder and CTO Sandy Jen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a huge and highly fragmented market &#8212; estimated at over $80 billion annually, and $50 billion in the U.S. alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honor’s platform continues to match “the right caregivers with the right clients” based on a range of personalized factors. It also assists with caregiver recruiting, training, scheduling and performance analysis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technology improves as the company scales, according to Sternberg, learning from expanding data points to further optimize performance. This tech-enabled approach strengthens the relationships between professional caregivers and clients while streamlining business operations, centralizing care and reducing turnover &#8212; ultimately increasing the ability of Honor and Home Instead to meet rapidly growing demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, Honor started selling its operating system to other home health care agencies &#8212; which state they are “powered by Honor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investment researcher Anika Penn of Baillie Gifford believes that so much of the way home care is delivered invites misalignment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, she said, many traditional senior home care options are lacking in transparency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Customers traditionally</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t know what happens from visit to visit, caregivers</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">aren’t sure how many hours of work they will get, companies aren’t sure how many caregivers</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">they’ll have available in any given region,” noted Penn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also inefficiencies associated with maintaining paper records of visits or handling manual scheduling that increases lag times for processing, payments and scheduling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This adds to the anxiety for everyone involved,” she wrote via email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her firm invested in Honor because its technology and operations platform, combined with the reach they now have with the Home Instead network, “brings consistency, trust and excellence to an industry that desperately needs it,” Penn said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robinhood announced Tuesday that it will be bringing &#8220;24/7&#8221; phone support to its 31 million users. It&#8217;s a long overdue move for the stock and crypto trading company founded in 2013, but one that signals its maturation following a challenging year that brought the company its biggest crisis, a surge in trading volume and its own entry to public markets.</p>
<p>Users with a question or account issue will now be able to request a call inside the Robinhood app and receive a call back some time later from a support agent. Previously users had been pushed towards the option of messaging the company and escalating the issue through an email chain, while limited phone support had been offered for specific customer trading issues at certain hours of the day.</p>
<p>While Robinhood is certainly not the first trading firm to offer phone support for its users &#8212; the company has been criticized in the past for its limited customer support options &#8212; Robinhood crypto lead Christine Brown notes that it is the first crypto exchange to launch phone support, and hopes that the increased level of support with provide an added level of assurance for users plunging into crypto trading for the first time.</p>
<p>&#8220;By being the first to offer this service, I think we&#8217;re further reducing the barriers that a lot of our users might think of when they think of crypto trading,&#8221; Brown tells TechCrunch. &#8220;I think a lot of people today think that the crypto exchanges are very hard to onboard onto&#8230; and god forbid, you ever have an issue, email support &#8212; let alone phone support &#8212; is scarce.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scaling its support team to handle the phones for tens of millions of users has meant a hiring spree for Robinhood. Brown says they have tripled the size of the internal team and have also tapped a large number of contractors to handle phone support. Robinhood&#8217;s customer support army will be a &#8220;fairly even&#8221; split between internal Robinhood employees and contractors, Brown says. Users will be assigned to a particular agent based on the topic they&#8217;re calling about.</p>
<p>The company isn&#8217;t advertising any guarantees for the amount of time between sending a request and receiving a phone call from the company, acknowledging that certain market events may stress test their systems, but Brown says that generally their internal target is to call back a user within 30 minutes of making a request.</p>
<p>The structure of this flow will likely frustrate some users who might prefer a phone number they can call, and some key types of issues will clearly fall through the cracks including when a user is locked out of their account or having a major issue with the app. In a launch blog post, the company details they&#8217;re working on a solution to bring phone support for users locked out of their accounts, though that features rollout will be sometime in &#8220;the coming months.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Customer support workflows are made to be stress-tested, and Robinhood is certainly no stranger to the damaging effects and challenges of unexpected market frenzies.</p>
<p>The company took a major hit to its reputation earlier this year amid a meme stock trading surge that forced the company to cease or heavily limit trading of popular stocks like GameStop. At the time, some users felt they were seeing yet another example of a financial institution protecting the professional investor class, while it soon came to light that Robinhood was financially unprepared for the trading frenzy and was forced to raise emergency funding to keep up with investor demand. That incident highlighted some of the company&#8217;s strategic communication missteps but also showcased the limited support paths users had to speak with representatives from the company and have their questions answered in a timely manner.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Adaptive Shield, a Tel Aviv-based startup that automates the security of software-as-a-service (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/saas/">SaaS</a>) applications, has secured $30 million in Series A funding led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/insight-partners/">Insight Partners</a>.</p>
<p>The funding round, which also saw participation from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/okta-ventures/">Okta Ventures</a> and existing investor Vertex Ventures Israel, follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/adaptive-shield-raises-4m-for-its-saas-security-platform/">a $4 million seed round in 2019</a>. The company tells TechCrunch it will use this latest investment to further accelerate growth through product innovation and global expansion, as well as to build out its research and development, customer success, and sales teams.</p>
<p>Adaptive Shield, which already has customers among Fortune 500 companies, aims to put an end to costly data breaches caused by SaaS security configuration errors that can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/dow-jones-watchlist-leak/">expose corporate data</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/11/security-lapse-nasa-project-data-exposed/">government projects</a>. These errors are the second-largest cause of data breaches, according to the startup, and can leave organizations open to one-click corporate espionage, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a>, and exposure of their cloud data.</p>
<p>While many other security companies offer cloud security posture management (CSPM) tools that focus on the infrastructure layer, Adaptive Shield focuses on the cloud application layer. The company&#8217;s so-called SaaS Security Posture Management platform, or SSPM, looks for and fixes misconfigurations across SaaS platforms for all global settings and user privileges.</p>
<p>“Expecting security teams to stay on top of SaaS Security misconfigurations without a proper SSPM solution in place is like expecting a bodyguard to protect an invisible person,” said Adaptive Shield co-founder and chief executive Maor Bin, who previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/thoma-bravo-buys-cybersecurity-vendor-proofpoin-for-12-3b-in-cash/">led cloud research at Proofpoint</a>. “Deep visibility and continuous maintenance of SaaS security hygiene is crucial to keeping the company secure.”</p>
<p>The platform currently supports more than 50 SaaS applications including GitHub, Office 365, Salesforce, Slack, and Zoom, and Adaptive Shield tells TechCrunch it will expand this support to 150-200 applications by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>“With the average company using 80 SaaS applications, our extensive support is a major competitive advantage,” the startup says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The availability of data can paralyze a company and its effort to bring software-centric products and services to market. To solve this issue, two-year-old data startup <a href="https://www.rendered.ai/">Rendered.ai</a> is generating synthetic data for the satellite, medical, robotics and automotive industries.</p>
<p>At its most broad, synthetic data is manufactured rather than gathered from the real world. “When we use the term synthetic data what we really mean is engineered simulated datasets, and in particular, we focus on a physics-based simulation,” Rendered.ai CEO Nathan Kundtz explained in a recent interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Kundtz received his PhD in physics from Duke University and cut his teeth in the space industry, heading the satellite antenna developer Kymeta Corporation. After leaving that company, he started working with other small space companies, when he noticed what he called a “chicken and egg” problem.</p>
<p>For example, imagine a company develops a new kind of sensor for a satellite and is looking for funding to commercialize. The company would need to demonstrate to investors that the sensor could generate a useful insight. In order to generate these insights, the company would need to launch a constellation and start collecting a large amount of data.</p>
<p>“This lack of access to data was hindering artificial intelligence,” he said.</p>
<h2>Investor interest</h2>
<p>Rendered.ai’s approach to opening up that access has caught the attention of investors. The company has raised a $6 million seed round led by Space Capital, with participation from Tectonic Ventures, Congruent Ventures, Union Labs and Uncorrelated Ventures.</p>
<p>Using a physics-based approach distinguishes Rendered.ai from some of its competitors, which are using purely generative methods to create synthetic data. That means these competitors are taking an existing data set and engineering more of it. Generally, this is accomplished using generative adversarial networks (GANs), an AI technique that uses competing neural networks to simulate and refine synthetic data. According to Kundtz, that’s of limited utility to emerging industries, that often have very little or no data to start with.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are other factors that can affect a company’s ability to get data. It can be a costly, difficult and time-consuming process.  These issues get worse with non-RGB images, like those generated by synthetic aperture radar.</p>
<p>So how does physics solve this problem of generating new information? “We can introduce new information to the process of creating these algorithms through our knowledge of physics, through the equations that govern, for instance, how light interacts with things,” Kundtz said. “So we can simulate what things will look like under different scenarios and then use that to generate datasets.”</p>
<h2>A toolkit for developers</h2>
<p>Rendered.ai has developed a platform that includes a no-code configuration tool and APIs to let customers engineer and tweak the parameters on a data set, and a set of tools for dataset introspection and data analysis. The company also provides some starter code for specific applications that customers are interested in, like satellite imagery. The company calls this Platform as a Service.</p>
<p>While a Rendered.ai customer does need a certain amount of expertise to use the system, Kundtz said that amount is decreasing each day; some of the funding is going to go toward continuing to lower to skill set required to use the platform.</p>
<p>“What we&#8217;re pushing towards is, anybody who can click a button in a browser can generate synthetic data, and not just synthetic data but can really control the types of synthetic data that they want and can introduce that into the rest of a machine learning workflow.”</p>
<p>But you don’t know what you don’t know — a company wouldn’t necessarily know in advance the parameters needed to make a synthetic dataset effective or an algorithm functioning. Rendered.ai takes an iterative approach, and emphasizes the interactivity of its platform as a way for customers to identify the gaps in its algorithm or better understand its blind spots.</p>
<p>Kundtz says he doesn’t think synthetic data will completely replace real-world data, but that it will come to play an increasingly important gap for artificial intelligence applications. It also has the potential to take even a smidge of power from companies like Google, which have proprietary access to trillions of images and mountains of datasets.</p>
<p>Rendered.ai has already brought a handful of customers onto its platform but it’s still essentially in beta, so the funding is going to be used to expand access to the platform as well as investing in particular types of data for specific verticals.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[ZAX's  platform unites freight, delivery and payments tools to connect sellers and buyers in Brazil.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Keeping a small sales business afloat in Latin America can involve long bus trips to find new products, lack of working capital and payment difficulties. These inefficiencies then trickle up to wholesalers who then have to raise costs and deadlines for deliveries.</p>
<p>This caught the attention of second-time entrepreneurs Bruno Ballardie and Fernando Zanatta, who started <a href="https://www.zaxapp.com.br/">ZAX</a> in 2019 to develop a platform that unites freight, delivery and payments tools to connect sellers and buyers in Brazil.</p>
<p>Prior to starting ZAX, CEO Ballardie was founder of eÓtica, a glasses e-commerce company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/23/brazils-26-billion-eyewear-industry-moves-online-with-lema21-and-eotica-merger/">merged with Lema21 in 2018</a>. CTO Zanatta was founder of Netlolo, a tool that connected clients with global experts, and was also previously CTO for Dafiti and COO for Buscapé.</p>
<p>They saw a direct-to-consumer market that was becoming huge thanks to technology and innovation, but a wholesale sector that wasn’t seeing the same kind of growth. Many people traveled to city centers like São Paulo to buy inventory, but were using pen and paper to write orders and WhatsApp to transact.</p>
<p>“We saw a huge opportunity to help people make a great business,” Ballardie told TechCrunch. “The market was lagging — there is only 7% of e-commerce penetration, and in the wholesale sector, it is 1% or lower. All of the area was underdeveloped in terms of logistics, payments and products discovery, so we created a tool for that.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>ZAX’s addressable market for B2B transactions, just in Brazil, is estimated to be BRL 2.4 trillion, or $445.6 billion, Ballardie said. ZAX’s platform was initially a clothing wholesale, but has expanded to shoes, electronics, toys, accessories and beauty items. Buyers come on the platform, choose their products, then the method of shipment and the form of payment.</p>
<p>Today, ZAX raised $6 million in Series A funding in a round that was led by Atlantico and included FJ Labs, Caravela Capital, GFC and Canary, which led ZAX’s first two investment rounds. The new capital brings the company’s total funding to $8.3 million.</p>
<p>“ZAX has shown a great execution in a very short period,” said Julio Vasconcellos, Atlantico’s managing partner, in a written statement. “They have a lot of potential to help sellers and buyers not only in Brazil, but throughout Latin America, where wholesale and retail can grow a lot by using more technology.”</p>
<p>ZAX is working with over 700 suppliers — an increase from 100 prior to the pandemic — and since March 2020, its revenue has grown 10 times, Ballardie said. It has a team of 40 employees and has more than 50,000 buyers using the platform.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to expand into two more regions in Brazil and add to its product lines in the beauty products and accessories categories. Ballardie also wants to hire additional technology and product development staff.</p>
<p>Next up, ZAX is investing in financial services, piloting some buy now, pay later initiatives and integrating financial partners to provide working capital for customers. The company now offers a 30-day line of capital and point-of-sale system and will follow up with a digital wallet and other payment tools in the future.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This is the third in a quick succession of funding that Orca Security received in the past 12 months.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://orca.security/">Orca Security</a>, an Israeli security company offering an agent-less platform for protecting cloud-based assets, secured a $550 million extension to the Series C funding round it raised seven months ago.</p>
<p>The initial <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/orca-security-raises-210m-series-c-at-a-unicorn-valuation/">$210 million round</a> brought the company’s valuation to over $1 billion, and the latest round boosts the valuation by 50% to $1.8 billion, Avi Shua, co-founder and CEO told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Temasek led the round and was joined by strategic investors SAIC and Splunk Ventures. The initial C round was led by CapitalG and included Redpoint Ventures, GGV, ICONIQ Capital, Lone Pine Capital, Stripes, Adams Street Partners, Willoughby Capital and Harmony Partners.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PmDLgXI1S9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/orca-security-raises-210m-series-c-at-a-unicorn-valuation/">Orca Security raises $210M Series C at a unicorn valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Orca Security raises $210M Series C at a unicorn valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/orca-security-raises-210m-series-c-at-a-unicorn-valuation/embed/#?secret=PmDLgXI1S9" data-secret="PmDLgXI1S9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The extension is in line with the quick rounds Orca Security racked up over the past year. The company raised a $55 million Series B round last December, which followed a $20.5 million Series A round prior to that in May.</p>
<p>Since the Series C earlier this year, the company was busy building a new platform that will move the security environment to the cloud in minutes instead of months, Shua said.</p>
<p>“It’s like an MRI for the cloud,” he added. “Once you connect to the cloud environment, you can get a comprehensive view of the risks without any friction.”</p>
<p>As companies have moved to digital over the past two years, organizations were pushed to deliver features and capabilities in the digital space and couldn’t wait. This led to increased adoption of the cloud and security solutions. For Orca Security, this translated into “booming” growth, Shua said. The company has more than 200 people and grew revenue by 800%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After closing the Series C, Shua received interest from additional investors wanting to partner with the company, and some of the names stood out to him as partners that could help the company accelerate.</p>
<p>“Temasek is a world-known investor and with strategic partners like Splunk and SAIC, we can go further,” he added. “We were not desperate for cash, but did want to position ourselves for the growth we were experiencing.”</p>
<p>He intends to deploy the new funding into three areas: engineering to continue to deliver more functionality, to extend its global reach and on go-to-market.</p>
<p>In support of both the global growth and go-to-market, Orca Security also announced Tuesday that it hired Meghan Marks as chief marketing officer. Previously, Marks was CMO for Palo Alto Network’s Prisma Cloud business unit.</p>
<p>Orca Security is operating in over 15 countries today and recently launched versions of its website in German, French, Chinese and Japanese. It will expand its footprint in the U.K., where it is opening an office and R&amp;D center in London, as well as across the EMEA and APAC regions. It plans to staff the new London office with two dozen employees by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Shua sees the cloud continuing to move fast, and he expects <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210805005670/en/Global-Cloud-Security-Market-2021-to-2026---by-Application-Security-Type-Service-Model-Deployment-Organization-Size-Industry-Vertical-and-Geography---ResearchAndMarkets.com">cloud security</a> to be the next trillion-dollar market over the next five years.</p>
<p>“Orca Security is positioned to be a leader in the market, and we are focused on technology that no one else has,” he added. “We are living in a fragile world, and there are usually no negative aspects to cyber. If you fail, you just try again in the next few minutes, which makes it harder to control. This is the reason the cyber market is growing. What we deploy can be used to protect the environment.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://dualitytech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Duality</a>, a startup founded by groundbreaking cryptographers and data scientists that is building tools to make it easier for companies to share data and collaborate with each other without compromising sensitive information, has raised some funding on the back of some significant early deals, including a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense.</p>
<p>The startup, which uses homomorphic encryption &#8212; a relatively new technique that lets companies analyze and use encrypted data without needing to decrypt it &#8212; to build more privacy-centric, secure collaboration tools, has raised $30 million, in a Series B that includes a number of strategic investors. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">LG Technology Ventures is leading the round, with Euclidean Capital and the National Bank of Canada&#8217;s corporate venture capital arm NAventures also participating, along with previous backers Intel Capital (which </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/30/duality-cybersecurity-16-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led Duality&#8217;s Series A</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">), Hearst Ventures and Team8. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Duality is not disclosing its valuation and it has raised around $49 million to date. <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/234579-61/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook notes</a> that its valuation in this Series B would be $145 million although it doesn&#8217;t have the full value of this Series B so that may be different.</span></p>
<p>CEO Alon Kaufman &#8212; who co-founded the company with a team of other data scientists, mathematicians and engineers including Shafi Goldwasser (who won a Turing Award for her groundbreaking work in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldwasser%E2%80%93Micali_cryptosystem">cryptographic algorithms</a> that form the basis of homomorphic encryption), Rina Shainski, Vinod Vaikuntanathan and Kurt Rohloff &#8212; said in an interview that the plan will be to continue in its efforts to build more secure collaboration tools.</p>
<p>When it comes to commercialization, homomorphic encryption (HE) is still in its early days, and so the startup will be using the funds to further work on how to scale and productize the technology, to make it something more usable by all kinds of enterprise customers, as well as to continue with its R&amp;D efforts, both independently and in partnership with other vendors, which include its strategic backers, but also others like Oracle.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s clear to us that we can&#8217;t expect customers using our product to be experts in homomorphic encryption,&#8221; Kaufman said. This is one reason why it&#8217;s working on deals to integrate the technology into other systems that the customers might typically use, such as products like Oracle&#8217;s or IBM&#8217;s. &#8220;That means that any fraud analyst can click a mouse buttons and not care what runs behind the scenes. The heavy lifting is done by Duality.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;">There are a number of other companies also working on ways to apply homomorphic encryption into enterprise networking: they include <a href="https://www.enveil.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enveil</a>, backed by the CIA&#8217;s investment arm; IBM and Paris-based <a href="https://zama.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zama</a>. (And there are others like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/evervaults-encryption-as-a-service-is-now-open-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evervault</a> that are creating alternatives that do not use HE.)</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;">One important piece of traction for Duality is that it&#8217;s</span> already found some interesting customers. Earlier this year, Duality <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/duality-scores-14m-darpa-contract-for-hardware-accelerated-homomorphic-encryption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a $14.5 million deal with DARPA to work on new hardware, in collaboration with third parties, that can better handle the resource-intensive demands of homomorphic encryption processes.</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;">Alongside the DARPA deal, Duality is building and selling tools that blend HE with other data science techniques &#8212; which it sells under the name Duality SecurePlus &#8212; the idea being that HE is used for the most sensitive data, while other tools are applied in other places. Other customers of the startup include organizations in areas like financial services, healthcare and government.</span></p>
<p>Duality&#8217;s technology addresses a fundamental paradox in the world of big data.</p>
<p>On the positive side, data collaboration holds a lot of promise for the enterprise world. Used intelligently, having as wide a pool of data as possible from multiple sources can help organizations with breakthrough medical insights, training artificial intelligence models, tracking fraud or security issues, gaining a better understanding of consumer behavior, and more. And in some cases, it&#8217;s an essential component of how things work: not a business choice, but a must.</p>
<p>But on the negative side, all that silver lining also comes with a big cloud. Organizations run the risk of unintended or malicious data leaks; and in proprietary situations, a business might like the net products of sharing data with would-be competitors, but not the idea of sharing its IP or valuable customer information.</p>
<p>Data breaches and other cybersecurity issues are occurring these days with increasing frequency while data protection regulations and consumer expectations are getting ever stricter, and so grows the need for better tools to handle how data is used.</p>
<p class="p4">That is one reason why Duality has attracted the attention of so many strategic backers.</p>
<p class="p4">LG is an interesting investor in this regard. Duality is headquartered in New Jersey, but it has its roots in Israel, a country where LG has been getting increasingly active as it ramps up its presence in cybersecurity and applications of it in specific markets like automotive. Just the other week, it made its first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/lg-is-acquiring-automotive-cybersecurity-startup-cybellum-in-a-240m-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisition in Israel, buying Cybellum</a>, a specialist in connected-car cybersecurity.</p>
<p class="p4">“As privacy challenges mount in our data-driven world, Duality has established itself as a market leader in the swiftly developing privacy tech space,” said Taejoon Park, Managing Director, LG Technology Ventures, in a statement. “Demand for collaborative and secure computing techniques is skyrocketing – including privacy-preserving AI and Machine Learning analytics – and will continue to do so as businesses look to unlock their treasure chests of data while staying on the right side of increasingly complex privacy regulations. Duality is ideally positioned to lead the applications of privacy-enhanced computing in numerous industries through this period of rapid change, and I am excited to see the company expand its highly innovative solutions to even more fields.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Middle%20East%20and%20Africa/Africas%20insurance%20market%20is%20set%20for%20takeoff/SVGZ-AfricaInsurance-Ex1.svgz">penetration rate for insurance</a> in Africa is between 3% to 5%. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Africa makes up a large bulk of it; without it, the continent is on a 1% to 2% rate even with other developed technology and financial markets like Kenya, Nigeria and Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The insurance market is still one of the industries least disrupted by technology on the continent. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reasons vary, from bad experiences and poor satisfaction on the part of consumers to high distribution costs for providers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, some startups such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/kenyas-lami-raises-1-8m-to-scale-api-insurance-platform-across-africa/">Lami</a>, Ctrl and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/naspers-leads-11m-investment-in-south-african-insurtech-naked/">Naked</a> have sought to take on each regional market by storm, armed with the necessary capital to scale. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Y Combinator Summer 2021 graduate <a href="https://www.amenli.com/">Amenli</a> is taking its operations up north and is announcing a $2.3 million seed round to provide insurance services for Egyptians</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of local and foreign firms invested in the round &#8212; co-lead investors P1 Ventures, GFC, and Anim Fund (Founders Fund scout fund), with Costanoa VC, Liquid2 Ventures, Cliff Angels and other angel investors participating</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shady-el-tohfa-13023258">Shady El Tohfa</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adham-nauman-a6882ba3">Adham Nauman</a> in 2020, Amenli addresses a $2 billion untapped insurance market in Egypt. But it was a series of personal experiences that prompted CEO El Tohfa to look into the opportunities in the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Tohfa recounts two stories where his friends lost their fathers. While the said loss </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">negatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> affected the welfare of his first friend and that of his family because of unpaid medical bills,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it was different for the other friend who claimed that having insurance helped his family escape </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial difficulties</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> despite his father&#8217;s expensive treatments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those two accounts, alongside Nauman&#8217;s newfound knowledge that an average Egyptian could have insurance without being an employee and the Egyptian pounds&#8217; devaluation in 2016, shaped how the founders understood the importance of insurance in Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The traditional way insurance works in Egypt is in this manner: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An insurance company partners with banks to sell insurance to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mostly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> big-spending customers with high credit limits (as they are the most lucrative)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And these providers focus on the B2B market because they lack the tools to access the mass retail market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this segment is a middle-income pool of about 50 million adults; that&#8217;s the market Amenli is after, El Tohfa says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if anyone from this segment seeks to get insurance, it can take three to six weeks to buy a single policy from an insurance provider</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. El Tohfa says the reason is that insurance companies do not prioritize individuals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The cost of serving is very high and the economics </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> do not work for them,&#8221; he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Amenli wants to make it work. When users log onto its platform, they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are asked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to answer a few questions, and the answers provided determine what insurance plans &#8212; life, medical or motor &#8212; to recommend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before launch, Amenli would meet insurance companies to strike some partnerships to provide consumers immediate quotations around different types of policies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it was difficult to achieve, CTO Nauman said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We got struck by the fact that most of the companies didn&#8217;t actually have the capabilities to give APIs or to give us documentation to integrate.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, Amenli has gathered its legacy calculations, configured a model to serve these quotations </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">instantly and built its own infrastructure</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also provides APIs to other insurance companies banking on its position as the first licensed digital insurance broker in Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Life after YC has been great for Amenli. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without sharing specifics, El Tohfa says the company has tripled its revenue since graduating from the accelerator</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While policies sold also increased, customers didn&#8217;t grow as much since they are mostly repeat customers who use </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> policies at once, the CEO said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform issues more than 500 policies in less than 10 mins compared to the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">minimum</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of three-week industry standard. The numbers look impressive; however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the founders still think the company is still on the path to finding product-market fit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right now, we are still trying to prove that there is demand in the market for selling insurance because there was no benchmark and we did not know if people would receive the insurance online,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;Everyone would say that in Egypt, people do not want to understand or buy insurance. But what we found is that educated people in the middle-income segment are aware of insurance, understand it and want to buy it, even though it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">wasn&#8217;t accessible to them before.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before starting Amenli, El Tohfa and Nauman were part of the founding team at Egyptian fintech Paymob. El Tohfa was the CCO while Nauman was the tech lead for one of Paymob&#8217;s products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At some point, the pair worked on a microfinance product in 2017 and came across insurance as a concept for the first time. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were fascinated by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the concept of it. Before that, we did not have a lot of information or knowledge about insurance at all. But it was very interesting to us,&#8221; said El Tohfa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuous research and interest led the pair to decide that they wanted to venture into insurtech full-time. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it wasn&#8217;t until meeting CCO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/omar-ezz-el-din-58739919">Omar Ezz El Din</a> and securing an insurance brokerage license that the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eventually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A full year of operating with Y Combinator&#8217;s backing has prepared Amenli for what&#8217;s ahead. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO says the new funding will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to expand its team, scale </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more customers in a market expected to grow at CAGRs of 7% per annum within the next five years.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Ford F-series pickup is America&#8217;s truck. At least, that&#8217;s what the numbers tell us.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been America&#8217;s top-selling vehicle for close to half a century. While the Chevrolet Silverado and Ram&#8217;s series of pickups are worthy competitors, Ford still sells tens of thousands more units than either one.</p>
<p>If you spend any time with one, you might recognize the appeal. The large, powerful truck can function as both a mobile office and workbench; it can tackle just about any job as well as most terrains. And yet, Ford recognizes this all-in-one utility vehicle isn&#8217;t for everyone.</p>
<p>For the detractors, the F-series is too large, cumbersome and wasteful. It may even come off as a little obnoxious. Ford needed a truck for those dead set against Ford&#8217;s No. 1 seller &#8212; a vehicle that would go against the norm and stray from the typical expectations of what a pickup can and should be.</p>
<p>Enter the Ford Maverick.</p>
<p>The Maverick is Ford&#8217;s return to the North American compact pickup truck market after abandoning it for the better part of a decade. Its previous model, the Ranger, has recently returned with an upgrade to a midsize truck, while the all-new Maverick picks up (heh) where it left off. Fittingly, the &#8220;Maverick&#8221; nameplate was first used by Ford in the 1970s for a series of compact sedans.</p>
<h2>Nuts and bolts</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2212299" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-maverick-blue-alex-k.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212299" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2212299 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-maverick-blue-alex-k.jpg" alt="2022 ford maverick blue hybrid truck" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-maverick-blue-alex-k.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-maverick-blue-alex-k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-maverick-blue-alex-k.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-maverick-blue-alex-k.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-maverick-blue-alex-k.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-maverick-blue-alex-k.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-maverick-blue-alex-k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2212299" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alex Kalogianni</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This all-new truck is a unibody construction with one configuration on offer, a four-door &#8220;SuperCrew&#8221; cabin that seats five and a truck bed that&#8217;s about 54.4 inches or just a smidge over 4.5 feet long. For comparison, that&#8217;s half a foot shorter than the Ranger box with a SuperCrew cab.</p>
<p>The Maverick, which TechCrunch had an opportunity to test, comes standard with a hybridized 2.5-liter four cylinder engine that produces 191 horsepower and 155 pound-feet of torque. It&#8217;s married to a continuously variable transmission and sends power to the front wheels.</p>
<p>In this standard configuration, the tiny truck is meant to deliver big on fuel economy, with an estimated 40 mpg of city miles and 500 miles of range on a single tank. It&#8217;s capable of carrying 1,500 pounds of cargo and towing 2,000 pounds of whatever you want behind it.</p>
<p>Anyone seeking a bit more grunt can upgrade to an optional 2.0-liter EcoBoost engine that provides 250 horsepower and 277 pound-feet of torque. This engine is linked to a more traditional 8-speed automatic gearbox and can drive either the front or all four wheels. In terms of capability, its payload numbers stay the same but it tows 2,000 pounds of cargo on its own, or twice that amount with the optional 4K Tow Package (AWD-models only).</p>
<p>An EcoBoost-powered Maverick with AWD is eligible for the FX4 package, which adds underbody protection for off-road activities, as well as adjustments to the suspension tuning and additional, off-road focused drive modes.</p>
<p>The XL, XLT and Lariat trim levels are familiar Ford family fare. On the Maverick, the XL and XLT don&#8217;t differ drastically, with the latter simply unlocking a handful of neat accessories. Both have cloth seats and come with whichever powertrain configuration appeals to you.</p>
<p>The Lariat trim has a few more bells and whistles, along with an &#8220;activeX&#8221; synthetic material to give the cabin a slightly more premium feel. In its base hybrid configuration, the Maverick&#8217;s starting price is below $20,000, with the rest of the trims being in the $20,000 to $30,000 range. Fully loaded, the Maverick&#8217;s bottom line maxes out in the $35,500 range.</p>
<h2>The tech</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2212300" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-macverick-interior-alex-k.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212300" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2212300 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-macverick-interior-alex-k.jpg" alt="2022 ford maverick interior" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-macverick-interior-alex-k.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-macverick-interior-alex-k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-macverick-interior-alex-k.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-macverick-interior-alex-k.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-macverick-interior-alex-k.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-macverick-interior-alex-k.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-macverick-interior-alex-k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2212300" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alex Kalogianni</p></div></p>
<p>Like its larger siblings, the compact truck is fitted with most modern safety and convenience technologies, though the more impressive stuff is largely optional. Automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection and collision warning is standard, but drivers who want adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist or even hill descent control, plus a handful of other helpful driving aids will have to add them on as part of an extra technology package.</p>
<p>Inside the cabin, passengers will be treated to an 8-inch touchscreen that&#8217;s Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatible. A built-in WiFi hotspot gives up to 10 devices internet access through FordPass Connect, which has a three-month free trial before a subscription is required.</p>
<p>Other FordPass conveniences, however, are complementary, such as access to the car via a smartphone app. From here, drivers can connect to their car remotely for starting it up, unlocking the doors and vehicle status updates.</p>
<p>The Maverick&#8217;s true party trick is its &#8220;Flexbed,&#8221; a standard truck bed constructed to meet a multitude of different needs. It does this with a few nuanced tweaks like having a multiposition tailgate, an incorporated storage cubby, slots for false load floors and several attachment points to tie down rear cargo.</p>
<p>Flexibility is the name of the game for Maverick as a whole, as every aspect of the car was designed to maximize utility throughout. For instance, the unibody construction allowed for the fuel tank to be shifted to the back enough to allow for a substantial amount of storage underneath the rear seats. Doors were designed with the now-popular multiuse drinking bottles in mind and every free cavity of space has been converted into some sort of storage function.</p>
<p>The DIY spirit of Ford&#8217;s truck owners was top of mind when it came to designing the Maverick.</p>
<p>After observing the unique solutions users came up with to get the most out of their truck, Maverick was laid out to make things easier, saving customers having to hack into tail lamps for wiring solutions or drill into the truck bed for mounting brackets. QR codes throughout the Maverick will lead handy Maverick owners to a site filled with several video how-tos, plus CAD files of certain components will eventually be uploaded to allow 3D printers to come up with their own accessories.</p>
<h2>The UX</h2>
<p>Anyone turned off by the driving characteristics of larger trucks like the F-150 would find the Maverick refreshingly approachable. By design, its half-car/half-truck nature keeps it from driving like its body-on-frame siblings and feels more like a subcompact car with a raised seating position. The unibody construction feels solid on its suspension, and the body roll one would expect to feel in a ponderous pickup simply isn&#8217;t there. It&#8217;s no sports car, but the ride is competent, and fun roads don&#8217;t feel wholly wasted on this truck.</p>
<p>The front-wheel drive hybrid pulls well in either normal or sport mode, the latter of which is there for those who might seek a touch more throttle response from the efficiency-oriented Atkinson-cycle engine. It pairs well with the CVT transmission, which is largely unremarkable, but in a positive way. This could actually be the best way to sum up the hybrid Maverick&#8217;s driving experience — inoffensive. As a daily driver, the Maverick simply does its job and doesn&#8217;t disappoint but it&#8217;s also not particularly exceptional in that department, which, in a way, is a win in terms of nailing expectations.</p>
<p>It performed well enough that I was never longing for the extra power that the EcoBoost-fitted Maverick provided, which was confirmed when I switched vehicles. Having a bit of extra power on hand is nice, but it didn&#8217;t change the dynamics on the road so drastically that I would be compelled to choose it over the hybrid. Off road, it would be a different, if slightly more complicated story.</p>
<h2>Hybrid hesitancy</h2>
<p>Ford&#8217;s language surrounding the off-road capabilities of the Maverick is carefully chosen. While the truck is &#8220;built Ford tough,&#8221; it&#8217;s meant to get drivers to the start of their adventure, not be the adventure itself. This is a diplomatic way of stating that the Maverick is on the lower end of Ford&#8217;s off-road capability scale.</p>
<p>Go-anywhere adventurers should seek the Bronco. Even casual overlanders would be better served by the Bronco Sport. Even though it and the Maverick share the same platform, the shorter wheelbase and clearance alone puts it ahead of the compact truck.</p>
<p>In practice, the added drive modes to control throttle and wheel slip, paired with more capable tires served the Maverick well for the off-road portion of the test drive. The terrain was a mix of flat gravel and well-trodden paths through grassy country land. None of it was particularly challenging save for a very boney hill climb made up of large loose rocks.</p>
<p>The Maverick had no issues surmounting the rough stuff, and though the path itself would be considered light by experienced off-roaders, it was certainly rocky enough to give anyone a moment of pause, particularly if they were in a car they weren&#8217;t confident in.</p>
<p>There was little doubt the AWD EcoBoost version of the Maverick would be able to tackle a few light obstacles. The hybrid was another story. For now, Ford isn&#8217;t offering the hybrid as an AWD. And I wasn&#8217;t able to put the front-wheel version through off-road portion of the drive.</p>
<p>Mechanically speaking, the mild hybrid system is fairly low impact. In broad terms, it&#8217;s a small motor integrated into the drivetrain partnered with a small battery for some light power recovery, as opposed to multimotored PHEVs laden with massive power packs. It seems there&#8217;s little preventing the hybrid Maverick from getting its own AWD setup. Would it be less capable than the EcoBoost off road and hurt the MPG numbers? Most certainly, though the drop-off would presumably be within a very reasonable margin.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the mpg for an example. Ford is very pleased to state that the hybrid FWD Maverick is capable of 40 mpg. The heavier and more power demanding AWD system would very likely reduce that return, but to what? 30 mpg? 25? It&#8217;s not 40, but for a compact truck, that would still be pretty good.</p>
<p>As for off-road prowess, the most rugged Maverick is still by Ford&#8217;s own admission limited, and while 277 pound-feet of torque — the number that matters most in off-roading — is undoubtedly better than 150 pound-feet, it&#8217;s not nothing, and certainly enough given the parameters the Maverick can work within.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no question the FX4-fitted EcoBoost AWD Maverick is better at such things, but given that the hybrid system is standard and the most appealing, it stands to reason this is the version of the Maverick that will sell the most, and thus the one drivers will want to take off the tarmac — or at least try.</p>
<h2>Contenders</h2>
<p>Ford has designed the Maverick to appeal more to car upgraders than truck downgraders, meaning that while there might be some overlap in terms of customers between it and the midsize Ranger, they&#8217;re not strictly at odds with each other.</p>
<p>Meant for more urban and suburban settings, the Maverick&#8217;s closest rival pickup would be the Honda Ridgeline. It&#8217;s proven track record as an urbane, car-like midsize truck is currently unmatched, though the Maverick and all-new Hyundai Santa Cruz could shake its solid footing.</p>
<p>The Ford Maverick is an intriguing &#8220;blank slate&#8221; of a vehicle sold more on its potential rather than what it actually is.</p>
<p>On its own, it&#8217;s either a cost-effective, fuel-efficient compact utility vehicle or a modestly capable off-roader. It will surely catch the eye of buyers looking for the utility of a truck without the premium price and spatial demands, the same way those seeking a dog for companionship might opt for a terrier rather than a Saint Bernard.</p>
<p>Its car-like handling makes it accessible for new drivers as well as anyone put off by piloting hefty SUVs or full-sized pickups. What the Ford Maverick is, is &#8220;just fine,&#8221; but what it can be, is limitless.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">London-based <a href="https://www.tryhabitual.com">Habitual</a>, a healthtech startup which offers a weight loss program aimed at people with type 2 diabetes (or prediabetes) that combines &#8220;evidence-based&#8221; food replacement with digital support to help people manage and even reverse the condition (so they can be medication free), has closed a $2.3 million seed round.</p>
<p>The round was led by Berlin-based Atlantic Food Labs, with existing investors Seedcamp and MMC also participating. Oxford Seed Fund, which is an initiative of the Entrepreneurship Centre at Saïd Business School, University of Oxford, also participated &#8212; and the round is Habitual&#8217;s third round since it was founded back in September 2019, including a pre-seed earlier this year to fund a soft launch. Its total raised to date is just over $3M.</p>
<p>Habitual&#8217;s program involves a period of total food replacement &#8212; when it supplies users with all their daily meals in nutritionally controlled, packet-form (there&#8217;s a choice of flavored porridges, shakes and soups).</p>
<p>For the food replacement product, Habitual says it worked with a product development consultancy that had previously done development work for the European Soylent-rival <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/huel-brings-its-nutrition-bars-to-the-u-s/">Huel</a> to develop the formulations.</p>
<p>Its companion digital program is designed to wrap around and support patients throughout their dietary transitions &#8212; including guiding them through the reintroduction of healthy whole foods, with the app giving them tools to track their weight and mood, and access resources and digital coaching.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2212427,2212428,2212429,2212430,2212431"]</p>
<p>&#8220;We use the same nutritional framework as was used in <a href="https://diabetes.medicinematters.com/diet/obesity/diabetes-remission-durable-for-a-third-of-direct-participants/16529016">DiRECT [trial]</a> (and other total diet replacement studies) &#8212; that is, three months of total diet replacement followed by a slow reintroduction of whole foods back into the diet, during which time we help patients to retrain around healthy nutritional, mental, and physical habits,&#8221; says co-founder and COO Napala Pratini.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The main difference&#8230; is that we guide patients through the programme completely digitally, as opposed to via in-person of telemedicine appointments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Per Pratini, Habitual&#8217;s digital intervention consists of three key components &#8212; first, &#8220;evidence-based&#8221; daily behavior change lessons and exercises, which she says run the gamut from CBT to nutritional education to support users as they re-introduce whole foods; second, the app provides personalised daily tracking (through self reporting) to help patients monitor progress over time; and lastly users can access the startup&#8217;s patient care team and &#8220;bespoke virtual peer groups&#8221;.</p>
<p>Health problems associated with obesity and poor diet are a huge and growing problem across most parts of the world, often linked to heavily processed, sugar-laden foods that have been staples on supermarket shelves in rich, Western countries for decades &#8212; but which are increasingly finding their way into developing countries, too.</p>
<p>In the West, over the past decade or so, a number of digital health startups have sprung up on both sides of the Atlantic aiming to use technology to help tackle this problem &#8212; such as the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/in-a-sign-of-digital-healths-rise-livongo-and-teladoc-health-agree-to-18-5-billion-merger/">Livongo</a>, <a href="https://livahealthcare.com">Liva Healthcare</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/omada-health-launches-the-omada-insights-lab-to-help-improve-healthcare-outcomes-across-the-board/">Omada</a>, Oviva (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/oviva-grabs-80m-for-app-delivered-healthy-diet-programs/">recently raised an $80M round</a>), Second Nature (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/noom-competitor-ourpath-rebrands-as-second-nature-raises-10m-series-a/">formerly OurPath</a>) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/virta-healths-behavioral-diabetes-treatment-service-is-now-worth-over-1-billion/">Sequoia-backed </a>Virta, to name a few.</p>
<p>There are also general weight loss platforms, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/weight-loss-platform-noom-bulks-up-on-540-million-in-new-funding/">Noom</a>. And &#8212; more recently &#8212; increasingly specialized plays, such as YC-backed <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/fella">Fella</a> (which, as the name suggests, does targeted obesity support specifically for men).</p>
<p>But the opportunity to provide digital support in the area of diet and health is huge, with different approaches also likely to work for different people (or indeed, different health conditions) &#8212; so it&#8217;s unlikely to be a winner-takes-all scenario.</p>
<p>The cost of diabetes-related healthcare has also been predicted to pass $1 trillion per year by 2025 by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352952203_A_Global_Review_of_Obesity">some estimates</a> &#8212; so even just capturing a tiny fraction of this market could sum to a sizeable business.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are tackling the root cause of the biggest problems facing modern healthcare systems, and while US companies have raised and been valued in the billions, there is so much room to do better for patients,&#8221; argues Pratini.</p>
<p>She says the London-based startup has &#8220;global ambitions&#8221; &#8212; and wants to take on US giants with what she describes as &#8220;a more empathetic, patient-led model of diabetes care&#8221;.</p>
<p>During a private beta of Habitual&#8217;s program which involved 30 patients, Pratini says users saw an average weight loss over the 3 months of 17kg &#8212; a little over the amount of weight that she says has been shown to be &#8220;necessary&#8221; to reverse type 2 diabetes in a majority of people.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you say, some people will of course need to do shorter or longer periods [of total food replacement] to achieve their goals, and we support patients in doing that,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>Pratini, who has a marketing background, says she and her co-founder, CEO Ian Braithwaite, a medical doctor with a background in digital health startups and clinical practice, met working alongside the DiRECT team &#8212; &#8220;and are therefore very familiar with the research&#8221;.</p>
<p>Habitual will be putting its product through its own peer-reviewed trials &#8220;in the next year&#8221;, she also tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The startup has started with a direct-to-consumer program &#8212; meaning individuals are referring themselves and it&#8217;s charging these users a fee (£39/week or £139/month for 6 months &#8212; &#8220;this includes all of a patient&#8217;s food for 3 months, and about half of their food for the second 3 months&#8221;).</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s hoping to be able to work with payers like the UK&#8217;s National Health Service in the future, as well as self-insured employers and insurance companies (the latter being the dominant model in the US).</p>
<p>&#8220;We have taken the direct to consumer route to begin with because it has enabled us to start building evidence and scaling more quickly than we would be able to whilst relying on NHS procurement,&#8221; notes Pratini.</p>
<p>&#8220;The NHS is already doing trials of <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2020/09/thousands-to-benefit-from-soups-and-shakes-diet-on-the-nhs-from-today/">similar programs</a>, however these pilots only reach a tiny fraction of the UK&#8217;s Type 2 diabetics. We expect these programs will be rolled out on a larger scale in a few year&#8217;s time, at which point we&#8217;ll have a significant amount of evidence under our belt to be able to successfully bid for these NHS tenders,&#8221; she adds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More than a decade ago, Mohit Dubey founded CarWale, a startup that allows people to sell and buy used and new cars. But spending more than 10 years with the startup made Dubey realize that he was solving problems for just 3% of India. He wanted to try something bigger. Literally.</p>
<p>His current venture is <a href="https://chalo.com">Chalo</a>, which helps bus operators accept digital payments and enables commute tracking. India’s bus market is a $20 billion opportunity, almost twice the size of cabs, but there are very few buses in the country, he told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, [the bus space] has not seen any tech disruption or meaningful service improvements,” said Manish Kheterpal, Partner of WaterBridge Ventures, one of the earliest backers of Chalo. “Chalo&#8217;s unique solution is positively impacting the lives of daily commuters across 11 states of India and is poised to expand its offering nationwide.”</p>
<p>There are just three buses for every 10,000 people in India. It’s a space that is ripe for disruption, but also one that remains largely underserved. Customers still have to pay their fare in cash. Very few buses offer monthly passes. And there is no certainty when any of these buses will arrive at their designated stops.</p>
<p>These are the challenges seven-year-old Chalo is solving. It deploys GPS machines on buses that allows customers to track the whereabouts of their commute. Its eponymous app sells tickets and monthly passes, helping these operators secure recurring revenue.</p>
<p>“It’s a massive opportunity,” said Dubey, adding that digitizing bus commutes is also an enormous challenge. Bus owners often don’t know how much collection they made in a day. The ticketing system needs to also work in offline mode and still accept online payments as buses zip through areas where there is little to no connectivity.</p>
<p>Chalo is now beginning to gain traction on all fronts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2212419" style="width: 599px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212419" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2212419 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/mock.png" alt="" width="589" height="555" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/mock.png 589w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/mock.png?resize=150,141 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/mock.png?resize=300,283 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/mock.png?resize=50,47 50w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2212419" class="wp-caption-text">Image credits: Chalo</p></div></p>
<p>On Tuesday, Chalo announced it has raised $40 million in its Series C funding round. The round was led by Lightrock India and Filter Capital. Existing investors WaterBridge Ventures, Raine Venture Partners, Neeraj Arora (former chief business officer of WhatsApp) and Amit Singhal (former SVP at Google) also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Dubey said the startup was operating about 1,900 buses before the pandemic hit last year. Now the startup is operating 2,500 buses and has signed up several thousands more. By December, he said about 8,000 buses will be live on the platform. “Very rarely you find a business opportunity that also has a societal impact,” he said.</p>
<p>“Buses are India’s number 1 form of public transport with 48% share of trips. Despite this, the experience is broken. At Chalo, we deploy technology that significantly improves the bus experience, and thereby increases ridership. We are today one of India’s largest mobility companies, with 20 million happy rides each month,” he said.</p>
<p>As part of the new financing round, the startup said it will use $10 million of the proceeds to buy back stock options to reward its current and former employees as well as some early angel investors.</p>
<p>“Chalo has emerged as a clear winner post- COVID by addressing the under-served public transport segment. This positions them to be the de-facto mobility operating system of the country. Public transport is the backbone to build a larger mobility platform addressing mobility needs at scale,” said Vaidhehi Ravindran, Partner of Lightrock, in a statement.</p>
<p>“We are impressed by the founding team’s innovative, and technology led approach combined with a deep sense of purpose to serve the society. Their empathy towards stakeholders codified into the business at every level makes them the right team to build this solution for the Indian public. We are excited to partner with Chalo as they continue to transform Indian mobility.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Book sales during the pandemic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jan/25/bookshops-defy-pandemic-to-record-highest-sales-for-eight-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went up</a>, and it seems the <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-reading-habits-have-changed-during-the-covid-19-lockdown-146894" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amount we are reading did, too</a>. Now <a href="https://www.inkitt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inkitt</a>, the startup that operates a free, popular platform of the same name for anyone to write and publish stories &#8212; stories that Inkitt then analyses using data science to determine which of them to take to the next level to produce longer works for its separate paid app, <a href="https://getgalatea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatea</a> &#8212; has raised $59 million in funding that could help it capitalize on this moment. Valuation with the Series B is not being disclosed, but from what I understand from a reliable source, it is in the region of $390 million.</p>
<p>The funding will be used by Berlin-based Inkitt to continue building out its algorithms and technology, which is important because the curation of stories  &#8212; including choosing what catapults from the free to the paid app as a longer work; and acting as &#8220;editor&#8221; with A/B testing of variations in story directions &#8212; are all generated by those algorithms, not humans. It will also be using the funds to hire more people, in particular to expand further into the North American market. And it finally plans to work on how it might extend the platform in the longer term. That could involve more formats beyond reading (it&#8217;s now taking early steps into audio, for example), and it could also involve building APIs and SDKs so that other parties, such as other publishers, might be able to use its tools to also test out shorter works to see what might work as books.</p>
<p>Inkitt has been on a growth tear in the last couple of years &#8212; the company now has 7 million users (AKA readers) and a community of 300,000 writers, up nearly threefold on the 1.6 million readers and 110,000 writers it had when I covered its last funding round in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/28/inkitt-raises-16m-led-by-kleiner-perkins-to-publish-crowdsourced-novels-in-mini-episodes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019</a>. The paid Galatea app, meanwhile, has a run rate of over $38 million (that figure has grown more than 6x: it was just $6 million two years ago).</p>
<p>The startup has also been catching the eye of others in the publishing industry, underscored by who is investing in this round.</p>
<p>Scott Sandell, managing general partner of NEA, co-led the investment with German publishing giant Axel Springer. Michael Lynton, the chairman of Snap (and in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lynton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous lives</a>, the CEO of Penguin Books and a senior executive at Disney who started Disney Publishing); and <span class="s1">Stefan von Holtzbrinck, the chairman of the eponymous publishing giant (which owns Macmillan, among others), also participated, alongside Kleiner Perkins, HV Capital, Redalpine and Speedinvest. Kleiner led Inkitt&#8217;s Series A. </span></p>
<p>Writers on the platform &#8212; at least those whose initial chapters chime well with Inkitt&#8217;s algorithms, which they then turn into longer works that resonate with readers &#8212; are also seeing some big numbers, with a few notable fairytales among them.</p>
<p>Seemran Sahoo, from one of the more impoverished states in India, Odisha, has made $2.7 million to date from <em>The Arrangement</em>, a novel she wrote and published on Inkitt entirely on her smartphone. Sapir Englard from Israel originally wanted to use the proceeds from her Inkitt-germinated book, <em>The Millennium Wolves</em>, to finance her tuition at Berklee College of Music in Boston. Tuition is expensive at U.S. higher learning institutions, but even so, she has ended up doing a little more than that: so far, she&#8217;s made $8 million to date from the novel. (Note: both of these were published before Inkitt&#8217;s last funding round: they have continued to rake in a lot in sales.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These two are outliers, but Ali Albazaz, Inkitt&#8217;s founder and CEO (pictured below), says most of those who make the cut for Galatea do very, very well relative to other publishing environments.</p>
<p>&#8220;The majority of our Galatea writers made more than $100,000 in sales,&#8221; he said. But if books, and specifically a kind of blockbuster, are at the heart of what Inkitt does today, Albazaz is given to describing his bigger vision for Inkitt as much more than just reading. The company has started to make small steps into audio books, and there are plans for developing films, TV shows, merchandising, games, and maybe even a theme park: &#8220;the Disney of the twenty-first century,&#8221; in his words.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2212409" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ali-Albazaz-Founder-and-CEO-Inkitt.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ali-Albazaz-Founder-and-CEO-Inkitt.jpg 8019w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ali-Albazaz-Founder-and-CEO-Inkitt.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ali-Albazaz-Founder-and-CEO-Inkitt.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ali-Albazaz-Founder-and-CEO-Inkitt.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ali-Albazaz-Founder-and-CEO-Inkitt.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ali-Albazaz-Founder-and-CEO-Inkitt.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ali-Albazaz-Founder-and-CEO-Inkitt.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ali-Albazaz-Founder-and-CEO-Inkitt.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>That journey is consistent, but it isn&#8217;t being taken at a breakneck speed: this was almost exactly what Albazaz told me was his plan in 2019, too. (Some things have not remained as prominent: the company&#8217;s unique selling point originally on Galatea was a set of &#8220;effects&#8221; that it adds to books &#8212; sounds and jolts that make the reading experience more immersive. These are still there but it seems that they are no longer central to every experience, and even Albazaz referred to the effects in our conversation only as an afterthought.)</p>
<p>As for why the Disney vision has yet to be realized, to be fair we <em>have</em> been in a pandemic. Also, &#8220;move fast, break things&#8221; isn&#8217;t always the best way forward.</p>
<p>Albazaz said the company is getting &#8220;between two and four requests every week from TV and movie and production companies,&#8221; to make content based Galatea/Inkitt books (as the publisher, Inkitt owns the rights for film and other options), but it has yet to sign any deals. Partly that is because of this Disney idea: Inkitt wants to have a role in what comes next.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are figuring out what is the best for us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We want to leave the option open that we might have video on Galatea.&#8221; That is incidentally also another area where Lynton, who also spent years as the CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment, might help.</p>
<p>Like other self-publishing platforms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/17/storytelling-app-wattpad-raises-51m-at-a-398m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wattpad</a> &#8212; which has gone further along in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/17/storytelling-app-wattpad-raises-51m-at-a-398m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its own &#8220;Disney&#8221; ambition</a>, with a wide range of video and other content spun out from works that got their first oxygen on its platform; Wattpad earlier this year was <a href="https://betakit.com/wattpad-to-be-acquired-by-south-koreas-naver-corp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Korea&#8217;s Naver for about $600 million</a> &#8212; Inkitt has paved the way for a new route to the market for creative people who want to write for a living, as well as those who just want to get their work out there into the world. There are a lot of places already where you can do that, of course, from sites like <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FanFiction</a>, through to Amazon and everything else in between.</p>
<p>As for the latter, Albazaz is unequivocal about his disdain for the e-commerce giant, which &#8220;took away all the margins and pushed down profits&#8221; on books and ruined the reading experience with its Kindles. That sentiment, he said, is what drove him to build Galatea as an addition to Inkitt, since previously the company used to shift books to Amazon once they expanded beyond the short format central to the flagship app. But, it should be pointed out, Inkitt also has its own quirks that don&#8217;t sit right with everyone.</p>
<p>One prominent author &#8212; name undisclosed &#8212; was curious about how a new work might fare through the Inkitt machine and submitted a chapter for publishing on there.</p>
<p>The Inkitt data science engine &#8212; which is unsentimental about who is writing, just what might &#8216;do well&#8217; &#8212; &#8220;<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">measured that readers weren&#8217;t engaged with the story and would stop reading very quickly.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>The author was &#8220;furious,&#8221; Albazaz said, and so was the author&#8217;s publisher &#8212; not least because of what the author had done with <em>their</em> book. The author ignored the feedback and the book published as the author wrote it (the whole book was already written when the chapter was submitted). The book sold 1 million copies, definitely okay for some, but nothing like the author&#8217;s previous blockbusters.</p>
<p class="p11">&#8220;Those 1 million bought it because of the author&#8217;s name,&#8221; Albazaz said flatly.</p>
<p>Longer term, it will be interesting to see whether Inkitt not only can sustain its growth, but to leverage it, as it wants to, in a bigger media play. Potentially that will not just be up to Inkitt executing, but also what happens in the wider market.</p>
<p>Because so many ideas for other content germinate from stories that you read, it&#8217;s inevitably an area that Amazon, and others like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/bytedance-to-pump-170-million-into-e-book-reader-zhangyue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ByteDance</a> (already giving <a href="https://thenewpublishingstandard.com/2021/04/18/be-afraid-be-just-a-tiny-bit-afraid-tiktok-owner-bytedance-targets-3-fold-growth-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some in the publishing world the shivers</a>), might also want to explore over time, too. Amazon has extensive A/B testing for other parts of its operations, and a formidable arsenal of data science and AI that it uses across every part of its business. So far, it hasn&#8217;t made huge inroads in building a product to take all of this to its self-publishing efforts&#8230; not yet, at least.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, though, this also speaks of big opportunities, and present traction, both of which are what investors like to see.</p>
<p>“Inkitt is well-positioned to become the future of storytelling, having already moved beyond traditional content forms to new formats that are innovative and engaging for millions of readers,&#8221; said Sandell in a statement. &#8220;A critical shift is taking place in how people consume stories, and Inkitt understands that. We are thrilled to partner closely with Ali and the rest of the Inkitt board to help drive what is sure to be an exciting and exponential phase of growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Inkitt&#8217;s technology is extraordinary, very successful and truly illustrates the future of storytelling,&#8221; added Döpfner. &#8220;When you consider how many Inkitt authors are achieving great commercial success, you can clearly see how deeply this company has disrupted the way people consume books. We are excited to become part of the further development and work with them as they continue on their journey.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong>: Article clarified to note that Inkitt did not suggest alternative plot lines to the unnamed author; just told the author that as is, the story would not engage readers very much. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Licious, a Bangalore-based startup that sells fresh meat and seafood online, said on Tuesday it has raised $52 million in a new financing round and become the first direct-to-consumer startup to attain the unicorn status in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>The new round &#8212; a Series G &#8212; was led by Mumbai-headquartered IIFL. It comes just three months after Licious &#8212; which counts 3one4 Capital and Temasek among its investors &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/indias-licious-raises-192-million-for-international-expansion/">raised $192 million at a valuation of about $650 million</a>, TechCrunch reported earlier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.licious.in/">Licious</a> operates an eponymous e-commerce platform where it sells meat and seafood in 14 Indian cities. The startup has built a supply chain network across several Indian cities to be able to procure meat and seafood, keep them fresh, and deliver within hours of the order.</p>
<p>“Even though the funding for the D2C sector has grown significantly, FMCG is still not considered the most attractive category,” said Vivek Gupta and Abhay Hanjura, founders of Licious, in a joint statement. “We expect that Licious&#8217; unicorn status will change that. The fresh meats and seafood sector is still largely underserved and unorganised that holds a vast opportunity of $40 billion. As the category leader, we aim at paving the way for a second wave of young start-ups that can join hands in fully harnessing the potential that the industry has to offer.”</p>
<p>Licious has not disclosed several of its performance metrics &#8212; such as its sales and margin figures &#8212; but says it has grown over 500% in the past one year. It also says it has amassed over 2 million unique customers. In recent months, the startup has spoken about its intentions to expand to international markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Licious has disrupted the meat and seafood category, which has largely been unorganized and underserved,&#8221; said Chetan Naik of IIFL AMC. &#8220;Today, Licious is amongst the fastest growing D2C brands and is one of the few consumer businesses in India with very strong revenue retention metrics. We are excited to partner with them in this journey of creating India’s most-loved meat and seafood brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The arrival of IIFL, based on the firm&#8217;s historical track record, on Licious&#8217; captable suggests that the startup is planning for its IPO within the next two years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Bangalore-based firm joins another two-and-a-half-dozen startups in India that have attained the unicorn status this year. Scores of high-profile investors including Tiger Global, SoftBank, Falcon Edge Capital, and Temasek, as well as local giants such as Sequoia Capital India have significantly increased the pace of their investments in recent quarters as they double down in the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jonathan Abrams and Kent Lindstrom have partnered on a lot of things over the years. Lindstrom was an advisor and investor at the early social networking service Friendster, founded by Abrams. He was also the COO of social news aggregator Nuzzel, which was founded by Abrams and that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/scroll-acquires-nuzzel/">sold</a> to a subscription startup called Scroll in 2019. (Scroll later sold to Twitter, which <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2021/05/04/twitter-buys-scroll-new-aggregator-nuzzel-way">shut down Nuzzel </a>in May.)</p>
<p>Because both have been angel investing all the while, and because there&#8217;s still a lot of money looking to find its way into startups, it isn&#8217;t surprising that they decided more recently to raise an actual seed-stage fund from outside investors, or that they decided to invest it together.</p>
<p>Thus was born <a href="https://8bitcapital.com/">8-Bit Capital</a>, a brand that refers to a time when computers were only able to store a maximum of 8 bits per data block, resulting in the blocky graphics that people who grew up on Atari remember well. Now, the duo is taking the wraps off 8-Bit&#8217;s first fund, a $40 million vehicle that they raised from a wide number of well-known VCs and entrepreneurs, as well as several institutional investors.</p>
<p>We talked with Abrams earlier about some of those backers, who he asked we not name publicly (to shield them from more capital requests). We also talked about how he and Lindstrom are thinking about competing in the frothiest venture market ever and how focused &#8212; or not &#8212; the duo will be on social platforms, given their history. Our chat, below, has been edited lightly for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Why jump into VC full time right now?</strong></p>
<p>JA: We&#8217;ve been helping other entrepreneurs for a long time, and the feedback from a lot of entrepreneurs over the years is that they really appreciated he advice that we&#8217;ve given them. Part of that may be because the venture capital &#8220;value add&#8221; may may be a little overhyped in the industry, and part may be that Kent and I are just good at it. So even though there&#8217;s a lot of investors out there, we thought it did make sense for us to do this.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What are your most successful &#8220;exits&#8221; as an angel investor?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>JA: I would say that the best companies, or the most successful ones, still haven&#8217;t exited. That&#8217;s the crazy thing about about doing angel investing or venture capital &#8212; the early exits can be good but the the real winners take a long time. I was an investor in [the e-signature company] Hello Sign, which was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-28/dropbox-to-acquire-e-signature-software-company-hellosign?sref=gni836kR">acquired</a> by Dropbox [in 2019 for $230 million in cash]. I was invested in [the content sharing platform] SlideShare, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/03/linkedin-acquires-professional-content-sharing-platform-slideshare-for-119m/">acquired</a> by LinkedIn [in 2012 for $119 million in cash and stock], and those were very profitable exits. But some of the companies I invested in, like Instacart or Front or AngelList, are still not exited, and they&#8217;re doing extremely well and will be extremely profitable investments.</p>
<p>It does require patience. There are companies that are worth tens of billions [of dollars], but oftentimes, the entrepreneurs have been working on those companies for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re obviously a pioneer in social media, having started Friendster more recently started Nuzzel. Meanwhile, social media is hot again. How interested are you in social as an area of investment?</strong></p>
<p>JA: We&#8217;re open to it, but it&#8217;s not the area we&#8217;re most focused on right now, and I think that&#8217;s because of opportunity. Every week, somebody sends us some new social media pitch, but I&#8217;m still waiting to see something that&#8217;s crazy and innovative. Usually we just see things like, &#8216;We don&#8217;t like Facebook; we&#8217;ll somehow be better. &#8216;</p>
<p>What we invest in is <a href="https://8bitcapital.com/portfolio">software</a>. We&#8217;re not investing in biotech or mattresses or coffee or spaceships. Software that connects people or businesses in new ways is what Kent and I are really passionate about.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How can founders reach you? Do they need a warm introduction?</strong></p>
<p>JA: introductions are great. We like to see an entrepreneur who can network. If nobody on the founding team of a company has the ability to get introductions to investors, then how are you going to get introductions to customers and build your team and all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&#8217;m on the board of <a href="https://girlsintech.org/">Girls in Tech</a>, and Kent and I really care about diversity and we know that requiring an intro can be an impediment to improving the diversity numbers in an industry that really needs improvement. So if somebody sends me a cold email, I&#8217;m going to look at it. The problem is, I get a lot of cold emails, and they&#8217;re all terrible. They&#8217;re generally really long and don&#8217;t contain any of the information you need. So If [we&#8217;re sent] a cold email, we would probably read it, but in general, the cold emails we get are just not compelling.</p>
<p>Most of the companies that we&#8217;ve invested in, some of them have been entrepreneurs who we already know, and many of them have been referrals. Generally, we like to get deal flow directly from entrepreneurs, and when other VCs send us deals, we usually don&#8217;t do them for various reasons.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Because they are probably sending the same deal to everyone at once?</strong></p>
<p>JA: One issue is adverse selection where, if this is something that a VC is sharing around and didn&#8217;t gobble up that allocation themselves, there may be an issue there. Another issue is timing. We like to know a company super early &#8212; ideally before other VCs really know about it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span class="s1">European VC Eight Roads is launching its fourth fund of $450 million for European and Israeli tech companies , aiming for another 15-20 across a broad range of consumer, software-as-a-service, fintech and healthtech areas. Cheque sizes wil range from around $5 million to $50 million per company, and as such, it tends to play more in growth funding rounds. 10-year old Eight Roads is backed by Fidelity, and was formerly known as Fidelity Growth Partners and before that Fidelity Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Eight Roads has previously invested in companies such as AppsFlyer, Cazoo, Fireblocks, Hibob, <a href="http://made.com/"><span class="s2">Made.com</span></a>, Spendesk, Red Points, and Neo4j, and now manages over $8 billion of capital across Europe, Asia and the US.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p><span class="s1">To give you an idea of how the fund has grown, the first Eight Roads fund was 1st was £100m, the second £150m, the first $375m, and the latest is $450m.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Davor Hebel, Managing Partner and Head of Eight Roads Ventures Europe said: “It’s great to be launching our latest fund at a time when there is so much entrepreneurial energy and ambition in both Europe and Israel and we’re now firmly on a path to building global technology champions out of the region. This additional capital enables us to continue helping ambitious founders scale, win and have a lasting impact on the way we live.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p><span class="s1">I asked the firm whether it will also have a climate focus, given the scale of the problems facing the planet. A spokeperson said the focus on climate cuts across all of its sectors but as an investment theme Eight Roads looks at three main focus areas:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Clean energy &#8211; so it has an investment in a Nordic company <a href="https://tibber.com/en"><span class="s2">Tibber</span></a> which helps people run their homes more sustainably.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Sustainable products – Eight Roads has invested in <a href="https://www.otrium.co.uk/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwwNWKBhDAARIsAJ8HkheWwa8IemPuNWtjLwxVyqwUdcZGeIoWzfc3JrShWzsll1fmUU_7b40aAl4xEALw_wcB"><span class="s2">Otrium</span></a> (fashion marketplace aiming to get every item to be worn), <a href="https://smolproducts.com/"><span class="s2">Smol</span></a> (environmentally friendly house products), <a href="https://lafourche.fr/"><span class="s2">La Fourche</span></a> (organic and sustainable produce), <a href="https://shopviu.com/en_int/"><span class="s2">VIU</span></a> (eyewear brand), and <a href="https://www.made.com/"><span class="s2">Made.com</span></a> (online furniture brand)<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Climate change tools and enablers &#8211; e.g. carbon footprint measurement and reduction<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1">During an interview, Hebel told me a major investment theme last year and this had been the shift to remote working, HR systems to support that, and: “Every company needs FinTech now.”</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">The fourth biggest category for Eight Roads is digital health, also supercharged by the pandemic.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span class="s1">Enabling technologies, like AI, are also being applied: “I wouldn&#8217;t call it a sector, but the machine learning aspect. Like Glovo, which is a company that does internal talent marketplaces for large companies, where you can match people&#8217;s talents with opportunities in other parts of the organization.”</span></p>
