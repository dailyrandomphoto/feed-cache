</div><p id="speakable-summary">Software buying has evolved. The days of executives choosing software for their employees based on IT compatibility or KPIs are gone. Employees now tell their boss what to buy. This is why we’re seeing more and more SaaS companies — Datadog, Twilio, AWS, Snowflake and Stripe, to name a few — find success with a usage-based pricing model.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The usage-based model allows a customer to start at a low cost, while still preserving the ability to monetize a customer over time.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The usage-based model allows a customer to start at a low cost, minimizing friction to getting started while still preserving the ability to monetize a customer over time because the price is directly tied with the value a customer receives. Not limiting the number of users who can access the software, customers are able to find new use cases — which leads to more long-term success and higher lifetime value.</p>
<p>While we aren’t going 100% usage-based overnight, looking at some of the megatrends in software —  automation, AI and APIs — the value of a product normally doesn’t scale with more logins. Usage-based pricing will be the key to successful monetization in the future. Here are four top tips to help companies scale to $100+ million ARR with this model.</p>
<h2>1. Land-and-expand is real</h2>
<p>Usage-based pricing is in all layers of the tech stack. Though it was pioneered in the infrastructure layer (think: AWS and Azure), it’s becoming increasingly popular for API-based products and application software — across infrastructure, middleware and applications.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106114" style="width: 1532px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106114" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2106114 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APIbasedproducts2.jpg" alt="API-based products and appliacation software – across infrastructure, middleware and applications." width="1522" height="664" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APIbasedproducts2.jpg 1522w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APIbasedproducts2.jpg?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APIbasedproducts2.jpg?resize=300,131 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APIbasedproducts2.jpg?resize=768,335 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APIbasedproducts2.jpg?resize=680,297 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APIbasedproducts2.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1522px) 100vw, 1522px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106114" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kyle Povar / OpenView</p></div></p>
<p>Some fear that investors will hate usage-based pricing because customers aren’t locked into a subscription. But, investors actually see it as a sign that customers are seeing value from a product and there’s no shelf-ware.</p>
<p>In fact, investors are increasingly rewarding usage-based companies in the market. Usage-based companies are trading at a 50% revenue multiple premium over their peers.</p>
<p>Investors especially love how the usage-based pricing model pairs with the land-and-expand business model. And of the IPOs over the last three years, seven of the nine that had the best net dollar retention all have a usage-based model. Snowflake in particular is off the charts with a 158% net dollar retention.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Dyatlov Pass incident is the mother of all cold cases: nine people found dead in 1959, deep in the Ural mountains, under circumstances no one has ever been able to satisfactorily explain. But new research uses simulation techniques from multiple eras to advance what is perhaps the least implausible story of this tragic mystery.</p>
<p>The paper, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-020-00081-8/">published yesterday in Nature Communications Earth and Environment</a>, was accompanied by a <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2021/01/has-science-solved-history-greatest-adventure-mystery-dyatlov/">highly readable summary in National Geographic</a>, which is very much worth your time. (Even if the headline is the dreaded &#8220;Has science solved&#8230;?&#8221;)</p>
<p>Essentially the mystery is this: The eight students and their ski instructor had pitched their tent on a slope that seemed safe — if not perfectly so then comparatively considering the surroundings at <span class="clearfix">Kholat Syakhl</span>, or &#8220;Dead Mountain&#8221; — but were later found spread out around the area in various stages of disrobing and destruction. The carnage seemed beyond what an avalanche would produce, and anyway there seemed to be no evidence or likelihood of one in the first place.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For more than 60 years this has been a source of speculation and conspiracy, especially since there was the appearance of a cover-up by the Soviet government at the time. Even Russia revisiting the event in 2019 didn&#8217;t seem to produce a convincing explanation.</p>
<p>Enter Alexander Puzrin and Johan Gaume, from Switzerland&#8217;s ETH <span class="clearfix">Zürich</span> and EPFL, respectively, two highly prestigious and advanced technical institutes. Curious about the incident for their own reasons, they began looking into how to work out once and for all what happened. An interesting personal detail:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="clearfix">The scientific investigation came with an added benefit from Puzrin’s wife, who is Russian. “When I told her that I was working on the Dyatlov mystery, for the first time she looked at me with real respect,” he says.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>One hardly knows what to say!</p>
<p>At all events the researchers put together a new hypothesis based on a few ideas.</p>
<p>First, the slope was not as shallow as it appeared — it was near the minimum for an avalanche to occur, and the snow was characterized as having a base layer conducive to slippage of snow on top. Freezing winds could have added mass and set off a slide under the cut-out in which the group put their tent.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ES2Cmbvw5o?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Second, Gaume visited the creators of the movie &#8220;Frozen,&#8221; which featured <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ES2Cmbvw5o">highly realistic snow simulation</a>. He met with Disney&#8217;s snow simulation specialist and got permission to use and modify the code — but in this case, to see what an avalanche striking sleeping students would do to them. Their simulations showed that it wouldn&#8217;t take much — a block of icy snow the size of a large car — to cause the devastation witnessed by the rescue party.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106078" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/slab.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106078" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2106078" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/slab.png" alt="Diagram showing simulation of snow as it might impact a person sleeping in a tent at Dyatlov." width="1024" height="566" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/slab.png 1827w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/slab.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/slab.png?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/slab.png?resize=768,424 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/slab.png?resize=680,376 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/slab.png?resize=1536,848 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/slab.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2106078" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gaume, Puzrin / Nature</p></div></p>
<p>Third, they used research performed by GM that broke the ribs of a hundred cadavers — for the purposes of tuning seatbelts. They proposed that because the Russian students would have been sleeping on their skis, it was fairly similar to how certain cadavers with rigid supports reacted to impacts. Thus the horrific injuries instead of the usual asphyxiation produced by being submerged in a drift that usually happens to victims of avalanches.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all still speculation on top of speculation, but the important part is that by combining these various, reasonably objective measures, Puzrin and Gaume show that it&#8217;s possible that an avalanche was responsible for the Dyatlov Pass incident, however rare the combination of circumstances must have been.</p>
<p>They freely admit that many may not accept this explanation — &#8220;It&#8217;s too normal,&#8221; said Gaume — and will continue to pursue the conspiracies and fantasy scenarios the incident has spawned for half a century. But for others it may offer some solace: a reason to believe that these poor nine souls were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Where can new founders and budding entrepreneurs turn for expert advice to navigate the formative phases of building a startup? Head to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=DualEventPost">TechCrunch Early Stage</a> — a two-day virtual bootcamp that gives early founders (pre-seed through Series A) access to the leading experts across a range of essential entrepreneurial skills.</p>
<p>We’re talking dozens of workshops addressing operations, fundraising, pitch deck pointers, term sheet tips, product-market fit, brand building, growth marketing, recruiting, taming your tech stack and a lot more.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of ground to cover, amirite? That’s exactly why we’re hosting two Early Stage events this year. Each one offers different content, a separate slate of speakers and unique perspectives. Both feature highly interactive Q&amp;As with the experts. Get answers to all your burning questions!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In a hurry? Scroll down to the bottom (or click <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/#tickets">here</a>) to get the 411 on pass types, early-bird pricing and deadlines.</p>
<p>The first TC-ES, on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/#tickets?promo=DualEventPost">April 1 &amp; 2</a>, covers topics ranging from fundraising and operations to product lifecycle and recruiting — for starters. The second, on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-2/">July 8 &amp; 9</a>, spans marketplace positioning, growth marketing, content development and even more on fundraising.</p>
<p>Sure, you can go to a single Early Stage event, but savvy startuppers (that’s you, right?) will sign on for a double dose of knowledge and attend both. That’s not just marketing talk — the benefits are real.</p>
<p>Buy a dual-event pass (for a tidy discount, by the way), and you’ll not only learn more, but you’ll also have more time to absorb and implement critical advice that can lead to your success. Seriously, which topics and tips can you afford to miss? Don’t let the FOMO haunt you.</p>
<p>You’ll also have plenty of opportunity to connect and network with other early founders, later-stage founders and other smart members of the startup — oh, what’s the word? — <em>community</em>. Build your contacts, find indispensable support and mentorship. Remember, we all go further together.</p>
<p>We introduced TC Early Stage last year to rave reviews — like this one from Chloe Leaaetoa, founder of Socicraft:</p>
<blockquote><p>You learn from industry leaders and seasoned founders — people who’ve already been there and done that. They were genuine and honest about industry expectations. Plus, they shared first-hand accounts, which made them more relatable.</p></blockquote>
<p>And this one from Ashley Barrington, founder of MarketPearl:</p>
<blockquote><p>I recommend going to Early Stage. The virtual aspect helps in terms of scheduling, it offers community-building through networking, and it gives early stage founders a framework for navigating the startup ecosystem. This is the stage where founders need more support, especially if they haven’t done this before.</p></blockquote>
<p>Go all-in and attend TC Early Stage 2021 in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/">April</a> and again in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-2/">July</a>. Increase your knowledge, sharpen your skills, avoid pitfalls and expand your network. Those are mighty big benefits, and you deserve every one of them.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yousufakhan">Yousuf Khan</a> is a partner at <a href="https://ridge.vc/">Ridge Ventures</a>.

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As a 20-year CIO and advisor to multiple startups, I sat on many customer advisory boards (CABs) and saw how they were formed. Some companies have highly functioning CABs, others merely serve as feedback loops. Any startup striving to connect directly with their customers would benefit from establishing one.</p>
<p>Here are some considerations to make certain your customer advisory board is a success.</p>
<h2>Why CABs matter</h2>
<p>For those unfamiliar, a customer advisory board is a group of customers who come together to share their experiences, insights and advice with an organization. First and foremost, the CAB functions to recognize and include the voice of the customer, an essential part of your company’s journey since customers interact closer than anyone with your product or service.</p>
<p>It’s best to designate early adopters to be on the board — those who took a chance on you and have been on the frontlines as your company evolved — as well as some newer customers.</p>
<p>While establishing this group signals appreciation and respect for your customers, it also provides an opportunity for you to formalize and structure the feedback you are requesting from them. You can seek validation for product ideas or guidance on roadmap development, test out marketing messaging and even tap into market intelligence.</p>
<p>The greatest benefit of a CAB, however, is the creation of champions for your brand. These loyal partners will ultimately offer testimonials, references and referrals. Key to this partnership is a shared sense of playing a small part in building the future of your company.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The greatest benefit of a CAB is the creation of champions for your brand.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Assembling your CAB superteam</h2>
<p>The best route to assembling your CAB is to start with a very small group and expand slowly. There’s quite a bit of nuance in the selection of who to include. Do you go after the executive who sponsored you, the one who saw a vision and thought your solution would fit?</p>
<p>Perhaps. But that individual may not be using your product every day, be involved deeply in its operational aspects and/or have their finger on the pulse of the end-user’s experience.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In June of 1999, Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins invested $25 million into an early-stage company developing a new search engine called Google, paving the way for a revolution in how knowledge online was organized and shared.</p>
<p>Now, Sequoia Capital is placing another bet on a different kind of search engine, one for physical objects in three dimensions, just as the introduction of three-dimensional sensing technologies on consumer phones are poised to create a revolution in spatial computing.</p>
<p>At least, that&#8217;s the bet that Sequoia Capital&#8217;s Shaun Maguire is making on the Columbus, Ohio-based startup* <a href="https://physna.com/">Physna</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Maguire and Sequoia are leading a $20 million bet into the company alongside Drive Capital, the Columbus, Ohio-based venture firm founded by two former Sequoia partners, Mark Kvamme and Chris Olsen.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="011IfW9zpN"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/columbus-drivecapital/">Two ex-Sequoia VCs:  The most &#8216;compelling emerging market&#8217; may be America, outside of Silicon Valley</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Two ex-Sequoia VCs:  The most &#8216;compelling emerging market&#8217; may be America, outside of Silicon Valley&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/columbus-drivecapital/embed/#?secret=011IfW9zpN" data-secret="011IfW9zpN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been this open problem in mathematics, which is how you do three-dimensional search. How do you define a metric that gives you other similar three-dimensional objects. This has a long history in mathematics,&#8221; Maguire said. &#8220;When I first met [Physna founder] Paul Powers, he had already come up with a wildly novel distance metric to compare different three-dimensional objects. If you have one distance metric, you can find other objects that are a distance away. His thinking underlying that is so unbelievably creative. If I were to put it in the language of modern mathematics&#8230; it just involves a lot of really advanced ideas that actually also works.&#8221;</p>
<p>Powers&#8217; idea &#8212; and Physna&#8217;s technology &#8212; was a long time coming.</p>
<p>A lawyer by training and an entrepreneur at heart, Powers came to the problem of three-dimensional search through his old day job as an intellectual property lawyer.</p>
<p>Powers chose IP law because he thought it was the most interesting way to operate at the intersection of technology and law &#8212; and would provide good grounding for whatever company the serial entrepreneur would eventually launch next. While practicing, Powers hit upon a big problem, while some intellectual property theft around software and services was easy to catch, it was harder to identify when actual products or parts were being stolen as trade secrets. &#8220;We were always able to find 2D intellectual property theft,&#8221; Powers said, but catching IP theft in three dimensions was elusive.&#8221;</p>
<p>From its launch in 2015 through 2019, Powers worked with co-founder and chief technology officer Glenn Warner Jr. on developing the product, which was initially intended to protect product designs from theft. Tragically, just as the company was getting ready to unveil its transformation into the three-dimensional search engine it had become, Warner died.</p>
<p>Powers soldiered on, rebuilding the company and its executive team with the help of Dennis DeMeyere, who joined the company in 2020 after a stint in Google&#8217;s office of the chief technology officer and technical director for Google Cloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I moved, I jumped on a plane with two checked bags and moved into a hotel, until I could rent a fully furnished home,&#8221; DeMeyere <a href="https://www.protocol.com/physna-3d-modeling-search-like-google">told Protocol last year.</a></p>
<p>Other heavy hitters were also drawn to the Cincinnati-based company thanks in no small part to Olsen and Kvamme&#8217;s Silicon Valley connections. They include GitHub&#8217;s chief technology officer, Jason Warner, who has a seat on the company&#8217;s board of directors alongside Drive Capital&#8217;s co-founder Kvamme, who serves as the chairman.</p>
<p>In Physna, Kvamme, Maguire and Warner see a combination of GitHub and Google &#8212; especially after the launch last year of the company&#8217;s consumer-facing site, <a href="https://thangs.com/">Thangs</a>.</p>
<p>That site allows users to search for three-dimensional objects by a description or by uploading a model or image. As Mike Murphy at Protocol noted, it&#8217;s a bit like Thingiverse, Yeggi or other sites used by 3D-printing hobbyists. What the site can also do is show users the collaborative history of each model and the model&#8217;s component parts &#8212; if it involves different objects.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9wp8LdhPGa"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/04/meet-cocoa-press-the-philly-startup-making-a-3d-printer-for-chocolate/">Meet Cocoa Press, the Philly startup making a 3D printer for chocolate</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Meet Cocoa Press, the Philly startup making a 3D printer for chocolate&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/04/meet-cocoa-press-the-philly-startup-making-a-3d-printer-for-chocolate/embed/#?secret=9wp8LdhPGa" data-secret="9wp8LdhPGa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Hence the GitHub and Google combination. And users can set up profiles to store their own models or collaborate and comment on public models.</p>
<p>What caught Maguire&#8217;s eye about the company was the way users were gravitating to the free site. &#8220;There were tens of thousands of people using it every day,&#8221; he said. It&#8217;s a replica of the way many successful companies try a freemium or professional consumer hybrid approach to selling products. &#8220;They have a free version and people are using it all the time and loving it. That is a foundation that they can build from,&#8221; said Maguire.</p>
<p>And Maguire thinks that the spatial computing wave is coming sooner than anyone may realize. &#8220;The new iPhone has lidar on it&#8230; This is the first consumer device that comes shipped with a 3D scanner with lidar and I think three dimensional is about to explode.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eventually, Physna could be a technology hub where users can scan three-dimensional objects into their phones and have a representational model for reproduction either as a virtual object or as something that can be converted into a file for 3D printing.</p>
<p>Right now, hundreds of businesses have approached the company with different requests for how to apply its technology, according to Powers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One new feature will allow you to take a picture of something and not only show you what that is or where it goes. Even if that is into a part of the assembly. We shatter a vase and with the vase shards we can show you how the pieces fit back together,&#8221; Powers said.<br />
</span></p>
<p>Typical contracts for the company&#8217;s software range from $25,000 to $50,000 for enterprise customers, but the software that powers Physna&#8217;s product is more than just a single application, according to Powers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not just a product. We&#8217;re a fundamental technology,&#8221; said Powers. &#8220;There is a gap between the physical and the digital.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Sequoia and Drive Capital, Physna&#8217;s software is the technology to bridge that gap.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;Supreme Court&#8221; is now accepting comments on one of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/facebook-oversight-board-trump-facebook-suspension/">earliest and likely most consequential cases</a>. The Facebook Oversight Board announced Friday that it would <a href="https://oversightboard.secure.force.com/apex/VisualAntidote__HostedFastForm?f=i6VO6LLfXbOt%2Bdjzhn2zNj%2B5yLrazO6pIHWc5cVT/zWMmmWJHflKUJzl708kZWe1">begin accepting public feedback</a> on Facebook&#8217;s suspension of former President Trump.</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">announced Trump&#8217;s suspension on January 7</a>, after the then-president of the United States incited his followers to riot at the nation&#8217;s Capitol, an event that resulted in a number of deaths and imperiled the peaceful transition of power.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://oversightboard.secure.force.com/apex/VisualAntidote__HostedFastForm?f=i6VO6LLfXbOt%2Bdjzhn2zNj%2B5yLrazO6pIHWc5cVT/zWMmmWJHflKUJzl708kZWe1">post calling for feedback</a>, the Oversight Board describes the two posts that led to Trump&#8217;s suspension. One is a version of the video the president shared the day of the Capitol riot in which he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-pop-up-trump-video-capitol-rally/">sympathizes with rioters and validates their claim that the &#8220;election was stolen from us.&#8221;</a> In the second post, Trump reiterates those views, falsely bemoaning a &#8220;sacred landslide election victory&#8221; that was &#8220;unceremoniously &amp; viciously stripped away.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The board says the point of the public comment process is to incorporate &#8220;diverse perspectives&#8221; from third parties who wish to share research that might inform their decisions, though it seems a lot more likely the board will wind up with a tidal wave of subjective and probably not particularly useful political takes. Nonetheless, the comment process will be open for 10 days and comments will be collected in an appendix for each case. The board will issue a decision on Trump&#8217;s Facebook fate within 90 days of January 21, though the verdict could come sooner.</p>
<p>The Oversight Board specifically invites public comments that consider:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether Facebook’s decision to suspend President Trump’s accounts for an indefinite period complied with the company’s responsibilities to respect freedom of expression and human rights, if alternative measures should have been taken, and what measures should be taken for these accounts going forward.</p>
<p>How Facebook should assess off-Facebook context in enforcing its Community Standards, particularly where Facebook seeks to determine whether content may incite violence.</p>
<p>How Facebook should treat the expression of political candidates, office holders, and former office holders, considering their varying positions of power, the importance of political opposition, and the public&#8217;s right to information.</p>
<p>The accessibility of Facebook’s rules for account-level enforcement (e.g. disabling accounts or account functions) and appeals against that enforcement.</p>
<p>Considerations for the consistent global enforcement of Facebook’s content policies against political leaders, whether at the content-level (e.g. content removal) or account-level (e.g. disabling account functions), including the relevance of Facebook’s “newsworthiness” exemption and Facebook’s human rights responsibilities.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Oversight Board&#8217;s post <a href="https://oversightboard.secure.force.com/apex/VisualAntidote__HostedFastForm?f=i6VO6LLfXbOt%2Bdjzhn2zNj%2B5yLrazO6pIHWc5cVT/zWMmmWJHflKUJzl708kZWe1">gets very granular on the Trump suspension</a>, critiquing Facebook for lack of specificity when the company didn&#8217;t state exactly which part of its community standards were violated. Between this and the five recent cases, the board appears to view its role as a technical one, in which it examines each case against Facebook&#8217;s existing ruleset and then makes recommendations for future policy rather than working backward from its own broader recommendations.</p>
<p>The Facebook Oversight Board<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/facebooks-oversight-body-overturns-four-takedowns-and-issues-a-slew-of-policy-tweaks/"> announced its first cluster of decisions this week</a>, overturning the company&#8217;s own choice to remove potentially objectionable content in four of five cases. None of those cases pertained to content relevant to Trump&#8217;s account suspension, but they prove that the Oversight Board isn&#8217;t afraid to go against the company&#8217;s own thinking — at least when it comes to what gets taken down.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A gig economy-powered consumer edtech platform is heading to the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Edtech startup <a href="https://www.nerdy.com/">Nerdy</a>, which owns the popular tutoring business <a href="https://www.varsitytutors.com/">Varsity Tutors,</a> is seeking to become a public company through a special purpose acquisition vehicle, otherwise known as a SPAC.</p>
<p>Nerdy will merge with TPG Pace Tech Opportunities (NYSE: PACE), a publicly traded SPAC since 2015. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The deal will value Nerdy at $1.7 billion. Through the transaction, the business plans to raise up to $750 million in cash, including $150 million in PIPE financing aggregated by Franklin Templeton, Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan, Koch Industries and Learn Capital.</p>
<p>Nerdy’s flagship business, Varsity Tutors, is a two-sided marketplace that matches tutors to students in large, small or 1:1 group environments. The learning platform covers more than 3,000 subjects. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/the-tech-powered-wave-of-smart-not-slow-tutoring-sessions/">Like other edtech companies</a>, Varsity Tutors uses artificial intelligence and data analytics to better match experts to learners. Additionally, in August, Varsity Tutors<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teachers-are-leaving-schools-will-they-come-to-startups-next/"> launched a homeschooling offering</a> meant to replace traditional school. It onboarded 120 full-time educators, who came from public schools and charter schools, with competitive salaries.</p>

<h2><strong>Financial performance</strong></h2>
<p>TechCrunch reviewed the Nerdy-SPAC investor presentation, which can be read <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1819404/000119312521021623/d104457dex992.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>Nerdy is among consumer edtech businesses that saw rapid growth and opportunity due to the demands of remote learning brought about by the coronavirus pandemic. In the second half of 2020, Nerdy’s annualized revenue surpassed $120 million. In the last quarter of 2020, the company saw its online revenue grow 87%, online paid active learners grow 59% and paid online sessions grow 169%, compared to the same time period last year, the business reports.</p>
<p>Drilling into its realized results instead of its more-favorable annualized performance from its third and fourth quarters of 2020, Nerdy saw estimated revenues of $106 million in the year, up just 16% from its 2019 result.</p>
<p>That growth rate is slower than what it managed in 2019, some 26% growth, and is around half of what it anticipates for 2021, namely 31% growth. But Nerdy has even stronger projections for 2022, a year in which it expects to drive revenues of $198 million, up 43% from its 2021 expectation of $138 million.</p>
<p>Whether the company can hit those goals remains to be seen; SPAC-led debuts allow for the company being taken public in the transaction to forecast more than companies that follow traditional IPO paths are allowed.</p>
<p>The company’s growth also failed to stem its losses. Nerdy is not yet profitable. Its 2020 estimates list an anticipated net loss of $23 million, which is more than it lost in 2019 but less than its 2018 deficit. Based on last year’s growth, Nerdy estimates that its net loss will slim to $8 million in 2021, and will achieve profitability by 2023.</p>
<p>How did Nerdy fail to reduce its losses last year as its revenues expanded? The company’s costs showed modest gains and losses, apart from its sales and marketing line item. That particular realm of expense rose from $38 million in 2019 to an estimated $44 million in 2020.</p>
<p>In contrast, while Nerdy’s net losses were largely static in 2020, its estimated net margin did improve from -24% in 2019 to an estimated -22% in 2020. It has a ways to go to reach the black, though its financials do indicate that the company thinks that net income is only a few years away.</p>
<p>To reach profitability, Nerdy anticipates it will require 2023 revenues of $267 million, growth from 2022 of 35% and gross margins five points stronger than its 67% result it estimated it reached last year.</p>
<p>A closer look at Nerdy’s business brings up a common question amid the SPAC boom: Is the reverse-merger being used to bring companies with lackluster near-term growth stories to the public market that otherwise couldn’t have? So far, a number of edtech startups <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2021-01-27-public-edtech-companies-have-been-rare-these-spacs-will-change-that">have taken the SPAC route</a>, including Skillsoft, Meten International and now Nerdy.</p>

<p>After edtech had a strong 2020, sector investors say to expect more exits as startups cross the $100 million ARR mark. Deborah Quazzo, managing partner of GSV, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/vistas-3-5b-purchase-of-pluralsight-signals-a-maturing-edtech-market/">told TechCrunch in December</a> that “what’s happening in edtech is that capital markets are liquidating.” The ability to move fluidly between privately held and publicly held companies is a characteristic of tech sectors with deep capital markets, which is different from edtech’s “old days, where the options to exit were very narrow.”</p>

<p>One of the most exciting, challenging and potentially lucrative areas of the IoT is the automotive sector. The car is a major component of most people’s daily lives, and a &#8220;smart&#8221; car could do a lot to save people time and money.</p>
<p>At the same time, the &#8220;Internet of Cars&#8221; carries with it dystopian visions of increased ad noise and security threats. It’s worth considering for a moment what these scenarios look like &#8212; good and bad &#8212; and how consumers can educate themselves to ensure that the cars of the future are driving in the right direction.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

	</div>
	</p>
<h2>The promises and problems of connected cars</h2>
<p>Imagine if your car was able to call your mechanic when the engine was showing signs of trouble. Imagine if the mechanic could read a data report from your engine and order the required parts ahead of time. Imagine if the data on those parts could be aggregated to warn of the need for any mass recalls? What if your car could communicate with other cars around it in a traffic jam, and the cars could all work together to space out and ease congestion?</p>
<p>What if your car could pay automatically at parking garages and drive-throughs? Anyone that owns a car is familiar with all these pain points, and the prospect of a new system that erases these spots of friction would be a welcome development.</p>
<p>But how can we ensure that all of this new data from our smart cars will be handled in a secure and private way? It seems likely, as car manufacturers work quickly to bring their products online, that tech giants will be the first partners to help implement the Internet of Cars. This might be cause for concern amongst consumers who are growing tired of their data being sold or hacked. The big tech companies aren’t inherently evil, but their basic business models are structured in such a way that consumer privacy and security are not the main priorities.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to imagine how the Internet of Cars could move in a much darker direction: Advertisements with real-time location data updating constantly on your windshield, personal data such as your driving habits stored on central servers, and a myriad of new vulnerabilities for hackers to exploit. How do we bring cars online so that friction in our lives is smoothed down without introducing a unique set of new problems?</p>
<h2>Data security must be the foundation of the IoC</h2>
<p>Of course Big Tech companies will be eager to offer connectivity for drivers, but it’s most likely going to come at the price of giving personal data over to Big Tech servers. This brings with it, as always, two major problems. The first is that centralized data represents a honeypot for hackers. No matter the strength of the security system, hackers realize that once they break through, they have access to the whole pot. The second problem is that the value of all that data is simply too lucrative for the owner to ignore. The data will always be sold, regardless of all the lip service promising to make it anonymous.</p>
<p>The IoT represents a new layer of IT integration in our lives; it will be at least as much of a game-changer as the internet was originally. Even with the advancement of the mobile internet brought about by smartphones, internet implementations have, until now, basically been carried out through clunky interfaces like screens, keyboards and mouses. The IoT is going to bring a new level of sophistication to how and where we interface online, but this also means a new level of intrusion into our physical reality. In the case of cars, we can be rightly wary that this new development might be problematic, but it doesn’t have to be.</p>
<p>Distributed ledger technology (DLT) represents a path forward for the Internet of Cars, because it builds data security and privacy into the foundations of any connected devices. Any model of DLT includes some basic concepts such that data is carried on a decentralized network of computers and servers. It also means that data is stored permanently, and that new entries of any data are subject to a mathematical verification. DLT is a fundamentally different way to handle massive amounts of data. DLTs have proven to be extremely resilient to attacks, and the data on these networks is nearly impossible to collect and sell.</p>
<h2>Picking the right tool for the job</h2>
<p>There are millions of internet-connected cars already on the road, albeit mostly with crude subscription services for music and weather apps. With further advances, connection will be much more encompassing, with the average connected car having up to 200 sensors installed, each recording a point of data, minute by minute. The numbers quickly become staggering, and in emergency situations, the need for data agility is apparent. Picture driving on a highway in medium traffic.</p>
<p>If someone’s tire blows out half a mile ahead, this information could be quickly conveyed to surrounding cars, warning of the potential for emergency braking. Any DLT solution would have to include a very nimble verification process for all these new packets of information to be brought into and carried by the network.</p>
<p>Additionally, because of the computational complexity involved, almost all DLTs today charge a fee for each new transaction brought into the network. In fact, the fee is an integral part of the structure of many of these computational models. This is obviously not going to be workable in a system like urban traffic that would be generating billions of “transactions” every day. The truth is that decentralized data networks were never designed to handle these kinds of massive use-case scenarios. Blockchain, for example, is very elegant at <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/censorship-resistance">censorship-resistance</a> in a network, and this has proven valuable in certain financial use cases.</p>
<p>But a DLT that expects a little money every time a car’s air conditioning reports its output is simply unusable for that application. Any DLT that’s going to give us a high level of security and real-time connectivity will also have to be feeless.</p>
<p>Security, speed and ease of adaptability through a no-fee structure are the three critical points for any network backing up the Internet of Cars. DLTs are clearly the most secure option, but they must also provide scalability and a feeless structure.</p>
<p>The example of being able to pay automatically for a parking garage visit might seem like a trite convenience. In actuality, if we can implement these types of small transactions properly from the beginning, then the hurdles we will jump in solving the complexity and volume of the car traffic data environment will go a long way to creating a safe, consumer-friendly Internet of Things in general.</p>
<p>When thinking about a completely connected physical environment, the alternatives to scalable, fee-less DLT are frankly scary.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket fuel technology startup Firehawk Aerospace has added $1.2 million to its existing seed financing, bringing the full amount invested in the round to $2.5 million. The new tranche comes from Harlow Capital Management, a Dallas-based firm run by Colby Harlow, who will join Firehawk&#8217;s board of directors as part of the deal.</p>
<p>Firewhawk, which was a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/firehawk-aerospace-aims-to-revolutionize-rocketry-with-safe-cost-effective-hybrid-engines/">finalist in our first-ever all-virtual Startup Battlefield at TC Disrupt last September,</a> has developed a new kind of hybrid rocket fuel that greatly enhances rocket launch safety, cost and transportation using additive manufacturing (basically, the grown-up version of 3D printing). Hybrid rocket fuel (which combines aspects of both liquid and solid propellants used previously) isn&#8217;t new, but past technology has been unable to compete on cost and efficacy relative to existing nonhybrid alternatives.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s Chief Scientist Ron Jones was able to get around these limitations with two new approaches: Using a fuel with a hard polymer structure and producing it using additive manufacturing instead of casting via molds with a liquid that hardens.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Firehawk now intends to use its seed funding to test its technology in operational conditions and at the kind of scale required for commercialization, and to build out its partnerships and client list. The startup also intends to grow its R&amp;D and manufacturing operations in both Texas and Oklahoma.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Each year <a href="http://okta.com">Okta</a> processes millions of SaaS logons via its authentication system. It kindly aggregates that data to find the most popular apps and publishes <a href="https://www.okta.com/businesses-at-work/2021">an annual report</a>. This year it found that the most popular tool by far was Microsoft Office 365.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that while app usage popularity varied by region, Office 365 was number one with a bullet across the board, whether globally or when the report broke it down by geographic area. That wasn&#8217;t true of any other product in this report, so Office 365 has extensive usage across the world (at least among companies that use Okta).</p>
<p>But as with everything cloud, it&#8217;s not a simple matter to say that because lots of people signed onto Office 365, Microsoft is the clear winner in a broader sense. In reality, the cloud is a complex marketplace, and just because people use one tool doesn&#8217;t preclude them from using tools that compete directly with it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a case in point, consider that the report found that 36% of Microsoft 365 customers were also using Google Workspace (formerly known as G Suite), which offers a similar set of office productivity tools. Further, Okta found that 42% of Office 365 customers were using Zoom and 32% were using Slack.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZXzyDOLKpe"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/how-should-saas-companies-deliver-and-price-professional-services/">How should SaaS companies deliver and price professional services?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How should SaaS companies deliver and price professional services?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/how-should-saas-companies-deliver-and-price-professional-services/embed/#?secret=ZXzyDOLKpe" data-secret="ZXzyDOLKpe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This is pretty remarkable when you consider that Office 365 bundles Teams with similar functionality for free. What&#8217;s more, so does Google with Google Hangouts, so people use the tool they want when they want, and sometimes it seems they use competing versions of the same tool. The report also found that of those Office 365 users, 44% are using Salesforce, 41% AWS, 15% Smartsheet and 14% Tableau (which is owned by Salesforce). Microsoft has products in all those categories.</p>
<p>Microsoft is clearly a big company with a lot of products, but the report blows a hole in the idea that because people like Office 365, they are going to be big fans of other Microsoft products, or that they can count on any kind of brand loyalty across the range of products or even exclusivity within the same product category.</p>
<p>All of this, and much of the other data in this report makes tremendously interesting reading as far as it goes. It&#8217;s not a definitive window on the state of SaaS. It&#8217;s a definitive reading on the state of Okta customers&#8217; use of SaaS, on the Okta Integration Network (OIN), a point the company readily acknowledges in the report&#8217;s methodology section.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you read this report, keep in mind that this data is representative of Okta’s customers, the applications and integrations we connect to through the OIN, and the ways in which users access these tools through our service,&#8221; the report stated.</p>
<p>But it is a way to look at the state of SaaS taking advantage of the 9400 Okta customers using the network and the 6,500 integrations to the world&#8217;s most popular SaaS tools. That gives the company a unique view into the world of SaaS. What you can conclude is that the cloud is complicated, and it&#8217;s not a zero-sum game by any means. In fact, being a winner in one area is not a guarantee of winning across the board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As a turbulent week in the capital world, we&#8217;re taking a look at something a bit slower moving: venture capital trends in Africa during 2020.</p>
<p>The Exchange has long explored quarterly and yearly data regarding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/in-2020-vcs-invested-428m-into-us-based-startups-every-day/">the North American</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/how-vcs-invested-in-asia-and-europe-in-2020/">European and Asian venture capital markets</a>, along with data on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/fintech-startups-and-unicorns-had-a-stellar-q4-2020/">particular startup categories</a>. From today, we&#8217;ll also provide regular examinations of what&#8217;s happening in Africa.</p>
<p><em>As an aside, we&#8217;re sorry The Exchange didn&#8217;t come out yesterday. The world went mad and we had to tend to breaking news. We&#8217;re back! </em></p>
<p>To dig into African venture capital results, we&#8217;re looking at a report concerning 2020 data from <a href="https://briterbridges.com/">Briter Bridges</a>, a research group that focuses on the continent&#8217;s private capital market. The Exchange also interviewed report author and Briter director Dario Giuliani about the collected data.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>What emerges is a generally growing venture capital scene, but one that had mixed results in 2020 compared to 2019. However, if we control for an outsized investment or two, things smooth out rather nicely.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s check the top-line figures, get insight from Giuliani concerning where the capital is flowing most rapidly, and wrap with a look at which startup categories are seeing the most investment in Africa today.</p>
<h2>Africa&#8217;s 2020 venture capital results</h2>
<p>During my time at Crunchbase News, I helped lead a team that generated acre-feet of reporting on the global and domestic venture capital markets. It&#8217;s difficult work that involves making decisions on what counts, what doesn&#8217;t and how to handle rounds that have not been disclosed publicly.</p>
<p>Over time, I&#8217;ve also become comfortable with venture data from PitchBook and CB Insights as well, and am now adding the Briter dataset to the trusted cohort.</p>
<p>During my chat with Giuliani, it became clear that his team is doing the hard and valuable work of carefully collating and sorting information. I say all of that simply to let you know that we now have a regular source for trustworthy information (compiled in concert with seventy different investing groups) on Africa that we&#8217;ll use regularly to keep tabs on the continent. This is a win.</p>
<p>So, what does the data say? We have to parse it some, as historically Briter has collated megadeals &#8212; which it counts as investments of $90 million or more &#8212; and M&amp;A in the same bucket. So, tracking just the dollar volume of African deals smaller than $90 million gives us the following set of results:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In recent years we&#8217;ve seen a whole bunch of visual/style fashion-focused search engines cropping up, tailored to helping people find the perfect threads to buy online by applying computer vision and other AI technologies to perform smarter-than-keywords visual search which can easily match and surface specific shapes and styles. Startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/12/donde-search-picks-up-6-million-to-help-fashion-retailers-with-visual-search/">Donde Search</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/13/glisten-uses-computer-vision-to-break-down-fashion-photos-to-their-styles-and-parts/">Glisten</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/18/syte/">Stye.ai</a> to name a few.</p>
<p>Early-stage London-based <a href="https://cadeera.com">Cadeera</a>, which is in the midst of raising a seed round, wants to apply a similar AI visual search approach, but for interior décor. All through the pandemic it&#8217;s been working on a prototype with the aim of making e-commerce discovery of taste-driven items like sofas, armchairs and coffee tables a whole lot more inspirational.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Founder and CEO Sebastian Spiegler, an early (former) </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/03/microsoft-confirms-swiftkey-acquisition-for-250m-in-cash/">SwiftKey</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> employee with a PhD in machine learning and natural language processing, walked TechCrunch through a demo of the current prototype.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The software offers a multi-step UX geared toward first identifying a person&#8217;s décor style preferences &#8212; which it does by getting them to give a verdict on a number of look-book images of rooms staged in different interior décor styles (via a Tinder-style swipe left or right).</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mjaQrBSIXP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/13/glisten-uses-computer-vision-to-break-down-fashion-photos-to-their-styles-and-parts/">Glisten uses computer vision to break down product photos to their most important parts</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Glisten uses computer vision to break down product photos to their most important parts&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/13/glisten-uses-computer-vision-to-break-down-fashion-photos-to-their-styles-and-parts/embed/#?secret=mjaQrBSIXP" data-secret="mjaQrBSIXP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It then uses these taste signals to start suggesting specific items to buy (e.g. armchairs, sofas etc.) that fit the styles they&#8217;ve liked. The user can continue to influence selections by asking to see other similar items (&#8220;more like this&#8221;), or see less similar items to broaden the range of stuff they&#8217;re shown &#8212; injecting a little serendipity into their search. </span></p>
<p>The platform also lets users search by uploading an image &#8212; with Cadeera then parsing its database to surface similar-looking items which are available for sale.</p>
<p>It has an AR component on its product map, too &#8212; which will eventually also let users visualize a potential purchase in situ in their home. Voice search will also be supported.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Keyword search is fundamentally broken,&#8221; argues Spiegler. &#8220;Imagine you&#8217;re refurbishing or renovating your home and you say I&#8217;m looking for something, I&#8217;ve seen it somewhere, I only know when I see it, and I don&#8217;t really know what I want yet &#8212; so the [challenge we&#8217;re addressing is this] whole process of figuring out what you want.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&#8220;The mission is understanding personal preferences. If you don&#8217;t know yourself what you&#8217;re looking for we&#8217;re basically helping you with visual clues and with personalization and with inspiration pieces &#8212; which can be content, images and then at some point community as well &#8212; to figure out what you want. And for the retailer it helps them to understand what their clients want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It increases trust, you&#8217;re more sure about your purchases, you&#8217;re less likely to return something &#8212; which is a huge cost to retailers. And, at the same time, you may also buy more because you more easily find things you can buy,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>E-commerce has had a massive boost from the pandemic, which continues to drive shopping online. But the flip side of that is bricks-and-mortar retailers have been hit hard.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;COVID-19 pandemic accelerated shift to e-commerce by 5 years, new report says&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/covid-19-pandemic-accelerated-shift-to-e-commerce-by-5-years-new-report-says/embed/#?secret=By5JcYBvj5" data-secret="By5JcYBvj5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The situation may be especially difficult for furniture retailers that may well have been operating showrooms before COVID-19 &#8212; relying upon customers being able to browse in-person to drive discovery and sales &#8212; so they are likely to be looking for smart tools that can help them transition to and/or increase online sales.</p>
<p>And sector-specific visual search engines do seem likely to see uplift as part of the wider pandemic-driven e-commerce shift.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason why I want to start with interior design/home décor and furniture is that it&#8217;s a clearly underserved market. There&#8217;s no-one out there, in my view, that has cracked the way to search and find things more easily,&#8221; <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Spiegler tells TechCrunch. &#8220;In fashion there are quite a few companies out there. And I feel like we can master furniture and home décor and then move into other sectors. But for me the opportunity is here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We can take a lot of the ideas from the fashion sector and apply it to furniture,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;I feel like there&#8217;s a huge gap &#8212; and no-one has looked at it sufficiently.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The size of the opportunity Cadeera is targeting is a $10-$20 billion market globally, per Spiegler. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The startup&#8217;s initial business model is B2B &#8212; with the plan being to start selling its SaaS to e-commerce retailers to integrate the visual search tools directly into their own websites. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Spiegler says they&#8217;re working with a &#8220;big&#8221; U.K.-based vintage platform &#8212; and aiming to get something launched to the market within the next six to nine months with one to two customers. </span></p>
<p>They will also &#8212; as a next order of business &#8212; offer apps for e-commerce platforms such as WooCommerce, BigCommerce and Shopify to integrate a set of their search tools. (Larger retailers will get more customization of the platform, though.)</p>
<p>On the question of whether Cadeera might develop a B2C offer by launching a direct consumer app itself, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Spiegler admits that is an &#8220;end goal&#8221;. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is the million-dollar question &#8212; my end-goal, my target is building a consumer app. Building a central place where all your shopping preferences are stored &#8212; kind of a mix of Instagram where you see inspiration and Pinterest where you can keep what you looked at and then get relevant recommendations,&#8221; he says<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is basically the idea of a product search engine we want to build. But what I&#8217;m showing you are the steps to get there&#8230; and we hopefully end in the place where we have a community, we have a B2C app. But the way I look at it is we start through B2Bb and then at some point switch the direction and open it up by providing a single entry point for the consumer.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But, for now, the B2B route means Cadeera can work closely with retailers in the meanwhile &#8212; increasing its understanding of retail market dynamics and getting access to key data needed to power its platform, such as style look-books and item databases.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What we end up with is a large inventory data set/database, a design knowledge base and imagery and style meta information. And on top of that we do object detection, object recognition, recommendation, so the whole shebang in AI &#8212; for the purpose of personalization, exploration, search and suggestion/recommendation,&#8221; <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he goes on, sketching the various tech components involved. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;On the other side we provide an API so you can integrate into use as well. And if you need we can also provide with a responsive UX/UI.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Beyond all of that we are creating an interesting data asset where we understand what the user wants &#8212; so we have user profiles, and in the future those user profiles can be cross-platform. So if you purchase something at one e-commerce site or one retailer you can then go to another retailer and we can make relevant recommendations based on what you purchased somewhere else,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;So your whole purchasing history, your style preferences and interaction data will allow you to get the most relevant recommendations.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While the usual tech giant suspects still dominate general markets for search (Google) and e-commerce (Amazon), Cadeera isn&#8217;t concerned about competition from the biggest global platforms &#8212; given they are not focused on tailoring tools for a specific furniture/home décor niche. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">He also </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">points out that Amazon continues to do a very poor job on recommendations on its own site, despite having heaps of data. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been asking &#8212; and I&#8217;ve been asked as well &#8212; so many times why is Amazon doing such a poor job on recommendations and in search. The true answer is I don&#8217;t know! They have probably the best data set&#8230; but the recommendations are poor,&#8221; he says. &#8220;What we&#8217;re doing here is trying to reinvent a whole product. Search should work&#8230; and the inspiration part, for things that are more opaque, is something important that is missing with anything I&#8217;ve seen so far.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while Facebook did acquire a home décor-focused visual search service (called GrokStyle) back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/08/facebook-picks-up-retail-computer-vision-outfit-grokstyle/">2019</a>, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Spiegler suggests it&#8217;s most likely to integrate their tech (which included AR for visualization) into its own marketplace &#8212; whereas he&#8217;s convinced most retailers will want to be able to remain independent of the Facebook walled garden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;GrokStyle will become part of Facebook marketplace, but if you&#8217;re a retailer the big question is how much do you want to integrate into Facebook, how much do you want to be dependent on Facebook? And I think that&#8217;s a big question for a lot of retailers. Do you want to be dependent on Google? Do you want to be dependent on Amazon? Do you want to be dependent on Facebook?&#8221; he says. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;My guess is no. Because you basically want to stay as far away as possible because they&#8217;re going to eat up your lunch.&#8221;   </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/joint-statement-market-volatility-2021-01-29">official statement</a> on the tumult of the past week in the public stock market. It&#8217;s a relatively brief statement and doesn&#8217;t mention any of the key players by name (aka GameStop, Reddit, Robinhood and others), but it does acknowledge that &#8220;extreme stock price volatility has the potential to expose investors to rapid and severe losses&#8221; that could &#8220;undermine market confidence,&#8221; and basically says the commission is watching closely to ensure that it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The SEC statement does specify that it believes the &#8220;core market infrastructure&#8221; remains intact despite the heavy trading volumes of the past week, which were prompted primarily by activity organized by retail investors acting in concert through organization on r/WallStreetBets, a subreddit dedicated to day trading. These retail investors resolved to collectively purchase and hold GME stocks (and subsequently, shares in other companies like movie theater chain AMC) in a bid to sweat out hedge funds with significant short positions in the same.</p>

<p>The ensuing high volume of trading activity from individual retail investors led to various actions from platforms that provide free trading to these individuals, including Robinhood, Webull, Public and M1. Robinhood initially cited &#8220;protecting&#8221; its users as the reason for limits imposed, but later revealed that a lack of funding to cover trade clearances likely caused the temporary measures, since it tapped <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/robinhood-raises-1b-after-trading-halts-to-keep-its-platform-running/">$500 million to $600 million in credit facility and raised $1 billion in funding overnight</a>.</p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s statement includes a callout that seems specifically directed at entities like Robinhood, and it&#8217;s fair to interpret it as a warning:</p>
<blockquote><p>In addition, we will act to protect retail investors when the facts demonstrate abusive or manipulative trading activity that is prohibited by the federal securities laws. Market participants should be careful to avoid such activity. Likewise, issuers must ensure compliance with the federal securities laws for any contemplated offers or sales of their own securities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Robinhood has already had run-ins with the financial regulator for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/robinhood-pays-65m-to-settle-sec-charges-for-past-inferior-pricing-execution-misleading-customers/">unrelated business practices</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/gamestop-hearings-congress-waters-robinhood/">lawmakers from both the House and the Senate, as well as NY AG Letitia James</a> have all expressed their intent to review the event and all surrounding activities, which likely involves the role trading platforms like Robinhood played in the week&#8217;s events.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a turbulent week for the stock market and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-users-say-its-restricting-trades-after-the-gamestop-brouhaha-shakes-markets/">halts to the trading of certain speculative securities</a> including GameStop (GME) and AMC, consumer investing app Robinhood has raised new capital. The new funds total more than $1 billion, with the company telling TechCrunch that they were raised from its existing investor base.</p>
<p>The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/robinhood-fundraising.html">reports that</a> the company raised the new equity capital after tapping its credit lines for $500 to $600 million; the company did not answer a question from TechCrunch regarding its credit lines.</p>
<p>The reported drawdown matches <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/the-somewhat-boring-reason-it-appears-that-robinhood-yanked-trading-on-some-securities/">reporting from yesterday</a> indicating that Robinhood had accessed nine-figures of capital to ensure it had enough funds on hand to meet regulatory minimums and other requirements related to its users&#8217; trading activity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Individual retail investors, along with institutional capital, have attacked short positions in some stocks in recent weeks, leading to a tug-of-war between bullish investors and bearish wagers; the resulting tumult led to surging volume for volatile stocks, leading to Robinhood needing more capital to keep its gears turning.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility">post</a> discussing its decision yesterday to restrict trading on select securities, Robinhood wrote that it has &#8220;many financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits,&#8221; adding that &#8220;some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets and can be substantial in the current environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unicorn consumer fintech company halted trading in stocks like GameStop that had become the center of the trading storm yesterday, leading to frenetic accusations from incensed users that something nefarious was afoot. Later in the day the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/webull-and-public-remove-restrictions-on-memestocks-after-citing-trade-settlement-firm-as-the-cause/">clearing house entity powering trading for other consumer trading services</a> also halted service for a similar set of stocks.</p>
<p>Robinhood told users that it would allow trading to begin in some fashion today in shares it had previously restricted.</p>

<p>It does not appear that the current trading scrap will abate soon. Shares of GameStop, the most famous so-called &#8220;meme stock&#8221; in the current trading war, is up just under 94% this morning in pre-market trading, implying that many investors are willing to continue pushing its value higher in hopes of breaking short bets laid by other investors.</p>
<p>One result of the current climate is a boom in demand for trading apps. Today on the U.S. iOS App Store, Robinhood is ranked first; Webull, a rival service is second; Reddit, a hub for trading gossip mostly via r/WallStreetBets is third; Coinbase a popular crypto trading service is fourth in line. Square&#8217;s Cash App, which allows for share purchases is ranked seventh, Fidelity&#8217;s iOS app comes in tenth place, and TD Ameritrade is 16th. Finally, E*Trade&#8217;s own app is ranked 18th. That&#8217;s a good showing for fintech, both startup and incumbent alike.</p>
<p>No one knows what comes next, how the trades play out or if the present-day retail investing surge in stock trading will persist. What does seem clear, however, is that today is going to be very silly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another COVID-19 vaccine is almost ready to begin being distributed &#8212; a single-shot inoculation made by Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8217;s Janssen Pharmaceuticals subsidiary. The company just released an<a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-single-shot-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-met-primary-endpoints-in-interim-analysis-of-its-phase-3-ensemble-trial"> efficacy report based on data from its Phase 3 trial</a>, which found that the new vaccine is 66% effective overall in preventing moderate to severe incarnations of COVID-19 in those who received the jab, and 85% effective in preventing severe disease.</p>
<p>Those numbers aren&#8217;t as impressive as the reported figures for the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines that are already being distributed via emergency FDA approval, both of which reported 90+% efficacy. But Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8217;s vaccine is a single shot rather than a two-course treatment, which should make it much easier to distribute much more quickly. The vaccine also showed 100% efficacy in preventing hospitalization or death among participants in the trial, 28 days after vaccination, which is a key measure when considering the broader impact of COVID-19 on healthcare resources. Efficacy varied by region, with the jab proving 72% effective in the U.S. across moderate and severe cases versus 66% globally.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also important to note that Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8217;s Phase 3 trial is happening amid the emergence of new strains of the virus, including much more contagious versions like the U.K. and South African variants. At the time that both Moderna and BioNTech released their trial data, these variants hadn&#8217;t yet emerged or been confirmed by pandemic researchers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8217;s vaccine uses a modified version of a common cold virus to deliver DNA that provides a person&#8217;s body with instructions on building a replica of the spike protein that SARS-CoV-2 uses to attach to cells. The modified adenovirus can&#8217;t replicate in human cells, however, meaning it won&#8217;t lead to illness &#8212; only an immune response that can later be employed to combat contracting the virus that leads to COVID-19. This adenovirus method is much more proven in terms of use in human patients versus the mRNA method that the other vaccines currently in use employ.</p>
<p>All of which is to say, despite headline numbers that appear to fall short relative to the data we&#8217;ve seen from Moderna and Pfizer, this Johnson &amp; Johnson report is actually very encouraging. The company says it expects to file a request for an Emergency Use Approval (EUA) from the FDA in February, which could see it begin to be distributed next month, adding yet another weapon in the arsenal to combat the global pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber&#8217;s plan to acquire Autocab, a maker of SaaS for booking and dispatch software for the taxi and private-hire vehicle industry, which also operates a global trip marketplace for taxis and PHVs (<a href="https://www.autocab.com/our-solutions/igo/">iGo</a>), is being looked at by the U.K.&#8217;s competition watchdog &#8212; which <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/600fe20fd3bf7f05be4d1e22/Uber_Autocab_Notice_commencement_initial_period_.pdf">announced</a> the launch of an inquiry today.</p>
<p>The deadline for a decision by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on whether to refer the merger for an in-depth investigation is March 26.</p>
<p>Uber announced its intention to acquire U.K.-based Autocab last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/uber-picks-up-autocab-to-push-into-places-its-own-app-doesnt-go/">August</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Competition considerations could arise if Uber, a provider of ride-hailing services that competes with traditional taxis and private-hire vehicle firms for customers, were to shutter Autocab&#8217;s alternative trip-booking marketplace or close it in selective markets where its own ride-hailing service operates, for example.</p>
<p>Although, at the time it announced the acquisition, Uber said it planned to support Autocab’s expansion of SaaS and iGo internationally. The <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">move also looks intended to create more opportunities for Uber drivers to pick up jobs from outside its own platform, including delivery work, as ride-hailing has faced a demand squeeze during the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>
<p>Nonetheless, the overlap between Autocab&#8217;s iGo marketplace and Uber&#8217;s core rides service certainly merits questions being asked about risks to competition.</p>
<p>The CMA has opened an invitation for comment on the merger &#8212; with a February 12 deadline for submissions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The CMA is considering whether it is or may be the case that this transaction, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 and, if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services,&#8221; it writes, adding: &#8220;To assist it with this assessment, the CMA invites comments on the transaction from any interested party.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Commenting on the inquiry in a statement, an Uber spokeswoman said: “We are cooperating fully with the UK Competition and Market Authority’s inquiry to ensure it can conclude its review as quickly as possible. We are confident that this acquisition is positive for consumers, will help local operators grow and provide drivers with genuine earning opportunities.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://sirenum.com/">Sirenum</a>, a platform for remotely managing a shift-based workforce across industries such as railway, aviation, construction and the gig economy, has raised a $2.7 million Series A funding round from new investors, including former Tesco CEO Sir Terry Leahy, alongside the William Currie Group.</p>
<p>Sirenum says its subscription model platform simplifies the process of managing shift workers, including rostering and managing schedules, monitoring and engaging staff, and processing key financial processes, including payroll. Its clients include Randstad, Impellam, Manpower and GI Group, as well as specialist agencies like TES.</p>
<p>The issue with shift workers is that they need to be in the right place at the right time and paid the right amount. Obviously. Sirenum says it allows staff to manage their own time by accepting or rejecting shifts and check their payroll at any time through a mobile app. The platform handles shift management, payroll, compliance and scheduling. The app also tracks the fatigue of workers based on the U.K.’s Health and Safety guidelines, meaning employers can track the wellness of employees and adhere to compliance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The product came about when Sirenum founder Benjamin Rubin ran a staffing agency in London. He was on honeymoon with his wife when he received a call that one of his employees had been hit by a train.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the employee was fine, but Rubin realized that to avoid being in that same situation again, he needed a tool to be able to manage his staff safely at multiple locations. He developed the Sirenum product as a solution for his agency and in 2012 won the contract to staff the Olympic Stadium. In 2014 Sirenum became a standalone product. It now claims to have nearly 400,000 workers on the platform.</p>
<p>Its competitors include TempBuddy (owned by Bullhorn), Shiftboard and WorkN. Shiftboard has raised $16.9 million to date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.chefclub.tv/en-us//">Chefclub</a> announced earlier this week that it has raised a $17 million funding round led by First Bridge Ventures. SEB Alliance, the venture arm of kitchen appliance maker Groupe SEB, Korelya Capital and Algaé Ventures are also participating.</p>
<p>Chefclub has been building a major media brand on social media platforms. It has attracted a huge audience that doesn’t look bad next to well-funded media brands Tastemade and Tasty.</p>
<p>I already covered the company at length, so I encourage you to read my previous profile of the company:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9TCyt6cAiK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/27/how-food-media-brand-chefclub-reached-1-billion-organic-views-per-month/">How food media brand Chefclub reached 1 billion organic views per month</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How food media brand Chefclub reached 1 billion organic views per month&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/27/how-food-media-brand-chefclub-reached-1-billion-organic-views-per-month/embed/#?secret=9TCyt6cAiK" data-secret="9TCyt6cAiK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Chefclub is an interesting lesson in sales funnel. It has a huge top of the funnel with 100 million followers on YouTube, Snapchat, Instagram and TikTok. Overall, they generate more than 1 billion views per month.</p>
<p>The company leverages that audience to create new products. It starts with cooking books, obviously. Chefclub has sold 700,000 books so far. As those books are self-published, the company gets to keep a good chunk of the revenue.</p>
<p>More recently, the startup has launched cooking kits for kids, with colorful measuring cups, cooking accessories and easy-to-understand recipes; 150,000 people have bought a product for children.</p>
<p>Chefclub now wants to display its brands in stores thanks to partnerships. That’s why having Groupe SEB as an investor makes sense. You can imagine co-branded items boosted by promotion on Chefclub’s accounts.</p>
<p>Finally, the startup plans to enter a new market — consumer-packaged goods. That’s the same thinking behind it, except that we’re talking about food. It’s interesting to see that Chefclub doesn’t think online ads represent the future of the company. And it seems like a smart decision during the current economic crisis.</p>

<p>The company said it has self-developed an isolated charging pile that has five phase interference antennas built-in, which can “accurately detect the location of the smartphone.”</p>
<p>A phase control array composed of 144 antennas transmits millimeter-wide waves directly to the phone through beamforming, the company said, adding that “in the near future” the system will also be able to work with smart watches, bracelets and other wearable devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A company spokesperson said Xiaomi, which has previously introduced <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-80w-wireless-charging-fills-4000mah-battery-19-minutes/">80W</a> and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-mi-10-ultra-first-phone-qualcomm-quick-charge-5/">120W</a> wireless charging tech, won’t be deploying this new system to consumer products this year.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/xsFHKCcV2rg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the company has described the mechanics of its new tech:</p>
<blockquote><p>On the smartphone side, Xiaomi has also developed a miniaturized antenna array with built-in “beacon antenna” and “receiving antenna array”. Beacon antenna broadcasts position information with low power consumption. The receiving antenna array composed of 14 antennas converts the millimeter wave signal emitted by the charging pile into electric energy through the rectifier circuit, to turn the sci-fi charging experience into reality.</p>
<p>Currently, Xiaomi remote charging technology is capable of 5-watt remote charging for a single device within a radius of several meters. Apart from that, multiple devices can also be charged at the same time (each device supports 5 watts), and even physical obstacles do not reduce the charging efficiency.</p></blockquote>
<p>News site XDA-Developers <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/motorola-no-contact-wireless-charging/">reported</a> on Friday that a Motorola executive also demonstrated a prototype remote charging system that appears to deliver power over the air. No word on when its tech will hit consumer devices either.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German startup <a href="https://traderepublic.com">Trade Republic</a> is rolling out its app and service in France this week. This is a significant expansion move as Trade Republic has only been available in Germany and Austria so far.</p>
<p>Trade Republic lets you buy and sell shares or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from your phone with low, transparent fees. The company charges €1 ($1.21) in fees per order, whether you’re buying a single share worth €100 or allocating €10,000 of your savings on an ETF. The company promises that it doesn’t add any commission on top of that €1.</p>
<p>The startup lets you buy European shares as well as stock in Asian or American companies. Overall, there are 7,500 shares and ETFs available in the app. While the service is relatively new, Trade Republic has been working on its infrastructure for several years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Behind the scenes, the company has partnered with <a href="https://www.solarisbank.com/en/">Solarisbank</a>, a German banking-as-a-service platform regulated by German authorities. It means that your deposits are covered up to €100,000 ($121,000) in case of bankruptcy. When you’re submitting an order, Trade Republic works with LS Exchange and HSBC Transaction Services to handle those shares.</p>
<p>Trade Republic wants to position itself differently from Robinhood. The company thinks there are currently two options when it comes to trading.</p>
<p>You can open a trading account with your bank or a legacy broker, but they’ll charge a lot of money. Or you can use a mobile-first broker, but they’ll push you toward risky assets and day trading. And as we’ve seen this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-users-say-its-restricting-trades-after-the-gamestop-brouhaha-shakes-markets/">with the GameStop saga</a>, the second option can lead to some backlash.</p>
<p>Trade Republic is promoting a third way — low fees and low risk. The company wants to promote savings plans, for instance. Those plans let you buy shares progressively, which should protect users against volatility.</p>
<p>The company raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/trade-republic-a-german-robinhood-raises-67m-led-by-accel-and-founders-fund/">€62 million funding round</a> ($75.22 million at today’s rate) last year. The Series B round was co-led by Accel and Founders Fund.</p>
<p>As for French users, don’t forget that you have to declare that you have a <a href="https://www.impots.gouv.fr/portail/international-particulier/questions/comment-declarer-mes-comptes-et-mes-contrats-dassurance-vie">foreign bank account</a> when you file your taxes. Foreign brokers also don’t necessarily send information to tax authorities to pre-fill your tax reports. But if you’re fine with that, Trade Republic is most likely cheaper than your bank.</p>
