										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/norrsken-foundation-is-closing-on-an-oversubscribed-impact-venture-fund-at-125-million-euros/"> close of its latest investment</a> fund, <a href="https://www.norrsken.vc/">Norrsken VC</a> is is taking an unprecedented step in tying the compensation of its partners to the positive changes the firm&#8217;s portfolio companies have on the world &#8212; and not just their financial returns.</p>
<p>The firm, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HDDfC3EHopJz0zI8FSAX0b_iOgMX31IZ/view">which released its impact assessment for 2020 last week</a>, has invested in companies that address seven of the United Nations&#8217; <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">seventeen sustainable development goals</a>, and is benchmarking its performance on goals that range from the tightly monitored to the slightly tautological.</p>
<p>In some instances, the goals are simply customer metrics (with the assumption that the more customers on a product, the better they&#8217;re doing). To be fair, these are in areas like education and healthcare where the true impact of a company&#8217;s services are harder to measure.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The firm&#8217;s portfolio has much more tangible progress in the climate change mitigation and sustainability space. Here, emissions avoided or increases in energy efficiency can be measured quite easily.  And those energy efficiency gains and emissions reductions, along with lower waste associated with the firm&#8217;s food and agtech businesses are where the firm has seen its best performance.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Norrsken Foundation is closing on an oversubscribed impact venture fund at €125 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/norrsken-foundation-is-closing-on-an-oversubscribed-impact-venture-fund-at-125-million-euros/embed/#?secret=HRtDhCy8B2" data-secret="HRtDhCy8B2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>When they exit, this performance will matter a great deal to the partners at Norrsken, because their compensation is directly affected by it.</p>
<p>&#8220;For each investment that we make, we set targets pre-investment for what we want to see in terms of impact,&#8221; said Tove Larsson, a general partner with Norrsken VC. &#8220;We do that together with some of our key LPs in the fund. We need to get the advisory committee&#8217;s approval of the targets. We set thsoe targets for an individual year and then on an annual basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the fund reaches the end of its cycle, the firm will look at the aggregated outcome of all of the impact KPIs and will weight the results of each company&#8217;s impact based o the amount we invested in each company. Based on that, the firm decides whether the team gets any carried interest or not.</p>
<p>If the portfolio companies hit sixty percent of the impact targets that have been set by the firm and its advisory board members, then they receive half of the carried interest, with the rest donated to charity. &#8220;There&#8217;s a linear escalation up to 100 percent. And if we don&#8217;t achieve that then the carried interest will be paid out to a charity organization or an NGO,&#8221; said Larsson.</p>

<p>The partners at Norrsken see their novel compensation structure as a point of differentiation, especially as the number of firms focused on themes related to the UN&#8217;s sustainable development goals continues to increase dramatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;We we started to invest, we were one of the first &#8212; four years ago. Then the market evolved so quickly where we got questions around how do you stand out and how do you know whether you&#8217;re truly an impact player,&#8221; said Agate Freimane, a general partner at the firm.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a core part of the DNA. We need to do better and show that we can walk the talk,&#8221; Freimane said. So the firm took a page from the European Investment Fund, whose operations impose similar restrictions on compensation, she said. &#8220;When we heard about this way of doing it, we said tis make 100 percent sense, and why doesn&#8217;t everyone do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>So far, the team hasn&#8217;t had any problems hitting the target it had set. &#8220;We&#8217;re at 119 percent of the 2020 targets,&#8221; Freimane said. Still that&#8217;s only 12 percent of the long term targets. &#8220;At the moment, we&#8217;v e done one tenth of what we need to do over the lifetime of the fund.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if some of the targets may be&#8230; imprecise&#8230; the steps that the firm&#8217;s portfolio companies have taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and food waste, and improving energy efficiency are having a real, measurable imapct. Whether that&#8217;s the reduction of data center energy demand by 10 Gigawatt hours thanks to the deployment of Submer technologies; reducing 11,000 tons of food waste through operations at Karma, Whywaste, Matsmart or Olio; saving 4 million liters of water from carwashes using Woshapp; or the development of 38 megawatts of solar projects thanks to the work of Alight.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2131091" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131091" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2131091" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Norrsken.Impact.png" alt="" width="1024" height="535" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Norrsken.Impact.png 2814w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Norrsken.Impact.png?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Norrsken.Impact.png?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Norrsken.Impact.png?resize=768,401 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Norrsken.Impact.png?resize=680,355 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Norrsken.Impact.png?resize=1536,802 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Norrsken.Impact.png?resize=2048,1070 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Norrsken.Impact.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2131091" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: <a href="https://www.norrsken.vc">Norrsken VC</a></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What we’re most proud of is that we’re actually doing this now,&#8221; said Larsson. &#8220;It’s not perfect, what we have delivered now, But we really think we need to start somewhere and it is key that the industry needs to become more transparent. The first thing we mentioned is that we think it is an achievement that we are tracking it and making it public.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Before COVID, we worked out of an office in Brooklyn that had 10+ recording studios and a number of small, glass-walled meeting rooms set up for the table reads we call “edits.” We spent much of the day wandering around the office looking for one another in these offices and studios, which I guess is how I racked up an average of 6,700 steps a day in 2019 without really trying. Anyway, during the pandemic, we switched to recording ourselves and our interviews at home on portable recorders, which Gimlet provided.</p>
<p>We all use Zoom recorders and directional/shotgun mics. My recorder is a Zoom H6 and my mic is a Sennheiser MKE600. I think this is a very good quality mic because I don’t find a need to go into a closet or under a blanket to record myself. I just sit in my room, hold the mic to my chin and hit record. It seems to turn out fine, although maybe the audio engineers are secretly furious with me for this. The only way to know for sure is to repeatedly tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/petaplaysbass?lang=en">@petaplaysbass</a> demanding answers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130990" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130990" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2130990" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-i-pod-2-.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-i-pod-2-.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-i-pod-2-.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-i-pod-2-.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-i-pod-2-.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-i-pod-2-.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-i-pod-2-.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-i-pod-2-.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-i-pod-2-.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130990" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rose Rimler</p></div></p>
<p>It’s a different story when it comes to the audio we get from our guests. The most basic way to just grab audio from someone is to record their phone call, or Zoom/Skype/Google Hangout session. I do this with a cord that plugs in from the Zoom recorder into my laptop, or (via adaptor) into my phone. The problem with this method is that the “phone tape” audio is kind of hard to hear. I know this from personal experience because when I listen to podcasts that use phone tape off my iPhone, without headphones, I can barely hear what the person is saying. So, I think getting better audio quality from guests really does matter for the audience. How to do that? The best way we’ve come up with is to ask them to conduct the interview over a computer app while using their smartphone as a recording device.</p>
<p>The iPhone comes with an app called “voice memo” that most people can use, and the phone’s mic is surprisingly good quality. They record their end of the conversation and send the file to us. If I’m feeling particularly confident in my ability to direct people, I might also ask them to pick a quiet, well-furnished room, put their phone into airplane mode, and hold it in front of them as they talk so the mic isn’t too far away (or place it on a stack of books near them).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130991" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130991" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2130991" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-i-pod-3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="936" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-i-pod-3.jpg 3002w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-i-pod-3.jpg?resize=150,137 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-i-pod-3.jpg?resize=300,274 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-i-pod-3.jpg?resize=768,702 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-i-pod-3.jpg?resize=680,621 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-i-pod-3.jpg?resize=1536,1403 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-i-pod-3.jpg?resize=2048,1871 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-i-pod-3.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130991" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rose Rimler</p></div></p>
<p>We’ve always been a really collaborative show, which hasn’t changed since the pandemic. While the lead producer writes the first few drafts of the script, they collaborate with the host and editor to do re-writes the last week or so before we publish. That’s why we were always huddled in various offices before the pandemic, writing through the script together. The difference now is we huddle over Google Hangout.</p>
<p>Also, I get many, many fewer steps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has released an update for iPhones, iPads and Watches to patch a security vulnerability under active attack by hackers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212146">security update</a> lands as <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212256">iOS 14.4.2 and iPadOS 14.4.2</a>, which also covers a patch to older devices as <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212257">iOS 12.5.2</a>. watchOS also updates to <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212258">7.3.3</a>.</p>
<p>Apple said the vulnerability, discovered by security researchers at Google&#8217;s Project Zero, may have been &#8220;actively exploited&#8221; by hackers. The bug is found in WebKit, the browser engine that powers the Safari browser across all Apple devices.</p>
<p>It’s not known who is actively exploiting the vulnerabilities, or who might have fallen victim. Apple did not say if the attack was targeted against a small subset of users or if it was a wider attack. It&#8217;s the third time (by our count) that Apple has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/apple-says-ios-14-4-fixes-three-security-bugs-under-active-attack/">pushed out a security-only update</a> this year to fix flaws under active attack. Earlier this month the company released patches for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/apple-security-updates-iphone-ipad-mac-watch/">similar vulnerabilities</a> in WebKit.</p>
<p>Update today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</a>, but free, and made for your weekend reading.</p>
<h2>Well that was a crazy week</h2>
<p>I may be getting older, but it does seem that the pace of tech news has gotten stuck in top-gear. It’s bonkers. Think about how small a splash the news that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/wework-lines-up-for-a-second-run-at-the-public-markets/">WeWork is going public via a SPAC</a> made. It was small potatoes in the broader rush of happenings that blasted past us over the last seven days.</p>
<p>Y Comabinator’s Demo Day was this week, somehow, even if it feels like a few weeks have gone by since. Still, it’s what I want to riff on with you today. A nice early-stage break, we could say.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>During the one-day demo day rush, a few hundred startups showed off what they are doing in single-slide format. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-1/">covered some</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-2/">favorites</a>, but we had to leave far more startups on the shelf than we got to write about. Let’s add some names to the mix, shall we?</p>
<p>On the fintech front, a few names stood out to me during the hours I was able to tune in. <a href="https://alinea-invest.com/">Alinea</a> wants to build a trading app for Gen Z. I dig the idea as Zoomers seem <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/05/14/on-the-cusp-of-adulthood-and-facing-an-uncertain-future-what-we-know-about-gen-z-so-far-2/">far cooler</a> than any other generation. Why shouldn&#8217;t they get a native investing experience aimed at their demographic?</p>
<p><a href="https://imhapi.app/">Hapi</a> is a similar idea, but aimed at Latin America. Again, I like it. One trend I’ve enjoyed seeing in recent quarters has been the application of startup models that have worked in the United States taken to new markets, replicated with local tweaks, and offered up to way more people. Investing has long been artificially expensive. Here’s to making it cheaper.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atratopago.com/">Atrato</a> checks similar boxes, taking the Affirm-style buy now, pay later (BNPL) model to Latin America. I am generally less stoked about consumer credit apps than I am about consumer savings apps, but given the growth that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/as-bnpl-startups-raise-a-look-at-klarna-affirm-and-afterpay-earnings/">Affirm, Klarna and others have managed</a>, there’s real demand for their products. Let’s see what Atrato can get done.</p>
<p>Turning from Latin America to Southeast Asia, <a href="https://www.octifi.com/">OctiFi</a> is building BNPL products for that market. It’s not the only startup that we saw at demo day taking on that geographic slice &#8212; <a href="https://briohr.com/">BrioHR</a> is working there as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://buenofinance.in/">Bueno Finance</a> fits the theme of fintech for markets other than the United States and Europe, building what it calls “Chime for India.” If you think, as I do, that Chime and other neobanks are generally doing an alright job providing lower-cost, higher-quality banking experiences to less-wealthy consumers, this is an obvious winner. Of course most startups fail, but I like where their thinking is focused. (<a href="https://nextpay.world/">NextPay</a> is working on SMB digital banking for the Philippines; the list goes on.)</p>
<p>Another theme I had my eyes on were startups delivering their software via an API instead of as a managed service. It’s something that we’ve covered on The Exchange for ages. Some demo day names included <a href="https://dyte.in/">Dyte</a> (“Stripe for live video”), <a href="https://pibit.ai/">Pibit.ai</a> (an API to help structure data), <a href="https://dayra.co/">Dayra</a> (finservices for Egyptians via an API), <a href="http://www.enode.io/">enode</a> (energy provider-EV API), and so on.</p>
<p>Finally, there were a few startups working on services for IRL SMBs. <a href="https://www.thethirdplace.is/">The Third Place</a> is building subscription services for small businesses, while <a href="https://per-diem.co/">Per Diem</a> wants to bring quick shipping to companies other than Amazon.</p>
<p>There were a bunch of other neat companies (<a href="https://www.gimbooks.com/">GimBooks</a>! <a href="https://www.letsrecover.com/">Recover</a>! <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/">Wasp</a>! <a href="http://axiom.ai">Axiom.ai</a>!), more than I could ever write down for you. Now it’s time to sit back and see which grow the most in the next half year. But I left this particular demo day pretty excited about global startup activity. That’s not a bad way to close a Tuesday.</p>
<h2>Late-stage everything</h2>
<p>Amidst all the IPO and SPAC news (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/discords-10b-exit-compass-and-intermedia-cloud-communications-set-ipo-price-ranges/">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/a-look-at-4-ipo-updates-and-2-late-stage-funding-rounds/">here</a> in case you need to catch up), there were a host of big rounds worth our time. Two <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2021/03/26/607265.htm">came from the insurtech space</a>, with Pie (workers’ comp insurance) and Snapsheet (claims management) raising $118 million and $30 million apiece.</p>
<p>ServiceTitan raised $500 million at a quadrupled valuation of $8.3 billion, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/03/26/servicetitan-software-provider-for-tradespeople-reaches-85-billion-valuation/?sh=ac6307c19177">Forbes reported</a>. In about two years. That’s a chonky boi valuation differential. I suppose we’ll be covering their IPO next year. And accounting-focused Pilot <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/jeff-bezos-backed-start-up-pilot-hits-1point2-billion-valuation-.html">raised $100 million at a $1.2 billion valuation</a>. The pace of 2021 unicorn creation feels anything but slow.</p>
<p>And I can’t help but note that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-ipo-filing-suggests-robotic-process-automation-is-booming/">the UiPath IPO filing is pretty bonkers</a> in terms of illustrating how the company turned terrifying losses into some pretty reasonable economics. It’s looking like it’s working to pull a Snowflake, at least in GAAP terms.</p>
<p>I could add another 17 paragraphs with news just from this month and not even get close to all the eight and nine-figure rounds. It’s bonkers! Surely the Q1 2021 venture capital numbers feel like they should be both hot and spicy. More on that as soon as we get the data.</p>
<h2>Various and sundry</h2>
<p>I am not here to merely feed you vegetables, however. There’s a budding story that I need to get to in the near future that involves my favorite sport, and my job. More precisely it’s about F1 (the car racing thing) and tech.</p>
<p>Recently Cognizant <a href="https://www.cognizant.com/aston-martin-cognizant-formula-one">sponsored</a> the Aston Martin F1 team. Splunk works with McLaren. Microsoft has a deal with Renault’s team, now named after the car company’s Alpine brand. Epson, Bose and Hewlett Packard Enterprise sponsor the Mercedes racing team. Oracle sponsors Red Bull racing. The list goes on!</p>
<p>And this week Zoom <a href="https://www.sportbusiness.com/news/zoom-becomes-f1-official-partner-following-virtual-paddock-club-initiative/">announced</a> that it was getting into the F1 game as well. This is all very good fun for myself, and leads me to a hope. Namely that we see some tech companies begin to use F1 teams as a method of intra-industry competition. That would, one, allow me to write about F1 at work &#8212; like I am doing right now &#8212; and annoy more tech CEOs on earnings calls about why their team isn’t faster. I am sure that by now Splunk CEO Douglas Merritt is tired of my questions about his orange team. But I don’t want to stop.</p>
<p>So if you are a tech CEO, and you do not sponsor an F1 team, I shall from here on presume that your company is too small to matter, or too boring to be fun. And I am only mostly kidding.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Within 48 hours, the startup world experienced two momentous events: Y Combinator’s largest Demo Day ever, and the early investor exodus of Dispo, a photo-sharing app. Both events, while seemingly unrelated, taught us a lot about the importance, and difficulty, of due diligence in our current world.</p>
<p>For background, early investors in Dispo distanced from the startup after a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3">key investigation unearthed allegations</a> around co-creator and popular YouTuber, David Dobrik. Per venture capitalists I spoke to, the move to &#8220;sever all ties&#8221; with Dispo was unprecedented.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Spark Capital decides to ‘sever all ties’ with David Dobrik’s Dispo app weeks after leading deal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/early-investors-in-dispo-to-donate-any-profits-from-the-photo-sharing-app/">Early investors in Dispo to donate any potential profits from the photo-sharing app</a></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">So what&#8217;s the impact here? It&#8217;s a rude awakening on the importance of due diligence. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/you-can-only-invest-if-you-promise-not-to-read-the-fine-print-ok/">On Equity</a>, I argued that the Dispo news should nudge venture capitalists to do a more thorough job with vetting founders in the future. Dobrik&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1374149863135309824">questionable &#8220;pranks&#8221;</a> were always a search away.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even though one person doesn’t represent an entire company (Dispo’s team<a href="https://twitter.com/boop?s=21"> seems great</a>, for what it’s worth), investors still left because of what their money represented. Fast forward, this event could have a chilling effect on VCs working with celebrities or influencers. The liability just seems too huge to back a startup led by potentially problematic individuals, so either stay away or do your homework.</p>
<p>Well, you’d think. Ironically, 24 hours after Dispo investors backed away from the startup was YC Demo Day, one of the marquee startup events of the year. My colleague joked that founders don’t simply need to figure out how to get into Y Combinator anymore &#8212; they need to figure out how to stand out in the batch once they get there. The comment, made in jest, underscored a truth about the current startup funding environment: too noisy to handle.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/y-combinators-new-batch-features-its-largest-group-of-indian-startups/ ">Y Combinator’s new batch features its largest group of Indian startups</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/y-combinator-widens-its-bet-in-edtech-in-latest-batch/">Y Combinator widens its bet in edtech in latest batch</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/y-combinators-biotech-startups-incubate-a-new-generation-of-therapies-and-tools/">Y Combinator’s biotech startups incubate a new generation of therapies and tools</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Noise turned into free-for-all investments. One investor <a href="https://twitter.com/pitdesi/status/1374752923771543553">got an email</a> from a batch company saying essentially, &#8220;thanks for your interest, if you want to invest here’s a document, no due diligence required.&#8221; The startup was valued at $100 million. Another investor I spoke to said that a company asked for an investment without meeting the VC.</p>
<p>While these are only anecdotes, I think these pitches are illustrative of the disconnect between the importance of due diligence and the hype cycle we are in. As Dispo showed us, it’s net positive to vet your future partner, back the right startups and bring on the right money. As YC Demo Day showed us, it’s hard to go slow when you can go fast. If the money is dangling in front of you, how do you say no?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/pre-seed-round-funding-is-under-scrutiny-is-vc-pandemic-posturing-here-to-stay/ ">Pre-seed funding is under scrutiny, is VC pandemic-posturing here to stay?https://twitter.com/pjux/status/1374805872371666948</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/you-can-only-invest-if-you-promise-not-to-read-the-fine-print-ok/">You can only invest if you promise not to read the fine print, ok?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t have a solution to the disconnect, and ultimately the change comes down to the ethos of individual investors and founders. But at minimum, this week of extremes gives a dose of reality to startup mania right now.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll focus on a five-month unicorn, and Plaid’s harmony at Discord’s cost. As always, you can find me <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">on Twitter @nmasc_. </a></p>

<h2><strong>Exits, and Plaid’s lack thereof </strong></h2>

The startup was last valued at $7 billion.</p>
<p>Here’s what to know: The deal price feels slightly cheap,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/you-can-only-invest-if-you-promise-not-to-read-the-fine-print-ok/"> argues the Equity trio.</a> When you consider the fact that Plaid could be valued at almost double or triple for what it was going to be sold to Visa, one has to wonder if Discord has an anti-trust discount limiting its pricing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Who knew building a vertical software as a service toolkit focused on home heating and cooling could be worth $8.3 billion?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how much Los Angeles-based <a href="https://www.servicetitan.com/">ServiceTitan</a>, a startup founded just eight years ago is worth now, thanks to some massive tailwinds around homebuilding and energy efficiency that are serving to boost the company&#8217;s bottom line and netting it an unprecedented valuation for a vertical software company, according to bankers.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s massive mint comes thanks to a new $500 million financing round led by Sequoia&#8217;s Global Equities fund and Tiger Global Management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>ServiceTitan&#8217;s backers are a veritable who&#8217;s who of the venture industry, with longtime white shoe investors like Battery Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners and Index Ventures joining the later stage investment funds like T. Rowe Price, Dragoneer Investment Group, and ICONIQ Growth.</p>
<p>In all, the new $500 million round likely sets the stage for a public offering later this year or before the end of 2022 if market conditions hold.</p>
<p>ServiceTitan now boasts more than 7,500 customers that employ more than 100,000 technicians and conduct nearly $20 billion worth of transactions providing services ranging from plumbing, air conditioning, electrical work, chimney, pest services and lawn care.</p>
<p>If Angi and Thumbtack are the places where homeowners go to find services and technicians, then ServiceTitan is where those technicians go to manage and organize their own businesses.</p>
<p>Based in Glendale, Calif., with satellite offices in Atlanta and Armenia, ServiceTitan built its business to solve a problem that its co-founders knew intimately as the children of parents whose careers were spent in the HVAC business.</p>
<p>The market for home services employs more than 5 million workers in the US and represents a trillion dollar global market.</p>
<p>Despite the siren song of global expansion, there&#8217;s likely plenty of room for ServiceTitan to grow in the U.S. Home ownership in the country is at a ten-year high thanks to the rise of remote work and an exodus from the largest American cities accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>A focus on energy efficiency and a desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will likely cause a surge in residential and commercial retrofits which will also boost new business. Indeed these trends were already apparent in the statistic that home improvement spending was up 3 percent in 2020 even though the broader economy shrank by 3.5 percent.</p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">“We depend on the men and women of the trades to maintain our life support systems: running water, heat, air conditioning, and power,” said Ara Mahdessian, co-founder and CEO of ServiceTitan. “Today, as both homeownership rates and time spent at home reach record highs, these essential service providers are facing rising demand from an increasingly tech-savvy homeowner. By providing contractors with the tools they need to deliver a great customer experience and grow their businesses with ease, ServiceTitan is enabling the hardworking men and women of the trades to reach the level of success they deserve.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest pain points for startups and small businesses is keeping up with back office tasks such as bookkeeping and managing taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QuickBooks, it seems, just doesn’t always cut it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three-time co-founders Waseem Daher, Jeff Arnold, and Jessica McKellar formed </span><a href="https://pilot.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pilot </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the mission of affordably providing back office services to startups and SMBs. With over 1,000 customers, it has gained serious traction over the years. And Pilot has now also received validation from some big-name investors. On Friday, the company announced a $100 million Series C that doubles the company’s valuation to $1.2 billion.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bezos Expeditions &#8212; Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ personal investment fund &#8212; and Whale Rock Capital (a $10 billion hedge fund) co-led the round, which also included participation from Sequoia Capital, Index Ventures, Authentic Ventures and others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stripe and Index Ventures co-led Pilot’s $40 million Series B in April 2019. The latest financing brings the company’s total funding raised to over $158 million since its 2017 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founding team certainly has an impressive track record, having </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">founded and sold two previous companies: Ksplice  (to Oracle) and Zupli (to Dropbox).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pilot’s pitch is about more than just software. The company combines its software with accountants to do things such as provide “CFO Services” to SMBs without a full-stack finance team. It also provides monthly variance analysis for all its bookkeeping customers, essentially serving as a controller for those companies, so they can make better budgeting and spending decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also helps companies access small business tax credits they may not have otherwise known about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Pilot completed more than $3 billion in bookkeeping transactions for its customers, which range from pre-revenue startups to larger companies with more than $30M of revenue a year. Customers include Bolt, r2c and Pathrise, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pilot has also inked a number of co-marketing partnerships with companies such as American Express,</span><a href="http://bill.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Brex, Carta, Gusto, Rippling, Stripe, SVB, and Techstars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, Pilot says it aspires to the “AWS of SMB backoffice.” (In fact, co-founder Waseem Daher started his career as an intern at Amazon). Put simply, Pilot wants to take care of all those back office tasks so companies can focus more on growth and winning business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pilot strives to offer an “exceptional customer experience,” which is reflected in the fact that over 80% of the company’s business is driven by customer referrals and organic interest, according to Daher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whale Rock Partner Kristov Paulus said that white-glove customer service experience and Pilot’s “carefully-engineered” software make a powerful combination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We look forward to supporting Pilot in their vision to make back office services as easy-to-use, scalable, and ubiquitous as AWS has with the cloud,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pilot’s mission reminds me of that of ScaleFactor’s, an Austin-based startup that raised $100 million in a year before it </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/07/20/scalefactor-raised-100-million-in-a-year-then-blamed-covid-19-for-its-demise-employees-say-it-had-much-bigger-problems/?sh=3bba46b29285"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crashed and burned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But the difference in this case is that Pilot seems to have satisfied customers.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA["When the CEO sets that culture of customer obsession and customer delight, it sets the foundation for the future."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mayfield partner Navin Chaddha and Poshmark founder and CEO Manish Chandra met all the way back in 2003, well before Poshmark was even a glimmer in his eye. They stayed connected over the years, through Chandra&#8217;s sale of his startup Kaboodle to Hearst and after he left.</p>
<p>At a breakfast one morning, Chandra told Chaddha he was going to try to do everything from his iPhone for the next six months.</p>
<p>Over the course of that time, the idea for Poshmark started to percolate into something more concrete. Chandra, following Kaboodle, knew he wanted to do several things differently. The first was create an engagement and revenue model that was symbiotic, rather than starting with engagement and having to build out a business model later. He also knew he wanted to start with people first, and build a founding team that had deep DNA in the fashion world to pair with his technical background.</p>
<p>He met Tracy Sun, brought her on, and got to work.</p>
<p>This was back in 2011, and Chandra was absolutely adamant that he wanted Poshmark to be an app, not a website. So adamant, in fact, that during beta he actually provided 100 users with video iPods. (He recalled that he only got 20% of them back.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Lead with love, and the money comes.&#8221; It&#8217;s one of the cornerstone values at Poshmark. The company practiced that early on by holding IRL, and then virtual, parties, allowing users to show each other their wares and create an engagement cycle that offered instant gratification. The user base grew from 100 to 150 to 1,000 and so on.</p>
<p>&#8220;We still to this day use a similar kind of strategy in a much more compressed timeframe as we go to different countries,&#8221; said Chandra. &#8220;We focus on building the community first and then scale that community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chaddha and Mayfield led the company&#8217;s Series A deal a decade ago. On the latest episode of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/ecl">Extra Crunch Live</a>, Chandra and Chaddha sat down with us and walked us through that original Series A pitch deck (which you can check out below). They also participated in the Pitch Deck Teardown, giving their expert feedback on decks submitted by the audience. If you&#8217;d like your deck to be featured on a future episode of Extra Crunch Live, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">hit up this link</a>.</p>
<h2>Poshmark&#8217;s Series A Deck</h2>
<p><em><strong>Time stamp — 11:00</strong></em></p>
<p>Poshmark was built on a couple fundamental premises. The first was that the iPhone would transform the way we do just about everything. The second was more pointed: That fashion, at the time underserved by technology, was a discovery process over a direct search process. A decade ago, Chandra envisioned a fashion marketplace that mimicked shopping in the real world — walk into a shop and let natural attraction do its thing — without holding any inventory.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy. The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020.</p>
<p>Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/"> poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week we&#8217;re looking at the case of the missing Arizona app store bill, the latest on the Dispo drama and Facebook&#8217;s new audio efforts, among other things.</p>

<h3>So&#8230;where did that App Store legislation go?</h3>
<p>Arizona&#8217;s Senate was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22349302/arizona-hb2005-bill-vote-skipped-senate-apple-google-ios-android-app-store">supposed to vote on a controversial bill</a>, <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/HB2005/2021">HB2005</a>, that would make it the first state to regulate the Apple and Google app stores. But though the vote was listed first on the Senate&#8217;s livestream agenda on Wednesday, March 24th, the vote never came up.</p>
<p>Basecamp co-founder and Apple critic David Heinemeier Hansson, who submitted testimony in support of HB 2005, basically called the lobbying system corrupt.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s guaranteed that it&#39;s over in Arizona, but hot diggity damn.

<p>It&#8217;s true that Apple and Google had <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/apple-google-lobbyists-arizona-bill">hired lobbyists</a> to combat the bill, which would have threatened the companies&#8217; ability to continue collecting their 15% or 30% commissions by allowing app developers to use third-party payment processors for sales and in-app purchases.</p>
<p>Apple had its own lobbyist, Rod Diridon, working on the Arizona bill, and was said to have hired Kirk Adams, a former chief of staff to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, to negotiate directly with the bill&#8217;s sponsor, Rep. Regina Cobb (R).</p>
<p>However, others countered the narrative being laid out by Hansson, saying that the bill&#8217;s existence in the first place was the result of lobbying from Epic Games and others, and many lawmakers didn&#8217;t even know what they were voting on. A similar bill <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/16/north-dakota-senate-votes-down-anti-app-store-bill/">was already voted down</a> in North Dakota and HB2005 <a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/74279">didn&#8217;t seem to have much support</a> either, ahead of the would-be vote.</p>
<p>The Coalition for App Fairness (CAF), a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-02-17-coalition-for-app-fairness-behind-north-dakota-bill-against-apple">group backing these bills</a>, told us it didn&#8217;t know what happened to the bill, but was trying to find out.</p>

<p>Then again, an App Store bill getting mysteriously rejected without sufficient explanation is &#8230;fitting. <a href="https://t.co/C7ycLqTILc">https://t.co/C7ycLqTILc</a></p>

<h3>Dispo loses investor support, Dobrik</h3>
<p>Once-hot mobile photos app Dispo is becoming a case study as to why partnering with high-profile influencers and YouTuber-types without due diligence is just a bad idea. When a recent investigation exposed that a member of YouTuber David Dobrik&#8217;s &#8220;Vlog Squad&#8221; sexually assaulted her, Dispo&#8217;s early investors have been distancing themselves from the app.</p>
<p>Initially, lead investor Spark Capital said it would &#8220;sever all ties&#8221; with the company, TechCrunch&#8217;s Natasha Mascarenhas <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/">reported earlier this week.</a> Dobrik <a href="https://www.axios.com/youtube-star-david-dobrik-leaving-photo-app-dispo-55a03754-c051-473f-9e4b-5c9a3a8fbb0e.html">also left the board</a> and the company hours later. Two other investors, Seven Seven Six and Unshackled, said they would donate any potential profits from their Dispo investment into organizations working with survivors of sexual assault. (Cynically, one could argue, the firms don&#8217;t expect there to be much left to donate with this much of a stain on Dispo&#8217;s public image and the loss of its big-name backer in Dobrik).</p>

<h3>Facebook&#8217;s Clubhouse rival looks like Clubhouse</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2129329" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129329" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2129329" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?w=340" alt="" width="340" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?resize=768,1536 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?resize=340,680 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?resize=1024,2048 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129329" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1370937003253112834" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alessandro Paluzzi <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>New screenshots of Facebook&#8217;s unreleased audio product, still under development, show what appears to be a live audio broadcast experience that’s more of an extension of Facebook’s existing Messenger Rooms, rather than a standalone app experience. Facebook confirmed the images are examples of the company’s “exploratory audio efforts,” but cautioned that they don’t represent a live product at this time. The images show Clubhouse-like audio rooms with rounded profile icons and a listener section led by the speakers&#8217; friends &#8212; very much like Clubhouse.</p>
<p>While the company said not to jump to any conclusions about what this all means in terms of a final product, it&#8217;s interesting to see how Facebook is thinking about social audio experiences and where they could fit in on its platform. In this case, it sees it as a third option in Messenger Rooms &#8212; users could start either a private video chat with friends or a private audio chat, or they could go live to the public on audio only.</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg (rather boldly) went on Clubhouse to praise Clubhouse for what it had pioneered, saying it would end up “being one of the modalities around live audio broadcast.” It seems Facebook sees Clubhouse as just another networking format to be knocked off, like TikTok&#8217;s vertical videos or Snapchat Stories &#8212; both of which Facebook later adopted for its own platforms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">John Ruffolo isn&#8217;t as famous as some investors, but he&#8217;s very well-known in Canadian business circles. The longtime head of Arthur Andersen’s tech, media, and telecommunications practice, he joined OMERS roughly a decade ago when a former colleague became CEO and brought him aboard the pension giant to create a venture fund.</p>
<p>The idea was to back the most promising Canadian companies, and Ruffolo steered the unit into investments like the social media management Hootsuite, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/wattpad-the-storytelling-platform-is-selling-to-south-koreas-naver-for-600-million/">recently acquired</a> storytelling platform Wattpad, and the e-commerce platform Shopify, among other deals. The last was particularly meaningful, given that OMERS owned around 6% of the company sailing into a 2015 IPO that valued it at roughly $1.3 billion at the time. Alas, owing to the pension fund&#8217;s rules, it also began steadily selling that entire stake, even as Shopify&#8217;s valued ticked upward. (Its market cap is currently $130 billion.)</p>
<p>Indeed, after helping OMERS subsequently get a growth equity unit off the ground, an antsy Ruffolo left to launch his own fund. Then came COVID, and as if the pandemic weren&#8217;t trying enough, Ruffolo further underwent a harrowing ordeal last September. An avid cyclist, he set out to ride 60 miles one sunny morning on a country road, and was knocked far off his bike by a Mack truck in an accident that shattered most of his bones and left him paralyzed from the waist down.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That kind of one-two punch might drive someone to the brink. Instead, six months and multiple surgeries later, Ruffolo, is undergoing training and therapy and intends to bike someday again. He is also very much back to work and just taking the wraps off his new Toronto-based firm, <a href="https://www.maverixpe.com/">Maverix Private Equity</a>, which has $500 million to invest in “traditional businesses” that already produce at least $100 million revenue and are using tech to grow but could use an outside investor for the first time to really hit the gas.</p>
<p>We talked with Ruffolo about the accident and his new fund this morning. You can hear that conversation<a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/850276/8220060"> here</a> (it starts around the seven-minute mark, and it&#8217;s worth a listen). In the meantime, following are excerpts from that interview, edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re surely tired of answering the question, but how are you doing?</strong></p>
<p>JR: Well, when somebody says it&#8217;s great to be alive, it <em>is</em>. I actually never knew how close I was to death, to be honest, until about eight days after the accident. When I asked for my phone, just to kind of see what&#8217;s going on in the world, there was thousands of messages coming through. And I&#8217;m like, &#8216;What the hell?&#8217;</p>
<p>People were copying various articles. I picked off the first one, and it said, &#8216;John suffered a life threatening injury.&#8217; And I&#8217;m kind of thinking, &#8216;Life threatening? Why are they saying that? And the doctors came in and said, &#8216;Because it was. We thought that you were going to die in the first 48 hours.&#8217; I subsequently spoke to some of the top physicians [in Canada], and they don&#8217;t understand why I didn&#8217;t die on impact. That kind of scared me a little bit, but I&#8217;m so glad to be alive. And my recovery is far ahead of schedule. It was only within a couple of weeks where I started feeling my legs again.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You were basically pulverized, yet a <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-a-truck-nearly-killed-him-but-venture-capitalist-john-ruffolo-has-kept/">recent piece</a> about your recovery in The Globe &amp; Mail notes that within a month or so, you were back to thinking about your new fund. Do you think you might be . . . a workaholic?</strong></p>
<p>JR: Some people call it stupid. [Laughs.] For the two months, my first memory was worrying about my family and stuff [but] I have group of cycling friends &#8212; we&#8217;re called Les Domestiques &#8212; who have committed to cycling, and it&#8217;s a lot of folks who are investors, CEOs of big banks in Canada, we&#8217;re all close friends, [and] they all came to cocoon the family to make sure that nothing went wrong.</p>
<p>So very quickly, all of these folks take over every element of the family, and the kids were fine, everybody was fine. I then had a lot of time in the hospital, and I do get antsy, and I started placing the calls to the investors who were committing to this fund pre COVID . . . I just really wanted to tell them, &#8216;Hey, I&#8217;m not dead. All my faculties are there. Are you still gonna be there when I get out of hospital?&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>TC: Because they&#8217;re really investing in you and your track record.</strong></p>
<p>JR: That&#8217;s exactly right. And I gotta tell you, it&#8217;s an interesting comparison. I&#8217;ve had American investors, and Canadian investors. American investors are very transactional. They&#8217;re very fast to come in if they see a great value proposition. Canada is not the same thing. In Canada, I&#8217;m extremely well-known as an investor and there, it&#8217;s actually relationship-driven, which is both good and bad. It&#8217;s tough in Canada because they&#8217;re more conservative, however, they stick with you in bad times. In my case, every single investor, everyone that had committed on pre- COVID, came in. Then one in particular doubled the size of the investment. They just felt bad for me, and I was like, &#8216;Hey, dude, I will take that sympathy card. Anytime.&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>TC: You also see a real market for a Canadian-led firm to invest in Canadian companies versus taking money from American counterparts.</strong></p>
<p>JR: So now this is going a little bit to the thesis, which is not a new thesis from a US perspective but is new from a Canadian perspective: the great firms in the U.S., like an Insight [Partners], like a Madison Dearborn, Bain Capital, General Atlantic, Summit &#8212; we don&#8217;t have any of those in Canada. We have great venture capital firms, and we have great buyout private equity firms. But what was really happening here is the entrepreneurs who are building great businesses are not really tech entrepreneurs; they&#8217;re just traditional industry entrepreneurs. And really, all I&#8217;m doing is planting a Canadian flag and saying, Hey, we have a Canadian firm that will lead or highly participate in these deals [to help you scale that business].</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re drawing a distinction between old-line industries and growth-stage tech companies, in other words, and you&#8217;re going after the former?</strong></p>
<p>JR: [To me] a true technology company is one that actually builds the tool sets that are used by other businesses to make them bigger, faster, and stronger and I&#8217;ve been investing in those companies for 10 years with great success, but there&#8217;s a massive oversupply of capital in those spaces, particularly in the SaaS software space. It&#8217;s just not making mathematical sense on when it comes to a lot of these valuations. Meanwhile, when it comes to financial services, health care, travel, whatever, these are not tech entrepreneurs but they&#8217;re enlightened. We&#8217;re not introducing technology into the business, they already have it. But in one case, with a travel company we&#8217;re looking at closely, they want somebody who understands the travel space and also who understands technology and the impact as you scale globally.</p>
<p>The profile of the companies that I&#8217;m talking about have, on average, $100 million dollars of top line [growth], with flattish EBITDA, and that haven&#8217;t done any external financing with institutions. They&#8217;re growing at 20% to 50% a year, but they really want to become the next billion-dollar company.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How much of these companies do you think you can own and for what size checks?</strong></p>
<p>JR: We&#8217;re looking at 20% to 40% stakes in the business, so I&#8217;d say a significant minority, and we&#8217;re cutting checks of $50 to $75 million (U.S.)</p>
<p><strong>TC: There aren&#8217;t a lot of massive companies in Canada, Shopify notwithstanding. How do you get the companies you plan to work with thinking on a different scale?</strong></p>
<p>JR: Canadians might be a little bit more conservative, but the irony is, take a survey and [you&#8217;ll see] how many Canadians are running huge firms in the United States or in the Valley. It&#8217;s not inherent in Canadians [that they are risk averse].</p>
<p>Part of why I got into venture capital was I was so frustrated in the number of companies that were building products but couldn&#8217;t even generate revenues. Since then, I think we solved in Canada the zero to $10 million problem, then the $10 million to $100 million [challenge]. But starting around 2016 or so, I started to see companies that had $50 million, $60 million, $70 million in revenue starting to plateau, and the issue was global scalability.</p>
<p>In the U.S., so many companies can be a domestic company  and be a billion-dollar company. In Canada, our market is too small; you&#8217;re forced to sell on a global scale, and many Canadian companies struggle with that. So my focus now is that last part of the piece. How do we get these companies from $100 million businesses into $1 billion-plus?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Our reporting team watched more than 300 pitches over 8 hours at YC Demo Day and made a list of their favorite startups.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since the pandemic began, I have been pushing the limits of my imagination to try to picture what cities will look and feel like in the coming years.</p>
<p>If your town looks like San Francisco, where I live, it&#8217;s a pressing question: Our once-bustling financial district is a ghost town, but even in outer neighborhoods, the number of vacant storefronts is unsettling. People are starting to emerge after sheltering in place for a year, but we are a long way from fully restoring our shared spaces.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s going to happen to those semi-vacant office towers, some of which are still under construction? There&#8217;s been renewed talk of converting some skyscrapers into residential housing, but there are real economic/logistic hurdles to clear before that can be broadly applied. Scores of restaurants have closed in recent months; who will take over those spaces? I spend a lot of time walking around, and it&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve noticed a &#8220;Grand Opening&#8221; sign.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Seeking answers, Managing Editor Eric Eldon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/10-proptech-investors-see-better-era-for-residential-and-retail-after-pandemic/">interviewed 10 VCs who are active in proptech</a> and found that most were generally &#8220;optimistic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several expressed genuine uncertainty about the future of offices, but most were bullish about prospects for remote work, the rebirth of physical retail and the emergence of &#8220;third spaces&#8221; that will fill the gap between work and home.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/the-return-of-neighborhood-retail-and-other-surprising-real-estate-trends/">a companion article on TechCrunch</a>, Eric explores these broader shifts, concluding, &#8220;you can start to see a world emerging that sounds a lot more like the fantasies of a New Urbanist than the world before the pandemic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s who he interviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clelia Warburg Peters, venture partner, Bain Capital Ventures</li>
<li>Christopher Yip, partner and managing director, RET Ventures</li>
<li>Zach Aarons, co-founder and general partner, MetaProp</li>
<li>Casey Berman, general partner, Camber Creek</li>
<li>Vik Chawla, partner, Fifth Wall</li>
<li>Adam Demuyakor, co-founder and managing partner, Wilshire Lane Partners</li>
<li>Robin Godenrath and Julian Roeoes, partners, Picus Capital</li>
<li>Stonly Baptiste, founding partner, and Shaun Abrahamson, managing partner, Urban Us</li>
<li>Andrew Ackerman, managing director, Dreamit</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, BI transforms raw data into actionable information, but according to Charles Caldwell, VP of product management at Logi Analytics, &#8220;a gap exists between the functionalities provided by current BI and data discovery tools and what users want and need.&#8221;</p>
<p>Few BI tools actually integrate with existing workflows and most offer clunky user experiences, &#8220;leaving many individuals feeling like they need an advanced computer science degree to actually be able to pull insights out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of requiring workers to abandon workflow applications to access data, embedded analytics are more efficient and easier to use, says Caldwell.</p>
<p>In short, &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/its-time-to-abandon-business-intelligence-tools/">it’s time to abandon BI</a> — at least as we currently know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amid the pandemic, investors became laser-focused on sections of the pitch deck that address monetization and business viability — signs that founders need to come to the table with better-defined businesses in order to succeed.</p>
<p>Investors’ heightened expectations for monetization potential and a company’s positioning within its competitive landscape are unlikely to lessen in the years to come, even in a post-COVID economy.</p>

<p>Clubhouse’s hockey-stick growth is something most startups would kill for.</p>
<p>However, it also means that UX problems can only be addressed while in “full flight” — and that changes to the user experience will be felt at scale rather under the cover of a small, loyal and (usually) forgiving user base.</p>

<p><strong>The big story: Amazon makes PR push ahead of union vote</strong></p>
<p>Workers at Amazon&#8217;s fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama (a suburb of Birmingham) will vote next week on whether to unionize. In the meantime, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/amazon-goes-on-the-offensive-ahead-of-next-weeks-union-vote-counting/">Amazon is waging an aggressive PR campaign</a> against the effort and the politicians who support it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For example, in a response to news that Senator Bernie Sanders would be visiting Amazon workers, executive Dave Clark tweeted, &#8220;I welcome @SenSanders to Birmingham and appreciate his push for a progressive workplace. I often say we are the Bernie Sanders of employers, but that’s not quite right because we actually deliver a progressive workplace.&#8221; Meanwhile, the Amazon News account scoffed at Representative Mark Pocan for repeating accounts of Amazon workers peeing in water bottles: &#8220;If that were true, nobody would work for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>In response, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (which the Amazon workers would be joining if the unionization effort succeeds) put out a statement asking, &#8220;How arrogant and tone deaf can Amazon be?&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">There’s certainly no shortage of SaaS performance metrics leaders focus on. While all SaaS companies do, and must, home in on acquisition metrics, there’s also massive revenue potential within your current customer base.</p>
<p>I think NRR (net revenue retention) is without question the most underrated metric out there. NRR is simply total revenue minus any revenue churn <em>plus</em> any revenue expansion from upgrades, cross-sells or upsells. The greater the NRR, the quicker companies can scale. Simply put: the power of compound math!</p>

			One of the biggest and most impactful changes we made was to move new business, retention and account management all under our chief revenue officer.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Over the course of two quarters, Terminus grew its NRR by more than 30 points, opening up incredible new levels of growth opportunities.</p>
<p>To boost our NRR for the better, I focused on three core pillars within our organization.</p>
<h2>People</h2>
<p>We took a holistic look at the organization and our org structure. One of the biggest and most impactful changes we made was to move new business, retention and account management all under our chief revenue officer. At the end of the day, it just makes a ton of sense to have acquisition and retention living under the same roof &#8212; why bother acquiring new customers if you can’t retain them?</p>
<p>We also rolled out a surround-sound team (around three or four people per customer) who onboard and help customers with their account from day one. In total, we have about a quarter of our company dedicated to this 24/7 support and hands-on guidance to ensure we’re enabling customers immediately.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last October as <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a> was preparing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/slack-introduces-new-features-to-ease-messaging-between-business-partners/">for its virtual Frontiers conference</a>, the company began thinking about different ways people could communicate on the platform. While it had built its name on being able to integrate a lot of services in a single place to alleviate the dreaded task-switching phenomenon, it has been largely text-based up until now.</p>
<p>More recently, Slack has started developing a few new features that could bring different ways of interacting to the platform. CEO Stewart Butterfield discussed them on Thursday with former TechCrunch reporter Josh Constine, now a SignalFire investor, <a href="https://constine.substack.com/p/taming-the-hybrid-work-chimera-tips">in a Clubhouse interview</a>.</p>
<p>The talk was about the future of work, and Slack believes these new ways of communicating could help employees better connect online as we shift to a hybrid work world &#8212; one which has been hastened by the pandemic over the last year. There is a general consensus that many companies will continue to work in a hybrid fashion, even when the pandemic is over.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For starters, Slack aims to add a way to communicate by video. But instead of trying to compete with Zoom or Microsoft Teams, Slack is envisioning an experience that&#8217;s more like Instagram Stories.</p>
<p>Think about the CEO sharing an important announcement with the company, or the kind of information that might have gone out in a companywide email. Instead, you can skip the inbox and deliver the message directly by video. It&#8217;s taking a page from the consumer approach to social and trying to move it into the enterprise.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="y6at1voAY8"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/slack-introduces-new-features-to-ease-messaging-between-business-partners/">Slack introduces new features to ease messaging between business partners</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Slack introduces new features to ease messaging between business partners&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/slack-introduces-new-features-to-ease-messaging-between-business-partners/embed/#?secret=y6at1voAY8" data-secret="y6at1voAY8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Writing <a href="https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/innovation-for-a-new-moment">in a company blog post</a> earlier this week, Slack chief product officer Tamar Yehoshua was clear this was going to be an asynchronous approach, rather than a meeting kind of experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;To help with this, we are piloting ways to shift meetings toward an asynchronous video experience that feels native in Slack. It allows us to express nuance and enthusiasm without a meeting,&#8221; she wrote.</p>
<p>While it was at it, Slack decided to create a way of just chatting by voice. As <a href="https://constine.substack.com/p/taming-the-hybrid-work-chimera-tips">Butterfield told Constine</a> in his Clubhouse interview, this is essentially Clubhouse (or Twitter Spaces) being built for Slack.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yeah, I&#8217;ve always believed the ‘good artists copy, great artists steal’ thing, so we&#8217;re just building Clubhouse into Slack, essentially. Like that idea that you can drop in, the conversation&#8217;s happening whether you&#8217;re there or not, you can enter and leave when you want, as opposed to a call that starts and stops, is an amazing model for encouraging that spontaneity and that serendipity and conversations that only need to be three minutes, but the only option for you to schedule them is 30 minutes. So look out for Clubhouse built into Slack.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, it&#8217;s taking a consumer social idea and applying it to a business setting with the idea of finding other ways to keep you in Slack when you could be using other tools to achieve the same thing, whether it be Zoom meetings, email or your phone.</p>
<p>Butterfield also hinted that another feature &#8212; asynchronous audio, allowing you to leave the equivalent of a voicemail &#8212; could be coming some time in the future. A Slack spokesperson confirmed that it was in the works, but wasn&#8217;t ready to share details yet.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible to look at these features without thinking about them in the context of the $27 billion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">Salesforce acquisition of Slack</a> at the end of last year. When you put them all together, you have this set of tools that let you communicate in whatever way makes the most sense to you.</p>
<p>When you combine that <a href="https://slack.com/connect">Slack Connect DM</a>, a new feature to communicate outside the organization that was released this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/slacks-new-dm-feature-connect-is-thankfully-opt-in/">to some controversy,</a> as people wanted assurances that they could control spam and harassment, it takes the concept one step further &#8212; outside the organization itself.</p>
<p>As part of a larger entity like Salesforce, these tools could be useful across sales, service and even marketing as a way to communicate in a variety of ways inside and outside the organization. And they greatly expand the value prop of Slack as it becomes part of Salesforce sometime later this year.</p>
<p>While it began talking about the new audio and video features last fall, the company has been piloting them since the beginning of this year. So far Slack is not saying when the new features will be generally available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Headless commerce&#8221; is a phrase that gets thrown around lot (I&#8217;ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/headless-commerce-startup-swell-raises-3-4m/">typed it several times</a> today already), but <a href="https://www.vuestorefront.io/">Vue Storefront</a> CEO Patrick Friday has an especially vivid way of using the concept to illustrate his startup&#8217;s place in the broader ecosystem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vue Storefront is the bodiless front end,&#8221; Friday said. &#8220;We are the walking head.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, while most headless commerce companies are focused on creating back-end infrastructure, Vue powers the front end, namely the progressive web applications with which consumers actually interact. The company describes itself as &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">the lightning-fast front-end platform for headless commerce.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Friday said that he and CTO Filip Rakowski created the Vue Storefront technology as an open-source project while working at e-commerce agency Divante, before eventually spinning it out into a separate startup last year. The company was also part of the latest class at accelerator Y Combinator, and it <a href="https://www.vuestorefront.io/blog/vue-storefront-raises-1-5m-to-turn-the-fastest-growing-open-source-ecommerce-project-into-a-business">recently raised $1.5 million in seed funding</a> led by SMOK Ventures and Movens VC.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VLG4AZMuci"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/where-is-the-e-commerce-app-ecosystem-headed-in-2021/">Where is the e-commerce app ecosystem headed in 2021?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Where is the e-commerce app ecosystem headed in 2021?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/where-is-the-e-commerce-app-ecosystem-headed-in-2021/embed/#?secret=VLG4AZMuci" data-secret="VLG4AZMuci" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We had to set up a new entity in the middle of COVID, we had to raise in the middle of COVID and we had to convince the agency to get rid of the product in the middle of COVID,&#8221; Friday said. He even recalled signing papers with an investor one morning in early December and doing an interview with Y Combinator that evening.</p>
<p>As they&#8217;ve created a business around the core open-source technology, Friday and his team have realized that Vue has more to offer than just building web apps, because it connects e-commerce platforms like Magento and Shopify with headless content management systems like Contentstack and Contentful, payments systems like PayPal and Stripe and other third-party services.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130922" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130922" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2130922" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Vue-Storefront-Mobile-Desktop.jpg?w=680" alt="Vue Storefront screenshot" width="680" height="371" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Vue-Storefront-Mobile-Desktop.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Vue-Storefront-Mobile-Desktop.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Vue-Storefront-Mobile-Desktop.jpg?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Vue-Storefront-Mobile-Desktop.jpg?resize=768,419 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Vue-Storefront-Mobile-Desktop.jpg?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Vue-Storefront-Mobile-Desktop.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130922" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vue Storefront</p></div></p>
<p>In fact, Friday said customers have been telling them, &#8220;You are like the glue. Headless was so complex to me, and then I got this Vue Storefront thing to come in on top everything else and be the glue connecting things.&#8221;</p>
<p>The platform has been used to create more than 300 stores worldwide. Friday said adoption has accelerated as the pandemic and resulting growth in e-commerce have driven businesses to realize they&#8217;re using &#8220;this legacy platform, using outdated frameworks and technologies from a good four or five years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rakowski added, &#8220;We also see that many customers actually come to us deciding that Vue Storefront can be the first step of migration to another platform. We can quickly migrate the front end and write back-end agnostic code.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because it had just raised funding, the Vue Storefront team did not participate in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-1/">the recent YC Demo Day</a>, and it will be presenting at the next Demo Day instead. In the meantime, the company will be holding its own virtual <a href="https://hopin.com/events/vue-storefront-summit-2021">Vue Storefront Summit</a> on April 20.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In October 2019, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/27/nyregion/nyc-amazon-delivery.html">reported</a> that 1.5 million packages were delivered in New York City every single day. Though convenient for customers and profitable for the Amazons of the world, getting so many boxes from warehouse to customer generates considerable negative externalities for cities.</p>
<p>As the Times put it, “The push for convenience is having a stark impact on gridlock, roadway safety, and pollution in New York City and urban areas around the world.”</p>
<p>Since that article was published, the global pandemic has taken e-commerce to new heights, and experts don’t expect this upward trend to slow down<a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/the-consumer-after-covid-19/575634/"> anytime soon</a>.

	</p>
<p>The same frustrations have plagued urban roadways for decades. However, technology is finally catching up, providing new means of addressing the challenges of crowding, pollution and parking enforcement on dense city streets.</p>
<p>As is almost always the case, an effective solution begins by first understanding the detailed circumstances giving rise to the problem. In this case, a simple means of assessing the problem is to observe curbside parking and street traffic using streetlight cameras.</p>
<p>Deploying cameras to monitor public spaces may immediately incite the ire of die-hard privacy advocates (I consider myself among them), which is why companies like mine have taken a privacy-by-design approach to product development. Our technology processes video in real time and addresses further concerns about potential misuse for surveillance purposes by blurring faces and license plates beyond recognition prior to making any kind of image data available either internally or to public officials.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;10 proptech investors see better era for residential and retail after pandemic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/10-proptech-investors-see-better-era-for-residential-and-retail-after-pandemic/embed/#?secret=i9e79lLV3H" data-secret="i9e79lLV3H" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The point of these cameras is not to surveil but rather to leverage concrete data from real-world city streets to generate crucial insights and power automations at the curb. Automotus’ computer vision software is already using this model to help cities manage the aforementioned flood of commercial vehicles on their streets.</p>
<p>This technology can also be used to optimize and incentivize parking turnover. According to one study, drivers in New York City<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/searching-for-parking-costs-americans-73-billion-a-year-300486543.html"> spend</a> an average of 107 hours per year searching for parking spots, at a cost of $2,243 per driver in wasted time, fuel and emissions, which represents $4.3 billion in total costs to the city. Similar wasteful dynamics are unfolding across America and the world. By collecting comprehensive data around the demand for curbside space, cities can design parking policies that ensure proper alignment between the supply of curb space and the way vehicles are actually using it.</p>
<p>In one pilot we ran on the campus of Loyola Marymount University, traffic caused by drivers searching for parking dropped by more than 20% after our data was used to adjust parking policy. Using data to optimize parking results in more efficient turnover, less time spent circling for a spot and reduced traffic delays. Real-time parking availability data can also be used to direct drivers to open parking spots via an application or API.</p>
<p>By arming city planners with accurate, up-to-date information on all forms of curbside activity, we empower them to fully understand the temporal and spatial patterns that rule their curbs. This gives planners the information they need to make informed decisions about curbside policy tailored to their city’s peculiarities.</p>
<p>Suddenly, questions such as “How many ride-hailing drop-offs occur here?” and “Whose delivery trucks are double parking on Tuesday morning?” become trivial to answer. Gone are the days of using vague heuristics to guide policy; this new wealth of information makes possible precise and impactful decisions on the locations of passenger parking, dedicated delivery zones and ride-hailing areas, as well as optimal rates to charge for parking, appropriate penalties for violations and much more.</p>
<p>This tech is also a win for delivery companies. When delivery fleets have data about real-time and predicted parking availability, this can improve route efficiency, saving them money. Instead of paying for curb usage via fines, delivery companies can instead receive an invoice for their time spent at the curb (a tax-deductible expense, I might add).</p>
<p>A<a href="https://www.columbus.gov/publicservice/parking/Loading-Zones-Rules-and-Regulations/"> study</a> done in Columbus, Ohio, found that designated loading zones decreased double parking violations by 50% and reduced commercial vehicle time at the curb by 28%. Radically increasing the efficiency of delivery translates into savings for companies like FedEx and Amazon, which can then afford to pay fair rates for their curb access and pass on those savings to consumers.</p>
<p>Several interrelated trends make the current moment an especially opportune time to apply new technology to our streets and curbs. Pre-pandemic, many cities already faced<a href="https://bbmr.baltimorecity.gov/sites/default/files/Final%20SOTA%20FY20-compressed%20web.pdf"> declining revenue</a> from parking as citizens shifted toward using ride-shares. Now,<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/14/cities-budget-cuts-coronavirus/"> thousands of American municipalities are expecting major budget shortfalls</a> in the wake of COVID-19. At the same time, a report from the World Economic Forum<a href="https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-future-of-the-last-mile-ecosystem"> predicts</a> that the number of commercial delivery vehicles will increase by 36% in inner cities by the year 2030. Our research suggests that more than 50% of parking violations are unenforced and committed by commercial vehicles.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no coincidence that Columbus was the<a href="https://www.industryweek.com/technology-and-iiot/emerging-technologies/article/21973956/and-the-smart-city-of-the-future-is-columbus-ohio"> winner</a> of the 2016 federal Smart City Challenge. When former President Barack Obama pledged over $160 million as part of his<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/14/fact-sheet-administration-announces-new-smart-cities-initiative-help"> &#8220;Smart Cities&#8221; initiative</a> in 2015, reducing congestion and pollution were among the program’s major goals. Better management of parking and curb space are crucial tools for achieving these aims. Though former President Donald Trump campaigned on a massive infrastructure plan, his delivery on promises in this area were<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-16/what-did-all-those-infrastructure-weeks-add-up-to"> mixed at best</a>. Despite the lack of federal support, there are currently promising initiatives underway in cities such as Santa Monica, which is<a href="https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/news/santa-monica-LACI-pilot-voluntary-zero-emissions-delivery-zone/579937/"> piloting</a> a zero-emissions delivery zone in the heart of its downtown.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden has outlined a plan to build the infrastructure America needs both to combat climate change and modernize urban transportation. This plan includes<a href="https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/party-platform/building-a-stronger-fairer-economy/"> a provision</a> for 500,000 public charging stations for electric vehicles; changes to our cities that allow drivers, pedestrians, cyclists and others to safely share the road; and investment in critical clean energy solutions.</p>
<p>Curb management technology is one of a suite of options on the market that federal and local governments can leverage to reduce pollution and improve quality of life in cities. If the incoming administration is willing to champion this novel approach toward solving the problems of urban mobility, America’s infrastructure will not just be modernized but made ready for the future.</p>
<p>I, for one, hope this renewal is realized; our nation’s health, safety and shared prosperity depend on it.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">This year is all about the roll-ups. No, not those fruity snacks you used to find in your lunchbox; roll-ups are the aggregation of smaller companies into larger firms, creating a potentially compelling path for equity value.</p>
<p>Right now, all eyes are on <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thrasio-reaches-1b-valuation-sets-new-us-speed-record-for-unicorns-301093829.html">Thrasio, the fastest company to reach unicorn status</a>, and its cadre of competitors, such as Heyday, Branded and Perch, all vying to become the modern model of consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies.</p>
<p>Making things even more interesting, famed investor and operator Keith Rabois recently announced that he too is <a href="https://www.axios.com/keith-rabois-startup-ecommerce-e164cd05-7c36-4dbc-9d95-7bc311179007.html">working on a roll-up concept</a> called OpenStore with Atomic co-founder Jack Abraham.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Like any investment firm, to be successful, a roll-up should have a thesis or two providing it with a cohesive strategy across its portfolio.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Thrasio has been reaping the benefits of the e-commerce market’s Cambrian explosion in 2020, in which over $1 billion of capital was invested in firms on a mission to <a href="https://www.marketplacepulse.com/marketplaces-year-in-review-2020">acquire independent Amazon sellers and brands</a>.</p>
<p>This catalyst can be attributed to a few key factors, the first and most notable being the <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2020/05/29/how-covid-19-is-changing-everyones-behaviour-and-how-businesses-can-react/">pandemic accelerating spending on Amazon</a> and e-commerce more broadly. Next is the low cost of capital, a reflection of interest rates making markets flush with cash; this has made it easier to raise both equity and debt capital.</p>
<p>The third is the emerging and quantifiable proofs of concept: Thrasio is one of several raising hundreds of millions of dollars, and Anker, a primarily Amazon-native brand, went public. Both stories have provided further validation that a meaningful brand can be built on top of Amazon’s marketplace.</p>
<p>Still, the interest in creating value through e-commerce brands is particularly striking. Just a year ago, digitally native brands had fallen out of favor with venture capitalists <a href="https://builtin.com/e-commerce/dtc-dnvb-brand-growth">after so many failed to create venture-scale returns</a>. So what’s the roll-up hype about?</p>
<h2>Roll-ups are another flavor of investing</h2>
<p>Roll-ups aren’t a new concept; they’ve existed for a while. In the offline world, roll-ups often achieve much greater exit multiples, known as “<a href="https://www.axial.net/forum/multiple-arbitrage-primer/#:~:text=Multiple%20arbitrage%20is%20the%20practice,company%20is%20bought%20and%20sold.">multiple arbitrage</a>,” so it’s no surprise that the trend is making its way online.</p>
<p>Historically, though, roll-ups haven’t been all that successful; <a href="https://hbr.org/2008/09/seven-ways-to-fail-big">HBR notes that more than two-thirds of roll-ups fail to create</a> value for investors. While roll-ups are often effective at building larger companies, they don’t always increase profits or operating cash flows.</p>
<p>Acquirers, i.e., those rolling up smaller companies, need to uncover new operating approaches for their acquired companies to increase equity value, and the only way to increase equity value is to increase operating cash flow. There are four ways to do this: reducing overhead costs, reducing operating costs without sacrificing price or volume, increasing pricing without sacrificing volume or increasing volume without increasing unit costs.</p>
<p>E-commerce could present a new and different opportunity, or at least that’s what investors and smart money are betting on. Let’s explore how this new wave of roll-ups is approaching both growth and value creation.</p>
<h2>Channel your enthusiasm: Why every roll-up needs a thesis</h2>
<p>Like any investment firm, to be successful, a roll-up should have a thesis or two providing it with a cohesive strategy across its portfolio. There are a few that are trending in this particular wave.</p>
<p>The first is the primary distribution channel upon which a company grows. Evaluating companies with a common distribution channel can be helpful for creating economies of scale, focusing marketing and growth resources in a specific channel versus diluting resources across several.</p>
<p>On the downside, these companies become reliant on this distribution strategy and any changes could create vulnerabilities for their portfolio companies. As a study, let’s take a look at how two companies take different approaches:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This week’s Amazon public relations push will no doubt go down as one of the odder public-facing strategies in tech. As some of the company’s biggest rivals were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/house-big-tech-hearing-energy-commerce-misinformation-extremism/">getting ready to virtually testify</a> on Capitol Hill, the retail giant’s CEO of worldwide consumer business appeared to suggest that Amazon is not only as progressive as self-declared democratic socialist Bernie Sanders, but also more effective in achieving those leftist policies.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Vermont senator’s visit to Amazon’s Bessemer, Alabama fulfillment center, Dave Clark tweeted, “I welcome [Sanders] to Birmingham and appreciate his push for a progressive workplace. I often say we are the Bernie Sanders of employers, but that’s not quite right because we actually deliver a progressive workplace.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/3 I welcome <a href="https://twitter.com/SenSanders?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SenSanders</a> to Birmingham and appreciate his push for a progressive workplace. I often say we are the Bernie Sanders of employers, but that’s not quite right because we actually deliver a progressive workplace <a href="https://t.co/Fq8D6vyuh9">https://t.co/Fq8D6vyuh9</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Dave Clark (@davehclark) <a href="https://twitter.com/davehclark/status/1374853182484963332?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 24, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The statement was unsurprisingly greeted with pushback from labor groups. The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) sent TechCrunch a lengthy response from president Stuart Appelbaum to the odd statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>How arrogant and tone deaf can Amazon be? Do they really believe that the wage they pay – which is below what workers in nearby unionized warehouses receive and below Alabama’s median wage – gives them the right to mistreat and dehumanize their employees, put their workers’ health and safety in jeopardy, require them to maintain an unbearable pace, which even Amazon itself admits that a quarter of their workforce won’t be able to meet, and to deny working men and women the dignity and respect they deserve.</p></blockquote>
<p>The organization, which is helping facilitate the Bessemer warehouse’s union voting, goes on to cite high turnover rates and pay cuts amid the pandemic and founder Jeff Bezos’s ballooning wealth. The founder &#8212; who is set to step down as CEO some time in Q3 &#8212; <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/21/billionaires-who-added-the-most-to-their-net-worths-in-2020.html">reportedly added more than $72 billion</a> to his net worth in 2020, as Amazon employees became essential workers amid COVID-19-fueled shutdowns.</p>
<p>“Stuart Appelbaum, Chief Disinformation Officer of RWDSU, in an attempt to save his long declining union, is taking alternative facts to a whole new level,” Amazon’s head of worldwide comms Drew Herdener tells TechCrunch. “But our employees are smart and know the truth—starting wages of $15 or more, health care from day one, and a safe and inclusive workplace. We encourage all of our employees to vote.”</p>
<p>For many in the U.S., Amazon’s online delivery service provided a lifeline, as many stores were forced to close over pandemic precautions. The Bessemer facility <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/birmingham/news/2020/04/16/amazon-officially-opens-in-bessemer-jobs-still.html">opened on March 29</a>, just as the first wave was cresting in the U.S. The company was anticipating a potential strain on its resources as record numbers of Americans were suddenly forced to stay home and were otherwise avoiding in-person shopping at all costs.</p>
<p>“Our team at Amazon is thankful for the support we have received from state and community leaders, and we are excited to be a part of the Bessemer community,” Director of Operations Travis Maynard said at the time. “We’re proud to create great jobs in Bessemer with industry-leading pay and benefits that start on day one, in a safe, innovative workplace.”</p>
<p>After several years of negative coverage over its warehouse working conditions, it’s not surprising that the company has become proactively reflexive when it comes to working conditions.</p>
<p>“When New York City became the epicenter [of COVID-19], that’s when the Bessemer facility opened up,” Christian Smalls, a former Amazon worker-turned-critic said at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/the-path-forward-for-essential-workers/">TechCrunch’s Justice event earlier this month</a>. &#8220;So the union got a head start on talking to workers. So that’s a gem for anybody or any union that plans on trying to unionize the building — that you have a facility in your community that’s about to open up, when opening, that’s the best time to connect with workers. That’s what happened last year. And as a result, the workers had seen what happened to the workers that were unprotected and they don’t want that. They want better for themselves.”</p>

<p>Next week, the RWDSU will begin tallying votes for what has shaped up to be the largest union push since Amazon’s 1995 founding, much to the company’s chagrin. In recent months, the company has been hoping to throw a wrench in the works. In January, it unsuccessfully appealed a ruling by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) that allowed workers to vote by mail, as more than 350,000 COVID-19 cases had been reported in the state since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Amazon expressed concerns that mail-in voting would monopolize too much time and resources. “Union avoidance” firm Jackson Lewis <a href="https://www.jacksonlewis.com/publication/plan-ahead-employers-nlrb-ordering-mail-ballot-elections-because-covid-19-pandemic">suggested</a> that such rules put employers at a disadvantage, “because eligible voters are given several days after receiving their ballots to return them to the NLRB, the impact and momentum of the employer’s voter education campaign is decreased. This does not exist in connection with a manual ballot election, where the employer may educate employees one-on-one until the last moment before they vote.”</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW: Amazon is running glossy anti-union ads to combat the organizing drive by workers at their Bessemer, AL, warehouse.

<p>The following month, Amazon ran anti-union ads on its streaming subsidiary, Twitch. The spots featured employees discussing why they were planning to vote no, and compelled people to visit Do it Without Dues, which blasted potential union membership fees.</p>
<p>“Amazon feels that it has to go to extremes like this in order to gaslight its workers about the dreadful working conditions at its Bessemer warehouse,” Appelbaum <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301352/twitch-removes-amazon-anti-union-ads">told the press</a> in response to the ads.

<p>Workers have continued to be critical of conditions in Amazon’s warehouses, frequently comparing the work to that of robots that have increasingly become their colleagues. Last week,<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/03/bessemer-alabama-amazon-worker-on-the-union-drive.html"> <em>New York Magazine</em> published a piece</a> from a Bessemer picker who describes long and tiring days on the floor.</p>
<p>“It really is not fair for employees to get fired for going to the bathroom,” the worker, Darryl Richardson, tells the magazine. “Sometimes the water in the bathrooms isn’t working on the floor, and you have to go down another flight of stairs to go to the bathroom.”</p>
<p>A number of similar stories have been recounted to the media over the years. Images of workers peeing in water bottles so as to not be docked pay &#8212; or worse &#8212; for taking a bathroom break have almost certainly become the most visceral.</p>

<p>When Wisconsin Rep. Mark Pocan called out Clark’s Sanders comparisons on Twitter earlier this week, an official account shot back, “We hope you can enact policies that get other employers to offer what we already do.”</p>
<p>Sanders has been a long-time critic of the company. The Vermont senator was one of a handful of progressive politicians who compelled Amazon to raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour, while criticizing massive tax breaks. In 2018, he introduced the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/bernie-sanders-intros-stop-bad-employers-by-zeroing-out-subsidies-bezos-bill/">Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (BEZOS) bill</a>.</p>

<p>“The taxpayers in this country should not be subsidizing a guy who’s worth $150 billion, whose wealth is increasing by $260 million every single day,” Sanders told <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/28/bernie-sanders-problem-with-amazon/">TechCrunch at the time.</a> “That is insane. He has enough money to pay his workers a living wage. He does not need corporate welfare. And our goal is to see that Bezos pays his workers a living wage.” That November, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/02/amazon-minimum-wage/">the company relented</a>, increasing minimum wage to $15 an hour &#8212; something that has since become a major talking point for Amazon.</p>
<p>Responding to Pocan’s comments about “union-bust[ing] &amp; mak[ing] workers urinate in water bottles,” the Amazon News Twitter account wrote, “You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you? If that were true, nobody would work for us.

<p>Pocan’s reply was simple: “[Y]es, I do believe your workers. You don&#8217;t?”</p>
<p>In addition to past reports of warehouse workers and delivery drivers peeing in bottles, a new report from<a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/25/amazon-drivers-pee-bottles-union/"> The Intercept notes</a> that the act is “widespread,” due to workplace pressures. It cites an email from last May that also adds defecation into the mix.</p>
<p>“We’ve noticed an uptick recently of all kinds of unsanitary garbage being left inside bags: used masks, gloves, bottles of urine,” the email titled Amazon Confidential reads. “By scanning the QR code on the bag, we can easily identify the DA who was in possession of the bag last. These behaviors are unacceptable, and will result in Tier 1 Infractions going forward. Please communicate this message to your drivers. I know it may seem obvious, or like something you shouldn’t need to coach, but please be explicit when communicating the message that they CANNOT poop, or leave bottles of urine inside bags.”</p>

<p>As misguided or glib as the Amazon Twitter response may seem, it’s clear why the company has gone on the offensive here. &#8220;We’re not alone in our support for a higher federal minimum wage,&#8221; the accounted noted in the wake of the dustup with Pocan. The company adds that it <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/job-creation-and-investment/new-study-is-a-powerful-reminder-of-the-need-for-action-on-the-minimum-wage?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=tw&amp;utm_term=amznnews&amp;utm_content=Ipsos_15&amp;linkId=114538207">has been pushing</a> for a federal minimum wage increase following its own.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Marco Rubio says he ‘stands with’ Amazon warehouse workers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/marco-rubio-says-he-stands-with-amazon-warehouse-workers/embed/#?secret=36y0ijhvms" data-secret="36y0ijhvms" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The push to unionize, meanwhile, has made strange political bedfellows, ranging from Stacey Abrams to Marco Rubio. Breaking with the customary party position, the Republican senator wrote in an op-ed, &#8220;Here’s my standard: When the conflict is between working Americans and a company whose leadership has decided to wage culture war against working-class values, the choice is easy — I support the workers. And that’s why I stand with those at Amazon’s Bessemer warehouse today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rubio&#8217;s support of unionizing was tied, in part, to concerns over a &#8220;‘woke’ human resources fad,&#8221; but it&#8217;s still fairly uncommon for an event like this to find him on the side of the likes of Joe Biden, who had previously promised to be “the most pro-union president you’ve ever seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amazon will no doubt be keeping a close eye on Tuesday’s vote count, aware that the results will have a far wider ranging impact than the 6,000 workers currently employed at Bessemer. If unionization fails, the company will tout the results as vindication that its work force is perfectly happily without labor interference. A vote to unionize, on the other hand, could well embolden further unionization efforts across the company.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">With Roblox’s massive IPO this month, game developers, brands and investors alike are wondering what factors cause the most successful games on this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/welcome-to-bloxburg-public-investors/">$47 billion</a> platform to break out from the millions of user-generated passion projects.</p>
<p>According to Roblox’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm">S-1 filing</a>, nearly 250 developers and creators earned $100,000 or more in Robux in the year through September 2020 out of nearly 1 million creators on the platform.</p>
<p>From Gamefam&#8217;s first game two years ago that topped out at only 25 concurrent players to our current portfolio with 2 million to 3 million daily visits, our team learned to develop on Roblox the hard way &#8212; by trial and error and by getting better at listening to the Roblox community’s unique gamer culture and vernacular.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Even the most experienced and talented game designers from the mobile F2P business usually fail to understand what features matter to Robloxians.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>For those entrepreneurs just starting their journey in Roblox game development, these are the most common mistakes I have seen gaming professionals (myself included) make on Roblox:</p>
<h2>1. Using the established free-to-play (F2P) mobile game mechanics</h2>
<p>In the F2P mobile games market, it’s all about layered game loops: play a match with the hero, level the hero up using resources from the match, buy more heroes to merge with the first hero, open up new matches with new rules to win more resources, and on and on. These require ongoing player tutorials across hours of play sessions. These mechanics tend to backfire on Roblox because players have no tolerance for anything but immediate, visceral fun.</p>
<p>Accordingly, in mobile F2P, a robust tutorial for new users is oftentimes one of the biggest investments during development. But in our Roblox game Speed Run Simulator (more than 400,000 daily visits), we saw a significant increase in D1 retention when we removed the tutorial entirely and just allowed existing players to guide new players’ understanding of the game. The differences between Roblox and mobile F2P are not only numerous but also sometimes profoundly counterintuitive.</p>
<h2>2. Optimizing to make money off of &#8220;whales&#8221;</h2>
<p>Roblox players spend because they’re getting something they want. They won’t be cajoled or coerced into spending like in a mobile game where progress is restricted or slowed without making an in-app purchase (think Candy Crush).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woven Capital, the investment arm of Toyota&#8217;s innovation-focused subsidiary Woven Planet, has announced an investment into Silicon Valley-based autonomous delivery vehicle company Nuro. This kicks off the new $800 million strategic fund, which will invest in growth-stage technology companies that could one day develop into partners or acquisitions to further a mission of building the future of safe mobility, according to George Kellerman, Woven Capital’s head of investments and acquisitions.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woven Capital&#8217;s contribution was part of Nuro’s $500 million Series C funding round, which was announced last November. Chipotle also invested in the round, which also included funds managed by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., with participation from new investors Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, LLC and Baillie Gifford. The specific amounts invested by each stakeholder were not disclosed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toyota announced the <a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/woven-capital-new-800m-global-investment-fund-toyota/">$800 million investment pool in September 2020</a>, and Woven Capital was officially formed in January 2021, with the aim of investing in technologies including autonomous mobility, machine learning, artificial intelligence, automation, connectivity and data and analytics. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nuro was a good jumping off point, because a lot of the work that we’re doing is really focused on developing autonomous passenger vehicles, so this is a way for us to learn and advance through a partner that is laser-focused on local goods delivery,” Kellerman told TechCrunch. “There’s a lot of opportunity to learn from them, and potentially over time, to collaborate and help them expand globally.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuro’s fleet of cargo-only self-driving vehicles has </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/nuro-can-now-operate-and-charge-for-autonomous-delivery-services-in-california/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already been approved by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles to test on public roads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, delivering goods from partners like Krogers, Domino’s, Walmart and CVS. The coronavirus pandemic accelerated the need for goods delivery, giving Nuro an opportunity to become a leader in this space. Woven Capital saw an opportunity to help accelerate and strengthen that leadership position, while also setting up a strategic knowledge sharing arrangement between the two. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Woven Capital] has assembled a great team with ambitious goals for the future, and we share a common objective of transforming the way people live and move to make life better,” said Nuro co-founder and president Dave Ferguson in a statement. “We’ll use this new capital, and the support of one of the largest automotive companies in the world, to continue growing our team and building a great autonomous delivery product.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automation will be a big part of Woven Capital’s portfolio, which exists to support all of <a href="https://www.thedetroitbureau.com/2020/08/toyota-creates-woven-planet-to-spearhead-tech-development-growth/">parent Woven Planet’s activities</a>, including <a href="https://www.woven-city.global">Woven City</a>, a testing ground for new technologies set in an interconnected smart city prototype. In February, Toyota broke ground at the Higashi-Fuji site in Susono City, Japan, at the base of Mount Fuji. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we think about Woven City, we think about autonomous mobility and automation more broadly,” said Kellerman. “To facilitate that, you’re going to need artificial intelligence, machine learning, data and analytics, connectivity. So we’re going to be building a portfolio that has investments in all those areas.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A growing trend in the mobility industry is to view mobility not just as the movement of people and goods, but as the movement of information and data. Woven Planet recognizes this and is taking a software-first approach, particularly when it comes to automobiles. This means that instead of the historical auto industry approach of designing the hardware first, and then fitting in the software to operate that vehicle, you start with the software and build hardware around it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building off a software-first architecture provides a lot flexibility for future innovation. If the hardware changes, you don’t have to rewrite the code, you could just add in another application. Kellerman said all the software Woven Planet is developing as a company should be usable in as many applications as possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having really strong, integrated software is also the logical next step for connected mobility, and it opens up doors for rethinking what a vehicle has the potential to transport. A Nuro vehicle isn’t just a vehicle for whatever groceries it’s delivering, but it’s also a vehicle for all the information it picks up along the way and transmits back to the cloud, such as traffic flows and weather patterns. The value, therefore, is less in the A to B utility, and more in the interchange of information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the information collected by Nuro that could be immediately useful to Woven City is that related to street safety. Nuro’s vehicles don’t carry passengers, so the design features focus more on the safety of people outside of the vehicle, the aggregate data of which could be useful in human-centered city planning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, Woven Capital’s long-term view is always a potential funnel to future mergers and acquisitions, said Kellerman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Toyota is not historically a very acquisitive company, but within Woven Planet we’re building a corporate development team with an eye to how we can accelerate the vision and mission of Woven Planet through strategic acquisitions, as well,” said Kellerman.</span></p>
