										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>
<p><em><strong>This Week in Apps will finally be a newsletter! It will launch on August 7. Sign up here: <a href="http://techcrunch.com/newsletters">techcrunch.com/newsletters</a></strong></em></p>
<p><em>This Week in Apps took a little vacation this month, so we&#8217;re back this week with a big round-up of all the news we missed &#8212; and then some. And a super-sized section of apps getting funded, too! Let&#8217;s play some catch-up&#8230;</em></p>
<h1>Weekly News</h1>
<h3>Platforms: Apple</h3>
<p><strong>ATT isn&#8217;t killing mobile game performance.</strong> An <a href="https://blog.apptopia.com/app-tracking-transparency-ios-doesnt-impact-mobile-game-performance">Apptopia report found</a> that Apple&#8217;s launch of App Tracking Transparency has so far had no clear impact on mobile game download performance or monetization performance. The firm says this could be the result of any number of factors, including publishers using fingerprinting techniques (despite not being permitted), increased ad budgets on large networks like Facebook, increased spend on user acquisition, use of IDFV (vendor identifier) by larger publishers or higher than expected opt-in rates than was predicted.</p>

<p><strong>iOS 14.7 <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/19/ios-14-7-why-you-should-update">launched</a></strong>, adding support for Apple Card Family with combined credit limits, a Home app with support for multiple timers on HomePod, support for the MagSafe Battery Pack, Podcast app enhancements and more. iPadOS 14.7 also <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/21/apple-releases-ipados-14-7-to-the-public-with-home-app-upgrades-and-more">became available</a>, offering bug fixes, security updates, as well as the same Apple Card Family and HomePod support.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, the iOS 15 beta 3</strong> <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/14/ios-15-and-watchos-8-beta-3-allow-you-to-install-system-updates-with-less-available-storage/">added the ability to update</a> your device using Software Update even if less than 500 MB of storage is available. This could be a big deal for getting users onto the most recent version of iOS, which has in the past been more difficult when users&#8217; phone storage is nearly full.</p>
<p><strong>Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=2bbbudbw">added the ability</a> to assign tax categories</strong> to apps and in-app purchases on App Store Connect. The categories are based on the app&#8217;s content &#8212; like videos, books, news, etc. &#8212; and allow Apple to administer taxes at the specific rates that apply to that type of application or purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/ultrawide-band-availability-expands">expanded</a> Ultra Wideband functionality in the Apple Watch Series 6, iPhone 11 and 12 to more countries,</strong> including Argentina, Pakistan, Paraguay and the Solomon Islands. Some countries don&#8217;t allow the technology still, and it must be disabled, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p><strong>Apple <a href="https://www.imore.com/apple-calls-judge-consider-ftc-vs-facebook-epic-games-decision">asked</a> Judge Gonzalez Rogers to consider three other antitrust cases</strong> that have since been decided since the start of Epic Games&#8217; antitrust lawsuit, which is now being deliberated. The cases include a recent decision by the courts to throw out the FTC lawsuit against Facebook.</p>
<h3>Platforms: Google</h3>
<p><strong>Android beta 3 came out. </strong>The <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/release-notes">new release</a> dropped a month after beta 2, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/14/android-12-beta-3-hands-on-top-new-features-video/">and includes features like</a> scrolling screenshots, face detect auto-rotate, more Material You theme options and new icons, the ability to disable Assistant corner swipe activation, tweaks to features like one-handed mode and internet toggles and changes to the camera, Chrome, toggles, launcher and more.</p>
<p><strong>Android phones&#8217; backup system <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/21/backup-by-google-one-android/">was upgraded </a>to &#8220;Backup by Google One,&#8221;</strong> an improvement that now backs up photos, videos and MMS messages with more granular control, in addition to the app data, SMS messages, call logs and device preferences the old system covered.</p>
<p><strong>Google won&#8217;t enforce the original September 30, 2021 deadline that would have required all Play Store apps to switch over to the Play Billing IAP system.</strong> The company will now allow developers <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/07/apply-more-time-play-payments-policy.html">to request an extension</a> for adopting the new policy, in the wake of the big antitrust <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/07/36-states-dc-sue-google-for-alleged-antitrust-violations-in-its-android-app-store-498622">lawsuit</a> filed by AGs across 36 U.S. states and D.C.</p>
<p><strong>Epic Games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22583467/epic-fortnite-google-play-store-lawsuit-amended-complaint-filed">filed an update in its antitrust lawsuit</a> against Google over its Play Store policies</strong>, but most of the information it contains has been redacted. From the visible tidbits, Epic discusses Google&#8217;s relationship with Apple and its agreement to pay between $8 and $12 billion to be the default search provider; as well as Epic&#8217;s plans to launch Fortnite on the Samsung Galaxy Store.</p>
<p><strong>Verizon joined AT&amp;T and T-Mobile in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584443/verizon-android-messages-rcs?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">preloading the Android Message app</a> as the default texting app</strong> on all Android phones it sells, meaning that now all three major U.S. carriers support RCS &#8212; the next-gen standard to replace SMS &#8212; as the default Android experience.</p>
<h3>E-commerce</h3>
<p><strong>Amazon got the recently launched app <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580611/fakespot-ios-app-apple-amazon-fake-reviews">Fakespot pulled from the App Store</a>.</strong> An extension of the fake review-spotting website, Fakespot app was taken down because it was wrapping the Amazon website without permission, which Amazon successfully argued could be exploited to steal customer data. Amazon also said Fakespot injected code into its website, which opened up an attack vector. Apple said it gave Fakespot time to correct its issues before the takedown.</p>
<h3>Augmented Reality</h3>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Snap called out its AR advances during its Q2 earnings where the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/snap-had-its-best-quarter-in-four-years/">posted</a> <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/snap-q2-2021-earnings-1235025874/">record</a> revenue and the largest user growth in four years</strong>. The company&#8217;s Cartoon 3D Style Lens went viral in the quarter on other social networks, including TikTok, generating <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/snap-q2-2021-earnings-1235025874/">2.8 billion impressions</a> on Snapchat alone. Snap also partnered with Disney on location-based Lenses for Walt Disney World&#8217;s 50th anniversary. The company is now working on shopping features that could potentially allow users to try on clothes using AR.</p>

<h3>Fintech</h3>
<p><strong>Popular investment app Robinhood is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/robinhood-targets-ipo-valuation-up-to-35b-amid-warning-that-crypto-incomes-are-slipping">targeting</a> its IPO valuation up to $35 billion</strong> in a filing released on the 19th. The company first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/how-robinhoods-explosive-growth-rate-came-to-be/">filed</a> to go public in early July after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-long-weekend-brings-a-total-of-3-4-billion-to-its-balance-sheet/">raising</a> billions earlier in the year. The fintech giant expects to debut between $38 and $42 per share.</p>
<p><strong>Fintech giant Revolut <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/20/revolut-launches-travel-booking-feature-stays.html">launched</a> a travel booking feature called Stays,</strong> which allows users to book hotels and other accommodations in its app, in a move to become more of a &#8220;super app&#8221; that offers multiple services through one interface.</p>
<p><strong>Venmo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/venmo-removes-its-global-public-feed-in-a-significant-app-redesign">removed the app&#8217;s global, public feed</a> as part of its major redesign.</strong> The public feed put user privacy at risk, and follows a number of complaints about Venmo&#8217;s oversharing throughout the years. Recently, Venmo&#8217;s privacy leaks led BuzzFeed News to uncover President Biden&#8217;s Venmo account.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said bitcoin will be a &#8220;big part&#8221; of Twitter&#8217;s future.</strong> On the company&#8217;s earnings call, the exec spoke for the first time about how he envisions <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/jack-dorsey-says-bitcoin-will-be-a-big-part-of-twitters-future/">bitcoin can integrate with Twitter&#8217;s products</a>, including commerce, subscriptions and other new additions like the Twitter Tip Jar and Super Follows. The company <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/22/twitter-twtr-earnings-q2-2021.html">posted the fastest revenue growth</a> since 2014 in a pandemic rebound, but user growth slightly declined.</p>

<h3>Social</h3>
<p><strong>Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/instagram-confirms-test-of-new-anti-harassment-tool-limits-designed-for-moments-of-crisis/">confirmed</a> it&#8217;s testing a new feature called Limits</strong> that would allow users to lock down their accounts in a moment of crisis. Found in privacy settings, users could quickly toggle on options to limit the ability for new followers or accounts who don&#8217;t follow you to comment or message you. The Limits could be applied for a set period of time you specify, in terms of days or even weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Facebook launched a new tool available to U.S. Facebook Groups that allows users to ask for prayers.</strong> The prayer request tool could help drive engagement on the platform by turning into a product something users were already doing. Facebook&#8217;s head of faith partnerships <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-decided-faith-groups-are-good-business-now-it-wants-your-prayers-2021-07-22/">told Reuters</a> COVID gave new urgency to the building of the feature.</p>
<p><strong>TikTok ads get more tools and upgrades.</strong> TikTok partnered with Vimeo to integrate the latter&#8217;s video tools with the TikTok platform. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vimeo-and-tiktok-partner-to-drive-small-business-success-with-video-ads-301335879.html">The deal gives</a> SMBs the tools they need to create effective video ads via Vimeo&#8217;s AI-driven production tool, Vimeo Create, and the ability to publish ads directly into TikTok&#8217;s Ad Manager. The companies also collaborated on custom video templates optimized for TikTok. The video app also <a href="https://adage.com/article/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news/tiktok-marketers-can-now-directly-sponsor-trending-creator-posts/2351561">launched Spark Ads</a>, which allow brands to use existing posts from influencers in their ad campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/instagram-sensitive-content-controls-explore/">added</a> new controls that allow users to limit &#8220;sensitive&#8221; content in the app&#8217;s Explore tab.</strong> The feature appears in the settings menu and lets users choose to allow or limit content that could be “upsetting or offensive,” or “limit even more.”</p>

If the other person accepts, both accounts will appear in </span>the<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> header of the post or Reel.</span></p>
<p><strong>Twitter is<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/twitter-is-shutting-down-fleets-on-august-3-citing-low-usage"> killing Fleets</a>,</strong> its misguided effort to offer its own version of &#8220;Stories&#8221; in an app where content flows so quickly it effectively already feels &#8220;ephemeral,&#8221; even if the posts don&#8217;t auto-delete. Twitter hoped Stories would give hesitant users a place they felt comfortable posting, but that didn&#8217;t happen. The feature will be removed on August 3.</p>
<p><strong>Tumblr&#8217;s community <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tumblr-community-lash-out-post-plus-subscription/">lashed out at</a> the company&#8217;s new subscription feature</strong>, now in beta, that would allow bloggers to get paid for their content. The system, called Post+, offers the ability to paywall content, which subscribers can pay for at price points of $3.99, $5.99 or $9.99 per month. But some angry Tumblr users didn&#8217;t like the idea of paying, or at least, not being able to pay the blogger directly without the company taking a cut. They harassed and even sent death threats to one early tester. (Perhaps it&#8217;s time to move to Substack?)</p>

<p>Two early WhatsApp employees <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22584551/halloapp-private-social-network-by-early-whatsapp-employees">have launched</a> a private social networking app called HalloApp on both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halloapp/id1501583052">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.halloapp">Android</a>. The ad-free app is somewhat similar to WhatsApp as it also allows for encrypted, private chats with friends and family, including group chats. The app also features a Home feed with posts from friends. The company plans to eventually monetize via subscriptions if it gains traction.</p>

<p>Audio app Anyone<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/anyone-is-building-a-marketplace-for-advice-one-5-minute-call-at-a-time"> launched its &#8220;marketplace for advice&#8221; app</a> on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anyone/id1492481733">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anyonemobile&amp;gl=ES">Android</a> after previously operating in a closed beta. The app allows users to pay for access to busy people whose advice they&#8217;d like to seek out, but limits calls to just five minutes. (Advice givers can opt to donate the money to charity, if they don&#8217;t want to profit from the help they&#8217;re giving.) The company claims to vet advisors before they&#8217;re allowed to offer calls, in order to keep the advice on the platform high-quality.</p>

<p>Streamlabs, a maker of livestreaming software, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/streamlabs-convert-twitch-clips-crossclip/">launched a new iOS app</a> that allows creators to easily turn their Twitch clips into a format that works on TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts and Facebook. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crossclip-clip-post-grow/id1568560633">The app</a> works by allowing streamers to enter the URL of a clip, selecting the output format (landscape, vertical or square) and choosing a pre-loaded layout. You can also crop the clip, blur the background and select from different layouts depending on which frames you want to feature. The app is free with a subscription of $4.99/mo or $49.99/yr to remove the watermark and add more features, including higher-quality exports.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["Finding product-market fit is not a deterministic process. Most of the time, it requires iteration. It requires constant adaptation."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sequoia&#8217;s Mike Vernal has worn many hats. He was VP of product and engineering at Facebook for eight years before getting into investment. His portfolio includes Houseparty, Threads, Canvas, Citizen, PicsArt and more, and he continues to invest in companies across a broad spectrum of stages and verticals, including consumer, enterprise, marketplaces, fintech and more.</p>
<p>Vernal joined us at TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising earlier this month to discuss how founders should think about product-market fit, with a specific focus on tempo. He covered how to organize around the pace of iteration, how to design with customer feedback loops in mind and how Sequoia evaluates companies with regard to tempo.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Be explicit and be greedy at every single step along the way about getting feedback.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>What is tempo?</h2>
<p>Vernal breaks down tempo into two separate ingredients: speed and consistency.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just about going fast (which can often lead to some recklessness). It&#8217;s about setting a pace and staying consistent with that pace.</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the very best compliments an angel can bestow on a founding team and include in an introduction to us is, &#8220;They&#8217;re just really fast,&#8221; or &#8220;She&#8217;s a machine.&#8221; What does that mean? It doesn&#8217;t mean fast in the kind of uncontrolled, reckless, crashing sense. It means fast in a sort of consistent, maniacal, get-a-little-bit-better-each-day kind of way. And it&#8217;s actually one of the top things that we look for, at least when evaluating a team: how consistently fast they move. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 2:26)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Vernal went on to say that tempo is directly correlated to goals and objectives and key results (OKRs). Building a feedback loop into those OKRs and determining the tempo with which to attack them is critical, especially during the process of finding product-market fit.</p>
<blockquote><p>Finding product-market fit is not a deterministic process. Most of the time, it requires iteration. It requires constant adaptation. My mental model is that it&#8217;s actually just a turn-based game with an unknown number of steps, and sometimes either the clock or the money or both run out before you get to finish the game. It&#8217;s kind of like a game of chess. So what is your optimal strategy? <em><strong>(Timestamp: 4:25)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Feedback is your friend</h2>
<p>As Vernal explained, finding product-market fit is all about feedback, and that must be an ongoing, built-in part of the process. He outlined how founders can go about designing with that in mind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We know how much you love a good startup pitch-off. Who doesn’t? It combines the thrill of live, high-stakes entertainment with learning about the hottest new thing. Plus, you get to hear feedback from some of the smartest folks in the industry, thus learning how to absolutely crush it at your next pitch meeting with a VC.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">With all that in mind, we’re introducing a special summer edition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> that’s all pitch-off, all the time.</p>
<p>On August 4, Extra Crunch Live will feature startups exhibiting in the Startup Alley at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=ecljuly2021suapost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=eclsuajuly&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> in September. Those startups will pitch their products/businesses to a pair of expert VC judges, who will then give their live feedback.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is usually a combination of an interview with a founder/investor duo and an audience pitch-off. But as it’s summer, and Disrupt is right around the corner, we thought it would be fun to bring you even more pitches and even more feedback.</p>
<p>On August 4, our expert VC judges will be Edith Yeung from Race Capital and Laela Sturdy of CapitalG. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-startup-alley-edition-w-edith-yeung-and-laela-sturdy?ref=8e6debd80dd4">Register here for free!</a></p>
<p>Edith Yeung started out as an investor at 500 Startups and is now a general partner at Race Capital. She&#8217;s an expert on both the China and Silicon Valley investment landscape and has made more than 50 investments, with a portfolio that includes 50 startups, including Lightyear/Stellar (valued $1.2 billion), Silk Labs (acquired by Apple), Chirp (acquired by Apple), Fleksy (acquired by Pinterest), Human (acquired by Mapbox), Solana, Oasis Labs, Nebulas, Hooked, DayDayCook, AISense and many more.</p>
<p>Laela Sturdy is a 10x unicorn operator-turned-investor whose investments are worth nearly $200 billion. She joined CapitalG, the investment arm of Alphabet, in 2013, and her portfolio includes Stripe, UiPath, Duolingo, Gusto, Webflow and Unqork, among many others.</p>
<p>As a special thank you, all attendees of this episode of Extra Crunch Live will be entered into a random drawing for a chance to win one of three free tickets to TechCrunch Disrupt 2021. Following the event, we’ll randomly select three winners and send details on how to redeem their passes. Do you need to submit any additional information to enter the drawing? Nope. All you need to do is register for Extra Crunch Live by clicking <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-startup-alley-edition-w-edith-yeung-and-laela-sturdy?ref=8e6debd80dd4">here</a> and attend the event on August 4.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for July 23, 2021. It’s been an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-exchange-ftx-valued-at-18-billion-in-funding-round-11626800455?mod=djemalertNEWS">interesting week</a> for the crypto faithful. One eye-catching piece of news came from Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, who said that bitcoin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/jack-dorsey-says-bitcoin-will-be-a-big-part-of-twitters-future/">will be a “big part” of the company’s future</a>. In his view it’s the internet’s “native currency.” Kinda? I would have picked a more modern chain, but that’s just me. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/food-delivery-firm-zomato-surges-in-key-india-debut/">Indian IPOs are a go:</a> </strong>After much selling and waiting, the Zomato IPO took flight in India to great effect. Shares of the food delivery unicorn went up sharply, marking a successful flotation for the growth-oriented unicorn. For other richly valued Indian unicorns, it’s just about the best news that you could imagine. More, please.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/snap-had-its-best-quarter-in-four-years/"><strong>Snap is very much not dead:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Lost amidst all the Facebook and TikTok brouhaha is the fact that Snap is still growing its user base (some) and revenue scale (more). The company still consumes cash and has huge share-based compensation costs, but it reported the sort of growth that delights investors. So, up went its shares.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/">China cracks down on edtech:</a></strong> The changing climate for startups and tech giants in China took a new twist this week when news broke that the Chinese Communist Party may force tutoring companies in the country to go nonprofit. That hit a number of stocks, and, we presume, was a pretty bad day for the country’s larger edtech venture and startup ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/paystand-banks-50m-to-make-b2b-payments-cashless-and-with-no-fees/"><strong>Paystand is building Venmo for businesses:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Want to send a bloc of cash as a company? The process can suck. Happily Paystand just raised $50 million for its work on the matter. TechCrunch’s <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristineMHall">Christine Hall</a> told Daily Crunch that she picked up the round because the company is “not only taking on the business-to-business payment space, but is also utilizing blockchain technology as its engine.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/monarch-raises-4-8m/"><strong>Former Minter wants to be king:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s our first read of the startup Monarch, founded by Val Agostino, who was the first PM at Mint.com. What does Monarch do? Helps folks manage their financial futures. Sure, other companies do that, but most of them are garbage. Have you used the Fidelity website lately?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/lucid-motors-spac-merger-approved-after-executives-issue-plea-to-shareholders-to-vote/"><strong>Lucid Motors discovers the weaknesses of demo</strong><strong>cracy: </strong></a>The EV company had to extend its voting deadline to approve its SPAC deal after not enough folks voted. Per TechCrunch, the “hiccup occurred on Thursday, when shareholders voted to approve all but one of the proposals as part of the merger.” That particular item required more votes. Regardless, it now has the votes and will go public.</li>
<li>And if you wanted to know <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/duolingos-bellwether-ipo/">what’s up with the Duolingo IPO</a></strong>, the Equity team has you covered.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Susan Su on how to approach growth as your startup raises each round</h2>
<p>If you are methodical in your approach to building a larger customer base, it is not difficult to foster steady growth.</p>
<p>Marketers who shift with whichever way the wind is blowing — or blindly follow someone else&#8217;s idea of best practices — are less likely to be successful.</p>
<p>&#8220;The not-so-secret secret here is that the key to great retention is really simple,&#8221; said growth expert Susan Su recently at TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is building a product that solves a real and especially persistent problem for people.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a conversation with Managing Editor Eric Eldon, Su delved into several issues, including tips for how founders should discuss growth with their investors and her methods for developing a sample qualitative growth model.</p>
<p>&#8220;I firmly believe that every founder should try their hand at growth,&#8221; said Su.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/gm-recalls-bolt-evs-once-again-over-fire-risks/">GM recalls the Bolt. Again:</a></strong> If you own a 2017-to-2019-era Bolt, it may catch fire. So you’ll want to take part in the current recall. The first to happen since November of 2020 we hasten to add. Still the news underscores that EV tech is coming to maturity, even if some earlier attempts at such vehicles are riding the struggle bus.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/after-going-public-via-a-spac-taboola-acquires-e-commerce-marketing-network-connexity-for-800m/">Taboola goes shopping:</a> </strong>Fresh off its SPAC combination, Taboola announced that it is buying “Connexity, a marketing technology company that operates a retail- and e-commerce-focused advertising network” for $800 million. You can do this more easily if you are public. Buy things, that is. Shares in the online effluent provider were up sharply in today’s trading.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tumblr-community-lash-out-post-plus-subscription/">Folks still using Tumblr not stoked that Tumblr wants a future:</a> </strong>A few days back Daily Crunch was generally positive about Tumblr’s move to introduce paywalls for creators who wanted them. Why not position the venerable company toward the burgeoning creator economy and help folks make a few bucks? Well, users are pissed. It’s a somewhat standard internet mess, but that doesn’t make it any less befuddling.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Battery joint ventures have become the hot must-have deal for automakers that have set ambitious targets to deliver millions of electric vehicles in the next few years.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no longer just about securing a supply of cells. The string of partnerships and joint ventures show that automakers are taking a more active role in the development and even production of battery cells.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Automakers are taking a more active role in the development and even production of battery cells.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>And the deals don&#8217;t appear to be slowing down. Just this week, Mercedes-Benz announced its $47 billion plan to become an electric-only automaker by 2030. Securing its battery supply chain by expanding existing partnerships or locking in new ones to jointly develop and produce battery cells and modules is a critical piece of its plan.</p>
<p>Mercedes, like other automakers, is also focused on developing and deploying advanced battery technology. In addition to setting up eight new battery plants to supply its future EVs, the German automaker said it was partnering with Sila Nano, the Silicon Valley battery chemistry startup that it has previously invested in, to increase energy density, which should in turn improve range and allow for shorter charging times.</p>
<p>“This follows a trend that we&#8217;ve seen of automakers realizing how critical the battery is and taking more control of the production of the cells in order to ensure their own supply,” Sila Nano CEO Gene Berdichevsky said in a recent interview. “Like if you&#8217;re VW, and you say, &#8216;We&#8217;re going to go 50% electric by whatever year,&#8217; but then the batteries don&#8217;t show up, you&#8217;re bankrupt, you&#8217;re dead. Their scale is so big that even if their cell partners have promised them to deliver, automakers are scared that they won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tesla, BMW and Volkswagen were early adopters of the battery joint-venture strategy. In 2014,<a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/panasonic-and-tesla-sign-agreement-gigafactory">Tesla and Panasonic signed an agreement to build a large battery manufacturing plant</a>, or a gigafactory as everyone is now calling it, in the U.S. and have worked together since.<a href="https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1114390_bmw-partners-with-us-solid-state-battery-company"> BMW began working with Solid Power</a> in 2017 to create solid-state batteries for high-performance EVs that could potentially lower costs by requiring less safety features than lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<p>In addition to its partnership with Northvolt, VW is also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagen-seeks-partnerships-battery-materials-race-2021-06-15/">in talks with suppliers</a> to secure more direct access to supplies like semiconductors and lithium so it can keep its existing plants running at full speed.</p>
<p>Now the rest of the industry is moving to work <em>with</em> battery companies, to share knowledge and resources and essentially become the manufacturer.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Getaround was fined nearly $1 million by the Washington, D.C. Office of the attorney general for operating without a license and other violations, part of a settlement of what the peer-to-peer car rental startup calls “politically motivated allegations.”</p>
<p>The AG’s office started investigating the company early last year, after it received reports of vehicle thefts of cars listed on the Getaround platform. The settlement, released Friday, requires the company to pay the city $950,000, in addition to implementing other changes, including paying restitution to customers whose vehicles were stolen or damaged while listed for rent on Getaround’s platform.</p>
<p>Getaround, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/getaround-startup-battlefield-finalist-presentation/">the winner</a> of TechCrunch&#8217;s Startup Battlefield at Disrupt NYC in 2011, lets individual car owners rent their vehicles by the hour or day via its website and app. The site, much like competitor Turo or home rental analog Airbnb, mediates this exchange (and takes a cut off the top). The company’s attracted a lot of interest from investors, most recently raising a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/getaround-raises-a-140-million-series-e-amid-rebound-in-short-distance-travel/">$140 million Series E</a> that brought its total venture funding to $600 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The settlement is what’s known as an “assurance of voluntary compliance,” and it’s not an admission of guilt. <a href="https://oag.dc.gov/sites/default/files/2021-07/Getaround-Inc.-DCOAG-Agreement-.pdf">The settlement document</a> makes clear that Getaround denies it violated any consumer protection or tax laws.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KMj5ODFarp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/getaround-raises-a-140-million-series-e-amid-rebound-in-short-distance-travel/">Getaround raises a $140 million Series E amid rebound in short-distance travel</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Getaround raises a $140 million Series E amid rebound in short-distance travel&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/getaround-raises-a-140-million-series-e-amid-rebound-in-short-distance-travel/embed/#?secret=KMj5ODFarp" data-secret="KMj5ODFarp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Gig economy companies must abide by the same rules as their brick-and-mortar counterparts,” Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement. “They must provide clear and accurate information to consumers, especially about the safety of their services, and they must pay their fair share of taxes like everyone else does.”</p>
<p>The AG’s office claims that Getaround operated without a license in the district, misrepresented its service and made “untrue or misleading representations” about the safety of its car rental services. As part of the settlement, the company must create a written policy for user complaints regarding vehicle damage or theft, including a way for users to report any issues. It also must clearly disclose limitations of its safety features, such as its “Enhanced Security” software feature, which Getaround says on its website can immobilize your car when it’s not being used. Getaround must also more clearly state the terms and conditions for insurance coverage.</p>
<p>The AG’s office also claimed that Getaround misled consumers by creating fake owner profiles for vehicles that it owned and operated. The company must now disclose its fleet cars clearly in listings.</p>
<p>A Getaround spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company “categorically disagrees” with the AG’s allegations.</p>
<p>“With regard to safety and security, as the attorney general acknowledges, as soon as Getaround was notified of security issues affecting certain cars in the District, the company took immediate corrective action,” the spokesperson said. “As is its practice, Getaround will continue to compensate car owners who have filed valid claims for loss or damage. Finally, Getaround never disputed liability for the taxes it is paying pursuant to this settlement. Getaround will continue to pay applicable taxes to the District and in every jurisdiction in which it operates.”</p>
<p>The company spokesperson went on to say that &#8220;while the attorney general is focused on scoring political points, Getaround remains focused on connecting safe, convenient and affordable cars with District residents who need them to live and work.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA["The not-so-secret secret here is that the key to great retention is really simple," says growth expert Susan Su.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Early-stage startups tend to claim that their go-to-market strategy is fully operational. In reality, GTM is a stark numbers game, and even with a solid plan in place, it can be easily foiled by common problems like turf battles and poor communication.</p>
<p>Finding GTM fit is a milestone for any startup that includes everything from expanding the engineering team to launching your first media buy. But how do you know when you&#8217;ve reached that magic moment?</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to consider three metrics: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/these-simple-metrics-will-tell-you-if-your-startup-is-ready-to-scale/">gross churn rate, the magic number and gross margin</a>,&#8221; says Tae Hea Nahm, co-founder and managing director of Storm Ventures.</p>
<p>High churn means customers aren&#8217;t delighted, low gross margins mean poor unit economics, and that so-called magic number?</p>
<p>&#8220;You can calculate it by taking new ARR divided by your marketing and sales spending,&#8221; Nahm writes. &#8220;But keep in mind that the magic number is a lagging indicator, and it may take you a few quarters to see a positive result.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The not-so-secret secret here is that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/susan-su-on-how-to-approach-growth-as-your-startup-raises-each-round/">the key to great retention is really simple</a>,&#8221; said growth expert Susan Su recently at TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising. &#8220;It is building a product that solves a real and especially persistent problem for people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Few startups go to market with the exact product their founders first envisioned.</p>
<p>Today, Tractable is known for developing tech that allows drivers to upload photos of their vehicles after a collision so its AI can assess the damage. Its first paying customer, however, used Tractable to inspect plastic pipe welds.</p>
<p>And as fate would have it, that customer also fired them just as the founders were raising their first round.</p>
<p>&#8220;We struck gold with car insurance,&#8221; says co-founder Alex Dalyac, as it was &#8220;a huge and inefficient market in desperate need of modernization.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an Extra Crunch guest post, he shares several takeaways from the last six years spent scaling a unicorn that have value for founders of all stripes. Step one?</p>
<p>&#8220;Search for complementary co-founders who will become your best friends,&#8221; advises Dalyac.</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim continued their exploration of the scorching global VC market, this time taking a look at Europe.</p>
<p>For perspective, they analyzed data from Dealroom and spoke to four VCs about the continent&#8217;s investment climate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diana Koziarska, SMOK Ventures</li>
<li>Vinoth Jayakumar, Draper Esprit</li>
<li>Simon Schmincke, Creandum</li>
<li>Javier Santiso, Mundi Ventures</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;There’s little indication that what we’ve seen thus far from Europe in 2021 will slow in Q3 or Q4,&#8221; Alex and Anna write.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though Europe has a reputation for lengthy summer vacations, investors don’t expect much — if any — slowdown to come in Europe during this sun-drenched quarter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Amid the chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic and the murky path to profitability for shared electric micromobility, an increasing number of companies have turned to subscriptions,&#8221; Rebecca Bellan writes in a roundup about the future of micromobility.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a business model that some founders and investors argue hits the profit center sweet spot — an approach that appeals to customers who are wary of sharing as well as paying upfront to own a scooter or e-bike, all while minimizing overhead costs and depreciation of assets.&#8221;</p>

<p>After noting that Robinhood anticipates a decline in revenue in the third quarter as a result of slowing crypto trading, Alex Wilhelm got to thinking about what that forecast means for Coinbase.</p>
<p>&#8220;The now-public unicorn has lived through crypto ups and crypto downs,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;A decline in consumer interest in the next few months or quarters is not a huge deal, assuming one keeps a long enough perspective and the crypto-infused future that its fans expect comes to pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>But will it?</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I handle people ops as a consultant at several different tech startups. Many have employees on OPT or STEM OPT who didn’t get selected in this year’s H-1B lottery.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The companies want to retain these individuals, but they’re running out of options. Some companies will try again in next year’s H-1B lottery, even though they face long odds, particularly if the H-1B lottery becomes a wage-based selection process next year.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Others are looking into O-1A visas, but find that many employees don’t yet have the experience to meet the qualifications. Should we look at Canada?</strong></p>

<p>For The Exchange, Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim looked at Canada’s VC market in the first half of 2021, and if you’ve been reading their work, you know what’s coming.</p>
<p>Canada, like the rest of the globe, was absolutely scorching in the first half.</p>
<p>&#8220;Canada’s venture capital results now rival those of the entire Latin American region, with exits and mega-deals coming in roughly on par in the second quarter, and a similar number of total venture capital rounds in the period,&#8221; they write.</p>
<p>&#8220;That caught our attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>With more venture funding flowing into the startup ecosystem than ever before, there’s never been a better time to be a growth expert.</p>
<p>At TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising earlier this month, Greylock Partners’ Mike Duboe dug into a number of lessons and pieces of wisdom he’s picked up leading growth at a number of high-growth startups, including StitchFix. His advice spanned hiring, structure and analysis, with plenty of recommendations for where growth teams should be focusing their attention and resources.</p>

<p>Thanks to sprawling fulfillment centers, seamless logistics networks and ubiquitous internet access, consumers in many regions can now order groceries and a new set of cookware during breakfast and reasonably expect everything to arrive in time for dinner.</p>
<p>In Latin America, a lack of technology infrastructure makes delivery operations complex, and these supply chains are often managed with spreadsheets, paper and pen.</p>
<p>Algorithms that manage delivery routes or automatically dispatch drivers &#8220;are almost unheard of in the Latin America retail logistics sector,&#8221; says Bob Ma, an investor at WIND Ventures.</p>
<p>But thanks to growing consumer demand and expanding investment in last-mile delivery startups, Ma says the region is at a turning point.</p>
<p>Since Latin America&#8217;s middle class has grown 50% in the last decade and e-commerce constitutes just 6% of all retail, several unicorns have emerged in recent years, with more waiting in the wings.</p>

<p>China&#8217;s edtech industry is estimated to be worth $100 billion, but its leaders are reportedly considering a plan that would require these firms to operate as non-profits.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it comes to control, the Chinese government doesn’t mind wiping out a few dozen billion dollars in market cap here and there,&#8221; writes Alex Wilhelm in this morning&#8217;s edition of The Exchange.</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s not a great system.&#8221;</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Here at memoryOS, we have a saying we repeat often: “Most of the Kickstarter happens before the actual Kickstarter.”</p>
<p>Preparation is the key. But even if you understand that most of the work is done in advance, you should still prepare yourself for some sleepless nights after the launch date. The usual startup mantra will apply to your crowdfunding campaign just as well: Measure, analyze and adjust along the way.</p>
<p>As you may know, crowdfunding fits some B2C products better than it does others. So to give you our product context here, <a href="https://memoryos.com/">memoryOS</a> is a gamified app that teaches memorization skills with the help of virtual <a href="https://memoryos.com/mind-palace-virtual-implant">mind palaces</a> and interactive microlessons taught by our co-founder, two-time World Memory Champion, Jonas von Essen.</p>

<p>Before becoming the most funded app on Kickstarter and getting it 6,400% funded (and carrying it further to the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/memoryos-greatly-improve-your-memory-the-fun-way#/">Indiegogo</a> platform right after), we spent countless hours researching down the rabbit hole of crowdfunding tips and tricks. We also had calls with several top-tier crowdfunding project creators who were kind enough to answer our questions and share bits of knowledge from their experience.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re sharing our approach (and secrets) to building a successful crowdfunding campaign because we know just how tough it can be to launch your own product. So here is a complete 10-step guide:</p>
<h2>Find a unique idea</h2>
<p>You should have a unique idea for a product that would solve at least one problem for your target audience. The proven approach is to set two major hypotheses right at the start and then work on getting them tested:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">Does your product work and solve the problem as intended, and is it better than what’s out there? This is usually referred to as the &#8220;proof of concept&#8221; stage.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Are there enough people who are willing to pay for your product for you to build a sustainable business?</li>
</ol>
<p>You will need to build a base prototype to test the first hypothesis and, if it works, you can then work on turning it into an MVP or a short demo version for your future commercial product. You can then get people to test it for free and prepay for the full version.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Getting people to actually back their interest with their wallet means you already have customers, not merely enthusiasts, and it significantly increases the chances of a successful project.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	<br />
Yes, it’s important that you get people to pay a minimum reservation deposit at this point and receive their commitment to pay the remaining amount for the full product later on. Getting people to actually back their interest with their wallet means you already have customers, not merely enthusiasts, and it significantly increases the chances of a successful project.</p>
<h2>Get user feedback</h2>
<p>As soon as you have something to test, conduct short surveys to better understand your customers by gathering and analyzing the reasons why and for what purpose(s) they would want your product.</p>
<p>Here at memoryOS, we called the first couple thousand of our leads and had many insightful conversations to help us connect to our audience on a more personal and emotional level.</p>
<p>Once you have a demo or prototype for the users to test, make sure to add a feedback form right at the end of their experience (or gather feedback using Google Forms for surveys, or via email inquiries).<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian announced Friday that it has closed a $2.5 billion private funding round led by Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, D1 Capital Partners, Ford Motor and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc.</p>
<p>Third Point, Fidelity Management and Research Company, Dragoneer Investment Group and Coatue also participated in the round, according to Rivian.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we near the start of vehicle production, it’s vital that we keep looking forward and pushing through to Rivian’s next phase of growth,&#8221; Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement. &#8220;This infusion of funds from trusted partners allows Rivian to scale new vehicle programs, expand our domestic facility footprint, and fuel international product rollout.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>D1 Capital Partners founder Dan Sundheim said the firm is excited to increase its &#8220;investment in Rivian as it reaches an inflection point in its commercialization and delivers what we believe will be exceptional products for customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rivian has raised roughly $10.5 billion to date. The company did not share a post-money valuation.</p>
<p>The electric automaker, which now employs 7,000 and is preparing to deliver its R1T pickup truck in September, last raised funds in January. That round brought in $2.65 billion from existing investors T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., Fidelity Management and Research Company, Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, Coatue and D1 Capital Partners. New investors also participated in that round, which pushed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/rivian-raises-2-65-billion-in-new-capital-as-it-pushes-towards-production-of-its-electric-pickup/">Rivian&#8217;s valuation to $27.6 billion</a>, a source familiar with the investment round told TechCrunch at the time.</p>
<p>The news comes just a day after Rivian confirmed it plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/rivian-is-planning-a-second-u-s-factory/">open a second U.S. factory</a>. It also follows Rivian&#8217;s decision to delay deliveries of its R1T truck and R1S SUV from this summer to September due to delays in production caused by “cascading impacts of the pandemic,” particularly the ongoing global shortage of semiconductor chips.</p>

Last month at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/WWDC-2021/">WWDC</a>, Apple unveiled a free <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/apple-music-launches-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio-adds-spatial-audio-playlists/">update for Apple Music subscribers</a> that added lossless audio streaming and spatial audio with support for Dolby Atmos. Now, Android users can access these features too.</p>
<p>Last year, Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/google-play-music-to-shut-down-starting-in-september-will-disappear-by-december/">shut down</a> its Google Play Music app (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/rip-google-music-one-of-the-companys-last-examples-of-generosity/">RIP</a>) with the intent for users to migrate to YouTube Music. Some longtime Android fans are still unpleased about that decision and don&#8217;t feel that YouTube Music is up to par &#8212; but for audiophiles, these Apple Music updates might be what it takes to get them to switch. However, not all Android devices <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590148/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-lossless-android">support Atmos yet</a>.</p>
<p>Apple Music isn&#8217;t the only streaming platform ramping up its audio quality. On the same day that Apple announced its upgraded audio features at WWDC, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/amazon-makes-its-its-lossless-music-streaming-service-a-free-upgrade/">Amazon Music</a> also announced that it would support lossless streaming and spatial audio with Atmos functionality. Like Apple, Amazon offers these enhancements at no extra cost for subscribers. Spotify plans to launch a lossless audio feature as well, called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-a-new-high-end-subscription-spotify-hifi/">HiFi</a>, but it will be a premium add-on, rather than a free upgrade like Apple Music or Amazon Music. YouTube Music doesn&#8217;t yet offer a comparable feature.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Currently, Spotify leads the streaming industry with <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-28/spotify-reports-first-quarter-2021-earnings/">158 million paid subscribers</a>. For comparison, Apple Music had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/apple-music-surpasses-60-million-subscribers/">60 million subscribers</a> in June 2019, and Amazon Music had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/amazon-music-passes-55m-customers-across-its-free-and-paid-tiers-but-still-lags-behind-spotify-and-apple/">55 million</a> in January 2020, but both companies haven&#8217;t shared updated numbers since then; YouTube Music has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/youtube-premium-subscribers-get-a-new-perk-with-launch-of-testing-program/">at least 20 million</a> paid users. Even on consumer-grade headphones, you can hear the difference between a lossless FLAC file and a compressed mp3 &#8212; but if you&#8217;re such a keen audiophile that you need to listen to master-quality audio, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/daily-crunch-square-acquires-tidal/">just get Tidal</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA['In deep tech, it's essential to think about founder-investor fit. And what we mean by this is understanding why an investor is even in VC in the first place.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startups developing so-called deep tech often find it challenging to raise capital for various reasons. At TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising, two experienced investors spoke on the subject and advised startups facing a challenging fundraising path.</p>
<p>Pae Wu and Garrett Winther are both partners at SOSV and run the fund&#8217;s programs around biotech and hardware. SOSV doesn&#8217;t shy away from startups building complex technology, and because of this, Wu and Winther are well placed to advise on fundraising. They presented three key points targeting startups fundraising for deep tech applications, but the points are applicable to startups of any variety.</p>
<p>Before giving advice, the two acknowledged the nuances across the deep tech ecosystem and each industry. Their presentation is focused on general guidance applicable to nearly every startup.</p>
<h2>Finding the right investor</h2>
<p>The first point on Wu and Winther&#8217;s presentation sounds a bit self-serving but is based on solid advice. When building a deep tech startup, find the right investor, they said. This is general advice for startups, but according to these two, it&#8217;s even more important when building a company that might take longer for the investor to see a return.</p>
<blockquote><p>In deep tech, it&#8217;s essential to think about founder-investor fit. And what we mean by this is understanding why an investor is even in VC in the first place. And what it is that&#8217;s driving you, the founder, to do what you do.</p>
<p>And so we look at this fit as a Venn diagram between founders who have a near maniacal devotion to wanting to solve a core systemic problem and investors that thrive on the unique risk profile that comes in deep tech. Because with deep tech, we&#8217;re talking about both technical risk, where maybe that insight that is core to the company merely proves that we&#8217;re no longer having to break any laws of physics to do whatever it is you&#8217;re trying to do. So there&#8217;s a big technical risk. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 6:09)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			We, as investors, love to see methodical founders who can see the first step that will converge at the right moment of technical and business milestones.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Set obtainable goals</h2>
<p>Breakthrough technology hardly came from sudden breakthroughs. As explained in this presentation, it&#8217;s critical to set obtainable goals that lead to the desired outcome.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric aviation startup Wisk Aero’s request for a preliminary injunction against rival Archer Aviation was denied by a federal judge Thursday, the latest in an ongoing legal battle over whether Archer stole trade secrets in developing its flagship Maker aircraft.</p>
<p>A full written opinion has not yet been published. In a tentative ruling filed earlier this week, Judge William Orrick said Wisk’s “evidence of misappropriation is too equivocal to warrant a preliminary injunction.” Wisk <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/wisk-aero-files-injunction-in-trade-secret-lawsuit-against-archer-aviation/">filed for the injunction in May</a>; if it had been approved, it would have effectively put an immediate halt to Archer’s operations.</p>
<p>Wisk submitted to the court 52 trade secrets it alleges were stolen and used by Archer, and the injunction would have prevented Archer from using any of them until a final decision was issued in the suit. It’s an extraordinary request and it makes sense that Orrick would need to see more certain evidence of misappropriation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“There are some arguable indications of misappropriation, but given how equivocal the evidence is, Wisk is not entitled to the extraordinary remedy of an injunction,” Orrick said in the tentative ruling. “Because the merits are so uncertain, Wisk has also not adequately shown irreparable injury based on misappropriation. And the balance of hardships favors Archer because, without solid evidence of misappropriation, an injunction would gravely threaten its business.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JSxuCoGxSi"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/wisk-aero-sues-archer-aviation-for-alleged-patent-infringement-trade-secret-theft/">Wisk Aero sues Archer Aviation for alleged patent infringement, trade secret theft</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Wisk Aero sues Archer Aviation for alleged patent infringement, trade secret theft&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/wisk-aero-sues-archer-aviation-for-alleged-patent-infringement-trade-secret-theft/embed/#?secret=JSxuCoGxSi" data-secret="JSxuCoGxSi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Wisk says the judge’s decision on the injunction has no bearing on the outcome of the case “and does not exonerate Archer in the least.”</p>
<p>“We brought this lawsuit based on strong indications of theft and use of Wisk’s IP, and the initial limited evidence gathered through the court process to date only confirms our belief that Archer’s misappropriation of Wisk’s trade secrets is widespread and pervades Archer’s aircraft development,” Wisk continued. “Following today’s ruling, Wisk will be allowed to begin collecting evidence in earnest.”</p>
<p>Wisk was established in 2019 as a joint venture between Kitty Hawk and Boeing, but its history with electric aviation stretches back much further. The company was originally founded in 2010 as Levt, which eventually merged with sister company Kitty Hawk. Wisk says it (as Kitty Hawk) zeroed in on a fixed-wing, 12-rotor design in 2016. It’s this design that’s the centerpiece of its debut aircraft, Cora.</p>
<p>Archer, by contrast, is newer to the field. Much of Wisk’s original complaint, filed in April, is predicated on the speed with which Archer is bringing its air taxi service to market. Archer also recruited many former Wisk engineers &#8212; including former employee Jing Xue, whom Wisk says downloaded nearly 5,000 files before his departure from the company, which it alleges he handed over to Archer.</p>
<p>When he was cross-examined, Xue pled the Fifth Amendment, invoking his right to not self-incriminate, citing an ongoing federal investigation.</p>
<p>Archer says Wisk has not brought forward any substantive evidence of the central claim of the lawsuit: that Archer received and used Wisk trade secrets. Wisk’s allegations are based on “conspiracy theories and outright misrepresentations,” Archer’s Deputy General Counsel Eric Lentell said.</p>
<p>“It is clear to us from Wisk’s actions in this case that after recognizing Archer&#8217;s momentum and pace of innovation, Wisk began abusing the judicial and criminal justice system in an attempt to slow us down to compensate for its own lack of success,” Archer co-founders Brett Adcock and Adam Goldstein said.</p>
<p>The court will hold a scheduling conference on August 11, where the judge will outline next steps for the case. A date for the trial has not been set.</p>
<p>The case is filed in the California Northern District Court under case no. 3:2021cv02450.</p>

The company says it plans to replace defective batteries, but until it can do so it&#8217;s advising Bolt customers to limit their charging up to 90 percent, and not to go below 70 miles of range. It&#8217;s also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-chevy-bolt-fire-warning-215322969.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">reiterating a recommendation from last week</a> against parking indoors and leaving the car&#8217;s to charge overnight unattended. This latest recall follows a similar one from last November, where <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-recalls-chevy-bolt-over-battery-fire-reports-230044311.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">GM recalled more than 68,000 Bolts</a>.</p>
<p>The company also suggests that Bolt customers visit their nearest Chevy EV dealer to get the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-chevy-bolt-battery-recall-software-195939173.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">advanced diagnostics software</a>, which should alert them ahead of any future battery issues. Hyundai, which also sources batteries from LG Chem like GM, ended up replacing more than 75,000 batteries for its Kona EV.</p>
<p>While it may sound alarming — GM&#8217;s recalls were triggered by five Bolt fires between 2017 and 2019 — it&#8217;s worth noting that gas cars typically cause around 150 fires a day, <a href="https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/statistics/v19i2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">according to a FEMA report</a>. Still, EV makers need to prove they can responsibly deal with potential issues before they can hurt more people (and before it leads to more negative sentiment towards electric vehicles).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve started using Snapchat more regularly this year, you&#8217;re not alone. At yesterday&#8217;s Q2 earnings call, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel announced that the platform grew both revenue and daily active users at the highest rates it has achieved in the last four years. Snapchat now has 293 million daily active users, growing 23% since last year.</p>
<p>Snap went public in 2017 with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/01/snap-values-itself-at-nearly-24b-with-its-ipo-pricing/?_ga=2.25886137.566122237.1626654100-1532633466.1621860309">$24 billion valuation</a>, but not long before then, the ephemeral photo sharing app experienced a massive hiccup: Instagram cloned their then-unique Stories feature. After Instagram Stories launched, Snapchat&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/slowchat/">growth slowed</a> by 82%. Then, when Snapchat redesigned its app&#8217;s interface, Kylie Jenner <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/22/snap-stock-sinks-as-kylie-jenner-says-she-doesnt-use-snapchat-anymore/">tweeted</a> that she didn&#8217;t use the app anymore, causing the company&#8217;s valuation to <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/02/22/technology/snapchat-update-kylie-jenner/index.html">drop by $1.2 billion</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me&#8230; ugh this is so sad.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) <a href="https://twitter.com/KylieJenner/status/966429897118728192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>But Snapchat held on and made a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/snap-shares-explode-after-blowing-past-earnings-expectations/"> comeback</a>. Its revenue reached an all-time high of <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210204006019/en/Snap-Inc.-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results">$911 million</a> in Q4 of 2020, then went down to <a href="https://s25.q4cdn.com/442043304/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Q1%E2%80%9921-Earnings-Release-Final.pdf">$770 million</a> the following quarter. Now, Snapchat&#8217;s revenue in Q2 of 2021 surpasses its previous high to reach <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210722005939/en/Snap-Inc.-Announces-Second-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results">$982 million</a>.</p>
<p>The app&#8217;s Q2 growth could be attributed to the return of advertisers who scaled back their spending during the height of the pandemic, as well as the retention of users that flocked to the app while in lockdown. Like many social media platforms, Snapchat <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/snap-grows-revenue-and-users-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/">grew its revenue and user base</a> during the pandemic, but this isn&#8217;t just a matter of re-engaging users with an app that they grew out of. As TikTok exploded on the scene and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/4-creator-economy-vcs-see-startup-opportunities-in-monetization-discovery-and-much-more/">creator economy</a> boomed, Snapchat kept up by creating <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">Spotlight</a>, a TikTok clone, and investing in the applications of augmented reality.</p>
<p>&#8220;We made significant progress with our augmented reality platform this quarter,&#8221; Spiegel said. &#8220;More than 200 million Snapchatters engage with AR every day on average, and over 200,000 creators use Lens Studio to build AR Lenses for our community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month, Snapchat went viral for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/everyone-you-know-is-a-disney-princess-which-means-ar-is-queen/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Cartoon 3D Style Lens</a>, which makes you look like a character in a Pixar movie. Spiegel specifically mentioned this lens as a feature that &#8220;highlighted the power of Lenses to go viral both inside and outside of Snapchat.&#8221; But beyond fun face filters, Snapchat has been using AR to woo e-commerce partners. The app has developed AR experiences for Walt Disney World, Smile Direct Club, Zenni Optical, e.l.f. Cosmetics, Ralph Lauren and more. This includes try-on capabilities for watches, jewelry, eyewear, handbags, makeup and even clothing. At its Partner Summit in May, Snapchat revealed an update that lets users <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-emphasizes-commerce-in-updates-to-its-camera-and-ar-platforms/">scan friends&#8217; outfits</a> to find shopping recommendations for similar styles.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot more work ahead to build out our technology and increase AR adoption, but we are thrilled with the results that our partners are seeing as we invest in our long-term camera opportunity,&#8221; said Jeremi Gorman, Snap&#8217;s chief business officer. &#8220;We are confident in our long-term opportunity, and are excited to double down on shopping and commerce via augmented reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>In March, Snap acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/snap-is-taking-a-significant-step-into-fashion-e-commerce-with-its-acquisition-of-fit-analytics/">Fit Analytics</a>, a Berlin-based startup that helps shoppers find the right-sized apparel and footwear when shopping online. Combined with Snap&#8217;s investment in AR, could we eventually use AR to see which size of clothing to order? The application of that sort of technology would need to be handled sensitively, especially as the rates of eating disorders in teens are <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/eating-disorders-surged-among-adolescents-in-pandemic-11624302000">on the rise</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond e-commerce, Snapchat has sought out strategic partnerships with entertainment companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/hbo-max-to-stream-free-episodes-inside-snapchat-for-co-watching-with-friends/">HBO Max</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/snap-makes-a-deal-with-universal-music-group-adding-its-catalog-to-sounds/">Universal Music Group</a> and doubled down on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-announces-its-latest-generation-of-its-spectacles-a-streamlined-device-for-experience-the-world-in-ar/">Spectacles</a>, glasses that create AR experiences. Of course, Facebook is working on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/facebook-ar-glasses-2021/">AR glasses </a>too. But for both companies, Snap&#8217;s recent successes show the rising adoption and value of AR experiences.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.monarchmoney.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monarch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a subscription-based platform that aims to help consumers “plan and manage” their financial lives, has raised $4.8 million in seed funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel led the round, which also included participation from SignalFire, and brings the Mountain View-based yet fully distributed startup’s total funding since its 2019 inception to $5.5 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder and CEO Val Agostino was the first product manager on the original team that built Mint.com. There, he said, he saw firsthand that Americans with a greater understanding of financial matters “needed software solutions that went beyond just tracking and budgeting.” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They needed help planning their financial future and understanding the tradeoffs between competing financial priorities,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monarch aims to help people address those needs with software it says “makes it easy” for people to outline their financial goals and then create a detailed, forward-looking plan toward achieving them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We then help customers track their progress against their plan and automatically course correct as their financial situation changes, which it always does,” Agostino said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monarch came out of private beta in early 2021 with apps for web, iOS and Android, and is priced at $9.99 per month or $89.99 per year. The startup intentionally opted to not be ad-supported or sell customers’ financial data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These approaches are “misaligned with users’ financial interests,” Agostino said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We felt that a subscription business model would best support that ethos and align our users’ interests with our own,” he added. Since launching publicly, Monarch has been growing its paid subscriber base by about 9% per week.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2181471" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2181471" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2181471 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/monarch-feature.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="368" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/monarch-feature.jpg 1850w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/monarch-feature.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/monarch-feature.jpg?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/monarch-feature.jpg?resize=768,415 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/monarch-feature.jpg?resize=680,368 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/monarch-feature.jpg?resize=1536,830 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/monarch-feature.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2181471" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Monarch</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monarch launched during the pandemic, the uncertainty of which carried over into people’s financial lives, believes Agostino.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As a result, we saw a lot of people make use of Monarch’s forecasting features to compare different ‘what if ‘scenarios such as switching jobs or moving to a different city or state,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, TechCrunch reported on a company with a similar mission, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/american-express-taps-startup-bodeswell-for-expansion-into-financial-planning/">BodesWell</a>, teaming up with American Express on a financial planning tool for its cardholders. Agostino said that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monarch is similar to BodesWell in that both startups help customers map a financial plan and future. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5IDGRFpEb5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/american-express-taps-startup-bodeswell-for-expansion-into-financial-planning/">American Express taps startup BodesWell for expansion into financial planning</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;American Express taps startup BodesWell for expansion into financial planning&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/american-express-taps-startup-bodeswell-for-expansion-into-financial-planning/embed/#?secret=5IDGRFpEb5" data-secret="5IDGRFpEb5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The difference is that Monarch also has a full suite of PFM tools, such as budgeting, reporting and investment analysis,” he said. “The benefit to the consumer is that because Monarch is connected to your entire financial picture, we can help you actually stay on track with your financial plan and/or update the plan in real time if needed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel’s Daniel Levine said that until he came across Monarch, he was “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">somehow still a Mint customer despite its obsolescence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past decade, the landscape for financial products has expanded dramatically, with more people having brokerage and crypto accounts, for example, Levine said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his view, Monarch stands out for a couple of reasons. For one, it’s a subscription product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One thing I always hated about Mint was when it would suggest the objectively wrong credit card for me,” Levine said. “It has all of my transaction data, it should tell me the card with the best rewards for me. Monarch is set up to never compromise what&#8217;s best for the user in favor of advertising.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, Monarch’s aim is to serve as the infrastructure for its customers. To do that, it needs to monitor all of someone&#8217;s finances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They need to track checking, credit cards, brokerage, real estate and crypto,” he said. “Monarch is committed to doing that. It&#8217;s an incredibly painful problem and even though Monarch is a new entrant in the space, I think they&#8217;ve clearly separated themselves on that dimension.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[When it comes to control, the Chinese government doesn't mind wiping out a few dozen billion dollars in market cap here and there. That's not a great system.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">News that China&#8217;s government may force domestic tutoring-focused companies to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-23/china-is-said-to-mull-turning-tutoring-firms-into-non-profits">go nonprofit</a> is taking a huge bite out of the value of several technology companies. Bloomberg <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-considers-turning-tutoring-companies-081502751.html">notes that the value of companies</a> like New Oriental Education &amp; Technology Group and TAL Education are tumbling in light of the news, which would constitute merely the latest salvo against tech companies in the autocratic country.</p>
<p>New Oriental&#8217;s Hong Kong-listed shares fell 44.22% in after-hours trading after the nonprofit news broke, while NYSE-shares of TAL are off an even sharper 51.75% in pre-market trading. With Yahoo Finance listing a roughly $13.8 billion market cap for TAL ahead of its impending declines at the market open, billions of equity value are about to get deleted. The list goes on: China Online Education Group is off 39.97% in after-hours trading, for example.</p>

<hr />
<p>A new decision by China&#8217;s government to exert more control over a sector of its domestic economy should not surprise. And we shouldn&#8217;t be shocked that online tutoring is in the country&#8217;s targets; today&#8217;s news is a follow-up to <a href="https://supchina.com/2021/06/16/china-creates-dedicated-department-to-regulate-private-tutoring-industry/">prior regulatory action</a> in the sector from earlier in the year.</p>

The expected rules change may also hit a host of private, venture-backed companies.</p>
<p>For example, what will happen to Yuanfudao? The company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/chinese-live-tutoring-app-yuanfudao-is-now-worth-15-5-billion/">valued at $15.5 billion last year</a>, offering what TechCrunch described as &#8220;live tutoring, an online Q&amp;A arm and a math-problem-checking arm.&#8221; Will the company see its wings clipped?</p>
<p>Or how about Zuoyebang, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/chinese-online-education-app-zuoyebang-raises-1-6-billion-from-investors-including-alibaba/">raised $1.6 billion in a single round last year</a>? TechCrunch wrote that Zuoyebang offers &#8220;online courses, live lessons and homework help for kindergarten to 12th grade students.&#8221; Is it in trouble as well?</p>
<p>All this comes on the same day that shares in Zomato began to float, with the Indian online food delivery company seeing its shares <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/food-delivery-firm-zomato-surges-in-key-india-debut/">close up nearly 65% in their first day&#8217;s trading</a>. TechCrunch has viewed the Zomato IPO as a possible bellwether for the larger Indian startup market, and the results augur well for other growth-focused, loss-making unicorns in the country.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">COVID-19 cemented e-commerce into everyone&#8217;s daily habits in 2020, and as we look ahead, B2B e-commerce is quickly becoming the next frontier for founders and investors. The pandemic pushed businesses online, and the emergence of B2B marketplaces and e-commerce infrastructure is fueling a new wave of growth that&#8217;s estimated to reach $3.6 trillion in annual GMV by 2024.</p>
<p>But one major component remains missing from the stack: <em>checkout</em>, which has the opportunity to be the ultimate enabler for B2B e-commerce more broadly.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Historically, B2B e-commerce has been held back by deeply entrenched behaviors and a lack of cloud-based infrastructure.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>The challenge of B2B e-commerce</h2>
<p>Historically, B2B e-commerce has been held back by deeply entrenched behaviors and a lack of cloud-based infrastructure. While the market is quickly evolving, there are nuances to B2B purchases that make the path to purchase more complex than in consumer e-commerce. Broadly speaking, these constraints fall into three buckets:</p>
<p><strong>Payments:</strong> PayPal unlocked the early days of consumer e-commerce, and Stripe&#8217;s ease of integrating card payments has powered the last decade. But in B2B, the challenge has always been that sellers don&#8217;t want to pay a 3% surcharge — so much so that they&#8217;d rather suffer through the pain of physical checks and accounts payable. In 2018, 60% of B2B payment flows were conducted via checks, and the persistence of nondigital payments has been a major bottleneck to e-commerce.</p>
<p><strong>Permissions:</strong> Most B2B transactions go through contracting and procurement, which requires multiple parties to sign off on each transaction. This creates friction in the path to purchase, as the seller can&#8217;t tell if the buyer is authorized. Rather than being able to hit buy, buyers often need to fill out a form so a salesperson can get in touch. This can slow the transaction from seconds to weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Credit:</strong> The majority of B2B transactions are completed on some form of credit, be it working capital loans, factoring, or in the form of days payable. Credit applications are typically completed on paper forms (or at best <a href="https://www.deere.com/assets/pdfs/region-4/finance/multi-use-account/multiuse-interactive-credit-app.pdf">hosted PDFs</a>) that armies of people at internal credit departments review. For context, there are over 1,000 employees at John Deere with &#8220;credit&#8221; in their job descriptions. This costs a lot and results in sensitive information being shared on paper documents, which further slows the transaction.</p>
<p>The net result of these constraints is the inability to make instant online purchases, like we’re used to as consumers. It’s a combination of fintech problems that require a platform rather than a series of point solutions.</p>
<h2>Why is checkout the answer?</h2>
<p>While the term &#8220;checkout&#8221; may not seem particularly novel, modern checkout is a distinctly new category in fintech combining digital payments, identity, fraud, credit and much more. It creates a powerful network, the type that can not only build trust but enable one-click transactions at scale.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shareholders approved Friday EV startup Lucid Motors’ merger with special purpose acquisition company Churchill Capital IV, after the companies extended the deadline by one day because not enough retail investors showed up to cast their vote.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The issue is unusual but could become more common as more companies eschew the traditional IPO path to public markets and instead merge with SPACs. </span></p>
<p>The hiccup occurred on Thursday, when shareholders voted to approve all but one of the proposals as part of the merger — proposal two, which would revise the company’s charter so that Lucid could receive key financing. That proposal requires a higher number of votes than the others — and it must be approved for the merger to take place — so a lack of votes ended up halting the entire process.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The lack of shareholders was blamed on retail investors&#8217; unfamiliarity with the SPAC process and, unbelievably, spam filters gone awry.</p>
<p>Churchill chairman Michael Klein raised the possibility that some of the emails sent to shareholders were accidentally sent to voters’ spam folders. While it may seem incredible that something as low-tech as a Gmail spam filter might interrupt a multibillion dollar business merger, it seems that may have occurred in this case.</p>
<p>“We simply need more votes,” Klein said on an investor call Thursday. Lucid Motors CEO Peter Rawlinson was also direct: “I need you to vote for proposal two.”</p>
<p>“We recognize that for many of you, this voting process may be new or not standard,” Klein continued. He later thanked the many individual shareholders but urged those “participating from the new platforms, the new apps,” to vote. “They may not necessarily be directing you clearly to the voting service.”</p>
<p>The number of amateur or so-called “retail traders” has exploded since the start of the pandemic, largely thanks to apps like Robinhood, which leverages gamification strategies to encourage users to buy and sell stocks from anywhere. The pinnacle of this phenomenon will likely be remembered by history in the explosive rise in prices of stocks for failing companies like GameStop and AMC entertainment, engineered by an army of retail traders on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets">subreddit r/wallstreetbets</a>. Retail investors account for around 10% of the U.S. equity trading volume, according to a report from Morgan Stanley, down from a high of 15% last September.</p>
<p>But if the rise in the price of meme stocks shows us anything, it’s that retail traders are a powerful force. The Morgan Stanley report notes that “retail investors tend to prefer companies in sectors they are likely to be familiar with as consumers, such as Consumer Discretionary, Communication Services, and Technology.” This could be why the Churchill SPAC was high on many retail investors’ radars.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/iz1u85/new_investors_please_read_shareholder_votes_you/">highly awarded post</a> on the subreddit r/SPACs, a Reddit user urges new retail shareholders to participate in voting: “<em>This is not normal. SPACs have never had to beg shareholders to act in their own best interest before.</em></p>
<p>You MUST vote. A non-vote does NOT count as a YES. A non-vote is just a non-vote.”</p>
<p>While Lucid’s merger hold-up is a very different scenario than that of meme stock trading, it’s yet another reminder that retail investors are continuing to shape markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alphabet’s public-facing history with robotics has, thus far, been a spotty one. Most notably, Google X’s big acquisition push culminated in its selling Boston Dynamics to SoftBank (who eventually flipped it to Hyundai). Alphabet/Google’s subsequent approach has been less flashy and focused on more immediate robotic tasks.</p>
<p>Unveiled today <a href="https://blog.x.company/introducing-intrinsic-1cf35b87651">through the X blog</a>, Intrinsic certainly fits the bill. In fact, it’s kind of an ideal take for Alphabet. Effectively, the latest branch of the X Development tree is concerned with software for industrial robotics &#8212; those  big, heavy machines that are perhaps not as nimble as many manufacturers would like.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2181420" style="width: 778px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2181420" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2181420" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1_ctE__hKyugfxRaoXUQpqmQ.gif" alt="" width="768" height="432" /><p id="caption-attachment-2181420" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Intrinsic</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The post is penned by Wendy Tan-White, a VP of Moonshots at Alphabet, who now has the title of Intrinsic CEO. Of the company’s origins, the co-founder of SaaS website builder Moonfruit writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the last few years, our team has been exploring how to give industrial robots the ability to sense, learn, and automatically make adjustments as they’re completing tasks, so they work in a wider range of settings and applications. Working in collaboration with teams across Alphabet, and with our partners in real-world manufacturing settings, we’ve been testing software that uses techniques like automated perception, deep learning, reinforcement learning, motion planning, simulation, and force control.</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s a vibrant community of startups out there looking to augment big, heavy robotics, including the likes of Veo, Symbio and Covariant. Oftentimes, these companies focus on one specific element, like Veo’s safety protocols from human-robotic interactions. Fittingly, Intrinsic appears to be shooting for the moon here, so to speak, with plans to take on a number of different issues at once.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2181421" style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2181421" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2181421" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1_z8Ia94QOptz5_siC0_Qg9A.gif" alt="" width="512" height="288" /><p id="caption-attachment-2181421" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Intrinsic</p></div></p>
<p>“We’re developing software tools designed to make industrial robots (which are used to make everything from solar panels to cars) easier to use, less costly and more flexible, so that more people can use them to make new products, businesses and services,” Tan-White writes.</p>
<p>Certainly Alphabet has the capital and ability to attract talent to make some headway there, even if there are a number of competitors who have a head start. Though Intrinsic isn&#8217;t exactly brand new, either. The company has apparently been working in customary X stealth mode for five-and-a-half years, per the post &#8212; it clearly wanted something to show for its efforts before announcing itself to the world.</p>
<p>The news also marks Intrinsic’s debut as an “independent” Alphabet company, leaving the moonshot area behind as it seeks partners in automotive, healthcare and electronics to help prove out its technologies.</p>
