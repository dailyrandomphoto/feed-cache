										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Ford F-series pickup is America&#8217;s truck. At least, that&#8217;s what the numbers tell us.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been America&#8217;s top-selling vehicle for close to half a century. While the Chevrolet Silverado and Ram&#8217;s series of pickups are worthy competitors, Ford still sells tens of thousands more units than either one.</p>
<p>If you spend any time with one, you might recognize the appeal. The large, powerful truck can function as both a mobile office and workbench; it can tackle just about any job as well as most terrains. And yet, Ford recognizes this all-in-one utility vehicle isn&#8217;t for everyone.</p>
<p>For the detractors, the F-series is too large, cumbersome and wasteful. It may even come off as a little obnoxious. Ford needed a truck for those dead set against Ford&#8217;s No. 1 seller &#8212; a vehicle that would go against the norm and stray from the typical expectations of what a pickup can and should be.</p>
<p>Enter the Ford Maverick.</p>
<p>The Maverick is Ford&#8217;s return to the North American compact pickup truck market after abandoning it for the better part of a decade. Its previous model, the Ranger, has recently returned with an upgrade to a midsize truck, while the all-new Maverick picks up (heh) where it left off. Fittingly, the &#8220;Maverick&#8221; nameplate was first used by Ford in the 1970s for a series of compact sedans.</p>
<h2>Nuts and bolts</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2212299" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-maverick-blue-alex-k.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212299" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2212299 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-maverick-blue-alex-k.jpg" alt="2022 ford maverick blue hybrid truck" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-maverick-blue-alex-k.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-maverick-blue-alex-k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-maverick-blue-alex-k.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-maverick-blue-alex-k.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-maverick-blue-alex-k.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-maverick-blue-alex-k.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-maverick-blue-alex-k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2212299" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alex Kalogianni</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This all-new truck is a unibody construction with one configuration on offer, a four-door &#8220;SuperCrew&#8221; cabin that seats five and a truck bed that&#8217;s about 54.4 inches or just a smidge over 4.5 feet long. For comparison, that&#8217;s half a foot shorter than the Ranger box with a SuperCrew cab.</p>
<p>The Maverick, which TechCrunch had an opportunity to test, comes standard with a hybridized 2.5-liter four cylinder engine that produces 191 horsepower and 155 pound-feet of torque. It&#8217;s married to a continuously variable transmission and sends power to the front wheels.</p>
<p>In this standard configuration, the tiny truck is meant to deliver big on fuel economy, with an estimated 40 mpg of city miles and 500 miles of range on a single tank. It&#8217;s capable of carrying 1,500 pounds of cargo and towing 2,000 pounds of whatever you want behind it.</p>
<p>Anyone seeking a bit more grunt can upgrade to an optional 2.0-liter EcoBoost engine that provides 250 horsepower and 277 pound-feet of torque. This engine is linked to a more traditional 8-speed automatic gearbox and can drive either the front or all four wheels. In terms of capability, its payload numbers stay the same but it tows 2,000 pounds of cargo on its own, or twice that amount with the optional 4K Tow Package (AWD-models only).</p>
<p>An EcoBoost-powered Maverick with AWD is eligible for the FX4 package, which adds underbody protection for off-road activities, as well as adjustments to the suspension tuning and additional, off-road focused drive modes.</p>
<p>The XL, XLT and Lariat trim levels are familiar Ford family fare. On the Maverick, the XL and XLT don&#8217;t differ drastically, with the latter simply unlocking a handful of neat accessories. Both have cloth seats and come with whichever powertrain configuration appeals to you.</p>
<p>The Lariat trim has a few more bells and whistles, along with an &#8220;activeX&#8221; synthetic material to give the cabin a slightly more premium feel. In its base hybrid configuration, the Maverick&#8217;s starting price is below $20,000, with the rest of the trims being in the $20,000 to $30,000 range. Fully loaded, the Maverick&#8217;s bottom line maxes out in the $35,500 range.</p>
<h2>The tech</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2212300" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-macverick-interior-alex-k.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212300" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2212300 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-macverick-interior-alex-k.jpg" alt="2022 ford maverick interior" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-macverick-interior-alex-k.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-macverick-interior-alex-k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-macverick-interior-alex-k.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-macverick-interior-alex-k.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-macverick-interior-alex-k.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-macverick-interior-alex-k.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-macverick-interior-alex-k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2212300" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alex Kalogianni</p></div></p>
<p>Like its larger siblings, the compact truck is fitted with most modern safety and convenience technologies, though the more impressive stuff is largely optional. Automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection and collision warning is standard, but drivers who want adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist or even hill descent control, plus a handful of other helpful driving aids will have to add them on as part of an extra technology package.</p>
<p>Inside the cabin, passengers will be treated to an 8-inch touchscreen that&#8217;s Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatible. A built-in WiFi hotspot gives up to 10 devices internet access through FordPass Connect, which has a three-month free trial before a subscription is required.</p>
<p>Other FordPass conveniences, however, are complementary, such as access to the car via a smartphone app. From here, drivers can connect to their car remotely for starting it up, unlocking the doors and vehicle status updates.</p>
<p>The Maverick&#8217;s true party trick is its &#8220;Flexbed,&#8221; a standard truck bed constructed to meet a multitude of different needs. It does this with a few nuanced tweaks like having a multiposition tailgate, an incorporated storage cubby, slots for false load floors and several attachment points to tie down rear cargo.</p>
<p>Flexibility is the name of the game for Maverick as a whole, as every aspect of the car was designed to maximize utility throughout. For instance, the unibody construction allowed for the fuel tank to be shifted to the back enough to allow for a substantial amount of storage underneath the rear seats. Doors were designed with the now-popular multiuse drinking bottles in mind and every free cavity of space has been converted into some sort of storage function.</p>
<p>The DIY spirit of Ford&#8217;s truck owners was top of mind when it came to designing the Maverick.</p>
<p>After observing the unique solutions users came up with to get the most out of their truck, Maverick was laid out to make things easier, saving customers having to hack into tail lamps for wiring solutions or drill into the truck bed for mounting brackets. QR codes throughout the Maverick will lead handy Maverick owners to a site filled with several video how-tos, plus CAD files of certain components will eventually be uploaded to allow 3D printers to come up with their own accessories.</p>
<h2>The UX</h2>
<p>Anyone turned off by the driving characteristics of larger trucks like the F-150 would find the Maverick refreshingly approachable. By design, its half-car/half-truck nature keeps it from driving like its body-on-frame siblings and feels more like a subcompact car with a raised seating position. The unibody construction feels solid on its suspension, and the body roll one would expect to feel in a ponderous pickup simply isn&#8217;t there. It&#8217;s no sports car, but the ride is competent, and fun roads don&#8217;t feel wholly wasted on this truck.</p>
<p>The front-wheel drive hybrid pulls well in either normal or sport mode, the latter of which is there for those who might seek a touch more throttle response from the efficiency-oriented Atkinson-cycle engine. It pairs well with the CVT transmission, which is largely unremarkable, but in a positive way. This could actually be the best way to sum up the hybrid Maverick&#8217;s driving experience — inoffensive. As a daily driver, the Maverick simply does its job and doesn&#8217;t disappoint but it&#8217;s also not particularly exceptional in that department, which, in a way, is a win in terms of nailing expectations.</p>
<p>It performed well enough that I was never longing for the extra power that the EcoBoost-fitted Maverick provided, which was confirmed when I switched vehicles. Having a bit of extra power on hand is nice, but it didn&#8217;t change the dynamics on the road so drastically that I would be compelled to choose it over the hybrid. Off road, it would be a different, if slightly more complicated story.</p>
<h2>Hybrid hesitancy</h2>
<p>Ford&#8217;s language surrounding the off-road capabilities of the Maverick is carefully chosen. While the truck is &#8220;built Ford tough,&#8221; it&#8217;s meant to get drivers to the start of their adventure, not be the adventure itself. This is a diplomatic way of stating that the Maverick is on the lower end of Ford&#8217;s off-road capability scale.</p>
<p>Go-anywhere adventurers should seek the Bronco. Even casual overlanders would be better served by the Bronco Sport. Even though it and the Maverick share the same platform, the shorter wheelbase and clearance alone puts it ahead of the compact truck.</p>
<p>In practice, the added drive modes to control throttle and wheel slip, paired with more capable tires served the Maverick well for the off-road portion of the test drive. The terrain was a mix of flat gravel and well-trodden paths through grassy country land. None of it was particularly challenging save for a very boney hill climb made up of large loose rocks.</p>
<p>The Maverick had no issues surmounting the rough stuff, and though the path itself would be considered light by experienced off-roaders, it was certainly rocky enough to give anyone a moment of pause, particularly if they were in a car they weren&#8217;t confident in.</p>
<p>There was little doubt the AWD EcoBoost version of the Maverick would be able to tackle a few light obstacles. The hybrid was another story. For now, Ford isn&#8217;t offering the hybrid as an AWD. And I wasn&#8217;t able to put the front-wheel version through off-road portion of the drive.</p>
<p>Mechanically speaking, the mild hybrid system is fairly low impact. In broad terms, it&#8217;s a small motor integrated into the drivetrain partnered with a small battery for some light power recovery, as opposed to multimotored PHEVs laden with massive power packs. It seems there&#8217;s little preventing the hybrid Maverick from getting its own AWD setup. Would it be less capable than the EcoBoost off road and hurt the MPG numbers? Most certainly, though the drop-off would presumably be within a very reasonable margin.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the mpg for an example. Ford is very pleased to state that the hybrid FWD Maverick is capable of 40 mpg. The heavier and more power demanding AWD system would very likely reduce that return, but to what? 30 mpg? 25? It&#8217;s not 40, but for a compact truck, that would still be pretty good.</p>
<p>As for off-road prowess, the most rugged Maverick is still by Ford&#8217;s own admission limited, and while 277 pound-feet of torque — the number that matters most in off-roading — is undoubtedly better than 150 pound-feet, it&#8217;s not nothing, and certainly enough given the parameters the Maverick can work within.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no question the FX4-fitted EcoBoost AWD Maverick is better at such things, but given that the hybrid system is standard and the most appealing, it stands to reason this is the version of the Maverick that will sell the most, and thus the one drivers will want to take off the tarmac — or at least try.</p>
<h2>Contenders</h2>
<p>Ford has designed the Maverick to appeal more to car upgraders than truck downgraders, meaning that while there might be some overlap in terms of customers between it and the midsize Ranger, they&#8217;re not strictly at odds with each other.</p>
<p>Meant for more urban and suburban settings, the Maverick&#8217;s closest rival pickup would be the Honda Ridgeline. It&#8217;s proven track record as an urbane, car-like midsize truck is currently unmatched, though the Maverick and all-new Hyundai Santa Cruz could shake its solid footing.</p>
<p>The Ford Maverick is an intriguing &#8220;blank slate&#8221; of a vehicle sold more on its potential rather than what it actually is.</p>
<p>On its own, it&#8217;s either a cost-effective, fuel-efficient compact utility vehicle or a modestly capable off-roader. It will surely catch the eye of buyers looking for the utility of a truck without the premium price and spatial demands, the same way those seeking a dog for companionship might opt for a terrier rather than a Saint Bernard.</p>
<p>Its car-like handling makes it accessible for new drivers as well as anyone put off by piloting hefty SUVs or full-sized pickups. What the Ford Maverick is, is &#8220;just fine,&#8221; but what it can be, is limitless.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">London-based <a href="https://www.tryhabitual.com">Habitual</a>, a healthtech startup which offers a weight loss program aimed at people with type 2 diabetes (or prediabetes) that combines &#8220;evidence-based&#8221; food replacement with digital support to help people manage and even reverse the condition (so they can be medication free), has closed a $2.3 million seed round.</p>
<p>The round was led by Berlin-based Atlantic Food Labs, with existing investors Seedcamp and MMC also participating. Oxford Seed Fund, which is an initiative of the Entrepreneurship Centre at Saïd Business School, University of Oxford, also participated &#8212; and the round is Habitual&#8217;s third round since it was founded back in September 2019, including a pre-seed earlier this year to fund a soft launch. Its total raised to date is just over $3M.</p>
<p>Habitual&#8217;s program involves a period of total food replacement &#8212; when it supplies users with all their daily meals in nutritionally controlled, packet-form (there&#8217;s a choice of flavored porridges, shakes and soups).</p>
<p>For the food replacement product, Habitual says it worked with a product development consultancy that had previously done development work for the European Soylent-rival <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/huel-brings-its-nutrition-bars-to-the-u-s/">Huel</a> to develop the formulations.</p>
<p>Its companion digital program is designed to wrap around and support patients throughout their dietary transitions &#8212; including guiding them through the reintroduction of healthy whole foods, with the app giving them tools to track their weight and mood, and access resources and digital coaching.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2212427,2212428,2212429,2212430,2212431"]</p>
<p>&#8220;We use the same nutritional framework as was used in <a href="https://diabetes.medicinematters.com/diet/obesity/diabetes-remission-durable-for-a-third-of-direct-participants/16529016">DiRECT [trial]</a> (and other total diet replacement studies) &#8212; that is, three months of total diet replacement followed by a slow reintroduction of whole foods back into the diet, during which time we help patients to retrain around healthy nutritional, mental, and physical habits,&#8221; says co-founder and COO Napala Pratini.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The main difference&#8230; is that we guide patients through the programme completely digitally, as opposed to via in-person of telemedicine appointments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Per Pratini, Habitual&#8217;s digital intervention consists of three key components &#8212; first, &#8220;evidence-based&#8221; daily behavior change lessons and exercises, which she says run the gamut from CBT to nutritional education to support users as they re-introduce whole foods; second, the app provides personalised daily tracking (through self reporting) to help patients monitor progress over time; and lastly users can access the startup&#8217;s patient care team and &#8220;bespoke virtual peer groups&#8221;.</p>
<p>Health problems associated with obesity and poor diet are a huge and growing problem across most parts of the world, often linked to heavily processed, sugar-laden foods that have been staples on supermarket shelves in rich, Western countries for decades &#8212; but which are increasingly finding their way into developing countries, too.</p>
<p>In the West, over the past decade or so, a number of digital health startups have sprung up on both sides of the Atlantic aiming to use technology to help tackle this problem &#8212; such as the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/in-a-sign-of-digital-healths-rise-livongo-and-teladoc-health-agree-to-18-5-billion-merger/">Livongo</a>, <a href="https://livahealthcare.com">Liva Healthcare</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/omada-health-launches-the-omada-insights-lab-to-help-improve-healthcare-outcomes-across-the-board/">Omada</a>, Oviva (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/oviva-grabs-80m-for-app-delivered-healthy-diet-programs/">recently raised an $80M round</a>), Second Nature (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/noom-competitor-ourpath-rebrands-as-second-nature-raises-10m-series-a/">formerly OurPath</a>) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/virta-healths-behavioral-diabetes-treatment-service-is-now-worth-over-1-billion/">Sequoia-backed </a>Virta, to name a few.</p>
<p>There are also general weight loss platforms, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/weight-loss-platform-noom-bulks-up-on-540-million-in-new-funding/">Noom</a>. And &#8212; more recently &#8212; increasingly specialized plays, such as YC-backed <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/fella">Fella</a> (which, as the name suggests, does targeted obesity support specifically for men).</p>
<p>But the opportunity to provide digital support in the area of diet and health is huge, with different approaches also likely to work for different people (or indeed, different health conditions) &#8212; so it&#8217;s unlikely to be a winner-takes-all scenario.</p>
<p>The cost of diabetes-related healthcare has also been predicted to pass $1 trillion per year by 2025 by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352952203_A_Global_Review_of_Obesity">some estimates</a> &#8212; so even just capturing a tiny fraction of this market could sum to a sizeable business.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are tackling the root cause of the biggest problems facing modern healthcare systems, and while US companies have raised and been valued in the billions, there is so much room to do better for patients,&#8221; argues Pratini.</p>
<p>She says the London-based startup has &#8220;global ambitions&#8221; &#8212; and wants to take on US giants with what she describes as &#8220;a more empathetic, patient-led model of diabetes care&#8221;.</p>
<p>During a private beta of Habitual&#8217;s program which involved 30 patients, Pratini says users saw an average weight loss over the 3 months of 17kg &#8212; a little over the amount of weight that she says has been shown to be &#8220;necessary&#8221; to reverse type 2 diabetes in a majority of people.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you say, some people will of course need to do shorter or longer periods [of total food replacement] to achieve their goals, and we support patients in doing that,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>Pratini, who has a marketing background, says she and her co-founder, CEO Ian Braithwaite, a medical doctor with a background in digital health startups and clinical practice, met working alongside the DiRECT team &#8212; &#8220;and are therefore very familiar with the research&#8221;.</p>
<p>Habitual will be putting its product through its own peer-reviewed trials &#8220;in the next year&#8221;, she also tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The startup has started with a direct-to-consumer program &#8212; meaning individuals are referring themselves and it&#8217;s charging these users a fee (£39/week or £139/month for 6 months &#8212; &#8220;this includes all of a patient&#8217;s food for 3 months, and about half of their food for the second 3 months&#8221;).</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s hoping to be able to work with payers like the UK&#8217;s National Health Service in the future, as well as self-insured employers and insurance companies (the latter being the dominant model in the US).</p>
<p>&#8220;We have taken the direct to consumer route to begin with because it has enabled us to start building evidence and scaling more quickly than we would be able to whilst relying on NHS procurement,&#8221; notes Pratini.</p>
<p>&#8220;The NHS is already doing trials of <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2020/09/thousands-to-benefit-from-soups-and-shakes-diet-on-the-nhs-from-today/">similar programs</a>, however these pilots only reach a tiny fraction of the UK&#8217;s Type 2 diabetics. We expect these programs will be rolled out on a larger scale in a few year&#8217;s time, at which point we&#8217;ll have a significant amount of evidence under our belt to be able to successfully bid for these NHS tenders,&#8221; she adds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More than a decade ago, Mohit Dubey founded CarWale, a startup that allows people to sell and buy used and new cars. But spending more than 10 years with the startup made Dubey realize that he was solving problems for just 3% of India. He wanted to try something bigger. Literally.</p>
<p>His current venture is <a href="https://chalo.com">Chalo</a>, which helps bus operators accept digital payments and enables commute tracking. India’s bus market is a $20 billion opportunity, almost twice the size of cabs, but there are very few buses in the country, he told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, [the bus space] has not seen any tech disruption or meaningful service improvements,” said Manish Kheterpal, Partner of WaterBridge Ventures, one of the earliest backers of Chalo. “Chalo&#8217;s unique solution is positively impacting the lives of daily commuters across 11 states of India and is poised to expand its offering nationwide.”</p>
<p>There are just three buses for every 10,000 people in India. It’s a space that is ripe for disruption, but also one that remains largely underserved. Customers still have to pay their fare in cash. Very few buses offer monthly passes. And there is no certainty when any of these buses will arrive at their designated stops.</p>
<p>These are the challenges seven-year-old Chalo is solving. It deploys GPS machines on buses that allows customers to track the whereabouts of their commute. Its eponymous app sells tickets and monthly passes, helping these operators secure recurring revenue.</p>
<p>“It’s a massive opportunity,” said Dubey, adding that digitizing bus commutes is also an enormous challenge. Bus owners often don’t know how much collection they made in a day. The ticketing system needs to also work in offline mode and still accept online payments as buses zip through areas where there is little to no connectivity.</p>
<p>Chalo is now beginning to gain traction on all fronts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2212419" style="width: 599px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212419" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2212419 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/mock.png" alt="" width="589" height="555" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/mock.png 589w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/mock.png?resize=150,141 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/mock.png?resize=300,283 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/mock.png?resize=50,47 50w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2212419" class="wp-caption-text">Image credits: Chalo</p></div></p>
<p>On Tuesday, Chalo announced it has raised $40 million in its Series C funding round. The round was led by Lightrock India and Filter Capital. Existing investors WaterBridge Ventures, Raine Venture Partners, Neeraj Arora (former chief business officer of WhatsApp) and Amit Singhal (former SVP at Google) also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Dubey said the startup was operating about 1,900 buses before the pandemic hit last year. Now the startup is operating 2,500 buses and has signed up several thousands more. By December, he said about 8,000 buses will be live on the platform. “Very rarely you find a business opportunity that also has a societal impact,” he said.</p>
<p>“Buses are India’s number 1 form of public transport with 48% share of trips. Despite this, the experience is broken. At Chalo, we deploy technology that significantly improves the bus experience, and thereby increases ridership. We are today one of India’s largest mobility companies, with 20 million happy rides each month,” he said.</p>
<p>As part of the new financing round, the startup said it will use $10 million of the proceeds to buy back stock options to reward its current and former employees as well as some early angel investors.</p>
<p>“Chalo has emerged as a clear winner post- COVID by addressing the under-served public transport segment. This positions them to be the de-facto mobility operating system of the country. Public transport is the backbone to build a larger mobility platform addressing mobility needs at scale,” said Vaidhehi Ravindran, Partner of Lightrock, in a statement.</p>
<p>“We are impressed by the founding team’s innovative, and technology led approach combined with a deep sense of purpose to serve the society. Their empathy towards stakeholders codified into the business at every level makes them the right team to build this solution for the Indian public. We are excited to partner with Chalo as they continue to transform Indian mobility.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Book sales during the pandemic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jan/25/bookshops-defy-pandemic-to-record-highest-sales-for-eight-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went up</a>, and it seems the <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-reading-habits-have-changed-during-the-covid-19-lockdown-146894" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amount we are reading did, too</a>. Now <a href="https://www.inkitt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inkitt</a>, the startup that operates a free, popular platform of the same name for anyone to write and publish stories &#8212; stories that Inkitt then analyses using data science to determine which of them to take to the next level to produce longer works for its separate paid app, <a href="https://getgalatea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galatea</a> &#8212; has raised $59 million in funding that could help it capitalize on this moment. Valuation with the Series B is not being disclosed, but from what I understand from a reliable source, it is in the region of $390 million.</p>
<p>The funding will be used by Berlin-based Inkitt to continue building out its algorithms and technology, which is important because the curation of stories  &#8212; including choosing what catapults from the free to the paid app as a longer work; and acting as &#8220;editor&#8221; with A/B testing of variations in story directions &#8212; are all generated by those algorithms, not humans. It will also be using the funds to hire more people, in particular to expand further into the North American market. And it finally plans to work on how it might extend the platform in the longer term. That could involve more formats beyond reading (it&#8217;s now taking early steps into audio, for example), and it could also involve building APIs and SDKs so that other parties, such as other publishers, might be able to use its tools to also test out shorter works to see what might work as books.</p>
<p>Inkitt has been on a growth tear in the last couple of years &#8212; the company now has 7 million users (AKA readers) and a community of 300,000 writers, up nearly threefold on the 1.6 million readers and 110,000 writers it had when I covered its last funding round in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/28/inkitt-raises-16m-led-by-kleiner-perkins-to-publish-crowdsourced-novels-in-mini-episodes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019</a>. The paid Galatea app, meanwhile, has a run rate of over $38 million (that figure has grown more than 6x: it was just $6 million two years ago).</p>
<p>The startup has also been catching the eye of others in the publishing industry, underscored by who is investing in this round.</p>
<p>Scott Sandell, managing general partner of NEA, co-led the investment with German publishing giant Axel Springer. Michael Lynton, the chairman of Snap (and in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lynton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous lives</a>, the CEO of Penguin Books and a senior executive at Disney who started Disney Publishing); and <span class="s1">Stefan von Holtzbrinck, the chairman of the eponymous publishing giant (which owns Macmillan, among others), also participated, alongside Kleiner Perkins, HV Capital, Redalpine and Speedinvest. Kleiner led Inkitt&#8217;s Series A. </span></p>
<p>Writers on the platform &#8212; at least those whose initial chapters chime well with Inkitt&#8217;s algorithms, which they then turn into longer works that resonate with readers &#8212; are also seeing some big numbers, with a few notable fairytales among them.</p>
<p>Seemran Sahoo, from one of the more impoverished states in India, Odisha, has made $2.7 million to date from <em>The Arrangement</em>, a novel she wrote and published on Inkitt entirely on her smartphone. Sapir Englard from Israel originally wanted to use the proceeds from her Inkitt-germinated book, <em>The Millennium Wolves</em>, to finance her tuition at Berklee College of Music in Boston. Tuition is expensive at U.S. higher learning institutions, but even so, she has ended up doing a little more than that: so far, she&#8217;s made $8 million to date from the novel. (Note: both of these were published before Inkitt&#8217;s last funding round: they have continued to rake in a lot in sales.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These two are outliers, but Ali Albazaz, Inkitt&#8217;s founder and CEO (pictured below), says most of those who make the cut for Galatea do very, very well relative to other publishing environments.</p>
<p>&#8220;The majority of our Galatea writers made more than $100,000 in sales,&#8221; he said. But if books, and specifically a kind of blockbuster, are at the heart of what Inkitt does today, Albazaz is given to describing his bigger vision for Inkitt as much more than just reading. The company has started to make small steps into audio books, and there are plans for developing films, TV shows, merchandising, games, and maybe even a theme park: &#8220;the Disney of the twenty-first century,&#8221; in his words.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2212409" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ali-Albazaz-Founder-and-CEO-Inkitt.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ali-Albazaz-Founder-and-CEO-Inkitt.jpg 8019w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ali-Albazaz-Founder-and-CEO-Inkitt.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ali-Albazaz-Founder-and-CEO-Inkitt.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ali-Albazaz-Founder-and-CEO-Inkitt.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ali-Albazaz-Founder-and-CEO-Inkitt.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ali-Albazaz-Founder-and-CEO-Inkitt.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ali-Albazaz-Founder-and-CEO-Inkitt.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ali-Albazaz-Founder-and-CEO-Inkitt.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>That journey is consistent, but it isn&#8217;t being taken at a breakneck speed: this was almost exactly what Albazaz told me was his plan in 2019, too. (Some things have not remained as prominent: the company&#8217;s unique selling point originally on Galatea was a set of &#8220;effects&#8221; that it adds to books &#8212; sounds and jolts that make the reading experience more immersive. These are still there but it seems that they are no longer central to every experience, and even Albazaz referred to the effects in our conversation only as an afterthought.)</p>
<p>As for why the Disney vision has yet to be realized, to be fair we <em>have</em> been in a pandemic. Also, &#8220;move fast, break things&#8221; isn&#8217;t always the best way forward.</p>
<p>Albazaz said the company is getting &#8220;between two and four requests every week from TV and movie and production companies,&#8221; to make content based Galatea/Inkitt books (as the publisher, Inkitt owns the rights for film and other options), but it has yet to sign any deals. Partly that is because of this Disney idea: Inkitt wants to have a role in what comes next.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are figuring out what is the best for us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We want to leave the option open that we might have video on Galatea.&#8221; That is incidentally also another area where Lynton, who also spent years as the CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment, might help.</p>
<p>Like other self-publishing platforms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/17/storytelling-app-wattpad-raises-51m-at-a-398m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wattpad</a> &#8212; which has gone further along in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/17/storytelling-app-wattpad-raises-51m-at-a-398m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its own &#8220;Disney&#8221; ambition</a>, with a wide range of video and other content spun out from works that got their first oxygen on its platform; Wattpad earlier this year was <a href="https://betakit.com/wattpad-to-be-acquired-by-south-koreas-naver-corp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Korea&#8217;s Naver for about $600 million</a> &#8212; Inkitt has paved the way for a new route to the market for creative people who want to write for a living, as well as those who just want to get their work out there into the world. There are a lot of places already where you can do that, of course, from sites like <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FanFiction</a>, through to Amazon and everything else in between.</p>
<p>As for the latter, Albazaz is unequivocal about his disdain for the e-commerce giant, which &#8220;took away all the margins and pushed down profits&#8221; on books and ruined the reading experience with its Kindles. That sentiment, he said, is what drove him to build Galatea as an addition to Inkitt, since previously the company used to shift books to Amazon once they expanded beyond the short format central to the flagship app. But, it should be pointed out, Inkitt also has its own quirks that don&#8217;t sit right with everyone.</p>
<p>One prominent author &#8212; name undisclosed &#8212; was curious about how a new work might fare through the Inkitt machine and submitted a chapter for publishing on there.</p>
<p>The Inkitt data science engine &#8212; which is unsentimental about who is writing, just what might &#8216;do well&#8217; &#8212; &#8220;<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">measured that readers weren&#8217;t engaged with the story and would stop reading very quickly.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>The author was &#8220;furious,&#8221; Albazaz said, and so was the author&#8217;s publisher &#8212; not least because of what the author had done with <em>their</em> book. The author ignored the feedback and the book published as the author wrote it (the whole book was already written when the chapter was submitted). The book sold 1 million copies, definitely okay for some, but nothing like the author&#8217;s previous blockbusters.</p>
<p class="p11">&#8220;Those 1 million bought it because of the author&#8217;s name,&#8221; Albazaz said flatly.</p>
<p>Longer term, it will be interesting to see whether Inkitt not only can sustain its growth, but to leverage it, as it wants to, in a bigger media play. Potentially that will not just be up to Inkitt executing, but also what happens in the wider market.</p>
<p>Because so many ideas for other content germinate from stories that you read, it&#8217;s inevitably an area that Amazon, and others like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/bytedance-to-pump-170-million-into-e-book-reader-zhangyue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ByteDance</a> (already giving <a href="https://thenewpublishingstandard.com/2021/04/18/be-afraid-be-just-a-tiny-bit-afraid-tiktok-owner-bytedance-targets-3-fold-growth-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some in the publishing world the shivers</a>), might also want to explore over time, too. Amazon has extensive A/B testing for other parts of its operations, and a formidable arsenal of data science and AI that it uses across every part of its business. So far, it hasn&#8217;t made huge inroads in building a product to take all of this to its self-publishing efforts&#8230; not yet, at least.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, though, this also speaks of big opportunities, and present traction, both of which are what investors like to see.</p>
<p>“Inkitt is well-positioned to become the future of storytelling, having already moved beyond traditional content forms to new formats that are innovative and engaging for millions of readers,&#8221; said Sandell in a statement. &#8220;A critical shift is taking place in how people consume stories, and Inkitt understands that. We are thrilled to partner closely with Ali and the rest of the Inkitt board to help drive what is sure to be an exciting and exponential phase of growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Inkitt&#8217;s technology is extraordinary, very successful and truly illustrates the future of storytelling,&#8221; added Döpfner. &#8220;When you consider how many Inkitt authors are achieving great commercial success, you can clearly see how deeply this company has disrupted the way people consume books. We are excited to become part of the further development and work with them as they continue on their journey.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong>: Article clarified to note that Inkitt did not suggest alternative plot lines to the unnamed author; just told the author that as is, the story would not engage readers very much. </em></p>

<p>The new round &#8212; a Series G &#8212; was led by Mumbai-headquartered IIFL. It comes just three months after Licious &#8212; which counts 3one4 Capital and Temasek among its investors &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/indias-licious-raises-192-million-for-international-expansion/">raised $192 million at a valuation of about $650 million</a>, TechCrunch reported earlier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.licious.in/">Licious</a> operates an eponymous e-commerce platform where it sells meat and seafood in 14 Indian cities. The startup has built a supply chain network across several Indian cities to be able to procure meat and seafood, keep them fresh, and deliver within hours of the order.</p>
<p>“Even though the funding for the D2C sector has grown significantly, FMCG is still not considered the most attractive category,” said Vivek Gupta and Abhay Hanjura, founders of Licious, in a joint statement. “We expect that Licious&#8217; unicorn status will change that. The fresh meats and seafood sector is still largely underserved and unorganised that holds a vast opportunity of $40 billion. As the category leader, we aim at paving the way for a second wave of young start-ups that can join hands in fully harnessing the potential that the industry has to offer.”</p>
<p>Licious has not disclosed several of its performance metrics &#8212; such as its sales and margin figures &#8212; but says it has grown over 500% in the past one year. It also says it has amassed over 2 million unique customers. In recent months, the startup has spoken about its intentions to expand to international markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Licious has disrupted the meat and seafood category, which has largely been unorganized and underserved,&#8221; said Chetan Naik of IIFL AMC. &#8220;Today, Licious is amongst the fastest growing D2C brands and is one of the few consumer businesses in India with very strong revenue retention metrics. We are excited to partner with them in this journey of creating India’s most-loved meat and seafood brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The arrival of IIFL, based on the firm&#8217;s historical track record, on Licious&#8217; captable suggests that the startup is planning for its IPO within the next two years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Bangalore-based firm joins another two-and-a-half-dozen startups in India that have attained the unicorn status this year. Scores of high-profile investors including Tiger Global, SoftBank, Falcon Edge Capital, and Temasek, as well as local giants such as Sequoia Capital India have significantly increased the pace of their investments in recent quarters as they double down in the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jonathan Abrams and Kent Lindstrom have partnered on a lot of things over the years. Lindstrom was an advisor and investor at the early social networking service Friendster, founded by Abrams. He was also the COO of social news aggregator Nuzzel, which was founded by Abrams and that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/scroll-acquires-nuzzel/">sold</a> to a subscription startup called Scroll in 2019. (Scroll later sold to Twitter, which <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2021/05/04/twitter-buys-scroll-new-aggregator-nuzzel-way">shut down Nuzzel </a>in May.)</p>
<p>Because both have been angel investing all the while, and because there&#8217;s still a lot of money looking to find its way into startups, it isn&#8217;t surprising that they decided more recently to raise an actual seed-stage fund from outside investors, or that they decided to invest it together.</p>
<p>Thus was born <a href="https://8bitcapital.com/">8-Bit Capital</a>, a brand that refers to a time when computers were only able to store a maximum of 8 bits per data block, resulting in the blocky graphics that people who grew up on Atari remember well. Now, the duo is taking the wraps off 8-Bit&#8217;s first fund, a $40 million vehicle that they raised from a wide number of well-known VCs and entrepreneurs, as well as several institutional investors.</p>
<p>We talked with Abrams earlier about some of those backers, who he asked we not name publicly (to shield them from more capital requests). We also talked about how he and Lindstrom are thinking about competing in the frothiest venture market ever and how focused &#8212; or not &#8212; the duo will be on social platforms, given their history. Our chat, below, has been edited lightly for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Why jump into VC full time right now?</strong></p>
<p>JA: We&#8217;ve been helping other entrepreneurs for a long time, and the feedback from a lot of entrepreneurs over the years is that they really appreciated he advice that we&#8217;ve given them. Part of that may be because the venture capital &#8220;value add&#8221; may may be a little overhyped in the industry, and part may be that Kent and I are just good at it. So even though there&#8217;s a lot of investors out there, we thought it did make sense for us to do this.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What are your most successful &#8220;exits&#8221; as an angel investor?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>JA: I would say that the best companies, or the most successful ones, still haven&#8217;t exited. That&#8217;s the crazy thing about about doing angel investing or venture capital &#8212; the early exits can be good but the the real winners take a long time. I was an investor in [the e-signature company] Hello Sign, which was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-28/dropbox-to-acquire-e-signature-software-company-hellosign?sref=gni836kR">acquired</a> by Dropbox [in 2019 for $230 million in cash]. I was invested in [the content sharing platform] SlideShare, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/03/linkedin-acquires-professional-content-sharing-platform-slideshare-for-119m/">acquired</a> by LinkedIn [in 2012 for $119 million in cash and stock], and those were very profitable exits. But some of the companies I invested in, like Instacart or Front or AngelList, are still not exited, and they&#8217;re doing extremely well and will be extremely profitable investments.</p>
<p>It does require patience. There are companies that are worth tens of billions [of dollars], but oftentimes, the entrepreneurs have been working on those companies for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re obviously a pioneer in social media, having started Friendster more recently started Nuzzel. Meanwhile, social media is hot again. How interested are you in social as an area of investment?</strong></p>
<p>JA: We&#8217;re open to it, but it&#8217;s not the area we&#8217;re most focused on right now, and I think that&#8217;s because of opportunity. Every week, somebody sends us some new social media pitch, but I&#8217;m still waiting to see something that&#8217;s crazy and innovative. Usually we just see things like, &#8216;We don&#8217;t like Facebook; we&#8217;ll somehow be better. &#8216;</p>
<p>What we invest in is <a href="https://8bitcapital.com/portfolio">software</a>. We&#8217;re not investing in biotech or mattresses or coffee or spaceships. Software that connects people or businesses in new ways is what Kent and I are really passionate about.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How can founders reach you? Do they need a warm introduction?</strong></p>
<p>JA: introductions are great. We like to see an entrepreneur who can network. If nobody on the founding team of a company has the ability to get introductions to investors, then how are you going to get introductions to customers and build your team and all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&#8217;m on the board of <a href="https://girlsintech.org/">Girls in Tech</a>, and Kent and I really care about diversity and we know that requiring an intro can be an impediment to improving the diversity numbers in an industry that really needs improvement. So if somebody sends me a cold email, I&#8217;m going to look at it. The problem is, I get a lot of cold emails, and they&#8217;re all terrible. They&#8217;re generally really long and don&#8217;t contain any of the information you need. So If [we&#8217;re sent] a cold email, we would probably read it, but in general, the cold emails we get are just not compelling.</p>
<p>Most of the companies that we&#8217;ve invested in, some of them have been entrepreneurs who we already know, and many of them have been referrals. Generally, we like to get deal flow directly from entrepreneurs, and when other VCs send us deals, we usually don&#8217;t do them for various reasons.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Because they are probably sending the same deal to everyone at once?</strong></p>
<p>JA: One issue is adverse selection where, if this is something that a VC is sharing around and didn&#8217;t gobble up that allocation themselves, there may be an issue there. Another issue is timing. We like to know a company super early &#8212; ideally before other VCs really know about it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span class="s1">European VC Eight Roads is launching its fourth fund of $450 million for European and Israeli tech companies , aiming for another 15-20 across a broad range of consumer, software-as-a-service, fintech and healthtech areas. Cheque sizes wil range from around $5 million to $50 million per company, and as such, it tends to play more in growth funding rounds. 10-year old Eight Roads is backed by Fidelity, and was formerly known as Fidelity Growth Partners and before that Fidelity Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Eight Roads has previously invested in companies such as AppsFlyer, Cazoo, Fireblocks, Hibob, <a href="http://made.com/"><span class="s2">Made.com</span></a>, Spendesk, Red Points, and Neo4j, and now manages over $8 billion of capital across Europe, Asia and the US.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p><span class="s1">To give you an idea of how the fund has grown, the first Eight Roads fund was 1st was £100m, the second £150m, the first $375m, and the latest is $450m.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Davor Hebel, Managing Partner and Head of Eight Roads Ventures Europe said: “It’s great to be launching our latest fund at a time when there is so much entrepreneurial energy and ambition in both Europe and Israel and we’re now firmly on a path to building global technology champions out of the region. This additional capital enables us to continue helping ambitious founders scale, win and have a lasting impact on the way we live.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p><span class="s1">I asked the firm whether it will also have a climate focus, given the scale of the problems facing the planet. A spokeperson said the focus on climate cuts across all of its sectors but as an investment theme Eight Roads looks at three main focus areas:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Clean energy &#8211; so it has an investment in a Nordic company <a href="https://tibber.com/en"><span class="s2">Tibber</span></a> which helps people run their homes more sustainably.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Sustainable products – Eight Roads has invested in <a href="https://www.otrium.co.uk/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwwNWKBhDAARIsAJ8HkheWwa8IemPuNWtjLwxVyqwUdcZGeIoWzfc3JrShWzsll1fmUU_7b40aAl4xEALw_wcB"><span class="s2">Otrium</span></a> (fashion marketplace aiming to get every item to be worn), <a href="https://smolproducts.com/"><span class="s2">Smol</span></a> (environmentally friendly house products), <a href="https://lafourche.fr/"><span class="s2">La Fourche</span></a> (organic and sustainable produce), <a href="https://shopviu.com/en_int/"><span class="s2">VIU</span></a> (eyewear brand), and <a href="https://www.made.com/"><span class="s2">Made.com</span></a> (online furniture brand)<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Climate change tools and enablers &#8211; e.g. carbon footprint measurement and reduction<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1">During an interview, Hebel told me a major investment theme last year and this had been the shift to remote working, HR systems to support that, and: “Every company needs FinTech now.”</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">The fourth biggest category for Eight Roads is digital health, also supercharged by the pandemic.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span class="s1">Enabling technologies, like AI, are also being applied: “I wouldn&#8217;t call it a sector, but the machine learning aspect. Like Glovo, which is a company that does internal talent marketplaces for large companies, where you can match people&#8217;s talents with opportunities in other parts of the organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">I asked Hebel if his company was returning to the office. He said: “I think we&#8217;re still feeling our way, you know. I think we said we&#8217;ll be two days a week, and then see how it goes. It&#8217;s good to see people again.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.foundershk.com/">FoundersHK</a> was created to strengthen Hong Kong’s startup community, which has weathered more than two years of political turmoil, along with the COVID-19 pandemic. Today the non-profit, which started as an events and mentoring network, held the first demo day of FoundersHK Accelerate, its equity-free accelerator program, which was created to help prepare Hong Kong startups to raise funding and scale globally.</p>
<p>Eleven startups (a full list is below) representing diverse sectors—pet care, fintech, insurance and education, to name a few—pitched an audience of about 500 mentors and investors. They were chosen from a pool of 150 applicants by FoundersHK’s creators, including Alfred Chuang, co-founder of BEA Systems, which was acquired by Oracle for $8.5 billion in 2008, Edith Yeung, former 500 Startups general partner and Phil Chen, founder of HTC Vive. All three are also partners in Hong Kong-based venture firm Race Capital.</p>
<p>One of FounderHK’s goals is to restore hope to Hong Kong’s startup ecosystem. When asked what that means to her, Yeung said, “In 2019, I landed at the airport in Hong Kong, where thousands of young people were protesting. I was overcome with sadness and even took a photo so I wouldn’t forget how I felt about the turmoil there. As a person born and raised in Hong Kong, I couldn’t just stand by and do nothing. I realized mobilizing entrepreneurship and helping founders build their startups was the best way to contribute and help, so FounderHK was born to do just that.”</p>
<p>One of its goals is to help Hong Kong startups secure more funding. “A lot of active investors in Hong Kong don’t invest in local Hong Kong companies. The part that is very ironic is that all unicorns in Hong Kong raised money from overseas,” Yeung said.</p>
<p>FoundersHK connects startups with mentors, many of whom are from Hong Kong, and work at major venture firms and tech companies like Facebook, Microsoft, LinkedIn, Apple and Grab. It held its first event in 2019, before the pandemic hit, and has since continued hosting educational events online.</p>
<p>One reason why FoundersHK is equity-free is because it wants to focus first on creating a culture change. “Hong Kong is a very money-driven place, so when you say that none of this will be money-driven, people are shocked,” said Chuang. “One of the things we really want to fix first is the networking issue, because people learn from other people, but they are not connected and it’s very hard to learn.”</p>
<p>Even though Hong Kong founders might be reluctant to talk about their challenges at first, they are eager for the opportunity, he added. “After the first person has shared what their biggest problem is, everyone else shares, because they now know they all have common problems. That brings a lot of teams together and that’s a culture changing thing.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Chuang says that hundreds of startups have gone through FoundersHK’s mentorship program. One reason it started its accelerator program was because many teams wanted more support before approaching investors. Bonnie Cheng, a former venture partner at 500 Startups, was recruited to run FoundersHK Accelerate. The program includes weekly check-ins with FounderHK’s leaders, and a mentorship network that includes people from Sequoia Capital, Goldman Sachs, Alibaba, Monks Hill and Matrix Partners.</p>
<p>“We’re finding a lot of Hong Kongers from everywhere who want to help support the community and check out these companies,” said Yeung.</p>
<p>The past few weeks were spent prepping startups for demo day, and making sure they don’t sell themselves short in pitches, another culture change FoundersHK wants to encourage. “Fundraising is a really big part of this accelerator, really the main thing is to teach them what they need to do, what attractions do they have and how to do pitch it,” Chuang said. “A lot of our work is connecting them with investors to pitch.”</p>
<p>Part of FoundersHK’s work is helping startups find partners in the right markets. Since Hong Kong is a small market, most startups begin thinking about international expansion from the start, including Southeast Asia, the United States and mainland China.</p>
<p>More than 100 investors from those markets attended FoundersHK Accelerate’s demo day.</p>
<p>“To get 100 investors from around the globe in front of a bunch of Hong Kong startups, that’s never happened before,” said Chuang. “This is a first and we’re hoping this will lead into future programs. Bonnie is a mastermind and our goal is to spiral these kind of events and do more and more.”</p>

<p><strong>Meet FoundersHK’s first batch:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sleekflow.io/">Sleekflow</a> is a B2B sales platform created specifically for social commerce companies. Most social commerce sellers rely on WhatsApp and other messaging apps to talk to customers and close sales. Since they don’t have a centralized hub, that means social commerce sellers need to do a lot of busywork, while missing out on valuable data that can boost conversion rates. Sleekflow is a SaaS selling platform for businesses that enables them to build customer flow automation (for example, sending offers if a shopping cart has been abandoned) and analytics to keep track of sales performance. It integrates with messaging apps, social media networks and CRM software like Salesforce. Sleekflow, which works primarily with mid-market and enterprise companies, plans to expand internationally by working with channel partners.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dimorder.com/">DimOrder</a> is a “super app for restaurant management” that says it is now used by 5% of restaurants in Hong Kong. Co-founder Ben Wong comes from a family of restaurant owners and said he wanted to create a solution to reduce the amount of labor spent on operations, while increasing profit margins. DimOrder’s frontend includes ordering, delivery with integrated logistics providers throughout Hong Kong and marketing tools. On the back end, it can handle inventory purchasing, payment and analytics. DimOrder plans to add central kitchen and school lunch box ordering for 108 schools in Hong Kong next year to its frontend, along with working capital loans, inventory management and an HR system to its back end. It will expand to Southeast Asia next year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spaceshipapp.com/en-hk">Spaceship</a> is a logistics platform focused on the fragmented cross-border courier, express and parcel services market. With more than 100,000 customers so far, Spaceship lets sellers compare providers, declare shipment content, chose time slots for shipments, make payments and track packages end-to-end. It also offers consumer services like logistics booking and relocation and moving services, and will launch other verticals, including a marketplace and travel planning. Spaceship plans to expand into Taiwan before entering other markets like Singapore, Thailand and Japan.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.findrecruiter.com/">FindRecruiter</a> is a bounty recruiting platform to help businesses find talent much more quickly than traditional recruiting methods. Co-founder Lawton Lai was a recruiter for a decade before launching the startup, and said it typically takes about 52 days to fill an opening. FindRecruiter can reduce that to about 17 days by working with more than 500 on-demand recruiters across six Asian countries who specialize in particular fields. The platform broadcasts job openings and matches employers with recruiters based on their sector, expertise and needs. FindRecruiter says its recruiters can earn 25% more in commissions and save 30 hours on cold-calling every month. Its clients include startup unicorns and bluechip companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.powerarena.com/">PowerArena</a> is a deep-learning analytics platform to help monitor manufacturing operations. It currently focuses on the electronics and automotive sectors, with clients like Wistron and Jabil. Even on manufacturing floors with many automated machines, more than 72% of the work is still done by people, says PowerArena’s founders. To use PowerArena, manufacturers install 1080p cameras and connect them to the platform for real-time analytics. For example, if there is a sudden slowdown in production, PowerArena can hone in on the cause, like maintenance being performed in one part of the factory.</p>
<p><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://wadabento.com/en">WadaBento</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> helps restaurants expand their operations and increase profit margins with automated vending machines in well-trafficked areas. It has sold 140,000 bento boxes in Hong Kong so far. Restaurants that want to expand usually have two costly options—opening new locations or delivery apps. WadaBento takes lunch boxes prepared by restaurants and puts them into their patented vending machines. Food is kept above 65 degrees during delivery and while they are in the machines, and hygiene is monitored through IoT devices. WadaBento has received patents in Japan, U.S. and China and recently signed a deal with Hong Kong’s largest fast food chain. It also recently shipped a machine to Japan, its first overseas market. It plans to deploy more than 200 machines by the first half of 2022.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://retykle.com/">Retykle</a> wants to reduce fashion waste by making it easier to resell maternity and children’s wear. Co-founder Sarah Garner, who spent 10 years working at luxury fashion companies including LVMH, said kids on average outgrow 1,700 of clothing by the time they’re 18, but only about 5% of children’s clothing reaches the secondary market. Retykle’s goal is to keep as many items in circulation as possible. Retykle carries items for babies to mid-teens. All items are sold on consignment: sellers send clothing to Retykle, which then inspects each piece before listing it on the site. When an item sells, users get an email alert and cash or credit transfers. The company plans to launch in Singapore next month and in Australia in 2022.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.preface.ai/">Preface Coding</a> is a tech education platform that provides scalable but customizable coding classes. Students can make on-demand bookings with teachers, and either meet with them virtually or at an offline location. The platform helps train teachers and most classes are 1:1. It serves a wide range of students, including kids aged 3 to 15, university students (especially Asian overseas students in the U.S. and Australia) and senior professionals in the financial, management and consulting industries. It&#8217;s also made partnerships with universities and banks, and plans to scale globally.</p>
<p><a href="https://zumvet.com/">ZumVet</a> is a pet care startup that offers video vet consultations, house visits and pharmacy deliveries, including medication and home-based diagnostic tests. Co-founder Athena Lee said ZumVet was created to help pet owners who don’t have a regular vet or live in areas where there aren’t a lot of veterinarian clinics. Vets perform consultations, create treatment plans and offer support remotely, or make house calls. Zumvet works with a network of independent vets and offers subscription plans to make pet care more affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigbangacademyhk.com/en/">Big Bang Academy</a> was created to address increasing demand for STEAM education and wants to make learning as “compelling as a movie, fun as a theme park and educational as a classroom” for kids. Its accredited curriculum includes videos and personalized lesson plans for each student. It also encourages a hands-on approach with experiment kits that are delivered to kids’ homes. The platform currently has 200 interactive sessions and a 70% course completion rate, a high number for an edtech platform. It business models include B2B, partnering with educational organizations, and B2C subscription models, and about 80% of its customer base is recurring. Big Bang Academy plans to diversify its content and create learning toys, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro-insurance.yas.com.hk/">YAS Microinsurance</a> is an insurtech startup with policies that can be activated in as little as five seconds, including coverage for running, biking or hiking accidents. It also recently signed its first partnership with Kowloon Motor Bus, one of the largest public bus companies in Hong Kong, to cover its passengers, including loss or theft or accidental medical expenses. YAS Microinsurance launched four months ago and says it now has $800,000 in committed revenue. About 6,300 policies were activated over the past couple of months, and it currently activates about 600 new policies per week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A pair of new e-readers from Kobo iterate on the company&#8217;s high-end options, adding Bluetooth audiobook and stylus support to the now familiar asymmetrical design of its larger devices. The Sage and Libra 2 also gain a new charging cover so you only have to plug the device in every few months rather than every few weeks.</p>
<p>The Sage is the higher-end of the two models, being an evolution of the Forma, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/kobos-forma-e-reader-takes-on-kindle-oasis-with-an-asymmetric-design-and-premium-price/">which I reviewed here</a>. The excellent 8&#8243;, 300 PPI screen and color-adjustable screen light are the same, so rest assured the reading experience will continue to be great. Likewise the Libra 2 is the sequel to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/kobo-brings-brings-the-forma-form-factor-to-a-cheaper-model/">Libra H2O</a> (they&#8217;re dropping the H2O, but it&#8217;s still waterproof), with the same type of display and light at 7&#8243; instead. (If you want smaller, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/29/kobos-new-entry-level-clara-hd-e-reader-has-a-crisp-color-adjustable-display/">Clara</a> is still the best move.)</p>
<p>New in both the readers is Bluetooth audio that can be used exclusively for sending Kobo audiobooks to your wireless headset of choice. While it&#8217;s always nice to have new capabilities, it&#8217;s a little surprising that Kobo decided to limit this to its own service. The company has generally been very open to different formats and services, letting you load whatever document formats you want on its readers — so it&#8217;s surprising that the approach here is more restricted. It&#8217;s possible that tie-ins with other services (like the devices&#8217; solid Pocket integration) are simply forthcoming. Both readers come with 32 gigs of storage built in to accommodate this new space-hogging feature.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212034" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/KOBO_Libra2_15JULY21_0759-EN.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212034" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2212034" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/KOBO_Libra2_15JULY21_0759-EN.jpg" alt="A man sitting on a couch reading on a Libra e-reader." width="1024" height="615" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/KOBO_Libra2_15JULY21_0759-EN.jpg 1605w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/KOBO_Libra2_15JULY21_0759-EN.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/KOBO_Libra2_15JULY21_0759-EN.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/KOBO_Libra2_15JULY21_0759-EN.jpg?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/KOBO_Libra2_15JULY21_0759-EN.jpg?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/KOBO_Libra2_15JULY21_0759-EN.jpg?resize=1536,923 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/KOBO_Libra2_15JULY21_0759-EN.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2212034" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kobo</p></div></p>
<p>Only the Sage gets support for Kobo&#8217;s new stylus, however, which was first put to use on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/kobo-elipsa-review-a-sized-up-e-reading-companion-with-clever-note-taking/">new, large-type Ellipsa</a>. It was useful there but mainly due to the larger format allowing the necessary space for sketching and jotting down notes. Whether that utility makes the jump to the smaller (but still on the large side for an e-reader) Sage is tough to predict — but we should be able to evaluate that when we review it.</p>
<p>The form factor of the devices has, unfortunately, gained somewhat in size and weight. The Forma and Libra H2O were notable for what you might call their &#8220;side chin,&#8221; a wedge-shaped bezel you could use to hold and operate the e-reader one-handed. Although as a rule I prefer symmetrical things, the form factor (pioneered, it must be said, by Amazon with the Oasis) has grown on me, partly because the screen part of the device is so thin that it feels rather futuristic and of course takes up very little space.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212042" style="width: 957px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sage_Side.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212042" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2212042" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sage_Side.jpg" alt="Side view of the Sage (top) and Forma (bottom). Truly the differences seem smaller than I made them out to be." width="947" height="307" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sage_Side.jpg 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sage_Side.jpg?resize=150,49 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sage_Side.jpg?resize=300,97 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sage_Side.jpg?resize=768,249 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sage_Side.jpg?resize=680,220 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sage_Side.jpg?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2212042" class="wp-caption-text">Side view of the Sage (top) and Forma (bottom). Truly the differences seem smaller than I made them out to be.</p></div></p>
<p>The new Sage and Libra 2 are definitely chunkier, with no extra-thin screen part, instead being as thick as thickest section all the way through. It&#8217;s a clean design in some ways and for all I know it may even be more comfortable to hold, but it&#8217;s already tough enough to find a pocket the Forma fits in. And it doesn&#8217;t help that both are about 20 percent heavier. While technically that only amounts to a few dozen grams and 3 or 4 millimeters, part of the draw of e-readers to begin with is that they are thin and light.</p>
<p>Anyway it might not matter once you put a case on these things — there&#8217;s a new evolution of the SleepCover, which automatically turns the device on or off when you open it, in the PowerCover, which also charges the device it protects. Of course that&#8217;ll probably add another few hundred grams too&#8230;</p>
<p>Though I grouse about these small changes to design and dimensions, the screen and frontlight are still class-leading and Kobo&#8217;s software is great and straightforward for reading. We&#8217;ll see how these new devices stack up to the old ones as soon as we have the chance to review them.</p>
<p>The Kobo Sage will cost $260, and the Libra 2 will cost $180 when they ship on October 19. You can pre-order them now if you&#8217;re feeling lucky.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-messenger-instagram-whatsapp-are-all-down/">day-long outage</a> is by far its longest and most extreme in years. At around 9 a.m. PDT on the U.S. West Coast &#8212; where the social giant is headquartered &#8212; Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger seemed to vanish from the internet.</p>
<p>The outage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-stock-falls-as-global-outage-continues/">continued through market close</a>, with the company&#8217;s stock dropping around 5% below its opening price on Monday. By midafternoon, services were beginning to resume after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/technology/facebook-down.html">Facebook reportedly</a> dispatched a team to its Santa Clara data center to &#8220;manually reset&#8221; the company&#8217;s servers.</p>
<p>But what makes the outage unique is just how extremely offline Facebook was.</p>
<p>In the morning, Facebook sent a brief tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/Facebook/status/1445061804636479493">to apologize</a> that &#8220;some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products.&#8221; Then, reports emerged that the outage was affecting not just its users, but the company itself. Employees were reportedly <a href="https://twitter.com/sheeraf/status/1445099150316503057?s=20">unable to enter their office buildings,</a> and staff called it a &#8220;snow day&#8221; &#8212; they <a href="https://twitter.com/rmac18/status/1445069187664293895">couldn&#8217;t get any work done</a> because the outage also affected internal collaboration apps.</p>
<p>Facebook hasn&#8217;t commented on the cause of the outage, though security experts said evidence pointed to a problem with the company&#8217;s network that cut off Facebook from the wider internet and also itself.</p>
<p>The first signs of trouble <a href="https://twitter.com/jgrahamc/status/1445065270272434176">were around 8:50 a.m</a>. PDT in California, according to John Graham-Cumming, CTO at networking giant Cloudflare, who said Facebook &#8220;disappeared from the internet in a flurry of BGP updates&#8221; over a two-minute window, referring to BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol, the system that networks use to figure out the fastest way to send data over the internet to another network.</p>
<p>The updates were specifically BGP route withdrawals. Essentially, Facebook had sent a message to the internet that it was closed for business, like closing the drawbridge of its castle. Without any routes into the network, Facebook was basically isolated from the rest of the internet, and because of the way Facebook&#8217;s network is structured, the route withdrawals also took out WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook Messenger and everything inside its digital walls.</p>
<p>A few minutes after the BGP routes were withdrawn, users began to notice issues. Internet traffic that should have gone to Facebook essentially got lost on the internet and went nowhere, Rob Graham, founder of Errata Security, said in <a href="https://twitter.com/ErrataRob/status/1445132412283981835">a tweet thread</a>.</p>
<p>Users began to notice that their Facebook apps had stopped working and the websites weren&#8217;t loading and reported experiencing issues with DNS, or the domain name system, which is another critical part of how the internet works. DNS converts human-readable web addresses into machine-readable IP addresses to find where a web page is located on the internet. Without a way into Facebook&#8217;s servers, apps and browsers would keep kicking back what looked like DNS errors.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not known exactly why the BGP routes were withdrawn. BGP, which has been around since the advent of the internet, can be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/19/cloudflare-wants-route-leak-internet-outages-to-be-a-thing-of-the-past/">manipulated and maliciously exploited</a> in ways that can lead to massive outages.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more likely is that a Facebook configuration update went terribly wrong and its failure cascaded throughout the internet. A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/q181fv/looks_like_facebook_is_down/hfd4dyv/?context=3">now-deleted Reddit thread</a> from a Facebook engineer described a BGP configuration error long before it was widely known.</p>
<p>But while the fix might be simple, the recovery may stretch from the next few hours into the following days because of how the internet works. Internet providers usually update their DNS records every few hours, but they can take several days to fully propagate.</p>
<p>&#8220;To the huge community of people and businesses around the world who depend on us: we&#8217;re sorry,&#8221; Facebook tweeted around 3:30 p.m. local time. &#8220;We’ve been working hard to restore access to our apps and services and are happy to report they are coming back online now. Thank you for bearing with us.&#8221;</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-messenger-instagram-whatsapp-are-all-down/">Facebook goes down:</a></strong> The biggest news item in all of tech today was the fact that Facebook was unable to provide its services for hours and hours. Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are all still offline as we write to you. Given Facebook’s enormous scale, the financial damage is piling up for the social giant and its myriad customers. In other Facebook news, the European Parliament is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/leak-shows-facebooks-business-model-needs-regulating-says-mep/">less than pleased with the company</a>, TechCrunch reports.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/informaticas-ipo-will-test-public-markets-appetite-for-slower-growing-tech-offerings/"><strong>Inside Informatica’s IPO:</strong></a><strong> </strong>As technology stocks took a battering today, TechCrunch sunk its teeth into data-focused Informatica’s S-1 filing. The company went private back in 2015, moving to the cloud over the intervening half-decade. What does it look like now that it is coming back to the public markets? Indebted, for one.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/apple-watch-series-7-arrives-october-15-starting-at-399/"><strong>New Apple Watches drop this month:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If you were hoping to snag a new Apple Watch in October, good news: The company’s Series 7 device should arrive on the 15th. As a reminder, the new Watch has a 20% larger screen, which means it can hold more text. In case you love reading from your wrist.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we dive into a bevy of venture capital rounds, take a peek at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/index-sequoia-and-canvas-investors-weigh-in-on-how-to-raise-your-first-dollars/">this Mary Ann Azevedo post</a> digging into advice from Index and Sequoia concerning how to go about raising your first dollars. It’s very good.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/nft-startup-dapper-labs-acquires-virtual-influencer-startup-brud/"><strong>An NFT and a virtual avatar walk into a bar:</strong></a><strong> </strong>OK so that’s the setup for a lame joke I couldn’t figure out how to finish (<em>The barkeep asks, “What do you think this is, the metaverse?”</em>) but in real news, NFT impresario Dapper Labs is buying virtual avatar startup Brud. Per TechCrunch, Brud has 32 staff, all of which will make a move to Dapper. Recall that Dapper Labs was last valued at $7.5 billion, so it 100% has some stock to throw around.</li>
<li>We had <strong>two insurtech rounds today</strong> worth discussing. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/insurtech-stable-raises-46-5m-in-greycroft-led-round-to-help-businesses-manage-volatile-commodity-prices/"><strong>The </strong><strong>first is from Stable</strong></a>, which is building an insurance product concerning the price of commodities. The value of oil, soybeans and pig bellies — not to mention copper, silicon metal and corn — can jump around quite a lot. For many producers, that’s suboptimal. Stable has raised more than $46 million to help provide more price stability — get it? — to folks previously at the vicissitude of the markets, who we presume were too small to hedge their own risk.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/ladder-raises-100m-on-a-900m-valuation-for-a-platform-selling-flexible-term-life-insurance/"><strong>The second is from Ladder</strong></a>, which just put together a $100 million funding round to remake the life insurance industry. That we have two large insurtech rounds land in a single day implies that venture sentiment around startups in the space has not waned to quiescence in the wake of public markets devaluing several public neoinsurance companies that went public in the last year.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/yc-grads-wasp-land-1-5m-seed-to-help-developers-build-web-apps-faster/"><strong>Wasp raises $1.5M for faster web app construction:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Recent Y Combinator graduate Wasp has put together a nice little round for its technology that aims to “help programmers code the business logic side of the application faster,” TechCrunch reports. It’s always nice to see a smaller round, reminders that not every company is raising nine figures in a single go these days.</li>
</ul>
<h2>As Apple messes with attribution, what does growth marketing look like in 2021?</h2>
<p>Cupertino introduced app tracking transparency in April, giving users the ability to prevent their iPhones from sharing data about their behavior. Later changes in iOS 15 permit consumers to opt into mail privacy protection and exert greater control over app permissions.</p>
<p>This is all good news for privacy-minded consumers, but for startups that live and die by their ability to measure growth and engagement, there&#8217;s widespread confusion and uncertainty.</p>
<p>To learn more about how growth marketers are recalibrating data collection, <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Managing Editor Danny Crichton</a> interviewed three experts at TechCrunch Disrupt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jenifer Ho, marketing VP, Elation Health</li>
<li>Shoji Ueki, head of marketing and analytics, Point</li>
<li>Nik Sharma, owner, Sharma Brands</li>

It turns out that inside of iOS 15 there’s now a way to report apps to Apple. Which is good, if Apple will, you know, ever email you back.</li>
<li>To wrap up news for the day, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/qualcomm-acquires-veoneer-for-4-5-billion-canceling-its-agreement-with-magna/"><strong>Qualcomm intends to buy Veoneer for $4.5 billion</strong></a>, which means that the smaller company’s deal with Magna is kaput. Veoneer is a “Swedish automotive tech company,” TechCrunch writes, which helps put the deal in context. Qualcomm makes chips &#8212; and cars, as we have learned in the last few months, really do need them.</li>

<h2>Bezos&#8217; labor woes</h2>
<p>Jeff Bezos is back in the news this week, this time over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/current-and-former-employees-raise-major-safety-concerns-allegations-of-sexual-harassment-at-blue-origin/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">allegations of a hostile work environment and a lack of focus on safety</a> from 21 current and former employees of his space company, Blue Origin. The news couldn&#8217;t come at a worse time for the company, which is currently mired in a lawsuit against NASA over its decision to award a lunar lander contract to rival SpaceX.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lioness.co/post/bezos-wants-to-create-a-better-future-in-space-his-company-blue-origin-is-stuck-in-a-toxic-past">The essay jointly composed by the employees</a> paints a vivid picture of Blue Origin’s work culture as one marred by sexual harassment, in which professional disagreement is stifled, environmental concerns are left unaddressed and speed of execution takes precedence over human safety.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KsJJIWLtUe"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/current-and-former-employees-raise-major-safety-concerns-allegations-of-sexual-harassment-at-blue-origin/">Current and former employees raise major safety concerns, allegations of sexual harassment at Blue Origin</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Current and former employees raise major safety concerns, allegations of sexual harassment at Blue Origin&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/current-and-former-employees-raise-major-safety-concerns-allegations-of-sexual-harassment-at-blue-origin/embed/#?secret=KsJJIWLtUe" data-secret="KsJJIWLtUe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Blue Origin disputed the allegations of sexual harassment in a comment to TechCrunch, but they did not respond to a follow-up inquiry regarding safety and whether the company has inserted stifling non-disparagement clauses in employee contracts.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke to the sole named author of the letter, Alexandra Abrams, who said she decided to go public with her identity because she felt a sense of responsibility for other employees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I really felt like I had compromised my integrity at Blue Origin,” she said. “I did my best, but I was Bob’s executive communicator and helped make him look good.”</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine how this essay could <em>not </em>affect Blue Origin’s bottom line. After the successful launch of New Shepard in July, in which Bezos and three others went to space during an 11-minute flight, the company intends to start welcoming more paying customers on flights.</p>
<p>The situation was made even more sticky when the Federal Aviation Administration confirmed to TechCrunch that &#8220;the agency is reviewing the information&#8221; in the essay. “The FAA takes every safety allegation seriously.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Abrams confirmed that the FAA had not yet reached out to her, she said she would “very much welcome” that.</p>
<p>“I feel like I’m fulfilling my job description as employee communications for the first time.”</p>

<h2>U.S. Space Force grants funds for next-gen rocket development</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/u-s-space-force-awards-87-5m-to-rocket-lab-spacex-blue-origin-ula-for-next-gen-rocket-testing/">U.S. Space Force</a> has awarded a collective $87.5 million in funding to SpaceX, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab and United Launch Alliance for projects related to next-gen rocket engine testing and upper-stage improvements &#8212; that includes Rocket Lab&#8217;s mysterious Neutron rocket and Blue Origin&#8217;s heavy-lift launch vehicle New Glenn.</p>
<p>SpaceX and ULA are already established launch providers for the U.S. government under the Space Force’s National Security Space Launch program. Both Rocket Lab and Blue Origin will be able to compete for the next series of launch procurement contracts in 2024, and contracts like these are signs that the two companies are gearing up to do so.</p>

<h2>Blue Origin&#8217;s next manifest</h2>
<p>One last story related to Blue Origin this week&#8230; the company announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/dcvc-partner-and-planet-labs-co-founder-chris-boshuizen-bound-for-space-on-blue-origins-second-human-flight/">the next two people</a> that will take a ride on the New Shepard rocket: Dr. Chris Boshuizen, co-founder of Planet Labs and current partner at venture capital firm DCVC; and Glen de Vries, co-founder of the clinical trial software company Medidata Solutions.</p>
<p>The flight is scheduled to take off on Tuesday, October 12, at 9:30 AM EST from Blue Origin’s sprawling Launch Site One just outside of Van Horn, Texas. The company has not released details regarding the identities of the remaining two crew members but we&#8217;ll certainly be keeping our ear to the ground. (Read our story on Blue&#8217;s first crewed launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/blue-origins-new-shepard-carries-jeff-bezos-and-three-crew-members-to-space-and-back/">here</a>.)</p>
<h2>Orbital servicing startup raises $7M</h2>
<p>In-orbit satellite servicing company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/starfish-space-raises-7m-for-in-orbit-servicing-space-tug/">Starfish Space</a> raised $7 million to accelerate the development of its Otter &#8220;space tug,&#8221; a spacecraft that the company says will be able to clean up orbital debris and extend the useful life of satellites in geostationary orbit. In the longer-term, Starfish even says the space tug could be used as autonomous in-orbit robots for a whole range of purposes related to the future space economy, including mining, manufacturing and recycling.</p>

<h2>A $300M satellite manufacturing facility for Florida&#8217;s Space Coast</h2>
<p>Florida&#8217;s Space Coast economy got a major boost this week when it was announced that contract manufacturer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/terran-orbital-to-open-a-300m-satellite-manufacturing-and-component-facility-on-floridas-space-coast/">Terran Orbital</a> would build a $300 million satellite manufacturing facility at Kennedy Space Center. The 660,000-square-foot facility will be the world&#8217;s largest, according to the company, and that&#8217;s not too hard to believe, considering the anticipated output: 1,000 complete satellites and over 1 million satellite components per year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube announced on Monday that it’s expanding video action campaigns (one of Google&#8217;s interactive ad types for video) to connected televisions (CTV) to make YouTube ads more shoppable. The company says this new move will help advertisers drive more online sales and grow their businesses.</p>
<p>For context, when viewers see a video action campaign on their TV, they are invited through a URL at the bottom of their screen to continue shopping on the brand’s website from their desktop or mobile device. All of this is done without interrupting users&#8217; viewing sessions.</p>
<p>“With a quarter of logged-in YouTube CTV viewers watching primarily on TVs, the living room is becoming an essential place for brands to drive incremental conversions with new audiences. In early experiments for video action campaigns on TV screens, over 90% of conversions coming from CTV would not have been reachable on mobile and desktop devices,” said Romana Pawar, the director of product management for YouTube ads, in a <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/expanding-video-action-campaigns-to-ctv/">blog post.</a></p>
<p>Pawar notes that more people are choosing to view YouTube on the big screen, as more than 120 million people streamed YouTube or YouTube TV on their TVs last year in December in the U.S. Further, Pawar outlined that businesses with the goal of driving online sales should use video action campaigns in order to find new customers in a single campaign by combining inventory from across YouTube and Google video partners.</p>
<p>“For the first time, performance advertisers can take advantage of YouTube on CTV to drive and measure conversions,” Pawar outlined in the blog post. “Video action campaigns on TV screens are now globally available through Google Ads.”</p>
<p>Google first announced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/a-new-youtube-feature-will-make-its-connected-tv-ads-more-shoppable/">plans to make its connected TV ads more shoppable</a> earlier this year (in May). Consumers, particularly younger users, like to watch videos and engage while they shop. As a result, YouTube and other platforms like Facebook and Instagram have invested in live shopping and video-based shopping features.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA has a launch date for that most Hollywood of missions, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test, which is basically a dry run of the movie &#8220;Armageddon.&#8221; Unlike the film, this will not involve nukes, oil rigs or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujMxXOHJloI">Aerosmith</a>, but instead is a practical test of our ability to change the trajectory of an asteroid in a significant and predictable way.</p>
<p>The DART mission, managed by the Planetary Defense Coordination Office (!), involves sending a pair of satellites out to a relatively nearby pair of asteroids, known as the Didymos binary. It&#8217;s one large-ish asteroid, approximately 780 meters across — that&#8217;s Didymos proper — and a 160-meter &#8220;moonlet&#8221; in its orbit.</p>
<p>As the moonlet is more typical of the type likely to threaten Earth — there being more asteroids that are that size and not easily observed — we will be testing the possibility of intercepting one by smashing into it at nearly 15,000 miles per hour. This will change the speed of the moonlet by a mere fraction of a percent, but enough that its orbit period will be affected measurably. Knowing exactly how much will help us plan any future asteroid-deflection missions — not surprisingly, there isn&#8217;t a lot of existing science on ramming your spacecraft into space rocks.</p>
<p>A companion spacecraft, called the Light Italian CubeSat for Imagine Asteroids, or LICIACube, just had the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/dart-gets-its-cubesat-companion-its-last-major-piece">finishing touches put on it</a> last week and will be launched shortly before the operation and will attempt to fly by at the very moment of impact and capture &#8220;the resultant plume of ejecta and possibly the newly-formed impact crater.&#8221;</p>
<p>A very exciting and interesting mission to be sure, but had to be delayed past its original launch window of this summer, and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-invites-media-to-launch-of-double-asteroid-redirection-test">November 23 marks the first day of the new launch window</a>. DART is scheduled to launch from Vandenberg in Southern California at 10:20 PM on that date, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9.</p>
<p>With Osiris-Rex and Japan&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/21/japans-hayabusa-2-has-landed-on-an-asteroid-shot-it-with-a-special-bullet-and-returned-to-space/">Hayabusa-2</a> missions, Earth authorities are getting pretty good at reaching out and touching asteroids. We&#8217;ll know more about the plan of attack on the Didymos binary in the run-up to launch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration rejected a 2019 petition requesting the agency open a formal investigation into Tesla&#8217;s battery management software over allegations that an over-the-air update was defective and caused fires in five vehicles.</p>
<p>The agency decided not to open a formal investigation in part because the majority of those incidents occurred outside of the United States, according to a <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2019/INCLA-DP19005-2413.PDF">document posted on its website</a>. None of these were related to crashes and most were parked.</p>
<p>As part of its evaluation, NHTSA reviewed 59 complaints out of the total 61,781 Model S and Model X vehicles from 2012 to 2019 included in the petition before it decided to reject it. Out of the 59 complaints, 52 alleged reductions in battery capacity and seven alleged reductions in charging speed after the software was updated. Log data from the vehicles showed that the voltage limiting firmware was enabled in 58% of the complaints, but that subsequent updates restored some or all battery capacity to those vehicles, according to the report summary.</p>
<p>The agency did find that a perfect storm caused two of the fires that occurred in China in 2019. The vehicles had recently completed fast-charging sessions, the batteries were at a high state-of-charge and were parked with the battery cooling systems shut off. The two vehicles also had histories of high-stress usage.</p>
<p>Sources familiar with Tesla&#8217;s battery management system say if there were truly a systematic software issue, way more than five cars would have caught fire. The more likely causes of such infrequent issues would be physical defects from manufacturing or physical damage in the course of use, like putting recently Supercharged vehicles under high stress, which NHTSA says is more common in China where those fires occurred.</p>
<p>There were also two fires that occurred in the U.S., but one involved a vehicle with no Supercharging history that was driving at the time of the fire, and another that couldn&#8217;t be linked back to the high-voltage battery system. The fifth fire happened in Germany with a vehicle that had been parked at a low state of charge for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the absence of any incidents in the United States related to fast charging, and the absence of any such incidents globally since May 2019, it is unlikely that an order concerning the notification and remedy of a safety-related defect would be issued due to any investigation opened as a result of granting this petition,&#8221; the petition concluded. &#8220;Therefore, upon full consideration of the information presented in the petition, and the potential risks to safety, the petition is denied.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The report did say that the agency would take further action if warranted, despite the denial of this current petition, if future findings identify safety-related defects.</p>
<p class="paywall">Even as NHTSA rejects this petition, it is still moving forward with a different<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/tesla-ordered-to-share-autopilot-data-with-the-us-traffic-safety-agency/"> investigation into Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot software</a> after certain cars that had activated the advanced driver assistance system crashed into 12 parked first responder vehicles with flashing lights, resulting in 17 injuries and one death since 2018. Tesla has until October 22 to hand over detailed Autopilot data or face fines up to $115 million, a slap on the wrist, really, considering the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/teslas-quarterly-profit-surpasses-1-billion/#:~:text=Tesla%20reported%20revenue%20of%20%2411.96,and%20%24600%20million%20in%20profit.">second quarter net income of $1.14 billion</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile website building platform <a href="https://onuniverse.com/">Universe</a> has launched a new update that brings advanced creative controls, enhanced themes, block features and more to its grid-based web builder. Universe allows users to create a custom site or open an e-commerce store directly from a mobile phone through a simplified grid system without the need for coding. The new update, GRID System II, aims to simplify previously complex coding processes into intuitive gestures to make the website-building process easier.</p>
<p>“What makes Universe special is the grid system and what we’re announcing today is a big upgrade of that grid system. It’s going to allow people to do a lot more without any technical knowledge,” Universe CEO and founder Joseph Cohen told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>The website building process is based on simple building blocks, where the platform gives users a wide grid into which they can drop content. The new update brings redesigned creative controls with an improved graphical interface, which allows for control around block padding in the grid, along with granular text spacing. Cohen stated that users are now able to make the grid denser and can go up to seven columns wide. The new interface also includes enhanced color selection tools.</p>
<p>Further, Universe users can now also select from 30 new themes for their site or create their own. Prior to the addition of themes, every block was independently styled on a case-by-case basis. Now with the introduction of themes, users are able to apply consistent design elements across fonts, page backgrounds and button colors. The themes are applied to all surfaces of users’ sites, including text, backgrounds, headlines and colors.</p>
<p>“We have made 30 amazing themes that you can apply to your whole site. You could also go in and create your own theme from scratch. You can match or customize any of the ones that we give you out of the box. And any of the changes that you make will be applicable to your whole site. It&#8217;s basically a way of changing all the styles across the whole site in a visual and easy-to-use way,” Cohen stated.</p>
<p>Users can also now access new text styles, which allow them to classify text as titles, subtitles, captions and more. The company outlines that users can use the title indicator to boost SEO and enhance accessibility for their sites.</p>
<p>The new update also introduces a new layers feature that allows users to overlay blocks on top of each other. Previously, creators were unable to put two blocks, such as an image block and text block, on top of each other. With this new layers feature, users are given a lot more creative freedom with the design of their website.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Universe has also launched a new grid block feature that allows creators to combine different blocks in a sub-grid to create a cluster. It essentially lets you add a block to your site that creates another grid within that block, which can be used to add things like a photo gallery. Grid blocks allow for precise block arrangements to be placed on the grid. The sub-grid can then be dragged to any location on the page.</p>
<p>Although some may see Universe as a competitor to other popular website-building tools such as Shopify and Wix, Cohen says Universe is quite different.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212174" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FINAL_GRIID_Subgrid_Phone-Only.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212174" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2212174" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FINAL_GRIID_Subgrid_Phone-Only.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2212174" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Universe</p></div></p>
<p>“We invented a new interface called the grid, which basically allows someone who isn&#8217;t technical or isn&#8217;t a professional designer to create a totally custom website. There are other systems like Squarespace, Shopify, Weebly and Wix, but those are website builders that are desktop-based and template-based. Universe is not template-based, we do have templates available but it is not a template-based system. It&#8217;s not constrained by templates, so the grid itself is our interface for creation.”</p>
<p>In terms of usage, Cohen outlined that Universe has seen an increase in users amid the COVID-19 pandemic as many people started new businesses or side hustles and were looking to create websites. Early on in the pandemic, Universe released the ability for users to sell and ship products on their sites. As a result, users aren’t required to sign up for a third-party e-commerce tool, such as Shopify.</p>
<p>“Since the pandemic started, our business has really ballooned over the past year and a half. In terms of overall growth, we have more or less 10x the business in terms of the number of active sites that are created,” Cohen noted.</p>
<p>Further, Cohen outlined that Universe saw an increase in users from the influencer community who want a “link in bio” site, which is essentially a URL at the end of an Instagram profile&#8217;s bio that redirects users to a website outside of Instagram. The redirected site is often used to sell products, link to other social media accounts, showcase a portfolio and more. Cohen said that 40% of the sites created on Universe are for “link in bio” purposes and that these types of sites are Universe’s biggest growing areas of business, in addition to commerce.</p>
<p>Cohen says that Universe currently has hundreds of thousands of active sites and that the company plans to continue to launch more consumer-friendly updates in the future as the platform continues to grow.</p>
<p>“With this update, we’re leaping forward but we will continue to iterate this grid system for decades and in the fullness of time, anything that’s possible on the internet will be possible with our grid system. This includes the core creative elements but also the commerce capabilities around building a business,” Cohen stated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s stock took a dive Monday as the site suffered one of its worst outages of the past decade with services across its entire suite of products going offline while the tech company struggled to even bring its own internal services back online.</p>
<p>The stock ended the day down nearly 5%, with Facebook shedding tens of billions in market cap value as the company sorted through the pieces attempting to diagnose what triggered the outage, and investors looked to calculate what lasting damage to the site could look like. Facebook stock has been on a tear in 2021, reaching a $1 trillion market cap in early July, though the share price has stalled in recent months with the market cap currently resting just south of $920 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GraphWear, a company pursuing needle-free approaches to glucose monitoring, has closed a $20.5 million Series B round. This Series B round is a vote of confidence by investors in GraphWear’s approach: to monitor key metrics in the body, like glucose, without breaking the skin at all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GraphWear Technologies was founded in 2015 by Rajatesh Gudibande and Saurabh Radhakrishnan, who had both completed master’s degrees in nanotechnology at the University of Pennsylvania. Specifically, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">GraphWear is developing a skin-surface-level wearable made of graphene (more on this material later). The sensor is small, about the size of an Apple Watch &#8212; but the key piece of technology is actually housed on the bottom. It’s a thin slice of graphene that fits onto the back of the watch, or onto a sticker that can be worn on the abdomen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Series B round, says Gudibande, will be focused on helping the company build upon previous validation studies of the wearable, completing a pivotal trial and submitting for FDA clearance. The round was led by Mayfield, with participation from MissionBio Capital, Builders VC and VSC Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Holy Grail problem has been: can you really know what is happening in your blood without using things to prick your skin and draw blood out,” says Ursheet Parikh the co-leader of Mayfield&#8217;s engineering biology investment practice. “We think GraphWear has made progress and is likely to be one of the first companies to actually bring a product that can get to hundreds of millions of people.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuous glucose monitoring has been a recent push within the diabetes community. There have been several continuous glucose monitors approved in recent years, like the FreeStyle Libre, <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpma/pma.cfm?id=P160030">approved by the FDA in 2017</a>. That device still uses a subcutaneous filament on an arm patch to measure glucose levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These devices have clear upsides for people with Type I diabetes (people whose bodies make little or no insulin). That’s about </span><a href="https://www.diabetes.org/resources/statistics/statistics-about-diabetes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.6 million people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S. alone. The American Diabetes Association notes that most people who regularly inject insulin “should be encouraged” to use self-monitoring glucose technologies, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">including </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">continuous glucose monitors, in </span><a href="https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/43/Supplement_1/S77"><span style="font-weight: 400;">its 2020 guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for people with Type II diabetes (</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/type2.html#:~:text=Healthy%20eating%20is%20your%20recipe,adults%20are%20also%20developing%20it."><span style="font-weight: 400;">about 34 million Americans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), or for people who don’t regularly inject insulin, there’s a bit more debate. <a href="https://khn.org/news/article/continuous-glucose-monitoring-blood-sugar-little-evidence-beneficial-type-2-diabetes-patients/">Some argue</a> that regularly monitoring glucose (which is what continuous glucose monitors do) isn&#8217;t worth it for these populations. For example <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2630691">one 2017</a> JAMA Internal Medicine study found that routine self-monitoring of glucose didn&#8217;t lead people to improve their A1c levels (a key diabetes biomarker) after one year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That study, though, evaluated people who regularly used finger-stick tests, rather than non-invasive continuous glucose monitors. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the American Diabetes Association </span><a href="https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/43/Supplement_1/S77"><span style="font-weight: 400;">notes that</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, if used properly, continuous glucose monitors in conjunction with insulin therapy, can be useful tools for these people as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GraphWear’s sensor takes a nanotechnology-based approach to continuous glucose monitoring. And, unlike other continuous glucose monitors, which may require a small retractable filament or finger sticks to evaluate blood glucose, the device doesn’t break the skin at all, says Gudibande. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The graphene has an electric field that drags the molecules up,” Gudibande explains. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re talking about about 200 molecules,” he continues. “It then ‘tastes’ it, converts it to an electrical signal, and then transports via Bluetooth to your phone that can chart and display glucose values continuously.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that these sensors are actually measuring the glucose present in interstitial fluid, not the glucose present in blood. However, there’s evidence glucose measured from the interstitial fluid </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“<a href="https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/43/Supplement_1/S77">correlates well with plasma glucose</a>”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, per the American Diabetes Association’s 2020 guidelines, so measurements taken this way are still clinically relevant for people with diabetes. Gudibande adds, &#8220;our own empirical clinical data suggests the same.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GraphWear has already completed one </span><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04226846"><span style="font-weight: 400;">feasibility study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the wearable sensor on 40 patients with both Type I and Type II diabetes. They tested the device’s glucose monitoring against glucose measures collected from venous blood draws. Results have not yet been released. However, Gudibande says that GraphWear’s accuracy was “comparable” to that of the traditional sensor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glucose monitoring aside, another big picture element to consider when it comes to GraphWear is the material the sensor is made of: graphene. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graphene is a single-atom thin carbon sheet. It happens to be an </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2014.14676"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exceptional conductor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of electricity, and is strong, light and flexible. Since graphene was <a href="https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200910/physicshistory.cfm#:~:text=The%20man%20who%20first%20discovered,State%20Physics%20in%20Chernogolovka%2C%20Russia.">discovered in 2004</a>, the material has generated a lot of hype &#8212; it was </span><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/click_online/9491789.stm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supposed to be the next silicon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though that hasn’t quite happened yet.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/27/graphene-wonder-material-national-security-china-uk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.K.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, China and </span><a href="https://graphene-flagship.eu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the EU</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are investing heavily in production of graphene at an industrial scale. And there are some graphene products leaking on the market already (it’s in bikes, shoes, sensors and tennis rackets, to name a few applications highlighted in a </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-019-0555-2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 review paper)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GraphWear can keep the graphene used in its sensors “pristine,” says Gudibande, which allows it to be highly sensitive to glucose molecules that it may encounter. The company, says Parikh, can also manufacture the material at scale, and is developing new applications of nanotechnology that could be useful beyond sensing glucose. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, the team has patented a way to use </span><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2017216641A3/en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">polarized fluids as transistors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If your glucose molecules are on the skin, it becomes like a transient transistor that shows up,” says Parikh. “That is a new class of transistor, and that’s a fundamental innovation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The glucose monitoring, though, is a smart first step for the company, because there&#8217;s a decently clear pathway to approval. If the company’s upcoming pivotal trial demonstrates that it’s similar to other continuous glucose monitors it could pursue FDA 510(k) clearance. Though, as Gudibande acknowledges, there could be some unforeseen pitfalls. For instance, it&#8217;s possible that GraphWear&#8217;s noninvasive approach could put it in a class of its own. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So there’s a risk to that, of whether we will be 510(k),” Gudibande says. “But the process for that will be anywhere from six to 14 months. Our goal is to get through the trials and submit to the regulatory body.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If GraphWear can deliver on measuring other biomolecules using its graphene platform, they could use the platform to detect other molecules or continuously monitor what’s going on inside the body. This Series B round, though, will be focused on delivering the first step: a clinically evaluated, graphene-based sensor.</span></p>
