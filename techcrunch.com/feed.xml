										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;re old enough to remember the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/03/hearts-and-stars-twitter/">outrage</a> that followed Twitter&#8217;s decision to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/03/heart-heart-heart/">replace stars with hearts</a> (aka likes instead of favorites), then you know that Twitter&#8217;s user base has strong feelings about how it wants to engage with tweets. Now, Twitter is considering another radical change on this front that could shake things up yet again. The company has been surveying users throughout the month to get input on how they feel about a broader set of emoji-style reactions, similar to what you&#8217;d see on Facebook.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re exploring additional ways for people to express themselves in conversations happening on Twitter,&#8221; a Twitter spokesperson said of the survey.</p>
<p>Specifically, Twitter&#8217;s survey proposed a few different sets of reaction emojis, all of which include the heart (like), laughing face with tears (funny), thinking face (interesting), and crying face (sad).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2129773" style="width: 392px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129773" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2129773" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwyQIqdWEAAdoOd.jpeg?w=382" alt="" width="382" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwyQIqdWEAAdoOd.jpeg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwyQIqdWEAAdoOd.jpeg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwyQIqdWEAAdoOd.jpeg?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwyQIqdWEAAdoOd.jpeg?resize=382,680 382w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwyQIqdWEAAdoOd.jpeg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129773" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/jdm0079/status/1372630471419469825" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@jdm0079 on Twitter <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>It then proposed some variations on this basic set, where the &#8220;awesome&#8221; sentiment could be expressed with either the shocked face or fire emoji, or where a &#8220;support&#8221; sentiment could be indicated with either the hug emoji or the raised hands.</p>
<p>More controversially, Twitter is considering a way for users to signal a general like or dislike for the tweet with either a thumbs up or thumbs down, a &#8220;100&#8221; in either green or red to indicate &#8220;agree&#8221; or &#8220;disagree,&#8221; or a green up arrow icon or red down arrow icon, reminiscent of Reddit&#8217;s upvote and downvote mechanisms.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129713" style="width: 316px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129713" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2129713" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuOc_VoAQQgaD.jpeg?w=306" alt="" width="306" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuOc_VoAQQgaD.jpeg 922w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuOc_VoAQQgaD.jpeg?resize=68,150 68w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuOc_VoAQQgaD.jpeg?resize=135,300 135w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuOc_VoAQQgaD.jpeg?resize=768,1706 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuOc_VoAQQgaD.jpeg?resize=306,680 306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuOc_VoAQQgaD.jpeg?resize=692,1536 692w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuOc_VoAQQgaD.jpeg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129713" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/WFBrother/status/1374633883593887747" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WFBrother on Twitter <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The survey questions demonstrated that Twitter is aware of the challenges that come with introducing emoji reactions that could imply negative sentiments. It asked the respondents how they would want to take advantage of a downvote or dislike, for example &#8212; whether they would use the reaction instead of replying to a tweet, or whether they would downvote irrelevant or offensive tweets, as well.</p>
<p>Twitter also asked how users would feel if their own tweets were downvoted and whether that would discourage them from tweeting in the future, or if they would take it more as &#8220;constructive&#8221; feedback about their content. (Ha!)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129796" style="width: 392px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129796" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2129796" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwyQIqiWEAAEUsw.jpeg?w=382" alt="" width="382" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwyQIqiWEAAEUsw.jpeg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwyQIqiWEAAEUsw.jpeg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwyQIqiWEAAEUsw.jpeg?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwyQIqiWEAAEUsw.jpeg?resize=382,680 382w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwyQIqiWEAAEUsw.jpeg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129796" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/jdm0079/status/1372630471419469825" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@jdm0079 on Twitter <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The company clearly understands that the introduction of reaction sets could have a significant impact on how people engage with Twitter content and, potentially, could even lead to a chilling effect on Twitter usage if people became overly concerned about having their tweets downvoted.</p>
<p>That said, the upvote and downvote mechanism &#8212; whether as thumbs or arrows or anything else &#8212; remains a common way to engage with content elsewhere on the web. This includes not only forum sites like Reddit and others, but also YouTube, Imgur, and Pandora, to name a few. A &#8220;thumbs up&#8221; signal by itself, meanwhile, is even more popular thanks to Facebook&#8217;s lead. But today, this like button can also take the shape of an arrow, heart, or just a box to click &#8212; like when you mark an Amazon.com user review as &#8220;Helpful,&#8221; for example.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the use of expanded emoji reactions has become more common since Facebook&#8217;s emoji reaction set <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/08/with-reactions-facebook-supercharges-the-like-button-with-6-empathetic-emoji/">debuted in 2015.</a> Since then, other social media sites adopted their use, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/linkedin-adds-a-range-of-reactions-to-spur-more-engagement-in-conversations/">like LinkedIn.</a> Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/twitter-dms-now-have-emoji-reactions/">even added emoji reactions to its DMs</a> (direct messages) last year.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s survey additionally asked users about how the thought the emoji reactions should be displayed &#8212; like whether negative reaction counts should be visible, for instance.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129793" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129793" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2129793" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuNzWVcAEsl4H.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="345" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuNzWVcAEsl4H.jpeg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuNzWVcAEsl4H.jpeg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuNzWVcAEsl4H.jpeg?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuNzWVcAEsl4H.jpeg?resize=680,345 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuNzWVcAEsl4H.jpeg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129793" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/WFBrother/status/1374633883593887747" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@WFBrother on Twitter <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Twitter told TechCrunch the work it&#8217;s doing in the space of reactions is exploratory &#8212; it&#8217;s only running this survey now because the company is thinking about ways people could add more nuance to the conversations they&#8217;re having, and how, by doing so, readers would be able to better understand the additional context around those conversations. Plus, Twitter notes that the new emoji reactions would not replace the &#8220;heart;&#8221; they&#8217;re additive.</p>
<p>But although Twitter hasn&#8217;t yet built out its emoji reaction set or put it into testing, it appears it&#8217;s on the path to do so.</p>
<p>In response to a user&#8217;s recent request to test emoji reactions instead of just hearts, Twitter Chief Design Officer Dantley Davis <a href="https://twitter.com/dantley/status/1372717290295238658">replied</a>, &#8220;we&#8217;ll have something for you soon.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Facebook on Wednesday announced new actions to disrupt a network of China-based hackers leveraging the platform to compromise targets in the Uyghur community. The group, known to security researchers as &#8220;Earth Empusa&#8221; &#8220;Evil Eye&#8221; or &#8220;Poison Carp,&#8221; targeted around around 500 people on Facebook, including individuals living abroad in the United States, Turkey, Syria, Australia [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook on Wednesday announced new actions to disrupt a network of China-based hackers leveraging the platform to compromise targets in the Uyghur community.</p>
<p>The group, known to security researchers as &#8220;Earth Empusa&#8221; &#8220;Evil Eye&#8221; or &#8220;Poison Carp,&#8221; targeted around around 500 people on Facebook, including individuals living abroad in the United States, Turkey, Syria, Australia and Canada. Through fake accounts on Facebook, the hackers posed as activists, journalists and other sympathetic figures in order to send their targets to compromised websites beyond Facebook.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s security and cyber espionage teams began seeing the activity in 2020 and opted to disclose the threat publicly to maximize the impact on the hacking group, which has proven sensitive to public disclosures in the past.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though Facebook says social engineering efforts on the platform are &#8220;a piece of the puzzle,&#8221; most of the hacking group&#8217;s efforts take place elsewhere online. They focus on attempts to gain access to targets&#8217; devices with watering hole attacks and lookalike domains, including a fake Android app store offering prayer apps and Uyghur-themed keyboard downloads.</p>
<p>When downloaded, those fake apps infected devices using two strains of Android trojan malware, <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/f/new-android-spyware-actionspy-revealed-via-phishing-attacks-from-earth-empusa.html">ActionSpy</a> and PluginPhantom. On iOS devices, the hackers leveraged malware known as Insomnia.</p>
<p>While the hackers targeted a small number of users relative to what the company sees in disinformation operations, Facebook stressed that a small, well-chosen group of targets can result in huge impacts. &#8220;You can imagine surveillance, you can imagine a range of secondary consequences&#8221; Facebook Head of Security Policy Nathaniel Gleicher said.</p>
<p>The Uyghurs are a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority in China that continues to face brutal repression from the Chinese government, including being <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-54277430">forced into labor camps</a> in the country&#8217;s Xinjiang province.</p>
<p>Facebook declined to link what it observed to the Chinese government, saying that it defers to the broader security community to make those determinations when it lacks the technical indicators to do so itself. Researchers believe that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/tibetans-iphone-android-hacks-uyghurs/"> adjacent hacking campaigns</a> are Beijing&#8217;s efforts to extend its surveillance of communities it already subjugates within China&#8217;s bounds.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">One year.</p>
<p>That’s how long Google gave developers to start implementing required changes to improve user experience. In early May 2020, Google <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience">published</a> a modest post on one of its developer blogs introducing <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9205520?hl=en">Core Web Vitals</a> &#8212; a set of metrics that will result in major changes to the way websites are ranked by the search engine. In May 2021, Google will officially add those Core Web Vitals to the various other “page experience” signals it analyzes when deciding how to rank websites.</p>
<p>The quest to improve a website’s position in search results has spawned hundreds (if not thousands) of how-to articles over the years. Businesses that are scared about taking a hit to SEO from Google’s new metrics have been pushing developers to optimize company websites. At the same time, developers have been frustrated because there’s a lot that goes into user experience that isn’t reflected in the Core Web Vitals. A lot of details have to be juggled.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Aside from improved SEO, small business websites optimizing for the new metrics will reap the rewards of an improved user experience for their site visitors.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But what about the startups, tech companies and small business owners who handle their own websites in-house? What about the agencies and enterprise platforms that manage or host hundreds or even thousands of websites for clients? While many are looking at the Core Web Vitals as a big hoop to jump through to please the search powers that be, others are seeing &#8212; and seizing &#8212; the opportunities that come along with this change.</p>
<h2><strong>Improving user experience will be rewarded</strong></h2>
<p>Small businesses wondering “What’s in it for me?” should recognize that if all other things are equal, optimizing for the Core Web Vitals is going to be a significant tiebreaker between websites. If a company’s site is ranking really well with these rigorous metrics, it will have an edge against competitors in searches when content and ranking are otherwise comparable.</p>
<p>Aside from improved SEO, small business websites optimizing for the new metrics will reap the rewards of an improved user experience for their site visitors. Internet users frequently complain about <a href="https://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/building-websites/website-load-time-statistics/">long wait times as pages are loading</a>, or problems with an entire page shifting just as the user goes to click a specific button &#8212; which results in them clicking the wrong button and causing further delays. For online retail websites, <a href="https://www.fasthosts.co.uk/blog/need-for-speed-slow-loading-websites-cost-retailers-nearly-60bn-in-lost-sales-each-year/">a poor user experience leads to lost revenue</a> as users abandon shopping carts and never return to a site. Once the Core Web Vitals go into effect, companies that have made the efforts to provide smooth and speedy performance for visitors will win out against competitors that retain sluggish designs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Investor FOMO following Roblox&#8217;s blockbuster public debut is pushing venture capitalists who missed out on that gaming giant to invest in competing platforms.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://recroom.com/">Rec Room</a> announced it has raised $100 million from Sequoia and Index, with participation from Madrona Venture Group. The deal is a huge influx of capital for Rec Room, which had raised less than $50 million before this round, including a $20 million Series C that closed in December. In 2019, we reported that the company had raised its Series B at a $126 million valuation, this latest deal values the company at $1.25 billion, showcasing how investor sentiment for the gaming space has shifted in the wake of Roblox&#8217;s monster growth.</p>
<p>Rec Room launched as a virtual reality-only platform, but as headset sales creeped along slowly, the company embraced traditional game consoles, PC and mobile to expand its reach.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a press release accompanying today&#8217;s funding announcement, Rec Room detailed it has surpassed 15 million &#8220;lifetime users&#8221; and had shown 566% year-over-year revenue growth. In December, CEO Nick Fajt told TechCrunch that the company has tripled its player base in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>The company has been following in Roblox&#8217;s footsteps in many ways as it build out its creator tools and seeks to build out an on-platform economy for game creators. The company says that two million players have created content on the platform and that Rec Room is on track to pay out more than $1 million to them this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A German court that&#8217;s considering Facebook&#8217;s appeal against a pioneering pro-privacy order by the country&#8217;s competition authority to stop combining user data without consent has said it will refer questions to Europe&#8217;s top court.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.olg-duesseldorf.nrw.de/behoerde/presse/Presse_aktuell/20210324_PM_Facebook2/index.php">press release</a> today the Düsseldorf court writes [translated by Google]: &#8220;&#8230;the Senate has come to the conclusion that a decision on the Facebook complaints can only be made after referring to the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ).</p>
<p>&#8220;The question of whether Facebook is abusing its dominant position as a provider on the German market for social networks because it collects and uses the data of its users in violation of the GDPR can not be decided without referring to the ECJ. Because the ECJ is responsible for the interpretation of European law.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Bundeskartellamt (Federal Cartel Office, FCO)&#8217;s &#8216;exploitative abuse&#8217; case links Facebook&#8217;s ability to gather data on users of its products from across the web, via third party sites (where it deploys plug-ins and tracking pixels), and across its own suite of products (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus), to its market power &#8212; asserting this data-gathering is not legal under EU privacy law as users are not offered a choice.</p>
<p>The associated competition contention, therefore, is that inappropriate contractual terms allow Facebook to build a unique database for each individual user and unfairly gain market power over rivals who don&#8217;t have such broad and deep reach into user&#8217;s personal data.</p>
<p>The FOC&#8217;s case against Facebook is seen as highly innovative as it combines the (usually) separate (and even conflicting) tracks of competition and privacy law &#8212; offering the tantalizing prospect, were the order to actually get enforced, of a structural separation of Facebook&#8217;s business empire without having to order a break up of its various business units up.</p>
<p>However enforcement at this point &#8212; some five years after the FCO started investigating Facebook&#8217;s data practices in March 2016 &#8212; is still a big if.</p>
<p>Soon after the FCO&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/german-antitrust-office-limits-facebooks-data-gathering/">February 2019</a> order to stop combining user data, Facebook succeeded in blocking the order via a court appeal in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/facebook-succeeds-in-blocking-german-fcos-privacy-minded-order-against-combining-user-data/">August 2019</a>.</p>
<p>But then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/antitrust-case-against-facebooks-super-profiling-back-on-track-after-german-federal-court-ruling/">last summer</a> Germany’s federal court unblocked the &#8216;superprofiling&#8217; case &#8212; reviving the FCO&#8217;s challenge to the tech giant&#8217;s data-harvesting-by-default.</p>
<p>The latest development means another long wait to see whether competition law innovation can achieve what the EU&#8217;s privacy regulators have so far failed to do &#8212; with multiple GDPR challenges against Facebook still sitting undecided on the desk of the Irish Data Protection Commission.</p>
<p>Albeit, it&#8217;s fair to say that neither route looks capable of &#8216;moving fast and breaking&#8217; platform power at this point.</p>
<p>In its opinion the Düsseldorf court does appear to raise questions over the level of Facebook&#8217;s data collection, suggesting the company could avoid antitrust concerns by offering users a choice to base profiling on only the data they upload themselves rather than on a wider range of data sources, and querying its use of Instagram and Oculus data.</p>
<p>But it also found fault with the FCO&#8217;s approach &#8212; saying Facebook&#8217;s US and Irish business entities were not granted a fair hearing before the order against its German sister company was issued, among other procedural quibbles.</p>
<p>Referrals to the EU&#8217;s Court of Justice can take years to return a final interpretation.</p>
<p>In this case the ECJ will likely be asked to consider whether the FCO has exceeded its remit, although the exact questions being referred by the court have not been confirmed &#8212; with a written reference set to be issued in the next few weeks, per its press release.</p>
<p>In a statement responding to the court&#8217;s announcement today, a Facebook spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Today, the Düsseldorf Court has expressed doubts as to the legality of the Bundeskartellamt’s order and decided to refer questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union. We believe that the Bundeskartellamt’s order also violates European law.”</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m a startup founder looking to expand in the U.S. I was originally looking at opening an office in Silicon Valley to be close to software engineers and investors, but then … COVID-19 :) </strong></p>
<p><strong>A lot has changed over the last year — can I still come?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Hopeful in Hungary</strong></p>
<p>Dear Hopeful:</p>
<p>How and where work is getting done in Silicon Valley (as well as in much of the world)  shifted during the COVID-19 pandemic. That said, yes, it can still make business sense for many to join the Silicon Valley ecosystem.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q1-2021-pitchbook-analyst-note-the-bay-area-still-holds-the-keys-to-vc?utm_medium=nl-na&amp;utm_source=reports&amp;utm_campaign=q1-2021-pitchbook-analyst-note-the-bay-area-still-holds-the-keys-to-vc&amp;sourceType=NEWSLETTER">a recent report from PitchBook</a>, Silicon Valley will continue to be the center for VC investment and high-tech talent, even though several large tech companies relocated out of Silicon Valley and implemented full-time work-from-home policies &#8212; and many predicted that “the Bay Area tech scene as we know it would be lost, and VC would find a new home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearly, while the pandemic’s impact on the venture industry will be felt in years to come, VC will continue to be centered in Silicon Valley. <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/063-immigration-global-mobility-working-from-home-and-the-future-of-work/">In a recent episode of my podcast</a>, I discussed work trends and how to use immigration to support company priorities as well as attract and retain talent in the United States.</p>
<p>The PitchBook report points out that Silicon Valley “has kept a tight hold on fundraising in the U.S., closing on commitments exceeding $151 billion over the past five years, more than the rest of the U.S. ecosystems combined. LPs have continued to funnel capital to area VCs because of the region’s track record of success, which includes 17 of the 22 U.S. companies to ever receive a private valuation of $10 billion or more.”</p>

<p>So while VCs will likely return to the old ways of networking and funding post-pandemic, we’ll see a hybrid of online and in-person meetings because there are so many benefits to in-person networking and exchanging ideas.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’m sure I’m not the only one who had a minor meltdown on seeing that Slack had finally added the Connect feature it announced in October. I’m a firm believer that there are already entirely too many ways to get ahold of me. On top of the countless inbox pitches I field on a daily basis, Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook have contributed to the barrage &#8212; and Clubhouse seems to be elbowing its way in.</p>
<p>Surely not Slack, too? That bastion of workplace productivity and Simpsons gifs has (mostly) been a safe haven. Today, the company added Connect, promising, “Employees at more than 74,000 organizations and counting can now securely direct message anyone – inside or outside their company.”</p>
<p>A convenient new resource for open communications? Or a Pacific Rim-style breach waiting to send a never-ending barrage of horrors into your workplace chat? Obviously that depends on a lot of things &#8212; including who you are and what you do. We have, however, reached out to Slack to get clarification on a few things, including just how open workplaces across the world will be to the aforementioned 74,000 organizations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>[A]n organization’s IT admins can control who has access to this feature, disable this feature for their teams, and monitor all external connections, including Slack Connect DMs. Once this feature is enabled, DMs can be initiated without the need for additional admin approval. If an organization has disabled Slack Connect DMs, their users cannot send or accept Slack Connect DM invitations. If an organization has limited the ability to accept Slack Connect DMs to those coming from verified organizations, their users will not be able to accept Slack Connect DMs from non-verified organizations. This will also help in preventing spam and phishing attempts.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the feature is opt-in, not opt-out. If the IT admins don’t turn the feature on, their users won’t be able to either send or receive DMs through the new system. One of the upshots of the feature is third-party app integration through services like Calendly (for scheduling) and DocuSign (for, erm, document signing).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’ve all heard the adage, less is more. But when it comes to learning all the complex ins and outs of building and launching a successful startup, more is definitely the way to go. Enter not one, but two bootcamp experiences for the early-stage crowd: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/">TC Early Stage: Operations and Fundraising</a> on April 1-2 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising</a> on July 8-9.</p>
<p>Here’s another relevant adage: A penny saved is a penny earned. Kill two adages with one click, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/#tickets">buy a dual-event pass at the early-bird price</a> and you’ll save $100 or more. More knowledge for less money — what’s not to love?</p>
<p><strong>Big, fat caveat:</strong> Procrastinate at your own peril. Prices on dual-event passes go up this <strong>Friday, March 26 at precisely 11:59 pm (PST).</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Both TC Early Stage events focus on the essential skills every founder needs to succeed, and you’ll learn from leading industry experts. Each bootcamp features a discrete set of speakers, range of topics and presentations, but they&#8217;re all dedicated to helping founders in the early stages of the startup journey build a solid foundation.</p>
<p>We have a tremendously talented group of people ready to share their expertise and experience with you. Check out the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/#b0807dca-a87a-47e9-903a-86c80adef221">TC Early Stage agenda for April</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s another cool commonality: Day two of each bootcamp features a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/announcing-the-tc-early-stage-pitch-off/">TC Early Stage Pitch-Off</a>. You’ll tune in live to watch 10 global early-stage companies pitch to a panel of top VCs. The ultimate winner will be featured on TechCrunch.com, receive an annual Extra Crunch subscription and attend TC Disrupt this September — gratis.</p>
<p>Contenders for the April pitch-off are ready to go, but we’ll be opening the application process for July soon, so keep checking back for your chance to bring the heat.</p>
<p>We’re busy building out the agenda for July’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising</a>, but we’re thrilled to share that Lisa Wu, a partner at Norwest —with investments like Calm, Plaid, Opendoor and Grove Collaborative — will join us to discuss <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/how-to-ace-the-1-hour-and-ever-elusive-pitch-presentation-at-tc-early-stage/">how to ace a 1-hour pitch</a>. Spoiler alert: think like a VC.</p>
<p>Get more and spend less is the best possible adage (okay, we made that up). But hey, saving up to $100 on a dual-event pass to TC Early Stage in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/">April</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">July</a> is just a smart way to go. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/#tickets">Buy your pass</a> before the deadline hits this <strong>Friday,</strong> <strong>March 26 at 11:59 pm (PST).</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic has clearly had an impact on the way we work, and this is especially true for salespeople. <a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> introduced a number updates to Sales Cloud this morning including Salesforce Meetings, a smart overlay for Zoom meetings that gives information and advice to the sales team as they interact with potential customers in online meetings.</p>
<p>Bill Patterson, EVP and General Manager of CRM applications at Salesforce says that the company wanted to help sales teams manage these types of interactions better and take advantage of the fact they are digital.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a broad recognition, not just from Salesforce, but really from every sales organization that selling is forever changed, and I think that there&#8217;s been a broad understanding, and maybe a surprise in learning how effective we can be in the from anywhere kind of times, whether that&#8217;s in office or not in office or whatever,&#8221; Patterson explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Salesforce Meetings gives that overlay of information, whether it&#8217;s advice to slow down the pace of your speech or information about the person speaking. It can also compile action items and present a To Do list to participants at the end of each meeting to make sure that tasks don&#8217;t fall through the cracks.</p>
<p>This is made possible in part through the Einstein intelligence layer that is built across the entire Salesforce platform. In this case, it takes advantage of a new tool called Einstein Intelligent Insights, which the company is also exposing as a feature for developers to build their own solutions using this tool.</p>
<p>For sales people who might find the tool a bit too invasive, you can dial the confidence level of the information up or down on an individual basis, so that you can get a lot of information or a little depending on your needs.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uWgPfIFYkD"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">Salesforce buys Slack in a $27.7B megadeal</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Salesforce buys Slack in a $27.7B megadeal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/embed/#?secret=uWgPfIFYkD" data-secret="uWgPfIFYkD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For now, it works with Zoom and the company has been working closely with the Zoom development team to provide the API and SDK tooling it needs to pull something like this off, according to Patterson. He notes that plans are in the works to make it compatible with WebEx and Microsoft Teams in the future.</p>
<p>While the idea was in the works prior to the pandemic, COVID created a sense of urgency for this kind of feature, as well as other features announced today like Pipeline Inspection, which uses AI to analyze the sales pipeline. It searches for changes to deals over time with the goal of finding the ones that could benefit most from coaching or managerial support to get them over the finish line.</p>
<p>Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst at CRM Essentials says that this ability to capture information in online meetings is changing the way we think about CRM.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing the caught my attention is how tightly integrated video meetings/collaboration is now into sales process. This is really compelling because meeting interactions that may not find their way into the CRM system are now automatically captured,&#8221; Leary told me.</p>
<p>Salesforce Meetings is available today, while Pipeline Inspection is expected to be available this summer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Covering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/bevy-raises-40m-series-c-with-20-coming-from-black-investors/">YC Demo Day</a> yesterday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-2/">was good fun</a>, but I missed a few items while watching several hundred startup pitches. A few years ago, these stories might have been the biggest news of the week.</p>
<p>But with the venture capital market redlining its engines while public markets remain sympathetic to growing, unprofitable companies, there&#8217;s lots going on. So, as a follow-up to our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/discords-10b-exit-compass-and-intermedia-cloud-communications-set-ipo-price-ranges/">first late-stage roundup</a> that we published yesterday morning, here&#8217;s another.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>This time we&#8217;re discussing IPO news from DigitalOcean (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/olo-raises-ipo-range-as-digitalocean-sees-possible-5b-debut-valuation/">context</a>), Kaltura (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/kaltura-files-to-go-public-on-the-back-of-accelerating-revenue-growth-rising-losses/">context</a>), Robinhood (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-q4-2020-revenue-shows-a-return-to-growth/">context</a>) and Zymergen, and big rounds for Lattice and goPuff. That&#8217;s a lot to chew on, but I&#8217;ll be brief and to the point.</p>

Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<h2>IPO updates</h2>
<p>Today&#8217;s most pressing news is that <strong>DigitalOcean</strong>, a provider of cloud services to small businesses, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/digitalocean-ipo-prices-at-47-a-share-high-end-of-range-2021-03-24">priced its IPO</a> at $47 per share last night. That was right at the top of its public-offering price range of $44 to $47. Before counting shares reserved for its underwriters, DigitalOcean is worth just under $5 billion.</p>
<p>And the company raised a gross $775.5 million in the offering, giving DigitalOcean a massive war chest to pursue its vision. As the company has proved increasingly unprofitable on a GAAP basis in recent years, the extra cash isn&#8217;t a problem: DigitalOcean plans to reduce its aggregate debt load with some of the proceeds, which will improve its profitability.</p>
<p>The company won&#8217;t trade for hours, so we&#8217;re done with DigitalOcean for now. File it in your mind as a win, as the company raised $50 million last year at a $1.1 billion valuation (<a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook data</a>). That&#8217;s a quick 5x.</p>
<p>Next up from the IPO treadmill is <strong>Kaltura</strong>, which released a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001432133/000162828021005315/kalturas-1a1.htm">first guess</a> of its market value as a public company. Targeting $14 to $16 per share in its impending debut, the video software company is worth around $2 billion at the top end of its range, not counting shares reserved for its underwriting banks or other shares tied up in vested options and recruited stock units (RSUs).<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Plaid, the fintech giant, has announced the inaugural cohort of startups in its new accelerator program, FinRise.</p>
<p>The equity-free and capital-free program has chosen five early-stage fintech startups out of 100 applications to join its cohort, working on issues central to the financial services industry such as simplifying payments and access to credit. The accelerator, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/plaid-launches-finrise-an-incubator-for-underrepresented-fintech-founders/">announced two months ago</a>, is explicitly focused on backing underrepresented founders in tech.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Plaid launches FinRise, an incubator for underrepresented fintech founders&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/plaid-launches-finrise-an-incubator-for-underrepresented-fintech-founders/embed/#?secret=uAC06AZ0Dx" data-secret="uAC06AZ0Dx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Last week, The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/altimeter-to-lead-plaid-deal-after-scrapped-visa-merger">reported</a> that Plaid is nearing a new financing deal that would value the company at between $10 billion to $15 billion. Beyond a high valuation, Plaid sports a key characteristic that positions it well to help early-stage startups: it has gone through regulatory hurdles. Months ago, Plaid announced it would not merge with Visa in what would have been a $5.3 billion dollar acquisition. This event, as well as advice on how privat fintech startups can deal with policy issues, will be part of FinRise programming.</p>
<p>While participants don’t get funding, FinRise has collated a number of “capital access partners” which basically means investors who are committed to meeting with these companies and potentially writing a check. This network includes Accion, Acrew, Amex Ventures, Flourish, Harlem Capital, Kapor, Matrix, Village Capital, Visible Hands, and First Round.</p>
<h3>Here’s a look at the five startups:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://com">Global Data Consortium</a> </strong>is building a process for global digital identity verification for businesses. Co-founded by Bill Spruill and Charles Gaddy, the startup is building a data supplier network of more than 200 sources to help build a standard of processes around digital identity verification. “As we continue to scale our platform it’s important to make sure our technical infrastructure continues to be enterprise-ready. Plaid’s engineering expertise and knowledge will prove useful to our team to help us plan and execute around our next level of service support architecture,” Spruill told TechCrunch.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.guidefi.com/about-us">Guidefi</a></strong> is a marketplace focused on connecting communities of color to culturally-savvy financial advisors. Led by Charlene Fadirepo, the financial wellness startup doesn’t charge for matches to advisors, but only begins pricing once services begini.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.ofcolor.com/">OfColor</a></strong> wants to be the go-to enterprise wellness platform for employees of color. Founder Yemi Rose tells TechCrunch that “a lot of companies we encounter generally pride themselves on being colorblind in their HR benefit practices, in spite of outcomes that show a different approach is needed&#8230;our biggest hurdle is education.” The startup focuses on features like a personalized financial manager as well as loans that allow employees to maximize their 401(k) contribution.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.hellowalnut.com/">Walnut</a></strong> is a point-of-sale lending platform that wants to make healthcare more affordable for patients. Roshan Patel, founder and CEO of the startup, says that its biggest competitor is PrimaHealth Credit, which focuses on elective care. “Walnut is care-agnostic: no matter where you are in the healthcare system, you can use Walnut to break up your bill into an installment plan that works for you. That can be at the dentist or cosmetic surgery practice, but it can also be in the emergency room or at your primary care physician,” he said.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.askzeta.com/">Zeta</a></strong> wants to build a better joint-bank experience for the modern couple. F<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/zeta-joint-card-seed/">irst covered by TechCrunch in February</a>, Zeta has already raised $1.5 million in venture funding to create a platform that makes it easier to join accounts and split purchases. “In some ways, we see ourselves as part of a replacement for Venmo,” CEO and co-founder Aditi Shekar said. “We saw couples Venmoing back and forth to each other sometimes six times a day…we want to take over your money chores.” While Zeta is entering the market as a tool for couples, Shekar sees the startup’s moonshot as being the go-to operational account for any modern household.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Leveraging networks of “experts” online started out as a very manual online business. But it’s rapidly becoming more efficient as machine learning is applied to the whole business model. Indeed, in the UK alone $60bn is spent a year on using outside expertise. Large players in this space include GLG, Third Bridge, Guidepoint, and AlphaSights. And we saw recently that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/18/prosapient-raises-10m-series-a-led-by-smedvig-capital-to-expand-expert-network-platform/">ProSapient has raised $18m</a> for its SaaS platform for managing expert networks.</p>
<p>Now Barcelona-based <a href="http://Arbolus.com">Arbolus</a> has raised a $6m funding round led by early-stage UK VC Fuel Ventures, in addition to Plug and Play, better known in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The 3-year old startup claims it has seen a 7x growth YoY and now has offices in Barcelona and New York. It’s also appointed Pau Beltran at CTO, who was formerly of Disney, eDreams, OneMind and others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Arbolus’ approach to ‘enterprise knowledge,’ as it’s known, is employing natural language processing and an AI backbone to its platform.</p>
<p>Whereas ProSapient uses technology to make expert sourcing more efficient, Arbolus captures recordings of expert interviews, transcribes them on its platform, and then shares that knowledge within companies’ networks that subscribe to the platform.</p>
<p>Companies using the platform pay fees to actually use the software, and use all of the toolsets that are on there. It also makes transaction fees when companies pay independent experts on its platform.</p>
<p>Sam Glasswell, CEO and co-founder of Arbolus, said in a statement: “Having the right information gives you a competitive edge but the typical means of engaging with experts through one-hour calls alone is failing to deliver value. These interviews are usually held by a single department and their findings end up lost in PowerPoint presentations or reports. Therefore, companies are only building up a short-term view. We are bringing innovation to the ways companies are working with external experts by using groundbreaking technology to, not just build expertise within organizations, but deliver it in ways that are digestible, searchable and, most importantly, usable for the months and years ahead across different departments.”</p>
<p>Mark Pearson, Managing Partner from Fuel Ventures added: “Arbolus have done amazing things in its first 24 months and it&#8217;s a testament to the entrepreneurial ambition of Sam and Will backed up by their experience of helping to scale a $1bn company in their former lives.”</p>
<p>Arbolus says it is working with more than 80 customers, including Big Four firms such as KPMG, and startups like UiPath.</p>
<p>Founders Sam Glasswell and Will Leeming scaled an expert agency before this startup and realized a lot of knowledge was being lost in these expert networks because it simply wasn’t being captured in the right way. And they decided to base the company in Barcelona because it was able to attract talent and had all the advantages of being in the EU.</p>
<p>Glasswell told me: “In Barcelona we have an awesome office, our own space, a great team it&#8217;s certainly a beautiful city, and we&#8217;re able to attract really really top talent. I mean, people will move from anywhere in the world to go to Barcelona. It&#8217;s probably been one of the biggest success factors for us so far. Does the EU factor, help? Yes, I mean the fact that is in the EU in the trading bloc of the union does help… and we thought we&#8217;d just be able to build a much more culturally diverse team in the long run.”</p>
<p>Certainly, the future of work looks like it is shifting towards one where outside experts are used more and more by companies. If the gig economy has affected your pizza delivery, it’s also affecting the knowledge economy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://breega.com">Breega</a>, a VC firm based in Paris, has announced the final closing of its third fund. The firm has managed to raise $130 million (€110 million).</p>
<p>This is Breega’s third fund and is officially called Breega Capital Venture 3. The firm’s previous fund launched in 2015 with €45 million ($53 million at today’s exchange rate).</p>
<p>Breega doesn’t focus on a vertical in particular. It says it can invest across many different categories, such as marketplaces, SaaS, agtech, HR tech, robotics, etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The investment team has already deployed some of the capital of Breega’s new fund. Portfolio startups include Stations-e, Trustpair, IoTerop, BeOp, Otodo, Humanity, Alice&amp;Bob, Neobrain, Didomi, Ubble, Ponicode and reciTAL. They all have received some funding at the seed or Series A stage.</p>
<p>Breega believes it can support its portfolio companies with some operational help. The firm has its own team of experts when it comes to HR, business development, communications, legal and finance.</p>
<p>Some of the fund’s limited partners include entrepreneurs-turned-business-angles. For instance, Patrick Asdaghi, the co-founder of FoodChéri, has invested in the new fund. FoodChéri received some funding from Breega before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/10/sodexo-acquires-majority-stake-in-french-online-restaurant-foodcheri/">getting acquired</a> by Sodexo.</p>
<p>Other limited partners include Bpifrance, the European Investment Fund, Isomer Capital, several banks and insurance companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/poshmark/">Poshmark</a> has come a long way over the last decade. Launched in 2011, the social fashion marketplace has raised upwards of $150 million, and has now listed on the public markets. It&#8217;s valued at $3.5 billion.</p>
<p>But well before all the success, Mayfield&#8217;s <a href="https://www.mayfield.com/goshposh-its-been-a-ten-year-journey-to-ipo-tales-from-partnering-with-poshmark/">Navin Chaddha saw the potential</a>, leading the Series A for the company.</p>
<p>On our next episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>, we&#8217;ll sit down with Chaddha and Poshmark founder and CEO Manish Chandra to discuss going from Series A to public company. (Registration info is at the bottom of this post.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Chandra is a triple-threat executive. He has degrees in marketing, business and computer science, and is a serial entrepreneur who sold his previous company, Kaboodle, to Hearst in 2007. The introduction of the iPhone inspired him to think about the coming shift in consumer behavior, paving the way for an idea like Poshmark to thrive. As is so often the case, what seems obvious in hindsight was incredibly insightful at the time.</p>
<p>The brilliance wasn&#8217;t at all lost on Chaddha, an entrepreneur in his own right. Now, Chaddha leads Mayfield, a firm with $2.5 billion in assets under management. Of the 50 companies he&#8217;s invested in during his venture capital career, 17 have gone public and 24 have been acquired. In other words, it makes sense that he has made an appearance on the Forbes Midas list 12 times.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk to Chandra and Chaddha about the process of fundraising from the early stage to the growth stage and beyond. But more importantly, we&#8217;ll talk about how a company has to adapt in order to be successful over time.</p>
<p>Plus, Chandra and Chaddha will take a look at pitch decks submitted by the audience and give their live feedback. If you&#8217;re wondering how to perfect your deck, there may be no more valuable resource than the advice of this founder/investor duo.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://ketch.com">Ketch</a>, a startup aiming to help businesses navigate the increasingly complex world of online privacy regulation and data compliance, is announcing that it has raised $23 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>The company is also officially coming out of stealth. I actually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/ketch-privacy-grader/">wrote about Ketch&#8217;s free PrivacyGrader tool</a> last year, but now it&#8217;s revealing the broader vision, as well as the products that businesses will actually be paying for.</p>
<p>The startup was founded by CEO Tom Chavez and CTO Vivek Vaidya. The pair previously founded Krux, a data management platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/03/to-beef-up-in-marketing-tech-salesforce-is-buying-krux-for-340m-in-cash-and-stock-potentially-750m-overall/">acquired by Salesforce</a> in 2016, and Vaidya told me that Ketch is the answer to a question that they&#8217;d begun to ask themselves: &#8220;What kind of infrastructure can we build that will make our former selves better?&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Chavez said that Ketch is designed to help businesses automate the process of remaining compliant with data regulations, wherever their visitors and customers are. He suggested that with geographically specific regulations like Europe&#8217;s GDPR in place, there&#8217;s a temptation to comply globally with the most stringent rules, but that&#8217;s not necessary or desirable.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s possible to use data to grow and to comply with the regulations,&#8221; Chavez said. &#8220;One of our customers turned off digital marketing completely in order to comply. This has got to stop [&#8230;] They are a very responsible customer, but they didn’t know there are tools to navigate this complexity.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129650" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129650" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2129650" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KETCHorchestration.jpg?w=680" alt="Ketch orchestration screenshot" width="680" height="362" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KETCHorchestration.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KETCHorchestration.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KETCHorchestration.jpg?resize=300,160 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KETCHorchestration.jpg?resize=768,409 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KETCHorchestration.jpg?resize=680,362 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KETCHorchestration.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129650" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ketch</p></div></p>
<p>The pair also suggested that things are even more complex than you might think, because true compliance means going beyond the &#8220;Hollywood facade&#8221; of a privacy banner — it requires actually implementing a customer&#8217;s requests across multiple platforms. For example, Vaidya said that when someone unsubscribes to your email list, there&#8217;s &#8220;a complex workflow that needs to be executed that to ensure that the email is not going to continue &#8230; and make sure the customer&#8217;s choices are respected in a timely manner.&#8221;</p>
<p>After all, Chavez noted, if a customer tells you, &#8220;I want to delete my data,&#8221; and yet they keep getting marketing emails or targeted ads, they&#8217;re not going to be satisfied if you say, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve handled that in the four walls of my own business, that&#8217;s an issue with my marketing and email partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chavez also said that Ketch isn&#8217;t designed to replace any of a business&#8217; existing marketing and customer data tools, but rather to &#8220;allow our customers to configure how they want to comply vis-a-vis what jurisdiction they&#8217;re operating in.&#8221; For example, the funding announcement includes a statement from Patreon&#8217;s legal counsel Priya Sanger describing Ketch as &#8220;an easily configurable consent management and orchestration system that was able to be deployed internationally&#8221; that &#8220;required minimal engineering time to integrate into our systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the Series A, it comes from CRV, super{set} (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/superset/">the startup studio founded by Chavez and Vaidya</a>), Ridge Ventures, Acrew Capital and Silicon Valley Bank. CRV&#8217;s Izhar Armony and Acrew&#8217;s Theresia Gouw are joining Ketch&#8217;s board of directors.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;d like to learn more about the product, Ketch is <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://content.ketch.com/nextgenerationconsentwebinar&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1616598611111000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2G1Ixbn6VAaBNVZgc0zCCh">hosting a webinar</a> at 11am Pacific today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Coinbase is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/">about to go public</a> in the U.S., another cryptocurrency company is having a blockbuster first quarter of 2021. <a href="https://www.blockchain.com">Blockchain.com</a>, the company behind a popular cryptocurrency wallet, an exchange, a block explorer and more, has <a href="https://medium.com/blockchain/blockchain-com-raises-300m-series-c-led-by-dst-vy-capital-lightspeed-79d3259937f2">raised</a> a $300 million Series C round.</p>
<p>If you’ve been paying attention, you may remember that I wrote about Blockchain.com last month. At the time, the company announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/crypto-wallet-and-exchange-company-blockchain-com-raises-120-million/">a $120 million funding round</a>. In other words, the company is raising <em>once again</em> just a few weeks after its previous funding round.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="holhON9Mc3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/crypto-wallet-and-exchange-company-blockchain-com-raises-120-million/">Crypto wallet and exchange company Blockchain.com raises $120 million</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>This time, DST Global, Lightspeed Venture Partners and VY Capital are leading the round. Existing investors also participated. Following today’s funding round, the company has reached a post-money valuation of $5.2 billion.</p>
<p>Originally named Blockchain.info, the company first launched a blockchain explorer. If you’re not familiar with the blockchain industry, an explorer lets you enter the hash of any transaction that occurs on a blockchain to get more information — you can retrieve the transaction amount, the number of confirmations, the wallet addresses of the sender and the reveiver, etc.</p>
<p>But Blockchain.com is better known for its open-source wallet. The company offers a noncustodial wallet, which means that you’re in control of your private keys. Blockchain.com can’t directly access your funds.</p>
<p>31 million users have verified their identities on Blockchain.com. The number of active users have tripled over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>Blockchain.com has diversified its activities over time. It has launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/30/blockchain-the-company-launches-an-exchange-the-pit/">an exchange</a> so that you can buy and sell cryptocurrencies from Blockchain.com directly. The startup also offers services to institutional investors. Blockchain.com can help you when it comes to buying and selling cryptocurrencies, custody, large over-the-counter transactions, etc.</p>
<p>When it comes to revenue, “Blockchain.com is highly profitable across each of our business lines,” co-founder and CEO Peter Smith <a href="https://medium.com/blockchain/blockchain-com-raises-300m-series-c-led-by-dst-vy-capital-lightspeed-79d3259937f2">wrote</a>. The new influx of funding is all about working with late-stage investors and growing rapidly. You can expect some Blockchain.com acquisitions down the road for instance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/1e18a952-5bd7-4ac9-9288-a720a77befc0?dark=true" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For this week’s deep dive, the Equity team brought on <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a> CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/shl">Sahil Lavingia</a> and <a href="https://www.hustlefund.vc/">Hustle Fund</a> General Partner <a href="https://twitter.com/dunkhippo33">Elizabeth Yin</a> to talk about equity crowdfunding. It’s been about a week since the SEC increased the equity crowdfunding cap from $1.07 million to $5 million, creating the perfect opportunity to go beyond the dollar amount and understand how the change impacts founders, venture capitalists, retail investors, and future fund managers.</p>
<p>Here’s a brief rundown of the show:</p>
<ul>
<li>We talk about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/will-new-sec-equity-crowdfunding-rules-encourage-more-founders-to-pass-the-hat/">the basics of this new SEC regulation</a>, and understand which platforms might be leading the pack for these bootstrapped campaigns. Indiegogo’s founder wrote a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/a-report-card-for-the-secs-new-equity-crowdfunding-rules/">n op-ed grading the new regulations</a> on the site.</li>
<li>Some banter on Gumroad’s 12-hour campaign that led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/gumroad-wants-to-make-equity-crowdfunding-mainstream/">a successfully crowdsourced $5 million for the company</a>. Lavingia talks about his decision to crowdfund a round in his company, why it made sense for the company, and what it will take to make this raise mainstream.</li>
<li>Of course, Yin shared a ton of helpful nuggets around crowdfunding, providing a venture capital perspective that was still bullish on growing the amount of check-writers in the ecosystem. Some recent equity crowdfunding campaigns have shown that there are thousands of individuals willing to fund the enterprises they want to see succeed. Juked.gg is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/23/how-vcs-and-founders-see-2021-differently/">one such example</a>.</li>
<li>There are also notes on the Testing the Waters dynamic that could usher some wiggle room to early-stage founders thinking about this.</li>
<li>Will equity crowdfunding supplant venture capital, or will it merely augment it? Our discussion leads us to ponder both possibilities. What seems clear is that equity crowdfunding could widen the band of companies that are &#8220;backable,&#8221; if not the band of companies that traditional venture capital players find enticing.</li>
<li>And we end with a whole bunch of meta debates, from the role of the platform in vetting campaigns. As with every innovation, including crowdfunding itself, there will be fraud and failure. But if there will be enough bad news to limit consumer interest is far from certain.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is one of those nerdy topics that gets us really excited about the future of dollar allocation and startup creation. We hope you love the show and leave with a better understanding of what’s ahead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, former Glossier executives Henry Davis and Bryan Mahoney <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurendebter/2020/03/10/ex-glossier-exec-turns-customers-into-partners-with-new-personal-care-startup/?sh=5c0540161045">unveiled a new e-commerce startup called Arfa</a>. Today, they&#8217;re announcing a new vision for the company, along with a new name, new funding and an acquisition.</p>
<p>The name first: Moving forward, the New York startup will be known as <a href="https://chord.co/">Chord</a>, which Davis (Chord&#8217;s chairman and COO) said reflects the fact that the startup is now &#8220;exclusively focused on our technology offering,&#8221; rather than on launching its own direct-to-consumer brands. (Davis also said that Chord will be sharing more news around plans for its existing brands soon.)</p>
<p>Mahoney (Chord&#8217;s CEO) said the platform provides brands with &#8220;commerce as a service.&#8221; In other words, as a business moves into the world of headless commerce (where they buy e-commerce infrastructure that&#8217;s separate from the front-end experience), Chord is designed to provide all of their needs, across multiple products and features including content management, a customer data platform and order management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Davis suggested that due to issues like insufficient data infrastructure and increasingly complex, multi-channel businesses, &#8220;Operators have been forced to make compromises and tradeoffs on their core business. We want to get rid of that as a concept. Your tech stack is here to support you.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129627" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129627" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2129627" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chord_PressPhoto_2068_Edited_Cropped.jpg?w=680" alt="Chord founders" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chord_PressPhoto_2068_Edited_Cropped.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chord_PressPhoto_2068_Edited_Cropped.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chord_PressPhoto_2068_Edited_Cropped.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chord_PressPhoto_2068_Edited_Cropped.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chord_PressPhoto_2068_Edited_Cropped.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chord_PressPhoto_2068_Edited_Cropped.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129627" class="wp-caption-text">Chord founders Henry Davis and Bryan Mahoney</p></div></p>
<p>And while there are certainly plenty of other headless commerce startups, when you look across the e-commerce landscape, Davis said, &#8220;Everyone’s fighting with same tools to do the same thing. Rather that bring another headless solution to access those same tools, we wanted to bring along an offering that made you differentiated and better.&#8221;</p>
<p>As one example of how Chord is different, Mahoney said that its customer data platform is something &#8220;we bake into everything we do,&#8221; offering &#8220;a single analytical layer&#8221; that&#8217;s collecting data across the platform.</p>
<p>The startup has also acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/26/yaguara-nabs-7-2m-seed-to-help-e-commerce-companies-understand-customers-better/">Denver-based e-commerce data startup Yaguara</a> for an undisclosed sum. With the Yaguara team joining Chord, Davis said the startup will be able to &#8220;double down&#8221; on data and data visualization.</p>
<p>And, as mention, the company has also raised an $18 million Series A, bringing its total funding to $25 million,<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/arfa/company_financials"> according to Crunchbase</a>. The round was led by Eclipse Ventures.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Mahoney said the company&#8217;s vision is to &#8220;be known as the Stripe of headless commerce — the way that they have built the infrastructure powering payments on the internet, we want to power headless commerce.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You might expect that a startup that makes community building software would be thriving during a pandemic when it&#8217;s so difficult for us to be together. And <a href="http://bevy.com/">Bevy</a>, a company whose product powers community sites like <a href="https://trailblazers.salesforce.com/">Salesforce Trailblazers</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/community/gdg">Google Developers</a> announced it has raised a $40 million Series C this morning, at least partly due to the growth related to that dynamic.</p>
<p>The round was led by Accel with participation from Upfront Ventures, Qualtrics co-founder Ryan Smith and LinkedIn, but what makes this investment remarkable is that it included 25 Black investors representing 20% of the investment.</p>
<p>One of those investors, James Lowery, who is a management consultant and entrepreneur, and was the first Black employee hired at McKinsey in 1968, sees the opportunity for this approach to be a model to attract investment from other under-represented groups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I know for a fact because of my friendship and my network that there are a lot of people, if they had the opportunity to invest in opportunities like this, they will do it, and they have the money to do it. And I think we can be the model for the nation,&#8221; Lowery said.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there has been a dearth of Black VC investment in startups like Bevy. In fact, only around <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/campaigns/us/audit/survey/diversity-venture-capital-human-capital-survey-dashboard.html">3% of venture capitalists</a> are Black and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/08/81-of-vc-firms-dont-have-a-single-black-investor-blck-vc-plans-on-changing-that/">81% of VC firms</a> don&#8217;t have a single Black investor.</p>
<p>Kobie Fuller, who is general Partner at investor Upfront Ventures, a Bevy board member and runs his own community called <a href="https://valence.community/">Valence</a>, says that investments like this can lead to a flywheel effect that can lead to increasing Black investment in startups.</p>
<p>&#8220;So for me, it&#8217;s about how do we get more Black investors on cap tables of companies early in their lifecycle before they go public, where wealth can be created. How do we get key members of executive teams being Black executives who have the ability to create wealth through options and equity. And how do we also make sure that we have proper representation on the boards of these companies, so that we can make sure that the CEOs and the C suite is held accountable towards the diversity goals,&#8221; Fuller said.</p>
<p>He sees a software platform like Bevy that facilitates community as a logical starting point for this approach, and the company needs to look like the broader communities it serves. &#8220;Making sure that our workforce is appropriately represented from a perspective of having appropriate level of Black employees to the board to the actual investors is just good business sense,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But the diversity angle doesn&#8217;t stop with the investor group. Bevy CEO and co-founder Derek Anderson says that last May when George Floyd was killed, his firm didn&#8217;t have a single person of color among the company&#8217;s 27 employees and not a single Black investor in his cap table. He wanted to change that, and he found that in diversifying, it not only was the right thing to do from a human perspective, it was also from a business one.</p>
<p>&#8220;We realized that if we really started including people from the Black and Brown communities inside of Bevy that the collective bar of a talent was going to go up. We were going to look from a broader pool of candidates, and what we found as we&#8217;ve done this is that as the culture has started to change, the customer satisfaction is going up, our profits and our revenues &#8212; the trajectory is going up &#8212; and I see this thing is completely correlated,&#8221; Anderson said.</p>
<p>Last summer the company set a two year goal to get to 20% of employees being Black. While the number of employees is small, Bevy went from zero to 5% in June, 10% by September. Today it is just under 15% and expects to hit the 20% goal by summer, a year ahead of the goal it set last year.</p>

<p>Bevy grew out of a community called Startup Grind that Anderson started several years ago. Unable to find software to run and manage the community, he decided to build it himself. In 2017, he spun that product into a separate company that became Bevy, and he has raised $60 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>In addition to Salesforce and Google, other large enterprises are using Bevy to power their communities and events including Adobe, Atlassian, Twilio, Slack and Zendesk.</p>
<p>Today, the startup is valued at $325 million, which is 4x the amount it was valued at when it raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/bevy-series-b/">its $15 million Series B</a> in May 2019. It expects to reach $30 million in ARR by the end of this year.</p>
