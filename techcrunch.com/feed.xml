										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite several efforts from carriers, telecom regulators, mobile operating system developers, smartphone makers, and a global pandemic, spam calls continued to pester and scam people around the globe this year &#8212; and they only got worse.</p>
<p>Users worldwide received 31.3 billion spam calls between January and October this year, up from 26 billion during the same period last year, and 17.7 billion the year prior, according to Stockholm-headquartered firm <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/true-software-scandinavia" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="true-software-scandinavia">Truecaller <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>The firm, best known for its caller ID app, estimated that an average American received 28.4 spam calls a month this year, up from 18.2 last year. And with 49.9 spam calls per user a month, up from an already alarming 45.6 figure last year, Brazil remained the worst impacted nation to spam calls, the firm said in its <a href="https://truecaller.blog/2020/12/08/truecaller-insights-top-20-countries-affected-by-spam-calls-in-2020-2/">yearly report</a> on the subject.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic, however, lowered the spam call frequency in several markets, including India, which topped Truecaller’s chart for the worst nation affected three years ago. The nation, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/truecaller-tops-250-million-users/">the biggest market of Truecaller</a>, dropped to the 9th position on the chart this year with 16.8 monthly spam calls per user, down from 25.6 last year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2084009" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084009" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2084009 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/truecaller-2020.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="670" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/truecaller-2020.jpg 1550w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/truecaller-2020.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/truecaller-2020.jpg?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/truecaller-2020.jpg?resize=768,502 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/truecaller-2020.jpg?resize=680,445 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/truecaller-2020.jpg?resize=1536,1005 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/truecaller-2020.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2084009" class="wp-caption-text">Top 20 countries affected by spam calls in 2020 (Truecaller)</p></div></p>
<p>“The COVID-19 pandemic has directly and indirectly affected not only global economies and societies, but spammer behaviour. As the virus spread exponentially worldwide, spam calls started to decrease around March,” the report said.</p>
<p>“Spam reached its lowest point in April, when strict curfews and lock downs were implemented worldwide. The overall volume of calls also dipped during this period.<br />
However, from this point, reports of scammers taking advantage of the uncertainty around the pandemic emerged. In May, spam calls started to pick up again and have<br />
been increasing on average by 9.7% per month. October, with a record high in terms of spam calls, was 22.4% higher than the pre-lockdown period.”</p>
<p>Some other trends from the report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just like us, spammers took time off from work on weekends, as can be seen in a global weekly reduction of spam calls on those days.</li>
<li>Last year, the top 10 countries were dominated by the South American region. This year Chile, Peru and Colombia have seen a decrease in spam calls.</li>
<li>A lot of European countries have surfaced on the list &#8211; Hungary, Poland, Spain, UK, Ukraine, Germany, Romania, Greece and Belgium. None of these countries were on the list last year.</li>
<li>The biggest increase of spam calls comes from Europe and the US &#8211; where Hungary has seen the biggest jump (1132%), followed by Germany (685%), Belgium (557%) and Romania (395%).</li>
<li>Indonesia (18.3), India (16.8), Vietnam (14.7) and Russia (14.3) are the most affected countries in Asia.</li>
<li>An escalation of scam calls and robocalls around the world is expanding their share within the most common spam categories. Scammers taking advantage of the pandemic is a reason for the increase of scam calls.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to bringing annoyance, these calls are also being used to scam people out of money. As many as 56 million Americans <a href="https://truecaller.blog/2020/04/16/truecaller-insights-2020-us-spam-scam-report/">reported</a> having lost money to phone scams this year, and an estimated $19.7 billion was lost to such calls, according to an earlier Truecaller report.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Young people have long been a prime, if especially careful, target for financial services companies: find the right and responsible way to connect with them, and you could have a good customer for many years. Today, one of the startups building services specifically for those under 18 is announcing a round of growth funding, money that it plans to use to continue building out its business in the US and UK. <a href="http://gohenry.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoHenry</a>, which provides a pre-paid debit card and corresponding app to minors as young as 6 and no older than 18 that in turn can be controlled and topped up by parents, has raised $40 million.</p>
<p>Led by Edison Partners, the round also had participation from Gaia Capital Partners, Citi Ventures (the strategic investment arm of Citi Bank), and Muse Capital.</p>
<p>GoHenry is not disclosing its valuation with this round, its first institutional fundraise. Prior to this, the startup had raised about $30 million from friends and family, and via equity crowdfunding. (GoHenry has some 5,000 shareholders as a result, it says, half of which are GoHenry customers.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As another mark of its rise, GoHenry has been seeing some strong growth.</p>
<p>The startup now has 1.2 million members &#8212; a figure that includes both parents and children &#8212; and it has doubled its customer base annually for the last six years. It does not disclose how many of those members are parents and how many are children, nor whether the UK or US, the two markets where it is currently active, is the stronger.</p>
<p>In its home market of the UK, GoHenry said that parents paid in £98 million in pocket money in 2019, with their children getting more than £2.2 million for completing tasks around the house. GoHenry&#8217;s young users then spent just under £100 million towards the UK economy. (Its cards are personalized with users&#8217; names, eg &#8220;GoIngrid&#8221; would be on mine, which is a great touch that probably resonates especially well with younger customers.)</p>
<p>And at a time where some companies such as retailers have really been feeling the pinch from the drop in consumer spending this year because of Covid, GoHenry said that it turned profitable in March of this year.</p>
<h2>Banking with a purpose</h2>
<p>GoHenry was conceived not just as a banking service for young people, but a banking service with a purpose.</p>
<p>There has traditionally been a division between how young people interface with money: it&#8217;s more about what parents pay them in cash, or that they might earn from informal work, with maybe a savings account in the wings where money as presents gets deposited. Although it&#8217;s gotten easier in very recent times, it used to be almost impossible to get a bank account or any kind of &#8220;banking services&#8221; like payment cards as a minor.</p>
<p>Yet these days, people under the age of 18 are just as likely as their parents to have a smartphone &#8212; and possibly more likely to experiment with a wider variety of apps and services.</p>
<p>GoHenry, founded in 2012 by Louise Hill (who is now the COO), saw that smartphone usage as an opportunity to build a financial service for those younger consumers, one that could serve as an entry point for financial education, getting those young people used to being responsible with money, and understanding the relationship between work and earning it. Not a full-fledged bank account, GoHenry has provided some of the building blocks that mimic how the &#8220;adult&#8221; world of making money, saving it, and spending it all work.</p>
<p>“For too long, kids have been locked out of the digital economy and parents lacked the tools to help their children gain confidence with money and finances. GoHenry was the first to respond to these needs in 2012 when we launched a groundbreaking financial education app and prepaid debit card that truly empowered children. In 2020, we’ve achieved three key milestones: becoming profitable which many B2C fintechs seek, raising $40m during Covid, and partnering with world leading funds. All three will help us fuel our US expansion.” says Alex Zivoder, CEO, GoHenry, in a statement.</p>
<p>The service is based around a pre-paid debit card that has more controls for parents than an ordinary pre-paid card: they can top up the amount with an allowance, but they can also limit where the card is used and for what, and how much is can be spent in a given period.</p>
<p>Parents can also get reports on how the money on the card is used (or not as the case may be). There is no facility to go overdrawn and into the red on spending. The child&#8217;s app, meanwhile, not only gives the young person a way of checking the balance on the card, but also lets the parents set up tasks that the kids can do and check off to &#8220;earn&#8221; more money.</p>
<p>All of this comes at a price: after a one-month free trial, members pay $3.99 per month for the basic service, with different charges for other transactions, such as when the card is used abroad, or if a parent tops up the account with a debit card instead of a direct transfer from a bank account.</p>
<p>GoHenry is not alone in building banking apps for those under 18. In fact, in recent times there&#8217;s been a big rush of launches and funding for startups that have set out to do precisely that. They include teen banking app Step, which most recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/teen-banking-service-step-raises-50m-adds-tiktok-star-charli-damelio-to-investor-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised $50 million earlier this month</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/21/kard-is-a-challenger-bank-for-teens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kard</a>, which launched last year in France; Revolut, the challenger bank that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/revolut-launches-revolut-junior-to-help-you-manage-allowance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently launched &#8220;Revolut Junior&#8221;</a>; PayPal&#8217;s Venmo, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/venmo-teen-debit-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prototyped a payment card for teenagers</a> earlier this year; and Current, which started out also targeting teens but now has widened that out to any groups that are currently underserved by other banks. To that end, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/mobile-banking-app-current-raises-131m-series-c-tops-2-million-members/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Current raised $131 million</a> a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>GoHenry has some key differences in comparison with those. In addition to this not being a full banking app, perhaps even more notable is that GoHenry doesn&#8217;t seem to have any strategy at the moment for holding on to younger customers after they turn 18.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now we are 100% focused on helping kids and teens aged 6-18 years old gain confidence in managing money and learning about finances,&#8221; said a spokesperson. In an industry &#8212; retail banking &#8212; that suffers from a lot of churn as customers migrate quickly from one service to another, it&#8217;s interesting (and a little refreshing, since these are kids we are talking about) to see a company that might build strong relationships but not try to leverage that for more business down the line.</p>
<p>&#8220;GoHenry is catering to millions of parents who are looking to raise smart, financially literate children but are currently underserved by existing solutions,&#8221; said Chris Sugden, managing partner, Edison Partners. &#8220;We’re thrilled to partner with Alex and the GoHenry management team on this next milestone in their growth journey and look forward to realizing their ambitions to improve the financial fitness of kids across the globe.” Sugden is joining the board with this round, along with Dawn Zier, a veteran CEO and marketing expert.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.hellogetsafe.com/">Getsafe</a>, the digital-first insurance startup that initially launched with an app for home contents insurance, has closed $30 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>Swiss Re, the reinsurer giant, led the round. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/05/getsafe/">Existing investors</a>, including Earlybird and CommerzVentures, also participated. Getsafe has raised a total of $53 million to date since being founded in May 2015.</p>
<p>The company says it plans to extend its Series B funding with a second tranche to be closed ahead of the company launching products powered by its own insurance licence, scheduled for the first half of 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pitching itself as a digital insurer aimed at millennials, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/safe" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="safe">Getsafe’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> first product offers flexible home contents insurance, along with other “modules,” such as personal possessions cover (which insures possessions out of home) and accidental damage cover. Available in the U.K. and Germany and delivered via an easy to use app, the idea is that you build and only pay for the exact cover you need.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EAvbz0Xf66"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/getsafe-uk/">Getsafe, the German insurtech, brings its contents insurance app to UK</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Getsafe, the German insurtech, brings its contents insurance app to UK&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/getsafe-uk/embed/#?secret=EAvbz0Xf66" data-secret="EAvbz0Xf66" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Christian Wiens tells me Getsafe currently has 150,000 active customers and that 90 percent of Getsafe users buy insurance for the first time. &#8220;We sell more policies to first-time insurance buyers in Germany than incumbents like Allianz, Axa, Zurich, etc,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Asked why Getsafe is moving to its own insurance license, Wiens says it will enable the insurtech to innovate with new products faster. &#8220;It’s better to have an insurance license, acting as a broker creates no innovation,&#8221; he says, adding that insurance is a &#8220;marathon&#8221; and a long term play.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hoped to navigate regulation faster and be able to use more existing software, but needed to build most tech from the ground up,” says Wiens.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the new partnership between Getsafe and Swiss Re is already bearing fruit. Last month, the pair launched digital car insurance optimised for smartphones. &#8220;With just a few clicks, users can purchase insurance with the Getsafe app, file a claim, and manage their policy in real time&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can cancel or discontinue the coverage any time e.g. if you don’t use the car in winter months or during summer holidays, just switch it off,&#8221; explains the Getsafe CEO.</p>
<p>You can also add up to five co-drivers to your coverage for free in the app. &#8220;In 2021, we plan to test driving behaviour based pricing,&#8221; adds Wiens. &#8220;We [will] track your driving with the app and you save money if you drive safely&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against U.S. government restrictions that would have effectively banned <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiktok" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tiktok">TikTok <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> from operating in the United States.</p>
<p>The ruling (embedded below) was made by U.S. District Court Judge Carl Nichols in a lawsuit filed by TikTok and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bytedance" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bytedance">ByteDance <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> against President Donald Trump, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and the Commerce Department. Judge Nichols wrote the government “likely exceeded IEEPA’s [the International Emergency Economic Powers Act] express limitations as part of an agency action that was arbitrary and capricious.”</p>
<p>This is the second time a federal judge has issued an injunction against Trump administration restrictions that would have prevented U.S. companies, including internet hosting services, from transactions with TikTok and ByteDance. The first injunction was granted in October by U.S. District Court Judge Wendy Beetlestone, in a separate lawsuit brought against the President Trump and the U.S. Commerce Department by three TikTok creators.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Both lawsuits challenge <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/trump-signs-executive-orders-banning-transactions-with-tiktok-and-wechat/">an executive order signed by President Trump on August 7</a>, banning transactions with ByteDance.

<p>In today’s ruling, Judge Nichols wrote TikTok and ByteDance are likely to succeed in their claims that Secretary Ross’ prohibitions against TikTok and ByteDance, which were originally supposed to go into effect on November 12, likely violated limits in the IEEPA and the Administrative Procedures Act.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/the-u-s-government-sends-mixed-messages-about-tiktoks-future/">already issued a notice last month</a> saying it will comply with Judge Beetlestone’s injunction pending further legal developments.</p>
<p>ByteDance is also facing a divestiture order that would force it to sell TikTok’s U.S. operations. While it has reached <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/tiktok-wtf/">a proposed deal with Oracle and Walmart</a>, ByteDance also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/bytedance-asks-federal-appeals-court-to-vacate-u-s-order-forcing-it-to-sell-tiktok/">asked the federal appeals court to vacate the order last month</a>. On November 26, the Trump administration extended the order’s deadline to December 4, but <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-05/tiktok-sale-deadline-is-put-on-hold-as-talks-with-u-s-continue?sref=gni836kR">allowed it to lapse without setting a new one</a>.</p>
<p>In an email to TechCrunch, a TikTok spokesperson said, &#8220;We&#8217;re pleased that the court agreed with us and granted a preliminary injunction against all the prohibitions of the Executive Order. We&#8217;re focused on continuing to build TikTok as the home that 100 million Americans, including families and small businesses, rely upon for expression, connection, economic livelihood, and true joy.&#8221;</p>
<p>A U.S. Commerce Department spokesperson said, &#8220;The Department maintains that the [executive order] is fully consistent with law and promotes legitimate national security interests.  The Government will continue to comply with the injunctions and has taken immediate steps to do so, but intends to vigorously defend the [executive order] and the Secretary’s implementation efforts from legal challenges.&#8221;</p>
<p>To keep track of the often overlapping developments in ByteDance and TikTok’s fight with the U.S. government, we have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/tiktok-timeline/">compiled a comprehensive timeline</a> and will keep it updated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://twitter.com/h_destecroix">Harry Destecroix</a> co-founded Ziylo while studying for his PhD at <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/">the University of Bristol</a>. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ziylo">Ziylo</a>, a university spin-out company, developed a synthetic molecule allowing glucose to bind with the bloodstream more effectively. Four years later, and by then a Phd, Destecroix sold the company to Danish firm Novo Nordisk, one of the biggest manufacturers of diabetes medicines, which had realized it could use Ziylo&#8217;s molecule to develop a new type of insulin to help diabetics. He walked away with <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-45268904">an estimated $800m</a>.</p>
<p>Destecroix is now embarking on a project, &#8220;<a href="http://www.sciencecreates.co.uk">Science Creates</a>”, to repeat the exercise of creating deep-tech, science-based startups, and it will once more be based out of Bristol.</p>
<p>To foster this deep tech ecosystem it will offer a specialized incubator space able to house Wet Labs, a £15 million investment fund and a network of strategic partners to nurture science and engineering start-ups and spin-outs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Science Creates hub, in partnership with the University of Bristol and located in the heart of the city, is aspiring to become a sort of &#8216;West Coast’ for England, and the similarities, at least with an earlier version of Silicon Valley, are striking.</p>
<p>The Bay Area of old was cheaper than the East Coast of the US, had a cornerstone university, access to capital, and plenty of talent. Bristol has all that and for capital, it can access London, less than 90 minutes by train. But what it’s lacked until now is a greater level of &#8220;clustering&#8221; and startup-focused organization, which is clearly what Destecroix is planning to fix.</p>
<p>In a statement for the launch, he explained: “<em>Where</em> a discovery is made has a huge bearing on whether it’s successfully commercialized. While founding my own start-up, Ziylo, I became aware of just how many discoveries failed to emerge from the lab in Bristol alone. No matter the quality of the research and discovery, the right ecosystem is fundamental if we are going to challenge the global 90% failure rate of science start-ups, and create many more successful ventures.”</p>
<p>Science Creates is be grown out of the original incubator, Unit DX, that Destecroix set up in collaboration with the University of Bristol in 2017 to commercialize companies like his own.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2083933" style="width: 774px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2083933" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/201103_ScienceCreates21693.jpg" alt="The Science Creates team" width="764" height="386" class="size-full wp-image-2083933" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/201103_ScienceCreates21693.jpg 764w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/201103_ScienceCreates21693.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/201103_ScienceCreates21693.jpg?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/201103_ScienceCreates21693.jpg?resize=680,344 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/201103_ScienceCreates21693.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 764px) 100vw, 764px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2083933" class="wp-caption-text">The Science Creates team</p></div></p>
<p>The &#8216;Science Creates ecosystem&#8217; will comprise of:</p>
<p><strong>Science Creates Incubators:</strong> Unit DX houses 37 scientific and engineering companies working on healthtech, the environment and quality of life.  The opening of a second incubator, Unit DY, close to Bristol Temple Meads train station, will mean it can support 100 companies and an estimated 450 jobs. The Science Creates’ physical footprint across the two units will reach 45,000 sq ft.</p>
<p><strong>Science Creates Ventures:</strong> This £15 million EIS venture capital fund is backed by the Bristol-based entrepreneurs behind some of the South-West’s biggest deep tech exits.</p>
<p><strong>Science Creates Network:</strong> This will be a portfolio of strategic partners, mentors and advisors tailored to the needs of science and engineering start-ups.</p>
<p>Destecroix is keen that the startups nurtured there will have more than &#8220;Wi-Fi and strong coffee” but also well-equipped lab space as well as sector-specific business support.</p>
<p>He’s betting that Bristol, with its long history of academic and industrial research, world-class research base around the University of Bristol, will be able to overcome the traditional challenges towards the commercialization of deep tech and science-based startups.</p>
<p>Professor Hugh Brady, Vice-Chancellor and President at the University of Bristol, commented: “We are delighted to support the vision and help Science Creates to build a thriving deep tech ecosystem in our home city. Great scientists don’t always know how to be great entrepreneurs, but we’ve seen the impact specialist support can have in helping them access the finance, networks, skills, and investment opportunities they need. Working with Science Creates, we aim to support even more ground-breaking discoveries to progress outside the university walls, and thrive as successful commercial ventures that change our world for the better.”</p>
<p>Ventures in Unit DX so far include:<br />
 &#8211; Imophoron (a vaccine tech start-up that is reinventing how vaccines are made and work &#8211; currently working on a COVID vaccine)<br />
 &#8211; Cytoseek (a discovery-stage biotech working on cell therapy cancer treatment)<br />
 &#8211; Anaphite (graphine-based science for next gen battery technology).</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with TechCrunch, Destecroix went on to say: “After my startup exited I just got really interested in this idea that, where discovery is actually founded has a huge bearing on whether something is actually commercialized or not. The pandemic has really taught us there is a hell of a lot more &#8211; especially in the life sciences, and environmental sciences &#8211; that has still yet to be discovered. Vaccines are based on very old technology and take a while to develop.”</p>
<p>“Through this whole journey, I started trying to understand it from an economic perspective. How do we get more startups to emerge? To lower those barriers? I think first of all there&#8217;s a cultural problem, especially with academically-focused universities whereby entrepreneurship a dirty word. I had to go against many of my colleagues in the early days to spin out, then obviously universities own all the IP. And so you&#8217;ve got to go through the tech transfer office etc and depending on what university you are at, whether it&#8217;s Imperial, Cambridge or Oxford, they&#8217;re all different. So, and I put the reason why there were no deep terch startups in Bristol down to the fact that there was no incubator space, and not enough investment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve now made about 14 angel investments. Bristol has now catapulted from 20th in the league tables for life sciences to six in the country in the last three years and this is largely due to the activities that we&#8217;ve been helping to encourage. So we&#8217;ve helped streamline licensing processes for the university, and I&#8217;ve helped cornerstone a lot of these deals which has resulted in a wave of these technology startups coming in.&#8221;</p>
<p>“I thought, now&#8217;s the time to professionalize this and launch a respectable Bristol-based venture capital firm that specializes in deep technologies.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sometimes it&#8217;s just not worth it to try to top Mother Nature. Such seems to have been the judgment by engineers at the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/university-of-washington" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="university-of-washington">University of Washington, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> who, deploring the absence of chemical sensors as fine as a moth&#8217;s antennas, opted to repurpose moth biology rather than invent new human technology. Behold the &#8220;Smellicopter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mounted on a tiny drone platform with collision avoidance and other logic built in, the device is a prototype of what could be a very promising fusion of artificial and natural ingenuity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nature really blows our human-made odor sensors out of the water,&#8221; admits UW grad student Melanie Anderson, lead author of the paper describing the Smellicopter, <a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2020/12/07/smellicopter-avoids-obstacles-uses-live-moth-antenna-to-smell/">in a university news release</a>. And in many industrial applications, sensitivity is of paramount importance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If, for instance, you had one sensor that could detect toxic particles at a fraction of the concentration of that detectable by another, it would be a no-brainer to use the more sensitive of the two.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it&#8217;s no cake walk training moths to fly toward toxic plumes of gas and report back their findings. So the team (carefully) removed a common hawk moth&#8217;s antenna and mounted it on board. By passing a light current through it the platform can monitor the antenna&#8217;s general status, which changes when it is exposed to certain chemicals — such as those a moth might want to follow, a flower&#8217;s scent perhaps.</p>
<p>See it in action below:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/8SGx2qmo9M4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>In tests, the cybernetic moth-machine construct performed better than a traditional sensor of comparable size and power. The cells of the antenna, excited by the particles wafting over them, created a fast, reliable, and accurate signal for those chemicals they are built to detect. &#8220;Reprogramming&#8221; those sensitivities would be non-trivial, but far from impossible.</p>
<p>The little drone itself has a clever bit of engineering to keep the antenna pointed upwind. While perhaps pressure sensors and gyros might have worked to keep the craft pointing in the right direction, the team used the simple approach of a pair of large, light fins mounted on the back that have the effect of automatically turning the drone upwind, like a weather vane. If something smells good that way, off it goes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very much a prototype, but this sort of simplicity and sensitivity are no doubt attractive enough to potential customers like heavy industry and the military that the team will have offers coming in soon. You can read the paper describing the design of the Smellicopter <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-3190/abbd81">in the journal IOP Bioinspiration &amp; Biomimetics</a>.</p>

This is your Daily Crunch for December 7, 2020.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Google smart speakers add Apple Music support</strong></p>
<p>Google announced this morning that devices including the Nest Audio, Nest Hub Max and Nest Mini will now be able to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/google-adds-support-for-apple-music-to-its-google-assistant-enabled-smart-speakers-and-displays/">play Apple Music</a> via voice commands.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google&#8217;s speaker ecosystem already supports a range of streaming audio services, including Spotify and Pandora, but Apple Music was a big exception until now. (Apple&#8217;s HomePod and HomePod mini already supported the service, of course, as did Amazon&#8217;s Alexa-enabled smart speakers.)</p>
<p>To set this up, Google device owners will need to link their Apple Music accounts in their Google Home app and set it as their default music service. Then they can start using commands like, “Hey Google, play New Music Daily playlist” or “Hey Google, play Rap Life playlist.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like a lot of startups, <a href="https://www.aarmy.com/">Aarmy</a> faced some big challenges when the pandemic forced widespread shutdowns in March.</p>
<p>Up until then, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/akins-army" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="akins-army">Aarmy <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was offering in-person fitness classes from its locations in New York and Los Angeles. Trey Laird, who founded the startup with trainers Akin Akman (chief fitness officer) and Angela Manuel-Davis (chief motivation officer), told me that within 48 hours, the strategy shifted online, starting with fitness classes via <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aarmy/?hl=en">Instagram Live</a> — something it continues to offer, while also <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/21/2082081/0/en/Fitness-Brand-AARMY-Launches-Experiential-Subscription-App-for-both-Mental-Physical-Conditioning.html">launching a digital subscription program</a> over the summer.</p>
<p>The startup is backed by celebrity investors including Jay-Z, Chris Paul and Karlie Kloss, as well as firms like Mousse Partners, Valia Ventures, Pendulum and Wilshire Lane Partners. Laird said that the team always planned to launch an online business, with a few physical locations serving as &#8220;content engines.&#8221; The pandemic just accelerated those plans.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;What changed is, we thought we had time to perfect everything,&#8221; Akman said. &#8220;[Once the pandemic hit,] we didn’t have time to have all these in-depth conversations, we didn&#8217;t have time to wait. We wanted to get out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>An Aarmy subscription costs $35 a month, or $350 a year, offering access to a full digital library, including live sessions with Aarmy trainers, with 20 new practice sessions uploaded every week. The company says it already has &#8220;thousands&#8221; of paying subscribers, with a conversion rate of more than 70% from its free trial, and an 88% retention rate overall.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Cy1HeBixxE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Manuel-Davis acknowledged that Aarmy&#8217;s coaches have had to rethink their approach, particularly since they can&#8217;t shoot themselves &#8220;in a room with 60 people&#8221; as originally planned. Now they have to provide all of the energy themselves, and they need to be &#8220;super intentional&#8221; about planning their sessions, rather than simply responding to the activity of the athletes in the room.</p>
<p>Beyond the classes, Aarmy has also launched an apparel business, selling a variety of fitness gear <a href="https://gear.aarmy.com">on its own website</a> and via Net-a-Porter. In fact, the company says this side of the business has already brought in $450,000 in sales.</p>
<p>Akin described the overall Aarmy strategy as one that&#8217;s as much about mental conditioning as it is about physical fitness — which he argued has been well-suited to the pandemic era, when so many people are struggling with feelings of depression, isolation and the sense that they&#8217;re &#8220;victims of circumstance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laird added, &#8220;For a brand where the inspiration and the mental strength and finding that inspiration is as important as the actual movement or actual workout, it&#8217;s been the perfect time. It’s presented a great opportunity to connect with people around the world and show what differentiates us.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Practically speaking, it&#8217;s nearly impossible to offer a real review of &#8220;Cyberpunk 2077,&#8221; the long-awaited follow-up to &#8220;The Witcher 3&#8221; from developer CD Projekt Red. In the first place, it&#8217;s so big that the few days I&#8217;ve had with it aren&#8217;t enough to realistically evaluate the game; second, it&#8217;s so buggy and janky now that it feels wrong to review it before it becomes the game I know it will be; and finally, everyone&#8217;s going to buy it anyway.</p>
<p>The Witcher 3 is among the most universally lauded games of the last decade, up there with &#8220;Breath of the Wild,&#8221; &#8220;The Last of Us&#8221; and &#8220;Dark Souls.&#8221; Though it had its flaws — lackluster combat, a limited scope — it did the open world thing better than anyone before or since, largely through improved writing, interesting characters and consequences to player choices.</p>
<p>It was during what you might call that game&#8217;s honeymoon period that &#8220;Cyberpunk 2077&#8221; was announced, and in the years since then the game has approached untenable levels of hype: It could never live up to what people expected, but it could very feasibly be a good game in its own right.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Recent controversies, however, have cast a pall over the launch: A seemingly hypocritical condemnation of pre-release crunch from the developer, some indefensible choices regarding diversity in the game (racialized gangs and a questionable approach to gender and trans representation) and delays suggested this may not be the magnum opus people hoped for.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2083837" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-3.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-3.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-3.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-3.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-3.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-3.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-3.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>In the first place I can confirm that the game probably should have been given a few more months of polish, at least on PC, the platform on which I played it. From the very start I encountered obvious bugs like characters failing to animate, objects floating in mid-air and the admittedly expected physics silliness one finds in every open-world game with simulated objects interacting. A day-one patch may fix some of them, but it&#8217;s clear that a game this big is nearly impossible to smooth out entirely. (I should say that I&#8217;m only partway through the 40-odd-hour campaign, though like its predecessor that will be padded out considerably with side quests.)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a shame, because the world CD Projekt Red has created — or rather adapted from the tabletop RPG on which it is based — is undeniably rich and lovingly fashioned. The easiest way to describe it is simply to say that it&#8217;s exactly what you imagine when you think of &#8220;cyberpunk,&#8221; no more, but surely no less.</p>
<p>The look of overcrowded streets filled with weirdo future people, shuffling between food carts offering vat-grown meat, beneath floating neon advertisements for cybernetic limbs and hacking tools, all watched over by enormous corporations of dubious intention&#8230; it&#8217;s right out of Blade Runner, Johnny Mnemonic, Strange Days, Ghost in the Shell, Neuromancer and dozens of other genre pieces that informed both the original RPG and the general ideas that constitute &#8220;cyberpunk&#8221; in the zeitgeist.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a familiar world you&#8217;ll be entering in some ways, with few real surprises if you&#8217;re at all conversant in the genre. That is a good thing in many ways, as it feels like a lived-in place: a crystallization and expansion of ideas that, while you have seen them elsewhere, have never been at your fingertips so readily, save perhaps in the original &#8220;Deus Ex,&#8221; which had its own limitations.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2083835" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-1.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>Yet at the same time there is very much the feel of a lack of imagination and willingness to update those ideas in ways that seem obvious. The gangs based on racial identities seem like such a poor fit for both this era and for a future in which such distinctions have no doubt declined in relevance, especially in a vast melting pot like Night City. The stereotypical &#8220;Mexican tough guy&#8221; dialogue of your otherwise likeable companion Jackie grates, for instance, as do for example the stilted, supposedly Japanese mannerisms of staff at an Arasaka corporate hotel.</p>
<p>Gender is also a mixed bag. Reviews by queer-identifying reviewers at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22158019/cyberpunk-2077-review-cd-projekt-red-pc-ps4-xbox-one-stadia">Polygon</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/30-hours-with-cyberpunk-2077-brings-mixed-feelings-1845824151">Kotaku</a> have much more relevance here than anything I can say, but I can only concur that the freedom the player has in selecting their presentation is an important step toward better representation of queerness in games — but also has a &#8220;do as I say, not as I do&#8221; feeling. Elsewhere in the game sex and gender are handled regressively or inconsistently with the clear implication that, with body modification something anyone one can do on a street corner for a few eurobucks, race and gender are fluid and unimportant in this world.</p>
<p>This future feels like it was extrapolated exclusively from the forward-thinking but still limited minds of a bunch of smart white guys from the &#8217;90s. Perhaps that&#8217;s why I feel so comfortable in it. But as &#8220;Ready Player One&#8221; demonstrated, there&#8217;s a limit to how much can be accomplished by those methods.</p>
<p>At the same time I want to call out the care that was obviously taken in some ways to have a future filled with people of different shapes, sizes, colors, inclinations and everything else — it&#8217;s clear there is genuine good intention here, even if it stumbles with unfortunate regularity.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2083841" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-1.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>&#8220;What about the game itself, you babbler,&#8221; you ask, after 800 words, &#8220;is it any good?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s good, but difficult to categorize. On one hand, you have a paralysis-inducing freedom in shaping the capabilities with which your character approaches the various situations he or she will encounter. Brute force, stealth, hacking, gunplay — all are quite viable, but don&#8217;t expect to get far relying on only one. A &#8220;pure hacking&#8221; approach, for instance, will be far more tedious than it&#8217;s worth, while a &#8220;pure gunplay&#8221; one will likewise miss the point.</p>
<p>In navigating an enemy base, taking down some rando street gang, or getting through one of the game&#8217;s highly involved criminal operations, there are many options for any given situation, but none is reliable enough (certainly not early on, anyway) to get you through without resorting to the others.</p>
<p>One inconveniently placed guard may be susceptible to having his eyes hacked, while another may be easily distracted by one of the numerous items you can make fizzle out and attract their attention. But when you eventually slip up and the bullets start to fly, you&#8217;re not going to hack your way out of it. That&#8217;s okay, though: You&#8217;re not a scalpel, you&#8217;re a Swiss Army knife. Act like it!</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2083836" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>The open world in which you&#8217;ll be undertaking all these missions is a rich one&#8230; perhaps too rich. Open the map and you&#8217;re presented with a sea of icons, though they&#8217;re not quite the Ubisoft-style to-do list so much as letting you know that this is a big, dense city where you&#8217;ll never lack for gun shops, criminal activities to engage in or disrupt and interesting locations to explore. If you think of the map as more &#8220;where&#8217;s a ripper around here? Let me check my phone&#8221; than generic &#8220;video game map&#8221; it makes more sense, though it&#8217;s obviously the latter, as well.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be driving around a lot as well, a process that is about as smooth as it was in &#8220;Grand Theft Auto 3.&#8221; Using the totally inadequate keyboard controls for my car, I&#8217;ve caused panics and accidents, mowed people down and obstructed traffic constantly, while attempting to follow every law and attract as little attention as possible. This part of the game feels hilariously last-generation, like how in &#8220;Assassin&#8217;s Creed: Odyssey,&#8221; your all-terrain horse vehicle was an object of terror and lethality to any peasant stupid enough to walk on one of that game&#8217;s many mountain trails.</p>
<p>The helpful GPS directions once took me through a pedestrian-occupied area with a gate that was just narrow enough to completely trap the car, though it extricated itself offscreen when I called it. Another time I summoned the car to my location and instantly heard a distant explosion and screams. The car arrived 30 seconds later completely trashed, missing the doors on one side. Fortunately it seems to repair itself by mysterious means when you&#8217;re not looking.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2083842" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-2.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>But when you&#8217;re doing what you&#8217;re supposed to be doing — you know, cyberpunk stuff — things are smoother, if not what I&#8217;d call completely modern. I had this feeling the whole time like I was playing a game whose bones were built eight years ago and then wrapped in layer after layer of stuff, creating systems and environments that feel incredibly cool in some ways and, like the car, huge throwbacks in others. The gunplay isn&#8217;t as good as any shooter today, the melee is about at &#8220;Skyrim&#8221; quality, the hacking is perhaps &#8220;Deus Ex&#8221; levels and stealth is nowhere near &#8220;Metal Gear&#8221; — but none of those games actually offered the breadth or richness of systems and environments as &#8220;Cyberpunk 2077.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the final — for the purpose of this article, which is to say incredibly limited and initial — analysis, it&#8217;s both accurate to say that this game is &#8220;GTA: Night City 2077&#8221; and totally inadequate. It&#8217;s both unique and totally derivative, futuristic and regressive, wide-open and painfully restrictive. Like many AAA games these days, &#8220;Cyberpunk 2077&#8221; contains multitudes, and short of being a total faceplant, which it undeniably isn&#8217;t, it has a huge draw and value for the millions of players who want to hoon around a cyberpunk dystopia, hacking and shooting and scheming and getting better armblades, eyeball replacements and future-guns.</p>
<p>I suppose the simplest summary of my review would be that I look forward to playing &#8220;Cyberpunk&#8221; when it&#8217;s finished. &#8220;The Witcher 3&#8221; came out to acclaim but also criticism of many of its systems, and over time it has evolved into the genre-leading game it is. &#8220;Cyberpunk&#8221; has that potential, but it undeniably also has real issues that I would like to let them address before I play it. If you have any patience, I&#8217;d give it a few months at least so you don&#8217;t have the best of the game spoiled by the worst. At some point in the future I think &#8220;Cyberpunk&#8221; will be a pivotal title in gaming, but not yet — let&#8217;s just hope it gets there before 2077.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/aurora-6292" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="aurora-innovation">Aurora Innovation, </a>the autonomous vehicle startup backed by Sequoia Capital and Amazon, has reached an agreement with Uber to buy the ride-hailing firm&#8217;s self-driving unit in a complex deal that will value the combined company at $10 billion.</p>
<p>Aurora is not paying cash for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> ATG, a company that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/18/uber-atg-1-billion-toyota-denso-vision-fund-spin-out/">valued at $7.25 billion</a> following a $1 billion investment last year from Toyota, DENSO and SoftBank’s Vision Fund. Instead, Uber is handing over its equity in ATG and investing $400 million into Aurora, which will give it a 26% stake in the combined company, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. (As a refresher, Uber held an 86.2% stake (on a fully diluted basis) in Uber ATG, according to filings with the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000119312519188316/d767435d8k.htm">SEC</a>. Uber ATG&#8217;s investors held a combined stake of 13.8% in the company.) Shareholders in Uber ATG will now become minority shareholders of Aurora. Notably, once the deal closes, Uber together with existing ATG investors and the ATG employees who continue their employment with Aurora are expected to collectively hold about 40% interest in Aurora on a fully diluted basis.</p>
<p>Uber CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/dara-khosrowshahi" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="dara-khosrowshahi">Dara Khosrowshahi <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> will take a board seat in the newly expanded Aurora.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Aurora, which was founded in 2017, is focused on building the full self-driving stack, the underlying technology that will allow vehicles to navigate highways and city streets without a human driver behind the wheel. Aurora has attracted attention and investment from high-profile venture firms, management firms and corporations such as Greylock Partners, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sequoia-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sequoia-capital">Sequoia Capital,  <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Amazon and T. Rowe Price, in part because of its founders Sterling Anderson, Drew Bagnell and Chris Urmson, all of whom are veterans of the autonomous vehicle industry.</p>
<p>Urmson led the former Google self-driving project before it spun out to become the Alphabet business Waymo. Anderson is best known for leading the development and launch of the Tesla Model X and the automaker’s Autopilot program. Bagnell, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon, helped launch Uber’s efforts in autonomy, ultimately heading the autonomy and perception team at the Advanced Technologies Center in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Aurora plans to bring autonomous trucks to market first. However, Urmson has maintained that the company is still pursuing other applications of its self-driving stack such as robotaxis. The deal with Uber ATG provides Aurora with talent and operational facilities. But it delivers on two other important areas: relationships with Uber ATG investors, specifically Toyota, as well as a partnership with Uber that will give it access to its vast ride-hailing platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way we want to build this company has been with this mindset of let&#8217;s build it to scale — let&#8217;s create an environment where people can do their best work,&#8221; Urmson said in an interview Monday. &#8220;And then let&#8217;s go look for great teams and bring them in. It&#8217;s one way to get a combination of talent and technology, and in this case, also relationships.&#8221;</p>
<p>The announcement, which confirms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/uber-in-talks-to-sell-atg-self-driving-unit-to-aurora/">TechCrunch&#8217;s reporting in November</a>, marks the beginning of what promises to be a huge undertaking to merge Uber ATG, a 1,200-person business unit with operations in Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto with its smaller competitor.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear if all Uber ATG employees will be folded into Aurora, which has 600-person workforce and operations in San Francisco Bay Area, Pittsburgh, Texas and Bozeman, Montana. At least one executive — Uber ATG CEO Eric Meyhofer — will not be joining the company.</p>
<p>Urmson emphasized that work to integrate the companies and their technology will begin without haste.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the most fun things we&#8217;ll be doing over the next 60 days is bringing the two teams together,&#8221; Urmson said. &#8220;And then kind of dispassionately looking at what is the technology that accelerates our first product to market and then amplifying that — whether it&#8217;s from the existing Aurora team or to the new Aurora team — and pushing that forward, whether it&#8217;s ideas or code or bits of hardware together to accelerate our time to market.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company plans to assess the workforce and technology as quickly as possible, Urmson said.</p>
<h2>Uber&#8217;s AV history</h2>
<p>For Uber, the deal marks one of the last expensive pursuits that it had yet to either spin or sell off as the company narrowed in on its core businesses of ride-hailing and delivery. In the past year, Uber has dumped shared micromobility unit Jump, sold a stake in its growing but still unprofitable logistics arm, Uber Freight and acquired Postmates. Uber is also reportedly in talks to sell off its autonomous air taxi business Uber Elevate.</p>
<p>Uber ATG was one of those businesses that promised financial benefits in the long term, but delivered lots of pain, controversy and upfront costs since almost the moment it was created.</p>
<p>In early 2015, Uber kicked off its pursuit of autonomous vehicles when it announced a strategic partnership with Carnegie Mellon University’s National Robotics Center. The agreement to work on developing driverless car technology resulted in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-uber-a-friend-or-foe-of-carnegie-mellon-in-robotics-1433084582">Uber poaching dozens of NREC researchers</a> and scientists. A year later, Uber acquired a self-driving truck startup called Otto, a startup founded by one of Google’s star engineers, Anthony Levandowski, along with three other Google veterans: Lior Ron, Claire Delaunay and Don Burnette.</p>
<p>Two months after the acquisition, Google made two arbitration demands against Levandowski and Ron. Uber wasn’t a party to either arbitration. While the arbitrations played out, Waymo separately filed a lawsuit against Uber in February 2017 for trade secret theft and patent infringement. Waymo alleged in the suit, which went to trial but ended in a settlement in 2018, that Levandowski stole trade secrets, which were then used by Uber.</p>
<p>With the trial over, Uber pressed on, but almost immediately was involved in another deadlier controversy when one of its autonomous test vehicles — which had a human safety driver behind the wheel — struck and killed a pedestrian in March 2018. The entire industry took pause and Uber halted all testing.</p>
<p>Uber spun out Uber ATG in spring 2019 after closing $1 billion in funding from Toyota, auto parts maker Denso and SoftBank’s Vision Fund. Even with the spin off, Uber still faced a costly enterprise. Uber reported in November that ATG and “other technologies” (which includes Uber Elevate) had a net loss of $303 million in the nine months that ended September 30, 2020. In its S-1 document, Uber said it incurred $457 million of research and development expenses for its ATG and “other Technology Programs” initiatives.</p>
<h2>What Aurora values</h2>
<p>Despite the trail of problems that have plagued Uber ATG, Urmson insists that the company has the talent and some interesting technology that makes it a worthy asset.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the work they&#8217;ve been doing in designing their next-generation hardware for the vehicles is exciting and interesting,&#8221; he said. &#8220;On the software side, they have really cool stuff in prediction, and how they&#8217;ve combined prediction and the perception system together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others close to the deal said Uber ATG has valuable and talented mid-level and low-level engineers, making the acquisition particularly appealing to Aurora.</p>
<p>This is not Aurora&#8217;s first acquisition, although it is certainly its largest and most complex. In 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/fresh-off-a-530m-round-aurora-acquires-lidar-startup-blackmore/">Aurora acquired Blackmore</a>, a Bozeman, Montana-based lidar company, and simulation startup 7D Labs. Aurora has touted its  &#8220;no jerks&#8221; policy and its company culture, which is now about to absorb hundreds of new people.</p>
<p>Post-merger integrations can take months, even years, which can in turn slow down technological or operational progress. Urmson thinks differently.</p>
<p>&#8220;If anything, this accelerates our objectives,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.odysee.com">Odysee</a> is a new video site that CEO Jeremy Kauffman said was created to recapture some of the freedom and independence of the internet he grew up with — an internet where &#8220;anyone could speak and anyone could have a voice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kauffman argued that since then, the internet has become &#8220;very corporate,&#8221; with a small number of companies controlling the flow of information. Odysee was created to provide an alternative — and eventually, more than that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some would call it an alternative to YouTube,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We like to think it’s the successor.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The site was created by the team behind the <a href="https://lbry.com/">Lbry</a> (pronounced &#8220;library&#8221;) blockchain protocol. Kauffman emphasized that neither Odysee creators nor their viewers need to know anything about the technology (&#8220;blockchain is a how, it&#8217;s not a why&#8221;), but he said this approach gives those creators more direct control of their content and their audience. As Kauffman put it, &#8220;Your channel exists, effectively, in a cryptocurrency wallet that you can download.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Lbry website <a href="https://lbry.com/faq/what-is-lbry">offers a few more details</a>: &#8220;For the same reasons that nobody can prevent a Bitcoin transaction from taking place, nobody can prevent a transaction (like a publication or a tip) from appearing on the LBRY blockchain.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Odysee website sits on top of this protocol. While anyone could, in theory, publish anything to the Lbry blockchain, Odysee restricts content based on <a href="https://odysee.com/@OdyseeHelp:b/Community-Guidelines:c">a handful of community guidelines</a> that prohibit things like pornography and content that promotes violence or terrorism.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;YouTube suspends and demonetizes One America News Network over COVID-19 video&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/youtube-suspends-and-demonetizes-one-america-news-network-over-covid-19-video/embed/#?secret=jqSSj5Dzg1" data-secret="jqSSj5Dzg1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Still, Kauffman said, &#8220;We do think that YouTube is far too strict.&#8221; As an example, he pointed to the Google-owned platform&#8217;s decision to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/09/17/scott-atlas-youtube/">remove an interview with the Trump administration&#8217;s pandemic advisor Scott Atlas</a> in which he questioned social distancing and stay-at-home orders. (Dr. Atlas <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/30/politics/scott-atlas-resigns-trump-administration-coronavirus-task-force/index.html">resigned from his position</a> in the administration last week.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Strict&#8221; is not exactly the word I&#8217;d use to describe YouTube&#8217;s moderation policies, and I&#8217;d also argue that it&#8217;s a good thing that the big digital platforms are being (somewhat) more proactive in blocking or at least labeling misinformation around high-stakes topics like the COVID-19 pandemic, or President Trump&#8217;s efforts to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/youtube-demonetizes-but-wont-pull-trump-won-video-following-backlash/">de-legitimize his defeat in the November election</a>.</p>
<p>Kauffman countered that in the Atlas example, &#8220;You don&#8217;t delete the video. That&#8217;s not how science progresses.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while loudly declaring your dedication to &#8220;free speech&#8221; has increasingly served as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/parler-app-store-facebook/">a euphemism for attracting right-wing content and users</a>, Kauffman said that&#8217;s not his aim.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mX1iuhVLMB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/parler-app-store-facebook/">&#8216;Free speech&#8217; social network Parler tops app store rankings following Biden&#8217;s election win</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;&#8216;Free speech&#8217; social network Parler tops app store rankings following Biden&#8217;s election win&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/parler-app-store-facebook/embed/#?secret=mX1iuhVLMB" data-secret="mX1iuhVLMB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We want to be a space where all voices can be heard,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a compelling argument that the big platforms <a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/p/the-problem-with-all-the-tech-hearings?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMDg1NTUsInBvc3RfaWQiOjE1MzU3OTA5LCJfIjoiN0ZkYjIiLCJpYXQiOjE2MDczNzE4MTYsImV4cCI6MTYwNzM3NTQxNiwiaXNzIjoicHViLTExODQiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.ft9XIJA4r3c8qdoVmKg2_SMRZyHyaWAW7wvMFckelho">simply have too much power</a>, so regardless of your opinion on any particular platform or decision, you could see Odysee as an attempt to return that power to individual creators.</p>
<p>Plus, politics only represents one slice of what&#8217;s being published on the site.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to go watch &#8216;The Daily Show&#8217; or Gordon Ramsay clips, go to YouTube,&#8221; Kauffman said. &#8220;If you want to watch this crazy, trippy video that a 19-year-old made in their house but it’s super interesting, that’s the kind of stuff that you can find on Odysee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not that Odysee necessarily expects creators to post exclusively to the site, as <a href="https://odysee.com/@UpperEchelonGamers:3">Upper Echelon Gamers</a> acknowledged in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>The greatest draw for me to Odysee was an automated second library of content that can build on its own without increasing my workload. Combine that with a much clearer monetization formula, and far more responsive communication with the administration and you have a platform that is very exciting to work with.</p></blockquote>
<p>Odysee officially launched this month, but it says that since the beta version went live in September, more than 400,000 people have posted a total of 5 million videos to the site, which is already attracting 8.7 million monthly active users.</p>
<p>The plan is to eventually make money from advertising, with creators given full control over how they monetize. Individual viewers, meanwhile, will also be able to pay to skip ads, even if it&#8217;s just for one video.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Do people want their at-home fitness to come in video-game form? The incredible <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/ring-fit-adventure-has-sold-over-4-million-units-worldwide/">popularity of games like Ring Fit Adventure</a> suggests yes.</p>
<p>London-based startup <a href="https://quell.tech">Quell</a> thinks it&#8217;s just the beginning for this genre, and they&#8217;ve raised a $3 million seed round to help prove it.</p>
<p>At the core of Quell&#8217;s gameplay is the &#8220;Gauntlet&#8221; — a harness, of sorts, that the player slips on to control Quell&#8217;s games. As players punch and dodge their way through the world, Gauntlet&#8217;s built-in sensors measure things like punch speed and accuracy, while customizable resistance bands keep things challenging.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We initially wrote about Quell <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/quells-resistance-based-workout-can-get-you-in-shape-by-boxing-virtual-enemies/">back in August</a>, and named it as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/our-12-favorite-startups-from-y-combinators-s20-demo-day-part-2/">one of our top startups</a> from the Y Combinator S20 Demo Day.</p>
<p>Investors in this round include Twitch co-founders Kevin Lin and Emmett Shear, AngelList founder Naval Ravikant, WikiHow founder Josh Hannah, TenCent, Khosla Ventures, Heartcore, Social Impact Capital and JamJar Investments. Quell co-founder Doug Stidolph tells me they were initially raising at a valuation of $10 million; by the time they&#8217;d closed the final investors in this round, the valuation had increased to $15 million. The company also recently closed a Kickstarter campaign, where it raised £501,341 (around $670,000 USD) from nearly 3,000 backers. With the ongoing pandemic making it scarier and riskier to hit the gym (if your state/county even allows it), interest and demand for home fitness options will just keep going up.</p>

<p>Quell&#8217;s hardware and games are initially being built to work with PC, Mac and mobile devices. That means no console support at first — a bummer, as a big ol&#8217; TV seems like the ideal display for games like this, and consoles are probably the most user-friendly way of getting it there. It&#8217;s something the company says it has on its roadmap to hopefully tackle in the future, but the added cost/complexity of the console hardware approval process was a bit too much to take on at launch.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Quell is building out its own in-house game studio, hiring folks like Peter Cornelius (formerly lead producer at the developer-centric gaming tech company Improbable) as Game Production director. One of the main goals, Quell co-founder Cameron Brookhouse tells me, is to build games that get the player exercising while still being deeply immersive; they want the gameplay to encourage movement intuitively, rather than tossing up prompts that say something like, &#8220;OK! Time for jumping jacks!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Quell team tells me they expect their first hardware to ship by the end of 2021. They&#8217;re currently working on transitioning their prototypes into production, figuring out how to do things like make it easier to adjust resistance or swap the Gauntlet from user to user, and to increase the number of different exercises its sensors can detect and gamify.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.sidewalkinfra.com/">Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners</a>, the company which spun out of Alphabet’s Sidewalk Labs to fund, develop and own the next generation of infrastructure, has unveiled its latest project &#8212; Resilia, which focuses on upgrading the efficiency and reliability of power grids.</p>
<p>Through a $20 million equity investment in the startup OhmConnect, and an $80 million commitment to develop a demand response program leveraging OhmConnect&#8217;s technology and services across the state of California, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sidewalk-infrastructure-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sidewalk-infrastructure-partners">Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> intends to plant a flag for demand-response technologies as a key pathway to ensuring stable energy grids across the country.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’re creating a virtual power plant,&#8221; said Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners co-CEO, Jonathan Winer. &#8220;With a typical power plant … it’s project finance, but for a virtual power plant… We’re basically going to subsidize the rollout of smart devices.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea that people will respond to signals from the grid isn&#8217;t a new one, as Winer himself acknowledged in an interview. But the approach that Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners is taking, alongside OhmConnect, to roll out the incentives to residential customers through a combination of push notifications and payouts, is novel. &#8220;The first place people focused is on commercial and industrial buildings,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p>What drew Sidewalk to the OhmConnect approach was the knowledge of the end consumer that OhmConnect&#8217;s management team brought to the table&#8230; the company&#8217;s chief technology officer was the former chief technology officer of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zynga" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zynga">Zynga, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Winer noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s cool about the OhmConnect platform is that it empowers participation,&#8221; Winer said. &#8220;Anyone can enroll in these programs. If you&#8217;re an OhmConnect user and there&#8217;s a blackout coming, we&#8217;ll give you five bucks if you turn down your thermostat for the next two hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>The San Francisco-based demand-response company already has 150,000 users on its platform, and has paid out something like $1 million to its customers during the brownouts and blackouts that have roiled California&#8217;s electricity grid over the past year.</p>
<p>The first collaboration between OhmConnect and Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners under the Resilia banner will be what the companies are calling a &#8220;Resi-Station&#8221; &#8212; a 550 megawatt capacity demand response program that will use smart devices to power targeted energy reductions.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> At full scale, the companies said that the project will be the largest residential virtual power plant in the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“OhmConnect has shown that by linking together the savings of many individual consumers, we can reduce stress on the grid and help prevent blackouts,” said OhmConnect CEO Cisco DeVries. “This investment by SIP will allow us to bring the rewards of energy savings to hundreds of thousands of additional Californians – and at the same time build the smart energy platform of the future.” </span></p>
<p>California&#8217;s utilities need all the help they can get. Heat waves and rolling blackouts spread across the state as it confronted some of its hottest temperatures over the summer. California residents already pay among the highest residential power prices in the country at 21 cents per kilowatt hour, versus a national average of 13 cents.</p>
<p>During times of peak stress earlier in the year, OhmConnect engaged its customers to reduce almost one gigawatt hour of total energy usage. That&#8217;s the equivalent of taking 600,000 homes off the grid for one hour.</p>
<p>If the Resilia project was rolled out at scale, the companies estimate they could provide 5 gigawatt hours of energy conservation &#8212; that&#8217;s the full amount of the energy shortfall from the year&#8217;s blackouts and the equivalent of not burning 3.8 million pounds of coal.</p>
<p>Going forward, the Resilia energy efficiency and demand response platform will scale up other infrastructure innovations as energy grids shift from centralized power to distributed, decentralized generation sources, the company said. OhmConnect looks to be an integral part of that platform.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The energy grid used to be uni-directional.. .we believe that in the near future the grid is going to be become bi-directional and responsive,&#8221; said Winer. &#8220;With our approach, this won’t be one investment. We’ll likely make multiple investments. [Vehicle-to-grid], micro-grid platforms, and generative design are going to be important.&#8221; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.finn.auto/">Finn.auto</a> — which allows people to subscribe to their car instead of owning it, and offsetting their CO₂ emissions — has raised a $24.2 million / €20 million Series A funding round. <a href="https://whitestarcapital.com/">White Star Capital</a> (which has also invested in Tier Mobility), and the Zalando co-CEOs Rubin Ritter, David Schneider and Robert Gentz, are new investors in this round. All previous investors participated.</p>
<p>The funding comes just under a year since the company launched, after selling just 1,000 car subscriptions. It’s also partnered with Deutsche Post AG and Deutsche Telekom AG.</p>
<p>A number of car manufacturers have launched similar subscription services powered by various providers, such as <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/drover" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="drover">Drover, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> LeasePlan and Wagonex.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>U.K.-based startup Drover has raised a total of $40 million in funding over five rounds. Their latest Series B funding round was with Shell Ventures and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cherry-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cherry-ventures">Cherry Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. Plus, there are branded services which include Audi on Demand, BMW, Citroën, DS, Jaguar Carpe, Land Rover Carpe, Mini, Volkswagen and Care by Volvo.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK&#8217;s Drover raises $26M to take its car subscription marketplace to Europe&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/uks-drover-raises-26m-for-to-take-its-car-subscription-marketplace-to-europe/embed/#?secret=na0JFHYnDa" data-secret="na0JFHYnDa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Digitally led subscription services have the potential to disrupt the traditional car sales model, and new startups are entering the market all the time.</p>
<p>The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/finn-b149" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="finn-b149">finn.auto <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> model is proving to appeal to environment-conscious millennials. For each car subscription, the company is offsetting the CO₂ emissions of its vehicles, meaning subscribers can drive their cars in a climate-neutral manner. It&#8217;s now expanding its range of fully electric vehicles and, in cooperation with <a href="https://www.climatepartner.com/en">ClimatePartner</a>, is supporting selected regional climate protection and development projects.</p>
<p>Key to the Munich-based startups’ play is the automation of fleet management processes and customer interactions, meaning it’s much easier and cheaper to run this kind of subscription operation.</p>
<p>Max-Josef Meier, CEO and founder of finn.auto, said: &#8220;We are delighted to have been able to bring such high-caliber investors on board and that our existing investors are cementing their confidence with the current round. Mobility with your own car becomes as easy as buying shoes on the internet. We already offer a large selection of different car brands, whose cars can be ordered online on our platform in just five minutes and at flexible runtimes. The delivery is then conveniently made to the front door.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas Stocks, general partner at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/white-star-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="white-star-capital">White Star Capital <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> added: &#8220;There is a huge opportunity globally to streamline outdated customer experiences in the automotive retail space and become the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> of the automotive industry. This is something finn.auto is excellently placed to capitalize on with its offering of convenience, flexibility, value and sustainability.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> timeline is currently overrun with ads for some users, in what at first appeared to be a glitch involving the distribution of Promoted Tweets. Typically, a Promoted Tweet &#8212; which is just a regular tweet <a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/help/overview/what-are-promoted-tweets.html">an advertiser has paid to promote more broadly</a> &#8212; will appear just once at the top of a user&#8217;s timeline, then scroll through the timeline like any other tweet. Now, however, Promoted Tweets are popping up with increased frequency. <a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1336024788985393152?from_editor=true">Some users</a> report seeing them as often as every four to six tweets, in fact. Others are reporting seeing the same Promoted Tweet more than once.</p>
<p>This seemed to have indicated some sort of issue with Twitter&#8217;s ad system, as the company generally intends for Promoted Tweets to be targeted and relevant to the end user, without being an overly frequent part of users&#8217; timelines.</p>
<p>As Twitter&#8217;s Business website <a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/help/overview/what-are-promoted-tweets.html">explains</a>, &#8220;we’re thoughtful in how we display Promoted Tweets, and are conservative about the number of Promoted Tweets that people see in a single day.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s obviously not the case when it seems like nearly every other tweet is now an ad &#8212; and often, a repeated ad.</p>
<p>Twitter says the change is not a glitch, however —  it’s intentional.</p>
<p>”<span data-removefontsize="true" data-originalcomputedfontsize="16">We regularly experiment and deploy changes to our advertising experience. We are constantly innovating and testing, and will continue to adapt as we learn,” a company spokesperson said.  </span></p>

However, we&#8217;ve seen complaints coming from users both in the U.S. and abroad and on both the &#8220;Home&#8221; and &#8220;Recent Tweets&#8221; timelines.</p>
<p>Given the lack of updates and information, some Twitter users have been dealing with the influx of Promoted Tweets by muting or blocking the advertiser&#8217;s account. That could have lasting consequences, as advertisers won&#8217;t be able to again reach those users if they get blocked.</p>
<p>Twitter provided a comment to TechCrunch after publication and we’ve updated to note that the company says it’s not a bug, but rather that it’s intentionally flooding the timeline with more ads to make use of the surplus ad inventory at year-end.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Portable audio recording solutions abound, and many recently released devices have done a lot to improve the convenience and quality of sound-recording devices you can carry in your pocket &#8212; spurred in part by smartphones and their constant improvement in video recording capabilities. A new device from Austria&#8217;s mikme, the <a href="https://shop-eu.mikme.com/collections/pockets/products/mikme-pocket">mikme pocket (€369 or just under $450 USD)</a>, offers a tremendous amount of flexibility and quality in a very portable package, delivering what might just be the ultimate pocket sound solution for reporters, podcasters, video creators and more.</p>
<h2>The basics</h2>
<p>mikme pocket is small &#8212; about half the size of a smartphone, but square and probably twice as thick. It&#8217;s not as compact as something like the Rode Wireless GO, but it contains onboard memory and a Bluetooth antenna, making it possible to both record locally and transmit audio directly to a connected smartphone from up to three mikme pockets at once.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2083738,2083739"]</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The mikme pocket features a single button for control, as well as dedicated volume buttons, a 3.5mm headphone jack for monitoring audio, a micro-USB port for charging and for offloading files via physical connection, and Bluetooth pairing and power buttons. It has an integrated belt clip, as well as a 3/8&#8243; thread mount for mic stands, with an adapter included for mounting to 1/4&#8243; standard camera tripod connections.</p>
<p>In the box, mikme has also included a lavalier microphone with a mini XLR connector (which is the interface the pocket uses) and a clip and two windscreens for the mic. They also offer a &#8220;pro&#8221; lavalier mic as a separate, add-on purchase (€149 or around $180 USD), which offers improved performance versus the included lav in terms of audio quality and dynamic range.</p>

<p>The internal battery for the mikme pocket lasts up to 3.5 hours of recording time, and it can last for more than six months in standby mode between recordings, too.</p>
<h2>Design and performance</h2>
<p>The mikme pocket is a pretty unadorned black block, but its unassuming design is one of its strengths. It has a textured matte feel which helps with grittiness, and it&#8217;s easy to hide in dark clothing, plus the integrated belt clip works exactly as desired, ensuring the pack is easily secured to anyone you&#8217;re trying to wire for sound. It features a single large button for simplified control, which also easily shows you its connectivity status using an LED backlight.</p>
<p>Controls for more advanced functions like Bluetooth connectivity, as well as the micro-USB port, are located on the bottom, where they&#8217;re unlikely to be pressed accidentally by anyone during recording. The mini XLR interface for microphones means that once a mic is plugged in, it&#8217;s also securely locked in place and won&#8217;t be jostled out during sessions.</p>
<p>You can use the mikme pocket on its own, thanks to its 16GB of built-in local storage, but it really shines when used in tandem with the smartphone app. The app allows you to connect up to three pockets simultaneously, and provides a built-in video recorder so you can take full advantage of the recording capabilities of modern devices like the iPhone 12 to capture real-time synced audio while you film effortlessly. The mikme pocket and app also have a failsafe built in for filling in any gaps that might arise from any connection dropouts thanks to the local recording backup.</p>
<p>In terms of audio quality, the sound without adjusting any settings is excellent. Like all lavalier mics, you&#8217;ll get better results the closer you can place the actual mic capsule itself to a speaker&#8217;s mouth, but the mikme pocket produced exceptional clean-sounding, high-quality audio right out of the box &#8212; in environments that weren&#8217;t particularly sound-isolated or devoid of background noise.</p>

<p>The included mini XLR lav mic is probably good enough for the needs of most amateur and enthusiast users, while the lavalier pro is a great upgrade option for anyone looking to make the absolute most of their recordings, especially with post-processing via desktop audio editing software. The mikme app has built-in audio tweaking controls with a great visual interface that allows you to hear the effects of processing tweaks in real time, which is great for maximizing sound quality on the go before sharing clips and videos directly from your device to social networks or publishing platforms.</p>

<h2>Bottom line</h2>
<p>From on-phone shotgun mics, to handheld recorders and much more, there are plenty of options out there for capturing audio on-the-go, but the mikme pocket is the one that offers the best balance of very high-quality sound that&#8217;s essentially immediately ready to publish, in a package that&#8217;s both extremely easy to carry anywhere with you and that offers durability and user-friendliness to suit newcomers and experts alike.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/federal-communications-commission" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="federal-communications-commission">FCC <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has just <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/auction-904-winning-bidders">published</a> the results of its Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Phase I auction, which sounds rather stiff but involves distributing billions to broadband providers that bring solid internet connections to under-served rural areas &#8220;on the wrong side of the digital divide.&#8221; Included is $885 million earmarked for SpaceX, whose <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/spacex-launches-starlink-app-and-provides-pricing-and-service-info-to-early-beta-testers/">Starlink</a> satellite service could be a game-changer for places where laying fiber isn&#8217;t an option.</p>
<p>Only three other companies garnered more funds: Charter with $1.22 billion; Minnesota and Iowa provider LTD Broadband with $1.32 billion; and utility collective Rural Electric Cooperate Consortium, with $1.1 billion. Those are all traditional wireline-based broadband, and a quick perusal of the list of grantees suggests no other satellite broadband provider made the cut (180 bidders were awarded support in total).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/auction/904">The $9.2 billion auction</a> (though the specifics of the process itself are not relevant) essentially asks for bids on how much a company can provide service to a given area for, ideally with a 100 megabit downstream and 20 up. Local companies can collect the hundred grand necessary to fund a fiber line where there&#8217;s now copper, and big multi-state concerns may promise to undertake major development projects for hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Starlink has the advantage of not requiring any major construction projects to reach people out in the boonies. All that&#8217;s needed is a dish and for their home to be in the area currently covered by the rapidly expanding network of satellites in low-Earth orbit. That means the company can undercut many of its competitors — in theory anyway.</p>

<p>Starlink has not had any major rollout yet, only small test deployments, which, according to SpaceX, have gone extremely well. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/spacexs-starlink-asks-potential-service-testers-for-addresses-says-private-beta-starts-this-summer/">The first wave of beta testers</a> for the service will be expected to pay $99 per month plus a one-time $500 installation fee, but what the cost of the commercial service would be is anyone&#8217;s guess (probably a bit lower).</p>
<p>In order to secure the $885 billion in the FCC&#8217;s auction, SpaceX would need to demonstrate that it can provide solid service to the areas it claims to for a reasonable price, so we can expect the costs to be in line with terrestrial broadband offerings. No other satellite broadband provider operates in that price range (Swarm offers IoT connection for $5/month, but that&#8217;s a totally different category).</p>

<p>The FCC doesn&#8217;t just knock on Elon Musk&#8217;s door with a big check, though. The company must demonstrate &#8220;periodic buildout requirements&#8221; at the locations it&#8217;s promised, at which point funds will be disbursed. This continues for a period of several years, and should help the fledgling internet provider stay alive while undergoing the rigors and uncertainties of launch. By the time the FCC cash dries up the company will ideally have several million subscribers propping it up.</p>
<p>This is &#8220;Phase I&#8221; of the auction, targeting the areas most in need of new internet service; Phase II will cover &#8220;partially-served&#8221; areas that perhaps have one good provider but no competition. Whether SpaceX will be able (or want) to make a push there is unclear, though the confidence with which the company has been approaching the market suggests it may make a limited play for these somewhat more hardened target markets.</p>
<p>The push for expanding rural broadband has been a particular focus for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/fcc-chairman-ajit-pai-will-step-down-to-make-way-for-the-biden-administration/">outgoing FCC Chairman Ajit Pai</a>, who had this to say about its success so far:</p>
<blockquote><p>We structured this innovative and groundbreaking auction to be technologically neutral and to prioritize bids for high-speed, low-latency offerings.  We aimed for maximum leverage of taxpayer dollars and for networks that would meet consumers’ increasing broadband needs, and the results show that our strategy worked. This auction was the single largest step ever taken to bridge the digital divide and is another key success for the Commission in its ongoing commitment to universal service. I thank our staff for working so hard and so long to get this auction done on time, particularly during the pandemic.</p></blockquote>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As a product manager, I’m a true believer that you can solve any problem with the right product and process, even one as gnarly as the multiheaded hydra that is microservice overhead.</p>
<p>Working for Vertex Ventures US this summer was my chance to put this to the test. After interviewing 30+ industry experts from a diverse set of companies — Facebook, Fannie Mae, Confluent, Salesforce and more — and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/13z4d063621t087/Vertex%20Ventures%20US%20Webinar%20-%20The%20State%20Of%20Microservices.mp3?dl=0">hosting a webinar</a> with the co-founders of PagerDuty, LaunchDarkly and OpsLevel, we were able to answer three main questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do teams adopt microservices?</li>
<li>What are the main challenges organizations face?</li>
<li>Which strategies, processes and tools do companies use to overcome these challenges?</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>How do teams adopt microservices?</strong></h2>
<p>Out of dozens of companies we spoke with, only two had not yet started their journey to microservices, but both were actively considering it. Industry trends mirror this as well. In an O’Reilly <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_03-1.png">survey of 1500+ respondents</a>, more than 75% had started to adopt microservices.</p>
<p>It’s rare for companies to start building with microservices from the ground up. Of the companies we spoke with, only one had done so. Some startups, such as <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/launchdarkly" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="launchdarkly">LaunchDarkly, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> plan to build their infrastructure using microservices, but turned to a monolith once they realized the high cost of overhead.</p>
<p>“We were spending more time effectively building and operating a system for distributed systems versus actually building our own services so we pulled back hard,&#8221; said John Kodumal, CTO and co-founder of LaunchDarkly.</p>
<p>&#8220;As an example, the things we were trying to do in mesosphere, they were impossible,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We couldn’t do any logging. Zero downtime deploys were impossible. There were so many bugs in the infrastructure and we were spending so much time debugging the basic things that we weren’t building our own service.”</p>
<p>As a result, it’s more common for companies to start with a monolith and move to microservices to scale their infrastructure with their organization. Once a company reaches ~30 developers, most begin decentralizing control by moving to a microservice architecture.</p>

	</p>
<p>Large companies with established monoliths are keen to move to microservices, but costs are high and the transition can take years. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/atlassian" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="atlassian">Atlassian’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> platform infrastructure is in microservices, but legacy monoliths in Jira and Confluence persist despite ongoing decomposition efforts. Large companies often get stuck in this transition. However, a combination of strong, top-down strategy combined with bottoms-up dev team support can help companies, such as Freddie Mac, make substantial progress.</p>
<p>Some startups, like Instacart, first shifted to a modular monolith that allows the code to reside in a single repository while beginning the process of distributing ownership of discrete code functions to relevant teams. This enables them to mitigate the overhead associated with a microservice architecture by balancing the visibility of having a centralized repository and release pipeline with the flexibility of discrete ownership over portions of the codebase.</p>
<h2><strong>What challenges do teams face?</strong></h2>
<p>Teams may take different routes to arrive at a microservice architecture, but they tend to face a common set of challenges once they get there. John Laban, CEO and co-founder of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/opslevel" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="opslevel">OpsLevel, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which helps teams build and manage microservices told us that “with a distributed or microservices based architecture your teams benefit from being able to move independently from each other, but there are some gotchas to look out for.”</p>
<p>Indeed, the linked <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_10-1.png">O’Reilly chart</a> shows how the top 10 challenges organizations face when adopting microservices are shared by 25%+ of respondents. While we discussed some of the adoption blockers above, feedback from our interviews highlighted issues around managing complexity.</p>
<p>The lack of a coherent definition for a service can cause teams to generate unnecessary overhead by creating too many similar services or spreading related services across different groups. One company we spoke with went down the path of decomposing their monolith and took it too far. Their service definitions were too narrow, and by the time decomposition was complete, they were left with 4,000+ microservices to manage. They then had to backtrack and consolidate down to a more manageable number.</p>
<p>Defining too many services creates unnecessary organizational and technical silos while increasing complexity and overhead. Logging and monitoring must be present on each service, but with ownership spread across different teams, a lack of standardized tooling can create observability headaches. It’s challenging for teams to get a single-pane-of-glass view with too many different interacting systems and services that span the entire architecture.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Jamstack, it’s a popular way of developing and deploying websites at scale. It lets you take advantage of global edge networks with a focus on performance.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re a very famous pop artist and you’re launching your new album on your website tomorrow. You expect to get a huge traffic spike and a ton of orders.</p>
<p>If you also happen to be a web developer, you could develop a Jamstack website to make sure that your website remains available and loads quickly. Instead of using a traditional content management system to host your content and deliver it to your users, a Jamstack framework lets you decouple the front end from the back end.</p>
<p>You could write a few posts in your content management system and then deploy your website update. Your Jamstack application will prebuild static pages based on what you just wrote. Those pages will be cached on a global edge network and served in a few milliseconds across the world. It&#8217;s like photocopying a letter instead of writing a new copy every time somebody wants to read it.</p>
<p>But what if somebody wants to buy your new album on the buy page? On that page, there will be a checkout module, which is dynamic content that can’t be cached. You can leverage a payments API, such as Stripe, so that the user doesn’t load content from your server at all.</p>
<p>This is a simple example, but many companies have been going down this path. For static content, everything is prebuilt and cached. For dynamic content, companies build microservices that are loaded on demand and that can scale easily.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane">Jane Manchun Wong’s</a> screenshots, Cloudflare Pages lets you deploy sites with a simple Git commit. It integrates directly with your GitHub repository if you’re hosting your source code on the platform.</p>
<p>You can configure a Node.js build command that will be executed every time you change something to your code. Once the build process is done, your website is accessible to your end users.</p>
<p>There will be a free tier for Cloudflare Pages, which lets you generate 500 builds per month. Above that quota, Cloudflare will most likely let you pay for more builds and more features.</p>
<p>By default, Cloudflare gives you a subdomain name to try out the service — your-website-name.pages.dev. Of course, you can configure your own domain name and combine Cloudflare Pages with other Cloudflare products.</p>
<p>You can already read Cloudflare Pages’ documentation, as spotted by Jane Manchun Wong. So it sounds like Cloudflare Pages could launch sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><i>Update: While the documentation site was accessible at the time of publication, it is no longer accessible.</i></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The way a team functions and communicates dictates the operational efficiency of a startup and sets the scene for its culture. It’s way more important than what social events and perks are offered, so it’s the responsibility of a founder and/or CEO to provide their team with a technology approach that will empower them to achieve and succeed — now and in the future.</p>
<p>With that in mind, moving to the cloud might seem like a no-brainer because of its huge benefits around flexibility, accessibility and the potential to rapidly scale, while keeping budgets in check.</p>
<p>But there’s an important consideration here: Cloud providers won’t magically give you efficient teams<em>.</em></p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Designing a startup for scale means investing in the right technology today to underpin growth for tomorrow and beyond.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>It will get you going in the right direction, but you need to think even farther ahead. Designing a startup for scale means investing in the right technology <em>today</em> to underpin growth for tomorrow and beyond. Let’s look at how you approach and manage your cloud infrastructure will impact the effectiveness of your teams and your ability to scale.</p>
<h2><strong>Hindsight is 20/20</strong></h2>
<p>Adopting cloud is easy, but adopting it properly with best practices and in a secure way? Not so much. You might think that when you move to cloud, the cloud providers will give you everything you need to succeed. But even though they’re there to provide a wide breadth of services, these services won’t necessarily have the depth that you will need to run efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>Yes, your cloud infrastructure is working now, but think beyond the first prototype or alpha and toward production. Considering where you want to get to, and not just where you are, will help you avoid costly mistakes. You definitely don’t want to struggle through redefining processes and ways of working when you’re also managing time sensitivities and multiple teams.</p>
<p>If you don’t think ahead, you’ll have to put all new processes in. It will take a whole lot longer, cost more money and cause a lot more disruption to teams than if you do it earlier.</p>
<p>For any founder, making strategic technology decisions <strong><em>right now</em></strong> should be a primary concern. It feels more natural to put off those decisions until you come face to face with the problem, but you’ll just end up needing to redo everything as you scale and cause your teams a world of hurt. If you don’t give this problem attention at the beginning, you’re just scaling the problems with the team. Flaws are then embedded within your infrastructure, and they’ll continue to scale with the teams. When these things are rushed, corners are cut and you will end up spending even more time and money on your infrastructure.</p>
<h2><strong>Build effective teams and reduce bottlenecks</strong></h2>
<p>When you’re making strategic decisions on how to approach your technology stack and cloud infrastructure, the biggest consideration should be what makes an effective team. Given that, keep these things top of mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed of delivery: </strong>Having developers able to self-serve cloud infrastructure with best practices built-in will enable speed. Development tools that factor in visibility and communication integrations for teams will give transparency on how they are iterating, problems, bugs or integration failures.</li>
<li><strong>Speed of testing</strong>: This is all about ensuring fast feedback loops as your team works on critical new iterations and features. Developers should be able to test as much as possible locally and through continuous integration systems before they are ready for code review.</li>
<li><strong>Troubleshooting problems</strong>: Good logging, monitoring and observability services, gives teams awareness of issues and the ability to resolve problems quickly or reproduce customer complaints in order to develop fixes.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
