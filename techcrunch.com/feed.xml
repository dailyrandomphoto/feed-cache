										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like “innovation,” machine learning and artificial intelligence are commonplace terms that provide very little context for what they actually signify. AI/ML spans dozens of different fields of research, covering all kinds of different problems and alternative and often incompatible ways to solve them.</p>
<p>One robust area of research here that has antecedents going back to the mid-20th century is what is known as stochastic optimization — decision-making under uncertainty where an entity wants to optimize for a particular objective. A classic problem is how to optimize an airline’s schedule to maximize profit. Airlines need to commit to schedules months in advance without knowing what the weather will be like or what the specific demand for a route will be (or, whether a pandemic will wipe out travel demand entirely). It’s a vibrant field, and these days, basically runs most of modern life.</p>
<p><a href="https://castlelab.princeton.edu/people/">Warren B. Powell</a> has been exploring this problem for decades as a researcher at Princeton, <a href="https://castlelab.princeton.edu/jungle/">where he has operated the Castle Lab</a>. He has researched how to bring disparate areas of stochastic optimization together under one framework that he has dubbed “<a href="https://castlelab.princeton.edu/sda/">sequential decision analytics</a>” to optimize problems where each decision in a series places constraints on future decisions. Such problems are common in areas like logistics, scheduling and other key areas of business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Castle Lab has long had industry partners, and it has raised tens of millions of dollars in grants from industry over its history. But after decades of research, Powell teamed up with his son, Daniel Powell, to spin out his collective body of research and productize it into a startup called <a href="https://www.optimaldynamics.com">Optimal Dynamics</a>. Father Powell has now retired full-time from Princeton to become Chief Analytics Officer, while son Powell became CEO.</p>
<p>The company raised $18.4 million in new funding last week from Bessemer led by Mike Droesch, who recently was promoted to partner earlier this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/bessemer-venture-partners-closes-on-3-3-billion-across-two-funds/">with the firm’s newest $3.3 billion fundraise</a>. The company now has 25 employees and is centered in New York City.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bessemer Venture Partners closes on $3.3 billion across two funds&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/bessemer-venture-partners-closes-on-3-3-billion-across-two-funds/embed/#?secret=imT5kWtDW6" data-secret="imT5kWtDW6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So what does Optimal Dynamics actually do? CEO Powell said that it’s been a long road since the company’s founding in mid-2017 when it first raised a $450,000 pre-seed round. We were “drunkenly walking in finding product-market fit,” Powell said. This is “not an easy technology to get right.”</p>
<p>What the company ultimately zoomed in on was the trucking industry, which has precisely the kind of sequential decision-making that father Powell had been working on his entire career. “Within truckload, you have a whole series of uncertain variables,” CEO Powell described. “We are the first company that can learn and plan for an uncertain future.”</p>
<p>There’s been a lot of investment in logistics and trucking from VCs in recent years as more and more investors see the potential to completely disrupt the massive and fragmented market. Yet, rather than building a whole new trucking marketplace or approaching it as a vertically-integrated solution, Optimal Dynamics decided to go with the much simpler enterprise SaaS route to offer better optimization to existing companies.</p>
<p>One early customer, which owned 120 power units, saved $4 million using the company’s software, according to Powell. That was a result of better utilization of equipment and more efficient operations. They “sold off about 20 vehicles that they didn’t need anymore due to the underlying efficiency,” he said. In addition, the company was able to replace a team of ten who used to manage trucking logistics down to one, and “they are just managing exceptions” to the normal course of business. As an example of an exception, Powell said that “a guy drove half way and then decided he wanted to quit,” leaving a load stranded. “Trying to train a computer on weird edge events [like that] is hard,” he said.</p>
<p>Better efficiency for equipment usage and then saving money on employee costs by automating their work are the two main ways Optimal Dynamics saves money for customers. Powell says most of the savings come in the former rather than the latter, since utilization is often where the most impact can be felt.</p>
<p>On the technical front, the key improvement the company has devised is how to rapidly solve the ultra-complex optimization problems that logistics companies face. The company does that through value function approximation, which is a field of study where instead of actually computing the full range of stochastic optimization solutions, the program approximates the outcomes of decisions to reduce compute time. We “take in this extraordinary amount of detail while handling it in a computationally efficient way,” Powell said. That’s where we have really “wedged ourselves as a company.”</p>
<p>Early signs of success with customers led to a $4 million seed round led by Homan Yuen of Fusion Fund, which invests in technically-sophisticated startups (i.e. the kind of startups that take decades of optimization research at Princeton to get going). Powell said that raising the round was tough, transpiring during the first weeks of the pandemic last year. One corporate fund pulled out at the last minute, and it was “chaos ensuing with everyone,” he said. This Series A process meanwhile was the opposite. “This round was totally different — closed it in 17 days from round kickoff to closure,” he said.</p>
<p>With new capital in the bank, the company is looking to expand from 25 employees to 75 this year, who will be trickling back to the company’s office in the Flatiron neighborhood of Manhattan in the coming months. Optimal Dynamics targets customers with 75 trucks or more, either fleets for rent or private fleets owned by companies like Walmart who handle their own logistics.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Marqeta has long been a fintech darling, but it's less well-known than other companies in its sector due to its infrastructure nature.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The IPO market is gearing up for a hot close to the second quarter and a hotter Q3.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s The Exchange&#8217;s takeaway from recent IPO filings <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/fast-growth-pushes-an-unprofitable-no-code-startup-into-the-public-markets-inside-monday-coms-ipo-filing/">from Monday.com (enterprise planning and communications)</a> and a number of SPAC-led combinations <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-spac-filing-shows-scooter-nomics-just-doesnt-fly/">from Bird (scooter sharing)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/industrial-automation-startup-bright-machines-hauls-in-435m-by-going-public-via-spac/">Bright Machines (AI-powered microfactories)</a> and others. Looking ahead, Squarespace (site design and hosting) will direct list this week, while Oatly (pressed grain juice) and Procore (construction tech) will price and complete traditional IPOs in the next few days.</p>
<p>Late last week, Marqeta (card issuing and payments tech) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001522540/000119312521162113/d64065ds1.htm">filed</a> as well, and just this morning, Flywire (global payments) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001580560/000119312521164506/d469729ds1a.htm">set a price</a> range for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/will-fintech-unicorn-flywires-proposed-ipo-reach-escape-velocity/">its own debut</a>. The two fintechs are our targets today, though we&#8217;ll take them in sequential posts.</p>

<hr />
<p>Public equities have seen some price declines in recent sessions, and there&#8217;s been observable multiples-compression afoot among both tech stocks and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-up-multiples-down-morning-brief-100154568.html">shares more generally</a>. But many companies are betting that it remains a fertile moment to list. A slow drift downward in the value of technology revenue, in other words, is not stopping what could be an enthusiastic exit market from here to the end of the year.</p>

Let&#8217;s narrow our focus to Marqeta, long a darling of the fintech market though less well-known than some companies in its sector due to its infrastructure nature.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with Marqeta, it powers the payment card tech behind products that you use, like Square, a key customer and driver of the unicorn&#8217;s growth. Marqeta exhibits a number of fascinating fintech characteristics (majority revenue from interchange, a rabidly competitive market) that make it very interesting to unspool.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alek Koenig spent four years at Affirm, where he was head of Credit.</p>
<p>There he saw firsthand just how powerful the alternative lending model could be. Koenig realized that it wasn’t just consumers who could benefit from the model, but businesses too.</p>
<p>So in November 2019, he founded <a href="https://www.settle.com/">Settle </a>as a way to give e-commerce and consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies access to non-dilutive capital. (Not every company wants to raise venture money). By June 2020, the startup had launched its platform, which is designed to help these businesses manage their cash flow. Over time, he recruited a previous co-worker, Shane Moriah, to serve as Settle’s CTO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And today, the company is announcing that it has raised $15 million in a Series A funding round led by Kleiner Perkins. This follows a previously unannounced $6 million seed raise led by Founders Fund in November 2020. Other investors in the company include SciFi (Affirm founder Max Levchin’s VC firm), Caffeinated Capital, WorkLife Ventures, Background Capital and AngelList Venture CEO Avlok Kohli.</p>
<p>With the pandemic leading to a massive shift toward digital and online shopping, e-commerce and CPG businesses found themselves with the challenge of keeping up with demand while trying to manage their cash flow. The main problem was the lag between accounts receivables and accounts payables.</p>
<p>“These companies suffer from the problem where there are these huge cash flow gaps from buying inventory, waiting to receive it and then turning it into revenue,” Koenig explains. “It takes quite a bit of time for these customers to actually get revenue from all those inventory purchases they need to make. What we do is make it really easy for companies to pay their vendors with extended payment terms.”</p>
<p>Settle does this by automatically syncing to a business’ accounting software and combining that with working capital products it’s developed.</p>
<p>Put simply, Settle will pay a vendor, and then brands can pay Settle back when they turn that COGS (cost of goods sold) into revenue. The startup says it also saves brands money on expensive wire fees.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153819" style="width: 354px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153819" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2153819" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Settle-screen-shot.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="344" height="258" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Settle-screen-shot.jpg 1768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Settle-screen-shot.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Settle-screen-shot.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Settle-screen-shot.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Settle-screen-shot.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Settle-screen-shot.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Settle-screen-shot.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153819" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Settle</p></div></p>
<p>“Businesses really value getting cash sooner, so they can use it in their operations,” Koenig said. “We’ve worked to reimagine the CFO suite for brands, starting with integrated financing and bill pay solutions.”</p>
<p>The concept of non-dilutive capital is not a new one with other startups tackling the space in different ways. For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/pipe-which-aims-to-be-the-nasdaq-for-revenue-raises-more-money-at-a-2b-valuation/">Pipe</a> aims to give SaaS companies a way to get their revenue upfront, by pairing them with investors on a marketplace that pays a discounted rate for the annual value of those contracts.</p>
<p>Settle is focused on the e-commerce vertical, and building a unique product for that category, Koenig says, rather than trying to build a product targeting several different industries.</p>
<p>“We don’t want to be a mediocre product for everybody,” he told TechCrunch. “But rather a phenomenal product for this vertical.”</p>
<p>Since its launch last June, Settle has seen its business jump by 1,000%, although it’s important to note that’s from a small base. Settle is currently working with more than 300 brands, including baby stroller retailer Lalo, Spiceology and men’s skincare brand Disco. So far, all of its growth has been organic.</p>

<p>“Last year when the pandemic hit, offline retail shut down and e-commerce got a big boost. But that meant that a lot of these companies were running out of orders and were out of stock on many items, so they were just kind of leaving money on the table,” Koenig said. “Once they started using us, they were able to buy more inventory, so we actually help them make more profit, and not just create more sales.”</p>
<p>His reasoning for that last statement is that by giving these businesses the ability to purchase items in bulk, they could get cheaper price per unit costs as well as cheaper shipping costs.</p>
<p>The company is planning to use its new capital in part to grow its team of 20, as well as raise more debt so that it can continue lending money to businesses.</p>
<p>Kleiner Perkins&#8217; <a href="https://www.kleinerperkins.com/people/monica-desai/">Monica Desai Weiss </a>said her firm believes that Koenig and CTO Moriah’s expertise in underwriting, capital markets and e-commerce give the pair “a rare skill set that’s unique to their market.”</p>
<p>She&#8217;s also drawn to the company&#8217;s embedded approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whereas most lending businesses are fairly transactional and opportunistic, Settle becomes deeply embedded in the way their merchants forecast and grow,” she told TechCrunch. “That approach has demonstrated inherent virality and their timing is perfect &#8212; the past year has changed consumer behaviors permanently and also produced massive opportunities for global entrepreneurship via ecommerce. In that way, we see the umbrella of e-commerce expanding massively in the coming years, and we believe Settle will be key to enabling that shift.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The influence of a founder on their company&#8217;s culture cannot be overstated. Everything from their views on the product and business to how they think about people affects how their company&#8217;s employees will behave, and since behavior in turn informs culture, the consequences of a founder&#8217;s early decisions can be far-reaching.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s not very surprising that Expensify has its own take on almost everything it does when you consider what its founder and CEO David Barrett learned early in his life: &#8220;Basically everyone is wrong about basically everything.&#8221; As we saw in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/">part 1 of this EC-1</a>, this led him to the revelation that it&#8217;s easier to figure things out for yourself than finding advice that applies to you. Eventually, these insights — and the adventurous P2P hacker attitude he nurtured alongside his colleagues and Travis Kalanick at Red Swoosh — would inform how he would go about shaping Expensify.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Expensify&#8217;s culture can&#8217;t be separated from its hiring and growth processes — by joining the company, employees self-select into a group that isn&#8217;t likely to get hung up about trade-offs.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>It&#8217;s striking how Expensify has managed to maintain this character 13 years later, even <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005265/en">on the threshold of an IPO</a>. How did this happen? During a series of interviews in February and early March, we found the answer is tied to the level of thought and effort this expense management business puts into its culture.</p>
<p>You see, the people at Expensify are prepared to invent their own playbook, develop it and, if needed, rewrite it completely. Its HR policies and strategy are tailored to find people who would have fun building an expense management product. It has a unique growth and recognition scheme to offset the drawbacks of a flat organizational structure. It&#8217;s even got a &#8220;Senate&#8221; that vets all major decisions. No kidding.</p>
<p>All this, and more, has ultimately helped Expensify reach more than 10 million users and achieve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/three-new-100m-arr-club-members-and-a-call-for-the-next-generation-of-growth-stage-startups/">$100 million in annual revenue</a> with just 130 employees. Let&#8217;s take a closer look at how Expensify makes it happen.</p>
<h2>&#8220;We want the fewest people necessary to get the job done&#8221;</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s clear Expensify&#8217;s unusually high employee-to-revenue ratio is intentional: &#8220;We want the fewest people necessary to get the job done,&#8221; Barrett says. But how do you actually achieve it? How do you hire and keep people who can deliver such results? Barrett had to learn how the hard way.</p>
<p>Expensify&#8217;s first team was based in San Francisco and comprised Barrett&#8217;s old Red Swoosh and Akamai colleagues, who joined a few months after Akamai fired him. A small team was enough to get started, but it was much more difficult to hire additional people. Barrett is eager to clarify the Valley is not really the best place to recruit talent: &#8220;Sure, Silicon Valley has a ton of really awesome people, but all of them have jobs!,&#8221; he says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Discovery has ordered a new reality show, to air in 2022, which will be an eight episode competition series where competitors will vie for a chance to take a trip to the International Space Station on commercial Axiom Space mission. The winner will be a crew member for AX-2, the second mission from Axiom to transport a fully private group of space travellers to the ISS following AX-1, which is set to take place as early as next January.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/axiom-space-and-nasa-detail-first-fully-private-human-launch-to-the-space-station-set-for-january-2022/">Axiom and NASA went into detail about AX-1</a> earlier this month in a press briefing, explaining that the mission will span eight days and take four paying customers to the orbital science station for a brief stay, with an overall price tag of $1.69 million being paid to NASA for the privilege (which excludes the value of some in-kind supply transport services that Axiom is providing).</p>

<p>Axiom will be using a SpaceX Falcon 9 and Crew Dragon spacecraft to transport its private astronaut customers to the ISS for AX-1. The initial press materials for the &#8216;Who Wants to Be an Astronaut?&#8217; series doesn&#8217;t specify which vehicle will be used for the AX-2 mission that will play host to the winner, but it&#8217;s reasonable to expect it&#8217;ll be SpaceX for that one as well, given that it&#8217;s the only fully private trip provider active so far.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how Discovery describes the actual selection process that will take place during the reality series:</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]hat does it take to win a coveted seat to space? The process will be grueling and only a select few will make it through the rigorous selection process. The series will follow each of the contestants competing for the opportunity in a variety of extreme challenges designed to test them on the attributes real astronauts need most, and as they undergo the training necessary to qualify for space flight and life on board the space station.</p>
<p>In the end, one lucky candidate, deemed to have the right stuff by a panel of expert judges, will punch their ticket for an adventure few have ever taken. The series will chronicle each pivotal moment along the way &#8211; from lift off to re-entry and the return home.</p></blockquote>
<p>The competition is open to &#8220;everyday people,&#8221; and there&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.discovery.com/shows/who-wants-to-be-an-astronaut?fbclid=IwAR1CBy18VL_jeMnjMYxv-EjPzDTWDRDskIQM3P6IfMko687rHyKDVDhCb78">application form with the requirement of a short, 30 to 60 second accompanying video</a> if you want to throw your hat in the ring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sidewalk Labs, Alphabet’s urban innovation organization, has announced the launch of Pebble, a vehicle sensor that’s designed to help manage parking in cities by providing real time parking and curb availability data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how it works: small spherical sensors are stuck to the ground on parking spaces to note the absence or presence of a vehicle. Then solar-powered gateway hardware, which can be strapped easily to street poles, uses IoT to connect the sensor to the cloud through the cellular network. The data is then viewed and analyzed by real estate developers, parking operators or municipal agencies via a dashboard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pebble doesn’t use cameras or collect identifying information about a person or vehicle, and is touting a “privacy preserving” approach. Sidewalk Labs has been relatively quiet since it </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/sidewalk-labs-shuts-down-toronto-project/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shut down its $1.3 billion tech-enabled real estate project in Toronto amid privacy concerns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a year ago. Rather than try to tackle large urban infrastructure projects, the company appears to be focusing its efforts on smaller scale solutions that can be used by private and public entities to improve cities. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October last year, Sidewalk Labs unveiled </span><a href="https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/news/sidewalk-labs-unveils-delve-tool-to-enhance-urban-development/587065/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delve</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a design tool that uses machine learning to help developers, architects and planners to create optimal design plans for urban projects. Just a few weeks ago, Sidewalk Labs spinout Replica – an AI-powered data platform that uses machine learning to generate “synthetic” populations whose behaviors can be tracked in order to simulate plausible scenarios in the real world – </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/replica-secures-41-million-in-series-b-funding-to-change-how-cities-plan-and-operate-301273415.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">secured $41 million in Series B funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninawolpow/2021/04/21/sidewalk-labs-spinout-replica-raises-41-million-series-b/?sh=5f7dff8828b0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City’s Metropolitan Transit Authority relied on Replica</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the pandemic to adapt its public transit schedule. Now, as the country begins to open up in earnest, those with a stake in parking and mobility, especially cities looking to unroll sustainable transport recovery plans, might consider using tools like Pebble’s to manage parking supplies effectively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between </span><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/8/3079/pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">9% and 56% of traffic, and all the pollution that comes with it, is caused by people who are cruising for parking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Pebble says its real-time parking availability can be integrated into navigation apps, like Google Maps, through an API to help users spend less time circling the block.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Real-time parking information can also alert would-be drivers when spaces are limited before they even leave home, leading them to use alternative travel modes, such as park-and-ride transit or ferries,” wrote Sidewalk Labs’ senior creative technologist, Nick Jonas, in a </span><a href="https://medium.com/sidewalk-talk/dbb79b570fda"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announcing the launch. “For example, a </span><a href="http://www.accessmagazine.org/fall-2007/smarter-parking-transit-stations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">smart parking program at a BART park-and-ride station</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reduced driving by a monthly average of nearly 10 miles per person — and even shortened commutes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While cities could certainly benefit from a tool that could monitor curb and municipal parking, the effort involved could be enormous. Imagine a city like New York widely placing individual sensors to mark street parking spaces! It would be quite the job, not to mention difficult to define static parking spaces. Pebble says it is already working with pilot customers to manage tens of thousands of parking spaces, but it did not reply to a request for more information about whether or not any of those pilot customers are cities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the blog post announcing the Pebble launch, Sidewalk Labs covers a range of potential use cases. City agencies that apply Pebble hardware to curbs can also gain insights on how to help businesses </span><a href="https://www.planning.org/planning/2021/spring/poor-curb-management-is-costing-cities-billions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">generate revenue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by assigning relevant curb space for things like outdoor dining and applying flexible programs like dynamic pricing, which adjusts on-street parking rates based on supply and demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pebble also says real estate developers can use its insights to create shared parking zones or build less parking if they can prove to cities that sufficient parking already exists to meet demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it seems more efficient parking would make for people relying further on cars, Sidewalk Labs says the opposite is true. Sidewalk Labs&#8217; Senior Creative Technologist Nick Jonas says that Pebble can help &#8220;reduce driving and new parking in several ways,&#8221; including by helping real estate developers collect the data needed to provide compelling counterarguments for city ordinances requiring certain amounts of parking spots be built for new residential and office spaces.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Pebble can help [&#8230;] prove that parking demand can be met through existing spaces or shared parking zones, reducing the need to build new spaces,&#8221; Jonas said. And in terms of traffic generated by drivers searching for spots, Pebble can help by &#8220;facilitating direct navigation to a parking space,&#8221; which can make a dent in the &#8220;30 percent of traffic congestion that occurs from drivers circling for a parking space.&#8221;</p>
<p>On top of those infrastructure benefits, Jonas notes that Pebble can help with economic and convenience incentives that encourage commuters to opt for other methods of transit instead of driving.</p>
<p>&#8220;By facilitating dynamic pricing programs, Pebble can help cities “right-price” parking and encourage alternative travel modes,&#8221; he noted, adding that based on early data from <a href="http://www.accessmagazine.org/fall-2007/smarter-parking-transit-stations/">BART pilots</a> in the Bay Area, Pebble data including &#8220;direct navigation and real-time space availability data can also encourage people to use park-and-ride transit rather than driving all the way into an office.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much of the operating thesis upon which Sidewalks Labs is based is that cities would be able to run much more efficiently, effectively and safely if they can just address the existing data gaps and blindspots about how people actually live in, and navigate them. Pebble looks like it could be a key ingredient in help fill in the blanks for parking and garage usage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lamborghini will pay homage to combustion engines with the introduction of two new V12 luxury sports cars this year before it makes a push into electrification as the company tries to balance its storied gas-powered past with a hybrid, and eventually electric, future.</p>
<p>The company laid out Tuesday its electrification roadmap, a plan that will see its full lineup of vehicles become hybrids by the end of 2024 and the launch of an all-electric Lamborghini in the second half of the decade.</p>
<p>Lamborghini said it plans to invest 1.5 billion euros ($1.82 million) over four years to make the transition to hybrid vehicles, the largest allocation in its history. The Volkswagen-owned brand it will launch its first hybrid series production car in 2023 and then hybridize the rest of the lineup the following year. During this second phase of its roadmap, Lamborghini will focus on developing new technologies and the application of lightweight carbon fiber materials — both of which will be crucial in compensating for weight due to electrification, the company said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The aim, during this phase, is to reduce the product emissions 50% by 2025, the company said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lamborghini&#8217;s electrification plan is a newly-plotted course, necessary in the context of a radically-changing world, where we want to make our contribution by continuing to reduce environmental impact through concrete projects,&#8221; Lamborghini President and CEO Stephan Winkelmann said in a statement. He emphasized that this plan, which begins with a celebration of the combustion engine, will take the company towards a &#8220;more sustainable future while always remaining faithful to our DNA.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Italian brand has already moved towards hybrids with the Sián and its roofless cousin the Sián Roadster. These vehicles, which were unveiled in 2019 and 2020 respectively, are mid-engine sports cars that combine a naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V12 engine, a supercapcitor instead of a lithium-ion battery that operates its powertrain and a 48-volt electric motor.</p>
<p>Together, this system produces 819 horsepower that propels the vehicle from zero to 62 mph in 2.8 seconds and a top speed of 218 mph. Lamborghini is producing 63 Sián and 19 Sián Roadsters. All of these have been sold, which suggests there is demand for a hybridized version of the classic Lamborghini.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">AI is driving the paradigm shift that is the software industry&#8217;s transition to data-centric programming from writing logical statements. Data is now oxygen. The more training data a company gathers, the brighter will its AI-powered products burn.</p>
<p>Why is Tesla so far ahead with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS)? Because no one else has collected as much information — it has data on more than <a href="https://electrek.co/2018/11/16/tesla-fleet-10-billion-electric-miles/">ten billion driven miles</a>, helping it pull ahead of competition like Waymo, which has only about 20 million miles. But any company that is considering using machine learning (ML) cannot overlook one technical choice: supervised or unsupervised learning.</p>
<p>There is a fundamental difference between the two. For unsupervised learning, the process is fairly straightforward: The acquired data is directly fed to the models, and if all goes well, it will identify patterns.</p>
<p>Elon Musk compares unsupervised learning to the human brain, which gets raw data from the six senses and makes sense of it. He recently <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1387901003664699392">shared</a> that making unsupervised learning work for ADAS is a major challenge that hasn’t been solved yet.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">A major part of real-world AI has to be solved to make unsupervised, generalized full self-driving work, as the entire road system is designed for biological neural nets with optical imagers</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Supervised learning is currently the most practical approach for most ML challenges. O’Reilly&#8217;s 2021 report on AI Adoption in the Enterprise <a href="https://get.oreilly.com/ind_ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise-2021_Request.html">found</a> that 82% of surveyed companies use supervised learning, while only 58% use unsupervised learning. Gartner <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/understand-3-key-types-of-machine-learning/">predicts</a> that through 2022, supervised learning will remain favored by enterprises, arguing that &#8220;most of the current economic value gained from ML is based on supervised learning use cases&#8221;.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://vise.com/">Vise</a> today announced a $65 million Series C financing round led by Ribbit Capital, with participation from existing investors including Sequoia.</p>
<p>The startup launched on the Disrupt Startup Battlefield stage in 2019 and has since raised upwards of $125 million.</p>
<p>Vise uses an AI-powered platform to give independent financial advisors the same level of data as advisories with their own analyst departments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The goal, cofounder and CEO Samir Vasavada has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/meet-vise-ai-the-startup-reimagining-portfolio-management/">told me in the past</a>, is to give indie financial advisors the time and energy to cultivate their client relationships, rather than doing the hard math of building out portfolios. Vise does a lot of heavy lifting where the latter is concerned, freeing up advisors to focus on the former.</p>
<p>The premise behind Vise is to use tech to empower humans, &#8216;as opposed to replacing them&#8217; by automating an industry that&#8217;s very old. The end goal is to &#8216;enable financial freedom for everyone.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to build a platform that will service hundreds of millions, billions, of dollars in assets in an automated way,&#8221; said Vasavada. &#8220;There is a lot of technical infrastructure that can be built, and systems around trading and around go-to-market so we can attack this industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since raising the company&#8217;s Series B, assets under management have ballooned 4x to $250 million and client accounts have more than doubled, says Vise.</p>

<p>Vise has been scaling its tech, team and the clientele for the past couple years, but that hit a new gear upon the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/fintech-startup-vise-brings-on-andrew-fong-formerly-dropbox-as-cto/">appointment of Andrew Fong as CTO</a>. Fong hails from Dropbox, where he served as VP of Infrastructure Engineering. He actually started out as a site reliability engineer at Dropbox back in 2012, climbing the ranks to engineering director, and then senior director of engineering with a focus on infrastructure before becoming a vice president.</p>
<p>Fong&#8217;s main goal is scaling up the engineering department, something that continues to be a focus for the company. Vasavada explained that expanding a product and a company is all about the foundation.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s round fits inside the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/ai-fintech-products-are-operating-at-scale-and-investor-interest-is-maturing/">generally bullish market for fintech investments</a> that TechCrunch has observed globally.</p>
<p><em>Of note: Vise&#8217;s Vasavada and Sequoia&#8217;s Shaun Maguire will join us tomorrow afternoon on Extra Crunch Live, where we&#8217;ll discuss how they came together for the financing, what made Vise stand out to Sequoia, and how they&#8217;re finding success in the world of fintech. Maguire and Vasavada will also hear live pitches from startups in the audience and give their feedback.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A company that has built a new approach to the business of extended warranties &#8212; providing a cost-effective and efficient way for retailers or brands to offer them; and an easy way for consumers to buy and file claims against them &#8212; is today announcing a huge round of funding as it looks to take its business to the next level.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.extend.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Extend</a> &#8212; which aims, in the words of co-founder and CEO Woody Levin, to become the &#8220;Apple Care&#8221; for everything that&#8217;s not an actual Apple product &#8212; has raised $260 million, a Series C that values the company at over $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>It plans to use the funding to continue expanding its business. That will include a gradual move into covering more than just extended warranties that kick in after manufacturer or retailer warranties run out; much wider geographical expansion; and more activity to prove out its place at the e-commerce table (if the leap to a $1.6 billion valuation in 27 months of operation isn&#8217;t testament enough&#8230;).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Same day delivery, buy-now-pay-later, and other tools: we are now all part of that core e-commerce toolset,&#8221; Levin said in an interview. &#8220;We have been selling since 2019 but the market is just waking up to this. We’re focused on being transparent and fair with warranties. It&#8217;s something they haven’t seen before.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company says that in 2020, its first full year of business, it sold 300,000 protection plans, but it is now on track to sell more than 3 million protection plans this year. Customers include Peloton, iRobot, Harman/JBL, Backcountry, Balsam Hill, BlendJet, RealTruck, Traeger Grills and &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of others, along with a growing number of retailers, too. (Peloton likely makes for some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-apologizes-agrees-to-treadmill-recall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interesting stories</a>&#8230;)</p>
<p>The funding, a Series C, is coming from an interesting mix of financial and very strategic investors. It is being led by SoftBank, in the latest investment out of its Vision Fund 2. (Levin said he was pitched directly by Mashayoshi Son: &#8220;He immediately understood what we were doing.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Existing backers Meritech Capital Partners, PayPal Ventures and GreatPoint Ventures, and new investors insurance giant Nationwide, Tomales Bay Capital, Launchpad Capital, 10X Capital and 40North, also participated.</p>
<p>PayPal is a notable name here: warranties are often sold at the point of sale, and so it makes sense that a payment giant is interested in bringing more tools and conversion levers into the mix. (And given the connection between warranties and insurance, it&#8217;s also interesting to remember that Stripe, one of PayPal&#8217;s big competitors, in March received a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/stripe-closes-600m-round-at-a-95b-valuation/">huge funding round</a> with insurance giants participating.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, recall that SoftBank also is a part-owner of T-Mobile (which sells a lot of gadgets) and an investor in, well, a lot. This gives Extend a possible door into a huge range of places where it might integrate and offer extended warranties and other kinds of protection plans.</p>
<p>The round was oversubscribed and comes just eight months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/extend-banks-40m-to-bring-a-new-approach-to-the-old-game-of-extended-warranties/">Extend announced a Series B of $40 million</a>. You could say that Extend very much extended its own conversations with VCs with this latest round.</p>
<p>Extended warranties and protection plans have long been a point of contention for consumers: they sound like peace of mind in theory, but they often feel like frustrating upsell, with the tacit message being that somehow the company accepts that its products won&#8217;t last. At the same time, they can be time-consuming, if not downright disappointing, to actually claim against.</p>
<p>Extend is all too aware of the pitfalls of the legacy model and has set out to combat it with more flexible offerings (providing tiers of warranty time with prices attached), clear policies that can be managed in one place for all of your Extend-provided coverage, and quick interactions &#8212; by way of a digital assistant called Kaley &#8212; to get claims against your policies if the need arises. In the background, it also leverages machine learning and risk analysis to make sure it&#8217;s not betting the house on its plans.</p>
<p>This has all played in its favor for now. Retailers are getting less interested in handling warranties in-house, and are turning to outside providers to do the work. Extend saw revenues rise 40x in its first full year of business (2020) &#8212; a time when many have been spending more hours at home and possibly more willing to follow through on customer support interactions when they do have problems. The startup says it expects revenues to go up by 400% this year.</p>
<p>Its customers continue to be primarily those who sell directly to consumers, although a few new deals with retailers speaks to some opportunities for a much wider opportunity for those who are looking for more services to offer shoppers around the basic proposition of buying goods, to better compete against the wider range of services that a marketplace like Amazon might offer for those who want them.</p>
<p>“As more consumers shop online, merchants are keen to provide customers with a greater peace of mind when making purchases. We believe Extend is reinventing the extended warranty industry through its leading platform, API solutions, and consumer-first approach,” said Nagraj Kashyap, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers. “We are pleased to work with Woody and the Extend team to support their ambition of providing a better way for consumers to protect the products they love.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Without good data, it&#8217;s impossible to build an accurate predictive machine learning model. <a href="https://www.explorium.ai/">Explorium</a>, a company that has been building a solution over the last several years to help data pros find the best data for a given model, announced a $75 million Series C today &#8212; just 10 months after announcing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/explorium-reels-in-31m-series-b-as-data-discovery-platform-grows/">$31 million Series B</a>.</p>
<p>Insight Partners led today&#8217;s investment with participation from existing investors Zeev Ventures, Emerge, F2 Venture Capital, 01 Advisors and Dynamic Loop Capital. The company reports it has now raised a total of $127 million. George Mathew, managing partner at Insight, and former president and COO at Alteryx, will be joining the board, giving the company someone with solid operator experience to help guide them into the next phase.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Maor Shlomo, says that in spite of how horrible COVID has been from a human perspective, it has been a business accelerator for his company and he saw revenue quadruple last year (although he didn&#8217;t share specific numbers beyond that). &#8220;It&#8217;s related to the nature of our business. We&#8217;re helping enterprises and data practitioners find new data sources that can help them solve business challenges,&#8221; Sholmo explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says that during the pandemic, a lot of companies had to find new data sources because the old data wasn&#8217;t especially helpful for predictive models. That meant that customers required new sources to give them visibility into the shifts and movements in the market to help them adjust and make decisions during pandemic. &#8220;And given that&#8217;s basically what our platform does in its essence, we&#8217;ve seen a lot of growth [over the past year],&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>With the revenue growth the company has been experiencing, it has been adding employees at rapid clip. When we spoke to Explorium last July, the company had 87 people. Today that number has grown to 130 with plans to get to 200 perhaps by the end of 2021 or early 2022, depending on how the business continues to grow.</p>
<p>The company has offices in Tel Aviv and San Mateo, California with plans to open a new office in New York City whenever it&#8217;s possible to do so. While Shlomo wants a flexible workplace, he&#8217;s not going fully remote with plans to allow people to work two days from home and three in the office as local rules allow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Email marketing is decades old, but it’s a category that has surprising life in it. Multiple generations of email marketing companies have come through and sustained success, from Constant Contact to Mailchimp. These brands often become household names — after all, you probably have hundreds of emails with their logos attached to the email footer.</p>
<p>Klaviyo is not as much of a household name right now, but it is absolutely on its way to the paramount of the next-generation of email marketing startups.</p>
<p>The company announced today that it has raised $320 million in new capital in a Series D round, led by Sands Capital, a private and public equity investor that has, among many areas of focus, <a href="https://www.sandscapital.com/ecommerce-a-play-in-multiple-acts/">a thesis in ecommerce</a>. That brings the company’s total fundraising to $675 million, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/marketing-automation-platform-klaviyo-scores-200m-series-c-on-4-15b-valuation/">following a $200 million Series C round from just six months ago</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Klaviyo was the subject of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1/">one of our most recent EC-1 analyses</a>, where we looked at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-origin/">the company’s history of growth</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-business/">how it is rebuilding what’s been dubbed “owned marketing”</a> (i.e. marketing channels that a business owns like email rather than channels owned by platforms like Facebook and Instagram), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-marketing/">how marketers are using Klaviyo post-COVID</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-lessons/">some startup growth lessons from the business</a> as well.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VGAuasvUJ4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1/">The Klaviyo EC-1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Klaviyo EC-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1/embed/#?secret=VGAuasvUJ4" data-secret="VGAuasvUJ4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There is nearly 10,000 words of analysis packed into that whole story, so read that or save it for the weekend if you really want to get into the nitty-gritty of Klaviyo’s story and how it is fitting in to the wider email marketing space. But suffice it to say that the company’s secret sauce is perhaps obvious: it’s a marketing company that’s pretty damn good at marketing. That’s allowed it to pull in gargantuan numbers of new customers as many retailers and brick-and-mortar businesses fled online in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In its press statement, the company wrote that “Klaviyo’s customer base doubled over the past 12 months and the company now serves over 70,000 paying customers, a more than 110% increase from 2019 — ranging from small businesses to Fortune 500 companies, in more than 120 countries.” It also said that it plans to increase its head count from 800 to 1,300 people this year.</p>
<p>The company is headquartered in Boston, and Klaviyo’s all-but decacorn valuation is a major win for the Boston enterprise ecosystem, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/what-pandemic-inside-bostons-scorching-vc-summer/">which continues to percolate on high</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As cloud-native apps continue to become increasingly central to how organizations operate, a startup founded by the creators of a popular open-source tool to manage authorization for cloud-native application environments is announcing some funding to expand its efforts at commercializing the opportunity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.styra.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Styra</a>, the startup behind <a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Policy Agent</a>, has picked up $40 million in a Series B round of funding led by Battery Ventures. Also participating are previous backers A. Capital, Unusual Ventures and Accel; and new backers CapitalOne Ventures, Citi Ventures and Cisco Investments. Styra has disclosed CapitalOne is also one of its customers, along with e-commerce site Zalando and the European Patent Office.</p>
<p>Styra is sitting on the classic opportunity of open source technology: scale and demand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>OPA &#8212; which can be used across Kubernetes, containerized and other environments &#8212; now has racked up some 75 million downloads and is adding some 1 million downloads weekly, with Netflix, Capital One, Atlassian and Pinterest among those that are using OPA for internal authorization purposes. The fact that OPA is open source is also important:</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Developers are at the top of the food chain right now,&#8221; CEO Bill Mann said in an interview, &#8220;They choose which technology on which to build the framework, and they want what satisfies their requirements, and that is open source. It&#8217;s a foundational change: if it isn’t open source it won’t pass the test.&#8221;</p>
<p>But while some of those adopting OPA have hefty engineering teams of their own to customize how OPA is used, the sheer number of downloads (and potential active users stemming from that) speak to the opportunity for a company to build tools to help manage that and customize it for specific use cases in cases where those wanting to use OPA may lack the resources (or appetite) to build and scale custom implementations themselves.</p>
<p>As with many of the enterprise startups getting funded at the moment, Styra has proven itself in particular over the last year, with the switch to remote work, workloads being managed across a number of environments, and the ever-persistent need for better security around what people can and should not be using. Authorization is a particularly acute issue when considering the many access points that need to be monitored: as networks continue to grow across multiple hubs and applications, having a single authorization tool for the whole stack becomes even more important.</p>
<p>Styra said that some of the funding will be used to continue evolving its product, specifically by creating better and more efficient ways to apply authorization policies by way of code; and by bringing in more partners to expand the scope of what can be covered by its technology.</p>
<p>“We are extremely impressed with the Styra team and the progress they’ve made in this dynamic market to date,” said Dharmesh Thakker, a general partner at Battery Ventures. “Everyone who is moving to cloud, and adopting containerized applications, needs Styra for authorization—and in the light of today’s new, remote-first work environment, every enterprise is now moving to the cloud.” Thakker is joining the board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Email marketing has been with us for decades, but today it has been refined to a science and an art form.</p>
<p>If you’re an early-stage founder, it is one of the best ways to build and grow your direct relationship with your customer. You know how fickle the platforms can be. You can’t afford to mess this up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the absence of a real baseball league, it is perhaps not surprising that a simulated one should grow popular during the troubled year 2020. But even so, the absurdist horror and minimalist aesthetic of <em>Blaseball</em> seem an unlikely success. The text-based fantasy fantasy league has attracted hundreds of thousands of players and now $3 million in funding to build up the game and go mobile.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with <em>Blaseball</em>, feel free to go check it out now and sign up — it&#8217;s free. You&#8217;ll probably get a better idea of what the game is from 30 seconds of browsing than the next couple paragraphs.</p>
<p>For those of you who&#8217;d rather read, however, <em>Blaseball</em> is a web-based fictional baseball-esque league where players can bet in-game currency on the outcomes. But this is where things get weird. The teams aren&#8217;t the Mariners or the Mets but the Moist Talkers and the Worms; players have names like Chorby Soul and Peanutiel Duffy; their stats include things like allergies, pregame rituals, and an inventory of RPG-like items.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Likewise, games — told through simple text summaries of the action like you might see in the corner of a sports site — involve hits, balls, and stealing, but also incineration, shaming, and secret bases. &#8220;Weather&#8221; might involve spontaneous blood transfusions between players, or birds that interfere with play.</p>
<p>In short, it&#8217;s totally ridiculous, utterly unpredictable, and very funny. This totally unique concoction of fantasy leagues, baseball satire, and cosmic horror has accrued a dedicated yet routinely puzzled fanbase over its 19 week-long seasons. And like so many hits, this one came as something of a shock to its creators.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153303" style="width: 849px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/feed.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153303" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2153303 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/feed.png" alt="Activity feed from the game Blaseball showing various absurd and normal events like hits and incinerations." width="839" height="873" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/feed.png 839w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/feed.png?resize=144,150 144w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/feed.png?resize=288,300 288w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/feed.png?resize=768,799 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/feed.png?resize=654,680 654w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/feed.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/feed.png?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 839px) 100vw, 839px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2153303" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> The Game Band</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re as surprised as you are,&#8221; said Sam Rosenthal, founder and CEO of The Game Band, which developed (and is developing) the game. &#8220;<em>Blaseball</em> was an experimental side project for the studio — we were in the middle of a pandemic, publishers were in a spending freeze, it was a scary time. We wanted to make a game that brings people together in this really isolating time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea for it came from banter at a real baseball game, where Rosenthal and a friend speculated about a league where the rules were &#8220;different and more chaotic.&#8221; Of course the rules of real-life baseball are continually being revised, but so far there haven&#8217;t been any resurrections of players incinerated by rogue umpires, free runs for home teams, or shrink rays.</p>
<p>While the resulting game-like product bears some resemblance to baseball, betting, and fantasy leagues, it&#8217;s much too weird and random to really be considered the same thing. That&#8217;s led to some friction as players who expect a more traditional experience lose coins on a game decided by, say, a bird pecking their team&#8217;s star hitter inside an enormous peanut shell, or a guaranteed home run because the batter ate magma.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153309" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tigers-blaseball.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153309" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2153309" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tigers-blaseball.png" alt="" width="1024" height="517" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tigers-blaseball.png 1313w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tigers-blaseball.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tigers-blaseball.png?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tigers-blaseball.png?resize=768,388 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tigers-blaseball.png?resize=680,343 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tigers-blaseball.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2153309" class="wp-caption-text">The Hades Tigers&#8230; so hot right now. The roster shows a team&#8217;s current and permanent attributes, while players can work together to create change by voting weekly.</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes we have to remind the fans that this is a horror game,&#8221; Rosenthal admitted. The gameplay, as players discover in time, consists more in cooperation and guiding the league itself than in precision oddsmaking. &#8220;This is not a game about individual success but collective success. The mechanics of the game reward organization, fans banding together with other fans of their team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using those coins to buy votes to determine how the most-idolized players are treated at the end of a season, for instance, could have huge repercussions on the next season. Ultimately the players are really participating in a sort of long-term alternative-reality game rather than a zany baseball sim, as the ominous announcements and events drive home now and again.</p>
<p>Next to the outcome of a match and the news that a player was walked to second base, you might learn that &#8220;Reality flickered in the Feedback&#8221; or see disembodied dialogue about the league or disordered cosmos.</p>
<p>It can be disconcerting and one may rightly wonder whether the creators have a narrative or goal in mind, or whether they&#8217;re just winging it and being weird for weirdness&#8217;s sake. I guessed the latter, but Rosenthal set me straight.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153304" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameband.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153304" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2153304" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameband.jpg" alt="The Game Band logo on a flag behind several instruments." width="1024" height="634" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameband.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameband.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameband.jpg?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameband.jpg?resize=768,476 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameband.jpg?resize=680,421 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameband.jpg?resize=1536,952 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gameband.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2153304" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> The Game Band</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;It is going somewhere,&#8221; he assured me. &#8220;There are a lot of plans, we have a ton of lore written. We literally have a writers&#8217; room every day, usually about 3-4 hours long. But we need to stay flexible because there&#8217;s two other creators: the simulation, since we don&#8217;t know what will happen in the games themselves, and the fans. There are things we don&#8217;t know they&#8217;ll latch onto, emergent narratives like the reincarnation of Jaylen Hotdogs. We&#8217;re always learning, and we give ourselves a lot of room to backtrack or change things quickly if needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>What was never clear even to the developers, however, was whether the game would live long enough to see those plans come to fruition. <em>Blaseball</em>, being a side project built during strange days, was never envisioned as a big money maker. For a small game developer to have a runaway success on their hands but little ability to monetize that success, the stresses of continuing development and support can overtake the benefits of popularity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we didn&#8217;t really set it up from the get go to be profitable, we were just sort of slowly losing money,&#8221; said Rosenthal. &#8220;Fortunately our community has been really supportive through Patreon and sponsorships. But ultimately we wanted to make the game better and sustainable, and we wanted to pay our team what they deserve.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153312" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blaseball-mobile.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153312" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2153312 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blaseball-mobile.jpg" alt="Illustration showing how 51 percent of Blaseball players are on mobile." width="400" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blaseball-mobile.jpg 400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blaseball-mobile.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blaseball-mobile.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blaseball-mobile.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blaseball-mobile.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blaseball-mobile.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blaseball-mobile.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blaseball-mobile.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2153312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> The Game Band</p></div></p>
<p>The $3M seed round keeps the lights on, to begin with, but also lets The Game Band staff up, so the writers don&#8217;t have to break up a meeting early because one of them is doubling as product support and the site is breaking. More importantly, however, the team plans to make a native mobile app. More than half of <em>Blaseball&#8217;s</em> players (that is, the real ones, not Baby Triumphant and Wyatt Mason IV) are on mobile and Rosenthal admitted the mobile experience is &#8220;not great.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company comes from a mobile development background, he noted, so they know what they&#8217;re doing, but saw the web as the easiest platform to deploy on during the pandemic. Now they want to get mobile up and running, since the live, constantly shifting nature of the game fits well with the kind of updates sports and fantasy aficionados tend to sign up for. Who wouldn&#8217;t want to know right away that their favorite team has entered Party Time, or that their idolized player found a new piece of armor, or that a new non-physical law has been ratified?</p>
<p>Rosenthal said they resisted seeking funding to begin with due to a desire for independence, but was enthused about their choice of investor, Makers Fund, saying they actually understand <em>Blaseball</em> and have been partners rather than parents when it comes to moving the operation towards making money.</p>
<p>&#8220;The know we can&#8217;t just copy monetization from another game and put it in <em>Blaseball</em>, that would ruin the experience right away. They have an amazing network of people in the games industry, and at the end of the day they&#8217;re not prescriptive,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>(They also gamely did not object to a line in the press release by the fictional Commissioner asserting that &#8220;Blaseball has acquired Makers Fund,&#8221; which says a lot.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very cognizant that there are ways that free games can monetize that are detrimental to the community,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;So it will always be free to play and it will never be pay to win. Like, the Crabs are never going to run away with it because they&#8217;re the richest team. When we think about monetization we think about how it can benefit the community as a whole, not individuals.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime the league slouches on, morphing from week to week in a live dialogue between players and developers. Don&#8217;t expect it go get any less weird, because the creators know that constant disorientation is part of the game&#8217;s charm.</p>
<p>Amazingly, Rosenthal even managed to suggest that Blaseball was, in the parlance of game design tropes, the <em>Dark Souls</em> of baseball simulators — &#8220;it [<em>Dark Souls</em>] gives you so little, it asks you to interpret and put a thesis together, to go linger on forums and talk with others about it. We wanted to create that kind of experience, and see how people would interpret this sort of weird, unknowable entity.&#8221;</p>
<p>They certainly got the weird and unknowable part right. <a href="http://blaseball.com/">You can try Blaseball out for yourself here</a>.</p>
<p>(This story originally included the figure of $3.4M for the round — this was an unforced error on my part and has been corrected to $3M.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nearly every social media experience today is built on the same premise: Humans identify with individuality. Users create a profile, upload an avatar picture, write a short biography and can then scream into the ether to other users on behalf of their digitally sculpted selves.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/najjmahal?lang=en">Naj Austin</a>, the founder behind Ethel’s Club, built <a href="https://www.somewheregood.com/">Somewhere Good</a> last year on an entirely different premise. She believes that humans crave collectivism more than individualism in a post-COVID world. So she’s in the process of reinventing how social media looks and feels, and with community and people of color at the core.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/ethels-club-somewhere-good/">Less than a year after launching</a>, Somewhere Good announced this morning that it has raised $3.75 million in a seed round led by True Ventures. Existing investors Dream Machine, Debut Capital and Canvas Ventures participated in the round, along with new investors, including Slauson &amp; Co., NextView Ventures and 2PM Inc. Notable angels include Ellen Pao of Project Include and actor Gabrielle Union. The money will be used for continued product innovation and expanding its nine-person team.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I&#8217;m thinking about scale and trying to ensure that the most people have access to a safe and authentic community on their phones, and that means it has to be venture-backed in terms of being able to accomplish that in a way that also feels delightful,” Austin said. “To build a platform that allows for us to have consultants who are thinking about accessibility, safety and privacy, we have to pay them.”</p>
<h2><strong>Extracting the buzz from Community</strong></h2>
<p>Somewhere Good is a mobile app that connects people and then fosters that connection in a solely group setting, across a diversity of interests &#8212; such as a birdwatching collective for people of color or an anti-capitalist book club.</p>
<p>The platform arose from Austin’s other company, subscription-based community for people of color, Ethel’s Club. Members kept asking her for different things: a cooking club, a therapist recommendation, a wellness group. She said she became a de facto Google for members, and that Ethel’s Club began to “frankenstein” into different groups and needs.</p>
<p>“Which is, you know, not scalable,” she said. “We thought ‘Why don&#8217;t we build a technology layer that communities like Ethel’s club need?’&#8221; Somewhere Good is now a social search platform for people to join, chat and discover new communities.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2152845" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2152845" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2152845" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-Screens-Transparent.png" alt="" width="1024" height="701" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-Screens-Transparent.png 1900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-Screens-Transparent.png?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-Screens-Transparent.png?resize=300,205 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-Screens-Transparent.png?resize=768,525 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-Screens-Transparent.png?resize=680,465 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-Screens-Transparent.png?resize=1536,1051 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-Screens-Transparent.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2152845" class="wp-caption-text">Somewhere Good</p></div></p>
<p>Users can visit and drop into different “worlds” or communities that fit their interests, she explained. Once a user has entered a world, they can view and post content and have real-time audio conversations with others. People are encouraged to cite content in order to promote content and nuance.</p>
<p>“If I add an Angela Davis article in ‘Abolition World’ I can also see that you added it to ‘Black Feminists’ world and so on,” Austin explained. “This is likely to encourage you to look into the Black Feminists world and further your discovery.”</p>
<p>Austin stressed that no one person or host controls the experience, instead putting focus on the community as a whole to create a world that is living and breathing. It’s her response to the rise of community in every startup right now.</p>
<p>“Communities become a buzzword that everyone&#8217;s trying to tap into their platforms now,” she said. “Things I know about community and what I&#8217;ve learned over the last year-and-a-half is that you need intimacy, you need nuance, you need collaboration and you need this magical collision of people who have shared identities.”</p>
<p>How Somewhere Good actually executes this mission will rely heavily on its product, which is still in its infancy. Right now, Austin shared that they have made intentional choices to remove what she sees as the “empty noise” of other social media platforms. At this point, there are no advertisements on Somewhere Good, no user profiles, no friending, no following and no feed.</p>
<p>Notably, this differentiation is also one of Somewhere Good’s biggest challenges.</p>
<p>“When building something new, it potentially feels like we are taking it away from the users,” she said. “For example, taking profiles away may feel like it is a less than, versus that it is additive in the long run because you no longer have to have a perfect profile and worry about users.”</p>

<p>The startup is testing out user reaction to these sorts of fundamental structural changes over the next couple of weeks. Somewhere Good also launched <a href="https://workingnotworking.com/projects/246091-somewhere-good-shift-fellowship">SHIFT</a>, a $50,000 year-long fellowship program, to invite people to join the team and create a feedback loop on product, team and community, as well as explore some of the ideas that Austin is experimenting with today.</p>
<p>“We still aren&#8217;t going to be able to make the most perfect platform for everyone on Earth to start, and we know that, but in doing so we&#8217;ve created a fellowship to help inform us, and kind of heads down and deploy that occurs when you&#8217;re building a product.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Entering the Clubhouse</h2>
<p>The app was meant to go into beta in January 2020 but that has now been pushed to the second half of 2021 so the team could continue to tweak the product. The beta will be invite-only to start, including 50 to 75 communities and their members that Somewhere Good has vetted beforehand and the some 5,000 people on its waitlist.</p>
<p>Somewhere Good’s monetization plan is also in the early innings, and the founder says it will focus on that more when the app reaches scale.</p>
<p>Clubhouse, an app valued at $1 billion that is similarly focused on community and spontaneity, could be seen as competition to Somewhere Good. Clubhouse has an exploration page that helps users discover different clubs, and it also built out a creator network to bring high-quality, recurring content to its platform.</p>
<p>“It’s a solid company,” Austin said. “But I think they’ve struggled with really big questions and I think that there are solutions and answers out there that Clubhouse has chosen not to embed to their platform, and that was simply a choice that they made.&#8221;</p>
<p>For now, she doesn’t seem fazed.</p>
<p>“I feel like most of the platforms that exist are taking what already exists and kind of putting a veneer on it,” she said. “There’s nothing wrong with repainting, but then it’s just repainting.” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/startups-dont-repaint-reinvent/">Reinventing feels like an outsized opportunity.</a></p>
<p>“I believe if we get Somewhere Good right, it can replace many of the apps on your phone,” she said. “When you think about it, where you receive the most value, outside of the calculator app, is with your friends and the people you know and trust.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The events of the past year and a half could well mark the beginning of a sea change for the world of restaurant robotics. The essential industrial was slammed amid the pandemic, leaving many companies searching for a decent automated option that could both keep things running and potentially avoid transmission vectors.</p>
<p>Seattle-based Picnic is the latest to benefit from that interest, announcing a $16.3 raise this week. Led by Thursday Ventures &#8212; with participation from Creative Ventures, Flying Fish Partners and Vulcan Capital – the Series A includes <a href="https://thespoon.tech/picnic-raises-3m-for-its-robot-powered-pizza-assembly/">a $3 million bridge filed last fall</a>.</p>

<p>The company is one of a handful looking to automate the pizza-making process. It’s an obvious target for this technology, given both the food’s popularity and the relative uniformity, versus other meals. XRobotics debuted its own system late-late year, while Zume – possibly the best-known of the bunch – has long since exited the category.</p>
<p>Picnic, meanwhile, says interest in its own pizza system has ramped up of late, announcing a number of industry partnerships, including Orion Land Mark, Ethan Stowell Restaurants, National Service Cooperative  and Baseline Hardware Financing. The plan is to roll the technology out to both restaurants and other public gathering spaces, including schools, stadiums and hospitals. The company says this latest round will go toward headcount and expanding operations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last September we concluded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/apple-27-inch-imac-review/">our 27-inch iMac review thusly</a>,</p>
<p>&#8220;The big open question mark here is what the future looks like for the iMac — and how long we’ll have to wait to see it. That is, of course, the perennial question for hardware upgrades, but it’s exacerbated by the knowledge of imminent ARM-based systems and rumors surrounding a redesign.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was, as these things go, less than a full-throated endorsement of Apple’s latest all-in-one. We certainly weren’t alone in the assessment. It was a weird liminal zone for the computer &#8212; and Macs in general. At WWDC in June, the company had taken the unusual step of announcing its move from Intel to its own in-house chips without any hardware to show for it.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Yeah, Apple’s M1 MacBook Pro is powerful, but it’s the battery life that will blow you away&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/embed/#?secret=YekLv8DI9F" data-secret="YekLv8DI9F" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The reasoning was sound. The company was looking to help developers get out ahead of launch. It was going to be a heavy lift &#8212; the first time the Mac line had seen such a seismic shift since 2005. Fifteen years is a long time, and that’s a lot of legacy software to contend with. While the move wouldn’t outright break every piece of MacOS software, it was certainly in devs&#8217; best interest to optimize for the new hardware, by way of the Mac Mini developer kit the company was offering. The full transition to the new silicon, Apple noted, would take two years.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2072199" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2072199" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2072199" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple-m1-chip.jpg" alt="Apple M1 chip" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple-m1-chip.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple-m1-chip.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple-m1-chip.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple-m1-chip.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple-m1-chip.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple-m1-chip.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple-m1-chip.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple-m1-chip.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2072199" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>In November, the company debuted the first M1 Macs: a new Mac Mini, MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/">We spent several thousand words reviewing all three systems</a>, but ultimately Matthew put it pretty succinctly, “Apple&#8217;s new M1-powered MacBook shows impressive performance gains that make Intel&#8217;s chips obsolete overnight.”</p>
<p>Which is, you know, a rough look for an all-in-one launched a mere two months before. That goes double for a system that hadn’t seen a fundamental redesign in some time. Two months after launch, the 2020 iMac was already starting to feel old.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153067" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153067" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2153067" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Recording-2021-05-17-at-10.25.32-AM.2021-05-17-10_31_28.gif" alt="" width="800" height="56" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153067" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Fast-forward to last month, when Apple announced the new iMac amid a flurry of hardware news. This, it seems, was the iMac we’d been waiting for. The new system brought the most fundamental redesign in a decade, with an ultra-compact new form factor, improvements to audio and video (a big sticking point in the remote work era) and, perhaps most importantly, the new M1 chip.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153037" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153037" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2153037" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9220.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9220.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9220.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9220.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9220.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9220.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9220.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9220.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9220.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153037" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The biggest thing the 2020 system has going for it is that it’s, well, big. Having used a 27-inch iMac for much of my day-to-day work throughout the pandemic, I’m honestly surprised by how much I miss those extra three inches. I’d initially assumed that added bit of screen real estate was going to be fairly negligible once you’ve passed the 20-inch threshold, but turns out, like anything else, it takes some getting used to.</p>
<p>There’s an immediate upside, too, of course. I was genuinely surprised by how compact the new design is, compared to past iMacs. In spite of adding 2.5 inches to the display size over the 21.5-inch, the new system is an extremely thin 11.5 mm (or 14.7 when the stand is factored in).</p>
<p>The overarching theme for the system is “cute.” This is not a word I often apply to technology. Words like “cool” or “sleek” are generally go-tos here. But I’m at a loss for a better word to describe what feels like a true spiritual successor to the iMac G3. The colorful line of all-in-ones ushered in Steve Jobs’ second triumphant stint with the company, arriving at the tail end of a decade in a year personified by the Volkswagen’s New Beetle.</p>
<p>Of course, the design language has evolved dramatically in the nearly quarter-century since the first iMac arrived, owing to changing styles and, of course, ever-reducing component sizes. The flat-panel design arrived early this century and settled into the most recent design around 2012. Sure, there have been plenty of updates since then, but nine years is a long time for an Apple design to go without a major refresh.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153030" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153030" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2153030" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9198.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9198.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9198.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9198.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9198.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9198.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9198.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9198.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9198.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153030" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>It finds the company moving from what was ostensibly an industrial design to something more warm and welcoming. The color is the thing here. It was the most frequently discussed question around the TechCrunch (virtual) offices. Everyone wants to know which we’d be getting. Mine landed with a yellow hue — something nice, light and spring. Honestly, it’s more of a gold than I expected, with a bright and shiny glean to it. I will advise that anyone who plans to buy one of these systems visit an Apple Store if there’s one nearby if you’re comfortable doing so. It’s really the sort of thing that really benefits from being seen in person, if possible.</p>
<p>That goes double here — since, boy howdy, is Apple on theme. The keyboard matches, the cables match, the desktop wallpaper matches, the adorable packaging matches (it&#8217;s a fun unboxing experience, as those things go) and even little touches like the OS buttons match. The latter two, obviously, are something you’re able to futz around with a bit. But the system and even the keyboard is a bit more of a commitment, really. After all, this is probably the kind of thing you’re going to want to hold onto for a number of years, so lighting and interior decorating are both worth considering before you make your decision. I recognize this is an odd thing to think about when talking about a desktop computer, but, well, it’s the iMac.</p>
<p>The company is offering <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/20/apple-website-lets-you-visualize-airtag-and-redesigned-imac-in-ar/">an AR iOS app</a> for seeing how the new iMac will fit in with its surroundings, which is a clever &#8212; and probably useful &#8212; touch. The system also weighs in at less than 10 pounds. This is admittedly not something I’ve given much thought to with desktops. “Portable” is a weird way to describe the form factor, but particularly compared to other desktop systems, it kind of fits? At the very least, it’s not entirely out of the realm of possibility that you can occasionally move the thing from room to room, as needed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153031" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153031" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2153031" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9200.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9200.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9200.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9200.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9200.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9200.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9200.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9200.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9200.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153031" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>In broad strokes, the front of the system is similar to that of the past iMacs, though the bottom panel and its large Apple logo have been swapped out of a streak of color. The pane of glass lies flush with the screen and a not insignificant white bezel that frames it. The bezel, combined with the panel, comprises a not insignificant amount of real estate below the display, likely owing to the placement of components and the downward-firing speaker grille that runs the full length of the computer’s bottom. Up top is the newly upgraded 1080p HD Webcam — the first on any Mac.</p>
<p>As with past iMacs, the system sits atop a stand. In the case of the yellow model, at least, the stand is a notably darker hue than the front of the system. There’s a VESA mount option configurable upon purchase, but the stand itself is very much not designed to be user replaceable. The hinge’s action is smooth. I found myself pivoting the system up and down semi-regularly to better frame myself in the webcam, and did so with ease.</p>

<p>There’s a 3.5 mm headphone jack on the left — hello, old friend. I much prefer this placement to the rear of the device, which requires the cable to wrap around the side or bottom.</p>

<p>A hole inside the stand is designed for cables to be run through — specifically power. Magsafe — er, the magnetic charging connector — really popped up unexpectedly here. It’s less about the quick release that you would find on the old MacBooks and more about the ease of simply snapping the cable in place. I suspect that people are less likely to trip over a desktop cable that never (or at least rarely) moves.</p>

<p>The big update to the power cable situation is, of course, the addition of ethernet to the brick. The brick is quite a bit larger &#8212; especially if you’re accustomed to dealing with MacBooks. But likely it will be out of the way. What it does bring is the removal of some additional clutter on the back of the system and helps keep the computer itself that much thinner. For most people in most cases that can access a hardwired connection, it’s a nice addition.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153033" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153033" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2153033" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9205.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9205.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9205.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9205.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9205.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9205.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9205.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9205.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9205.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153033" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The port situation, on the other hand, is decidedly less so. I like ports. I have lots of stuff that need plugging in to the back of the computer and ports are probably the best case to plug &#8217;em. The entry-level system has two Thunderbolt/USB ports. You can upgrade that to four. Definitely do this. Seriously. You’re not going to regret it.</p>
<p>I’m someone who keeps the wireless keyboard and trackpad/mouse plugged in most of the time. I know, it kind of defeats the purpose, but worrying about charging accessories is not another stress I need in my life right now. So that’s two ports right there. I also have some AV accessories and suddenly, boom, you’re out of ports.</p>
<p>The $1,299 version of the system ships with the Magic Keyboard. It’s pretty much the same as other Magic Keyboards of recent vintage. It’s not for everyone, I know. Those who love mechanical keyboards will find something to be desired in the tactility, but it’s a step up from MacBooks and I’ve certainly grown accustomed to using it. There’s no number pad on the base model, but the coloring coordinates with the Mac.</p>

<p>With the $1,699 model, you get upgraded to a version with Touch ID &#8212; something that’s been a long time coming on the desktop system. Like other Macs (and older iPhones), the fingerprint scanning login is nearly instantaneous. As has been the case for a while, if you’re an Apple Watch wearer, that will log you in as well, but the addition of Touch ID on the desktop is great. The base version comes with the Magic Mouse. It’s $50 to upgrade to a Trackpad and $129 for a combo. I’ve grown fond of the Trackpad, so that’s where I’d probably land here (I doubt many people will have a need for both).</p>

<p>As ever, I understand the many reasons the company has pushed its line to USB-C &#8212; it’s especially obvious when you see how much room has been freed up on the rear of the device. But man, I miss having those legacy USB-A ports on the 2020 iMac. Meantime, you might want to toss a couple of A to C USB adapters into your basket before check out. That’s kind of just life with Apple, though. Courage, and all that.</p>
<p>I do wonder if this means the company is positioning the M1 line for the return of an iMac Pro. Stranger things have happened. For now, of course, the company is more focused on the Mac Pro at the much higher end.</p>

<p>As expected, the new M1 chip breathes new life into the system. Take our Geekbench 5 scores: 1,720 Single and 7,606 multi-core. That blows the average of 1,200 and 6,400 for the 21.5-inch system out of the water. Things understandably take a dip with the Rosetta (Intel) version at 1,230 and 5,601, respectively, but it’s still solid performance running through a translation layer. But it also points to why Apple was so proactive about getting developers on-board with the new silicon. On the whole, the gains are in-line with the the other new M1 systems we&#8217;ve seen &#8212; which is to say a nice, healthy leap forward into the future of the Mac.</p>

On the whole, I found that most of my day to day apps were fine. There are outliers, of course. Spotify and Audacity are right there.

<p>Spotify is probably a question of how many resources the Apple Music competitor wants to put into a new version, while Audacity is likely more of an issue of how many resources the organization has at its disposal. The further you move away from big names like Microsoft and Adobe, the more of a crapshoot it is. But there are some support issues with bigger names still, as well. For instance, I upgraded to the Apple silicon version of Zoom, but downgraded when I discovered it doesn’t work with the Intel-only version of the Canon EOS webcam software I use.</p>

<p>I recognize this is an extremely specific issue, but, then, workflows are extremely specific. As M1 systems become the mainstream of Macs, however, developers ultimately won’t really have much of a choice. Support Apple Silicon or risk becoming obsolete. Growing pains are essentially unavoidable with this sort of shift, but the results really speak for themselves. Apple Silicon is the future of Macs and it’s a fast-booting, smooth-moving future, indeed.</p>
<p>I can practically see the Apple team shouting at me when I mention the external mics and cameras I use to record video for work. After all, the new iMac sees the biggest upgrade to these things in some time. The best time for a new microphone system and the first 1080p HD camera on a Mac would have been last year, as the pandemic was beginning to transform the way we work and meet. The second best time, of course, is now.</p>
<p>Apple did tout an improved camera system on last year’s MacBook, but that was more to do with the image signal processing on the chips. That goes a ways toward improving things like white balance, but a truly meaningful improvement to imaging generally also requires new camera hardware. Take a look at the below images.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153069" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153069" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2153069" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lBdCd1CD.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lBdCd1CD.jpeg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lBdCd1CD.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lBdCd1CD.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lBdCd1CD.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lBdCd1CD.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lBdCd1CD.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153069" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>That’s the 2020 iMac on the left and new M1 iMac on the right. Forgetting (hopefully) for a moment my droopy, partially paralyzed face (2020, am I right?), the image is night and day here &#8212; and not just because I’m slightly better put together all of these pandemic months later. The change that comes from upgrading from 720p to 1080p is just immediately apparent in term of image quality. I anticipate Apple upgrading its systems across the board, because teleconferencing is just life now.</p>

<p>Along with camera, the mic system got a nice upgrade. I’ve re-recorded the same audio that I did back in November on the old system. The three microphone array is crisper and much clearer, eliminating much of the background noise hiss. The six-speaker audio system is an improvement, as well. I found it worked well with music and movies, but could be less clear for teleconferencing, depending on the quality of the other attendee&#8217;s mic. The audio could be a bit bass-heavy for my taste.</p>
<p>On the whole, for most people, day to day, I think the audio and video upgrades are plenty. If you use your system for the occasional Zoom calls and some music listening, you should be fine. Depending on what you&#8217;re looking to get out of these things, though, a decent external camera, mic or speaker is never a bad investment.</p>
<p>The new iMac represents a nice leap forward for the desktop all-in-one in some key fundamental ways, breathing new life into one of the company&#8217;s most popular systems that&#8217;s long been in need need of a makeover. I miss some ports and now feel spoiled having had an SD reader on the 2020 model. I would also love to see a 27-inch version of the system on the market at some point (iMac Pro reboot, anyone?). On the whole the system is less targeted at creative pros than other models have been in the past &#8212; though the M1 and its on-board ML are still capable of impressive audio, video and still image editing.</p>
<p>But a cute, color coordinated design and some long overdue upgrades to teleconferencing elements aside, Apple Silicon is rightfully taking centerstage here as it did with the MacBooks and Mac Mini before it. The pricing on the systems was a source of some confusion around these parts when first announced. The very base-level version runs $1,299, while the tip-top level goes up to $2,628 with all the bells and whistles.</p>
<p>At the most basic level, there are three main configurations:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1,299 gets you an 8-core CPU and 7-Core GPU, 8GB RAM, 256GB storage, two USB ports, standard Magic Keyboard</li>
<li>$1,499 upgrades the GPU to eight cores, adds ethernet and two USB ports and brings Touch ID to the keyboard</li>
<li>$1,699 upgrades storage to 512GB (Our configuration as tested)</li>
</ul>
<p>The systems are available for pre-order now and will start arriving in customers&#8217; homes this Friday.</p>
