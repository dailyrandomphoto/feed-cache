										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.airwallex.com/">Airwallex</a>, the fintech company for cross-border businesses, announced today it has added $100 million more to its Series D round, bumping its valuation up to $2.6 billion. The extension was led by Greenoaks, with participation from Grok Ventures and returning investors Skip Capital and ANZi Ventures.</p>
<p>Co-founder and chief executive officer Jack Zhang told TechCrunch that the new funding will be used for Airwallex&#8217;s United States launch in the second quarter of this year, expand its payment coverage to new regions like the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe and Latin America, and add more products, including physical cards.</p>
<p>This latest extension brings Airwallex’s Series D round to $300 million, and total equity raised so far to $500 million.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Y Combinator is slowly growing its stake in education companies, as the sector <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/a-first-look-at-courseras-s-1-filing/">balloons</a> with newfound demand from remote learners. In its latest batch, the famed accelerator had its highest number of edtech startups yet: 14 companies from around the world, working on everything from teacher monetization to homework apps to ways to train software engineers in an affordable fashion.</p>
<p>While Y Combinator isn’t the definitive source on what success in early-stage startups looks like &#8212; it quite literally has a post-mortem dinner after Demo Day to celebrate failure &#8212; it does serve well in providing an illustrative glance of how entrepreneurs are thinking about certain sectors in a given moment in time. Managing director Michael Seibel said that the number of startups in each sector isn’t a Y Combinator choice, but is in line with the concentration of applicants in each sector. In other words, YC is backing more edtech companies because more edtech companies are applying to the accelerator.</p>
<p>One dynamic worth pointing out here is that, of the 14 edtech startups in this batch, only two have a woman founder, UPchieve and Degrees of Freedom. Y Combinator provided aggregate batch diversity, stating that 19% of companies in W21 include a woman founder, and 10% of founders in the entire batch are women. It&#8217;s a slight uptick from the last batch, but not an immense jump.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>With this context, I will use the current edtech cohort within the batch to sketch out one version of the future of education in the eyes of this specific demographic of early-stage founders.</p>
<h2>Internationalization is a factor</h2>
<p>The current YC batch has 50% of its startups based outside of the United States, a first for the accelerator. The growing internationalization of Y Combinator might help partially explain the uptick in edtech companies. The growth of companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/mary-meekers-bond-invests-in-indian-online-learning-giant-byjus/">India’s Byju’s</a>, one of the most valuable edtech companies in the world, shows how consumer spending in education companies internationally is impressive, and it&#8217;s clear that early-stage edtech startups are taking note.</p>
<p>Only two of Y Combinator’s 14 edtech investments are from the United States, with the highest concentrations in South America and India.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.manara.tech/"><strong>Manara: </strong></a>A marketplace to connect Middle East talent to tech jobs.</li>
<li><a href="https://prendea.com/"><strong>Prendea: </strong></a>Peru-based startup that offers live, online after-school classes for Spanish-speaking kids.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.avionschool.com/"><strong>Avion School:</strong></a> The education startup teaches Filipino students to be remote software engineers around the world.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.poliglota.org/">Poliglota:</a> </strong>A language school for Latin America.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>The future is consumer over B2B </strong></h2>
<p>The vast majority of startups in the current edtech batch charge consumers, instead of institutions or enterprises, for services. In some ways, edtech startups going for consumers instead of institutions isn’t new: it’s always been easier to convince a parent instead of a public school to pay for a service simply due to red tape. Consumers are an easier way to reach a venture-demanded scale, and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/4-edtech-ceos-peer-into-the-industrys-future/"> that’s always been a truth of edtech. </a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="about:blank"><strong>Kidato:</strong> </a>Targeting the middle class of Africa, Kidato is an online school for K-12 students. The startup has a focus on quality and affordability.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.codingal.com/"><strong>Codingal: </strong></a>An afterschool program for Indian kids to learn coding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, it’s noteworthy that we’re not seeing too much experimentation in business model here, despite the pandemic and that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/edtech-startups-find-demand-from-an-unlikely-customer-public-schools/">some schools have begun to invest</a> more in edtech services.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9ZcPqPnJlM"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/edtech-startups-find-demand-from-an-unlikely-customer-public-schools/">Edtech startups find demand from an unlikely customer: Public schools</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Edtech startups find demand from an unlikely customer: Public schools&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/edtech-startups-find-demand-from-an-unlikely-customer-public-schools/embed/#?secret=9ZcPqPnJlM" data-secret="9ZcPqPnJlM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>A potential hurdle that these companies might face is access. If it costs to use your service, you can only educate so many people from specific income groups. As a result, income share agreements, or ISAs, were especially present in this batch, a set-up that allows a student to hold off on paying for an education until they are employed. Upon employment, said student has to give a percentage of their income to the company until their debt is paid. While the model is controversial, it was popularized by YC graduate Lambda School and continues to be one way to make the upfront cost of school more popular.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://pragmaticleaders.io/">Pragmatic Leaders</a>: </strong>The startup wants to build a more cost-effective MBA, which is free until the student is hired post-grad.</li>
<li><a href="https://awari.com.br/"><strong>Awari:</strong></a> The São Paulo-based startup uses income share agreements to help students in Brazil afford a tech education. Courses range from data analytics to product UX and growth marketing.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.acadpal.com/"><strong>Acadpal</strong></a>, mentioned later, is an outlier here selling to schools in India. Before I move on to our next section, I do want to shout out two startups that I think embody the most ambitious bets in business model:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://upchieve.org/"><strong>UPchieve:</strong></a> A nonprofit for low-income high school students to access free, 24/7 virtual tutoring.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.degreesoffreedom.org/freedomyear">Degrees of Freedom:</a> </strong>The startup wants to offer low-cost higher education experience that is flexible and community-oriented. It <a href="https://www.degreesoffreedom.org/freedomyear">costs about $9,000 to attend.</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Zoom University lives on</strong></h2>
<p>Despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/to-win-post-pandemic-edtech-needs-to-start-thinking-big/">the struggles of &#8220;Zoom University,&#8221;</a> this batch of edtech founders clearly believe that the future of instruction is through online courses. This was perhaps the most overwhelming thread tying together all the companies in the sector: a bet on one of these companies is a bet that remote education will become status quo.</p>
<p>As previous sections show, a number of startups are offering online coding platforms for specific demographics. Now, I always have my inbox filled with different &#8220;Lambda School for X&#8221; startups, so seeing a variety of these startups pop up yet again isn’t exactly exciting. However, the pandemic did show how much community and network enhances a school experience. If these online schools can pull off strong partnerships with employers and alumni, I think there’s a huge opportunity here.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.turingcollege.com/"><strong>Turing College:</strong> </a>The Lithuania-based online data science school uses income-share agreements to bring affordability to education.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.coderhouse.com/"><strong>Coderhouse:</strong></a> An Argentina-based startup that wants to build a live, online tech education for the Spanish-speaking populations of the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, where there’s big opportunity there’s always a lot of competition. These startups will have to find a way to differentiate themselves, like the one below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.unschool.in/">Unschool:</a> </strong>The startup wants to tie higher education to employment outcomes, so it’s building a platform to increase completion rates in India with a guarantee of internships.</li>
</ul>
<p>There were bets on the infrastructure of how courses get done online, from course creation to completion.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://pensil.in"><strong>Pensil: </strong></a>A platform that helps YouTube teachers in India monetize their courses.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.acadpal.com"><strong>Acadpal:</strong></a> A learning app for teachers in India to create and share homework, and for students to complete and discuss assignments.</li>
<li><a href="http://questbook.app"><strong>CreatorOS &#8211; Questbook: </strong></a>This company wants to make it easier for teachers to teach online courses. It gives professionals the tools they need to launch a course within minutes, with a focus on a bite-sized end-product.</li>
</ul>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="e0vBzUxNbz"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/edtech-zoom-university/">Tired of &#8216;Zoom University&#8217;? So is edtech</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tired of &#8216;Zoom University&#8217;? So is edtech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/edtech-zoom-university/embed/#?secret=e0vBzUxNbz" data-secret="e0vBzUxNbz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2><strong>In conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>To end, the edtech startups in the current YC batch are more complementary to each other than competitive. For a homework platform like Acadpal to succeed, it would be good news for a company like Codingal, which helps bring afterschool learning online, to get funding as well. For Unschool, which ties higher-ed to employment, a company like Degrees of Freedom could be a key partner or integration for students from a low-income background.</p>
<p>Edtech is growing &#8212; and fast &#8212; so the fragmentation of different plays is somewhat expected. And while this batch’s hard work starts now, it’s illuminating to understand where the earliest entrepreneurs out there are seeing promise.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If you don't have time to skim through 300+ startups, we've aggregated some of the companies that really managed to catch our eye. This is part one of two, covering our favorites from the companies that launched in the first half of the day.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s that time again! Today is Demo Day for Y Combinator&#8217;s latest accelerator batch — its largest to date, with more than <em>300</em> teams getting a minute each to pitch their companies to an audience of investors.</p>
<p>This is the third time YC has held its Demo Day via a Zoom livestream and the second time the entire program was entirely virtual. YC president Geoff Ralston outlined their thinking for this latest batch — and how/why they&#8217;ve expanded the program to over 300 companies — in a <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/scaling-yc/">post this morning.</a></p>
<p>Want to see <em>all</em> of the companies? YC has a catalog of the entire <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/?batch=W21">Winter 2021 batch here</a> (minus those that haven&#8217;t publicly launched), filterable by industry and region.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have time to skim through it all, we&#8217;ve aggregated some of the companies that really managed to catch our eye. This is part one of two, covering our favorites from the companies that launched in the first half of the day.</p>
<p>As Alex Wilhelm put it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/our-11-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-s20-demo-day-part-i/">last time we did one of these</a>, &#8220;we’re not investors, so we’re not pretending to sort the unicorns from the goats.&#8221; But we do spend a lot of time talking with startups, hearing pitches and telling their stories; if you&#8217;re curious about which companies stood out, read on.</p>
<h2>Prospa</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.getprospa.com">Prospa</a> is building a neobank for small companies in Nigeria. The startup charges customers $7 per month and has reached $50,000 in monthly recurring revenue. That’s some pretty darn good traction. We found Prospa notable because Nigeria&#8217;s economy and population are rapidly growing, neobanks have succeeded in a number of markets thus far, and the company’s clear business model and early traction stood out.</p>
<p>And Prospa isn’t targeting a small market. It said during its presentation that there are 37 million so-called “microbusinesses” in its target country. That’s a lot of scale to grow into, and it’s really nice to hear from a neobank that isn’t going to merely pray that interchange revenues will eventually stack to the moon.</p>

<h2>Blushh</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2129269" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129269" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2129269 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blushh.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="411" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blushh.jpg 2394w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blushh.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blushh.jpg?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blushh.jpg?resize=768,465 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blushh.jpg?resize=680,411 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blushh.jpg?resize=1536,929 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blushh.jpg?resize=2048,1239 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blushh.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129269" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Blushh</p></div></p>
<p><a href="https://www.letsblushh.com/en">Blushh</a>, built by a team of ex-Google, Amazon, Harvard and BCG professionals, is creating a directory of short, sensual audio stories for women in Asia. The startup believes that there is a massive unmet need for adult content created for women, instead of men, signing up 100 paying subscribers within its first month on the market.</p>
<p>During their pitch, co-founder Soy Hwang said Blushh wants to do for sexual wellness what &#8220;Spotify and Audible did for music and audio books.&#8221; This startup stands out because it is taking on an untapped market ridden with stigma and lack of innovation. It’s a risk on several levels, and considering the fact that many venture capitalists today still have a &#8220;vice&#8221; clause that prevents them from investing in sex tech, it will be key to see how Blushh funds itself to keep growing.</p>

<h2>BrioHR</h2>
<p>TechCrunch caught up with <a href="https://briohr.com/">BrioHR</a> a few weeks ago when the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/briohr-raises-1-3m-ahead-of-y-combinators-demo-day/">announced that it had closed a $1.3 million round</a>. During its presentation, the company announced that it had reached $13,000 in monthly recurring revenue (MRR), or $156,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR).</p>
<p>The company is building human resources software for companies in Southeast Asia, a market it considers fraught with old software and outdated business processes. The company is doing two things. First, building software to help manage and pay workers. The latter part of its work requires lots of localization, so it’s rolling out more slowly than the rest of its software.</p>
<p>If Southeast Asia is as fertile ground for modern HR software as the United States has been shown to be, BrioHR could find more than enough room to grow. I’m excited to see how far the company can scale its ARR with the round that we recently covered.</p>

<h2>Charge Running</h2>
<p>Strava walked so <a href="https://www.chargerunning.com">Charge Running</a> could, well, run. The startup, founded by a former Navy SEAL, app connoisseur and kinesiology specialist, is an app that offers live virtual running classes. The consumer play is being framed by the team as a “Peloton for running” with motivation and social engagement during the run.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week a select group of 20 employees and guests gathered at an event space on the San Francisco Bay, and, while looking out at the Bay Bridge, dined on a selection of choice elk sausages, Wagyu meatloaf and lamb burgers &#8212; all of which were grown from a petri dish.</p>
<p>The dinner was a coming out party for <a href="https://www.orbillion.com/about">Orbillion Bio</a>, a new startup pitching today in Y Combinator&#8217;s latest demo day, that&#8217;s looking to take lab-grown meats from the supermarket to high-end, bespoke butcher shops.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on pork, chicken and beef, Orbillion is going after so-called heritage meats &#8212; the aforementioned elk, lamb and Wagyu beef to start.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By focusing on more expensive-end products, Orbillion doesn&#8217;t have as much pressure to slash costs as dramatically as other companies in the cellular meat market, the thinking goes.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s more to the technology than its bougie beef, elite elk and luscious lamb meat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Orbillion uses a unique accelerated development process producing thousands of tiny tissue samples, constantly iterating to find the best tissue and media combinations,&#8221; according to Holly Jacobus, whose firm, Joyance Partners, is an early investor in Orbillion. &#8220;This is much less expensive and more efficient than traditional methods and will enable them to respond quickly to the impressive demand they’re already experiencing.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Startups making meat alternatives are gaining traction worldwide&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/06/startups-making-meat-alternatives-are-gaining-traction-worldwide/embed/#?secret=c06VsFpK6a" data-secret="c06VsFpK6a" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company runs its multiple cell lines through a system of small bioreactors. Orbillion couples that with a high throughput screening and machine learning software system to build out a database of optimized tissue and media combinations. &#8220;The key to making lab grown meat work scalably is choosing the right cells cultured in the most efficient way possible,&#8221; Jacobus wrote.</p>
<p>Orbillion is co-founded by a deeply technical and highly experienced team of executives that&#8217;s led by Patricia Bubner, a former researcher at the German pharmaceutical giant Boehringer Ingelheim. Joining Bubner is Gabriel Levesque-Tremblay, a former director of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, who was a post-doc at Berkeley with Bubner and serves as the company&#8217;s chief technology officer. Rounding out the senior leadership is Samet Yildirim, the chief operating officer and a veteran executive of Boehringer Ingelheim (he actually served as Bubner&#8217;s boss).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129347" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129347" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2129347" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founder-Black-and-White.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founder-Black-and-White.jpg 5250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founder-Black-and-White.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founder-Black-and-White.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founder-Black-and-White.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founder-Black-and-White.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founder-Black-and-White.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founder-Black-and-White.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founder-Black-and-White.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129347" class="wp-caption-text">Orbillion Bio co-founders Gabriel Levesque-Tremblay, CTO; Patricia Bubner, CEO; and Samet Yildirim, COO. Image Credit: Orbillion Bio</p></div></p>
<p>For Bubner, the focus on heritage meats is as much a function of her background growing up in rural Austria as it is about economics. A longtime, self-described foodie and a nerd, Bubner went into chemistry because she ultimately wanted to apply science to the food business. And she wants Orbillion to make not just meat, but the most delicious meats.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an aim that fits with how many other companies have approached the market when they&#8217;re looking to commercialize a novel technology. Higher-end products, or products with unique flavor profiles that are unique to the production technologies available, are more likely to be commercially viable sooner than those competing with commodity products. Why focus on angus beef when you can focus on a much more delicious breed of animal?</p>
<p>For Bubner, it&#8217;s not just about making a pork replacement, it&#8217;s about making the tastiest pork replacement.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I’m just fascinated and can see the future in us being able to further change the way we produce food to be more efficient,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We’re at this inflection point. I’m a nerd, I’m a foodie, and I really wanted to use my skills to make a change. I wanted to be part of that group of people that can really have an impact on the way we eat. For me there’s no doubt that a large percentage of our food will be from alternative proteins &#8212; plant based, fermentation and lab-grown meat.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Joining Boehringer Ingelheim was a way for Bubner to become grounded in the world of big bioprocessing. It was preparation for her foray into lab-grown meat, she said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are a product company. Our goal is to make the most flavorful steaks. Our first product will not be whole cuts of steak. The first product is going to be a Wagyu beef product that we plan on putting out in 2023,&#8221; Bubner said. &#8220;It’s a product that’s going to be based on more of a minced product. Think Wagyu sashimi.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>To get to market, Bubner sees the need not just for a new approach to cultivating choice meats, but a new way of growing other inputs as well, from the tissue scaffolding needed to make larger cuts that resemble traditional cuts of meat, or the fats that will need to be combined with the meat cells to give flavor.</p>
<p>That means there are still opportunities for companies like Future Fields, Matrix Meats and Turtle Tree Scientific to provide inputs that are integrated into the final, branded product.</p>
<p>Bubner&#8217;s also thinking about the supply chain beyond her immediate potential partners in the manufacturing process. &#8220;Part of my family were farmers and construction workers and the others were civil engineers and architects. I hold farmers in high respect&#8230; and think the people who grow the food and breed the animals don&#8217;t get recognition for the work that they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>She envisions working in concert with farmers and breeders in a kind of licensing arrangement, potentially, where the owners of the animals that produce the cell lines can share in the rewards of their popularization and wider commercial production.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bill Gates wants Western countries to eat &#8216;synthetic meat&#8217;; Meatable has raised $47 million to make it&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/bill-gates-wants-western-countries-to-eat-synthetic-meat-meatable-has-raised-47-million-to-make-it/embed/#?secret=7kXB9qDxBu" data-secret="7kXB9qDxBu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That also helps in the mission of curbing the emissions associated with big agribusiness and breeding and raising livestock on a massive scale. If you only need a few animals to make the meat, you don&#8217;t have the same environmental footprint for the farms.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We need to make sure that we don’t make the mistakes that we did in the past that we only breed animals for yield and not for flavor,&#8221; said Bubner. </span></p>
<p>Even though the company is still in its earliest days, it already has one letter of intent, with one of San Francisco&#8217;s most famous butchers. Guy Crims, also known as &#8220;Guy the Butcher,&#8221; has signed a letter of intent to stock Orbillion Bio&#8217;s lab-grown Wagyu in his butcher shop, Bubner said. &#8220;He&#8217;s very much a proponent of lab-grown meat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that the company has its initial technology proven, Orbillion is looking to scale rapidly. It will take roughly $3.5 million for the company to get a pilot plant up and running by the end of 2022, and that&#8217;s in addition to the small $1.4 million seed round the company has raised from Joyant and firms like VentureSouq.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The way I see an integrated model working later on is to have the farmers be the breeders of animals for cultivated meat. That can reduce the number of cows on the planet to a couple of hundred thousand,&#8221; Bubner said of her ultimate goal. &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">There’s a lot of talking about if you do lab-grown meat you want to put me out of business. It’s not like we’re going to abolish animal agriculture tomorrow.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is building a Clubhouse rival, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/facebook-building-product-clubhouse.html">reported</a> in February. But what that product will look like or how it will work have been questions that have remained unanswered. However, new screenshots of a Facebook audio product, still under development, show what appears to be a live audio broadcast experience that&#8217;s more of an extension of Facebook&#8217;s existing Messenger Rooms, rather than a standalone app experience. Facebook confirmed with TechCrunch the images are indeed examples of the company&#8217;s &#8220;exploratory audio efforts,&#8221; but cautioned that they don&#8217;t represent a live product at this time.</p>
<p>The company said also that detailing what a product may look like based on these images would be inaccurate. We&#8217;ve decided to publish them anyway with the caveat that, of course, in-development features are very different from live products. Anything and everything could still change between now and a public launch.</p>
<p>But the images at least help demonstrate <em>how</em> Facebook is thinking about live audio and where such a social experience could fit within Facebook&#8217;s existing app. And that&#8217;s worth considering.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The photos themselves have been shared by mobile developer and reverse engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/">Alessandro Paluzzi,</a> who came across Facebook&#8217;s live audio developments and user interface experiments within the Facebook Android app&#8217;s code. Like other reverse engineers, Paluzzi digs around in the code to uncover unreleased products in various stages of development. Some of the products he finds are tested and scrapped, while others eventually make it to market.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129330" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129330" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2129330" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-5.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-5.jpeg 1242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-5.jpeg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-5.jpeg?resize=300,221 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-5.jpeg?resize=768,565 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-5.jpeg?resize=680,500 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-5.jpeg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129330" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1373392803707883526" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alessandro Paluzzi <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>In Facebook&#8217;s case, the images he shared show a &#8220;Live Audio&#8221; option for Rooms &#8212; Facebook&#8217;s social Zoom competitor which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/facebooks-social-zoom-competitor-messenger-rooms-goes-live-globally/"> first launched last May</a>. At the time, people were hungry for video chat options before our collective Zoom fatigue set in as the pandemic wore on. Now we all want to turn our screens off, and hang out in Clubhouse instead.</p>
<p>Currently, when a Facebook user creates a Messenger Room &#8212; which you can do from either Messenger or the Status box on Facebook &#8212; it&#8217;s a group video chat. Here, friends and family can virtually hang out or even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/facebook-introduces-a-co-viewing-experience-in-messenger-watch-together/">co-watch Facebook videos together</a>. But while Rooms support up to 50 people, they&#8217;re not meant to offer a large, public broadcast experience.</p>
<p>The new images show an expansion of Rooms, where you&#8217;ll be able to pick from one of three different &#8220;types&#8221; of Rooms &#8212; either a private video room (much like you what&#8217;s available today), or either a public or private audio room. The private audio room would be just a place to voice chat with a group of friends, while the &#8220;Live Audio&#8221; room would instead be an audio-only room where you could broadcast to wider group of listeners.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129328" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129328" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2129328" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-3.jpeg?w=340" alt="" width="340" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-3.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-3.jpeg?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-3.jpeg?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-3.jpeg?resize=768,1536 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-3.jpeg?resize=340,680 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-3.jpeg?resize=1024,2048 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-3.jpeg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129328" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1370937003253112834" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alessandro Paluzzi <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The latter would be given its own Room Link, which speakers could then promote across Facebook &#8212; either in Messenger, through a Facebook post, or within a Facebook Group &#8212; or anywhere else on social media and the web.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Live Audio Room experience &#8212; which Paluzzi mocked up with images of Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s face to represent the users profiles &#8212; looks a lot like Clubhouse. The speakers are shown at the top of the room where they&#8217;re represented with larger, circular profile pics, while the room listeners appear below. There&#8217;s also a &#8220;followed by speakers&#8221; section that leads the audience section &#8212; again, much like Clubhouse.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129329" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129329" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2129329" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?w=340" alt="" width="340" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?resize=768,1536 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?resize=340,680 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?resize=1024,2048 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129329" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1370937003253112834" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alessandro Paluzzi <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Paluzzi says the way the live audio rooms product is being developed, it would allow for rooms that anyone on Facebook could join, and those rooms could be accessible from Facebook itself &#8212; meaning you would not have to switch to Messenger to join a room. When not expanded to full-screen, the room would display its title, the number of speakers, and total listeners so you could get an idea of the room&#8217;s popularity.</p>
<p>Of course, what Paluzzi has come across is not a final product &#8212; it&#8217;s just a user interface, buried in the code, and none of the backend works. Facebook also stressed that the images were just audio experiments, as noted above.</p>
<p>But the images themselves are real and represent something Facebook has built. They&#8217;re worth examining, despite any attempts to downplay their importance.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been connecting people through audio and video technologies for many years and are always exploring new ways to improve that experience for people,&#8221; a spokesperson said, commenting on the images Paluzzi had published.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129326" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129326" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2129326" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-1.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="214" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-1.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-1.jpeg?resize=150,47 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-1.jpeg?resize=300,94 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-1.jpeg?resize=768,242 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-1.jpeg?resize=680,214 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-1.jpeg?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129326" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1373994846847967234" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alessandro Paluzzi <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is bullish on audio, of course. In fact, he&#8217;s already appeared on Clubhouse <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-on-clubhouse-2021-2">a couple</a> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-criticizes-apple-on-clubhouse/">of times</a>, and recently spoke about the potential for social audio in a<a href="https://constine.substack.com/p/pressclub-with-mark-zuckerberg-daniel"> Clubhouse Room hosted</a> last week by former TechCrunch editor Josh Constine, now an investor at SignalFire. During the chat, Zuckerberg said he believes audio has a number of advantages over other formats.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to prepare. You don&#8217;t have to look good before you get on to go to a podcast or Clubhouse or whatever you&#8217;re doing,&#8221; he noted, of the hosting experience. Plus, he added, &#8220;you can walk around a lot more easily. You can consume it without having to look at the screen and kind of do that in the background while doing something else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zuckerberg also praised Clubhouse for what it had pioneered, saying it would end up &#8220;being one of the modalities around live audio broadcast.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129327" style="width: 687px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129327" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2129327" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-2.jpeg?w=677" alt="" width="677" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-2.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-2.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-2.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-2.jpeg?resize=768,771 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-2.jpeg?resize=677,680 677w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-2.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-2.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-2.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-2.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-2.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129327" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alessandro Paluzzi</p></div></p>
<p>In other words, it appears Facebook sees Clubhouse as a feature it can reproduce &#8212; similar to how it borrowed the concept of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/30/attack-of-the-clone/">Stories from Snapchat for Instagram</a>, and the way it&#8217;s more recently copied the TikTok experience for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/instagram-reels-launches-globally-in-over-50-countries-including-u-s/">Instagram Reels</a>. It doesn&#8217;t have to launch a new app to counteract the Clubhouse threat, it just has to launch a place for people to use audio on Facebook. (And of course, there&#8217;s something to be said about praising Clubhouse on Clubhouse while simultaneously building a copy.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Overall, I think that this is going to be a pretty big space,&#8221;<a href="https://constine.substack.com/p/pressclub-with-mark-zuckerberg-daniel"> Zuckerberg said</a> of social audio. &#8220;The work that we&#8217;re doing in this is trying to basically build out a bunch of the tools across the spectrum of how people would want to use audio. I&#8217;m really excited about this,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/jeff-bezos-will-no-longer-be-ceo-of-amazon-as-of-later-this-year/">Amazon announced last month</a> that Jeff Bezos was moving into the executive chairman role, and AWS CEO Andy Jassy would be taking over the entire Amazon operation, speculation began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/what-andy-jassys-promotion-to-amazon-ceo-could-mean-for-aws/">about who would replace Jassy</a>.</p>
<p>People considered a number of internal candidates viable, such as Peter DeSantis, vice president of global infrastructure at AWS and Matt Garman, who is vice president of sales and marketing. Not many would have chosen Tableau CEO Adam Selipsky, but sure enough he is returning home to run the division he left in 2016.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/aws-announces-next-ceo">email to employees</a>, Jassy wasted no time getting to the point that Selipsky was his choice, saying that the former employee <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/">helped launch the division</a> when they hired him in 2005, then spent 11 years helping Jassy build the unit before taking the job at Tableau. Through that lens, the choice makes perfect sense.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Adam brings strong judgment, customer obsession, team building, demand generation, and CEO experience to an already very strong AWS leadership team. And, having been in such a senior role at AWS for 11 years, he knows our culture and business well,&#8221; Jassy wrote in the email.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZZzxLTTy5y"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/what-andy-jassys-promotion-to-amazon-ceo-could-mean-for-aws/">What Andy Jassy&#8217;s promotion to Amazon CEO could mean for AWS</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What Andy Jassy&#8217;s promotion to Amazon CEO could mean for AWS&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/what-andy-jassys-promotion-to-amazon-ceo-could-mean-for-aws/embed/#?secret=ZZzxLTTy5y" data-secret="ZZzxLTTy5y" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Jassy has run AWS since its earliest days, taking it from humble beginnings as a kind of internal experiment on running a storage web service to building a mega division <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">currently on a $51 billion</a> run rate. It is that juggernaut that will be Selipsky&#8217;s to run, but he seems well-suited for the job.</p>
<p>He is a seasoned executive, and while he&#8217;s been away from AWS since before it really began to grow into a huge operation, he should still understand the culture well enough to step smoothly into the role.  At the same time, he&#8217;s leaving Tableau, a company he helped transform from a desktop software company into one firmly based in the cloud.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/salesforce-closes-15-7b-tableau-deal/">Salesforce bought Tableau</a> in June 2019 for a cool $15.7 billion and Selipsky has remained at the helm since then, but perhaps the lure of running AWS was too great and he decided to take the leap to the new job.</p>
<p>When we wrote a story at the end of last year about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/salesforce-has-built-a-deep-bench-of-executive-talent-via-acquisition/">Salesforce&#8217;s deep bench of executive talent</a>, Selipsky was one of the CEOs we pointed at as a possible replacement should CEO and chairman Marc Benioff step down. But with it looking more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/could-marc-benioff-be-the-next-ceo-to-move-to-executive-chairman/">like president and COO Bret Taylor</a> would be the heir apparent, perhaps Selipsky was ready for a new challenge.</p>
<p>Selipsky will make his return to AWS on May 17th and spend a few weeks with Jassy in a transitional time before taking over the division to run on his own. As Jassy slides into the Amazon CEO role, it&#8217;s clear the two will continue to work closely together, just as they did for over a decade.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/robinhood-files-confidentially-for-u-s-ipo">Bloomberg reported</a>, and <a href="https://www.axios.com/robinhood-files-for-public-offering-93d52a5c-3b8f-4a41-a9b3-5aaa2a41d802.html">Axios confirmed</a> that Robinhood has filed privately to go public. The well-financed Robinhood is an American fintech company that provides zero-cost trading services to consumers.</p>
<p>Private IPO filings have become common in recent quarters, making Robinhood&#8217;s decision to file behind closed doors before showing its numbers to the public unsurprising. That it has filed privately, however, implies that the company is closer to a public debut than we might have anticipated.</p>
<p>Robinhood has long been expected to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/with-a-2021-ipo-in-the-cards-what-do-we-know-about-robinhoods-q3-performance/">have a 2021 IPO in its plans</a>. The company has not yet responded to an inquiry from TechCrunch regarding the news of its private IPO filing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Robinhood&#8217;s Q4 2020 revenue shows a return to growth&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-q4-2020-revenue-shows-a-return-to-growth/embed/#?secret=gWrmE4G8o4" data-secret="gWrmE4G8o4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There are several reasons why Robinhood may be interested in a near-term public debut, despite running into controversies in recent quarters. No amount of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/robinhood-goes-to-congress/">time in front of Congress</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/amidst-robinhoods-planned-service-changes-a-tension-between-growth-and-safety/">bad PR from a user&#8217;s suicide</a>, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/robinhood-pays-65m-to-settle-sec-charges-for-past-inferior-pricing-execution-misleading-customers/">settlements with the SEC</a> can change the fact that today&#8217;s stock market favors growth, something that the company has in spades. Or that recent IPOs have been rapturously received by public investors as a cohort; it&#8217;s a warm time to pursue public-market liquidity.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s revenue expanded greatly in 2020, something that TechCrunch has covered through the lens of Robinhood&#8217;s payment for order flow, or PFOF income. The company told Congress that the particular revenue source was the majority of its top line, meaning that PFOF growth is a reasonable comp for the company&#8217;s aggregate growth. And as TechCrunch has reported, those numbers rose sharply in 2020, from around ~$91 million in Q1 2020, to ~$178 million in Q2 2020, and ~$183 million and ~$221 million in the third and fourth quarter of last year.</p>
<p>Robinhood also makes money from consumer subscriptions, and other sources.</p>
<p>The fact that Robinhood has filed privately implies that it will go public sometimes soon, though perhaps not quickly enough to get around providing Q1 2021 numbers. More when we get our hands on the filing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TuSimple, the self-driving truck company that is backed by a diverse consortium of strategic investors, including Volkswagen AG’s heavy-truck business The Traton Group, Navistar, Goodyear, and freight company U.S. Xpress, filed Tuesday for an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1823593/000119312521091150/d909743ds1.htm">initial public offering</a>.</p>
<p>TuSimple is taking the traditional path to going public, a departure from the recent trend — particularly among electric and autonomous vehicle startups — to merge with a special purpose acquisition companies.</p>
<p>The number of shares to be offered and the price range for the proposed offering have not yet been determined, according to the regulatory filing. TuSimple intends to list its common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol &#8220;TSP.&#8221; Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and J.P. Morgan are the lead underwriters for the proposed offering.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to the company&#8217;s S-1, which was filed Tuesday, TuSimple has primarily financed its operations through the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock and loans from stockholders. The company&#8217;s principal sources of liquidity were $310.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, exclusive of restricted cash of $1.5 million. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks as well as certificates of deposit.</p>
<p>The S-1 shows that TuSimple had a loss from operations of $177.9 million in 2020, more than double loss of $84.8 million incurred in the previous year. The company said it had net losses from operations of $45 in 2018. Its accumulated deficit was $405.2 million as of December 31, 2020.</p>
<p>Net loss attributable to common stockholders sat at $198.8 million in 2020, up from a loss of $145 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s revenue did rise to $1.8 million in 2020, up from $710,000 the previous year.</p>
<p>TuSimple, which was founded in 2015,  was one of the first autonomous trucking startups to emerge in what has become a small, yet bustling industry that now includes Aurora, Embark, Kodiak and Waymo. While TuSimple’s founding team and its earliest backers Sina and Composite Capital are from China, a chunk of its operations are in the United States, including its global headquarters in San Diego. TuSimple also operates an engineering center and truck depot in Tucson and more recently set up a facility in Texas to support its autonomous trips —always with a human safety operator behind the wheel. TuSimple also has operations in Beijing and Shanghai.</p>

<p>Despite its U.S. operations and U.S. partners, its shares are largely held by Chinese investors, the S-1 prospectus shows. The company&#8217;s principal stockholders of Class A shares are Sun Dream Inc with 20%, Composite Capital Master Fund with 7.28% and Navistar with 6%. Navistar is now owned by Volkswagen Group&#8217;s The Traton Group. TuSimple&#8217;s co-founders Mo Chen and Xiaodi Hou hold 9.1% and 8.5%, respectively in Class A shares. The two each hold 50% of the Class B shares.</p>
<p>The Sun Dream is ultimately controlled by Charles Chao, who is a board member, but perhaps best known as the chairman of Sina, which owns Weibo.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital advertising company <a href="https://kargo.com">Kargo</a> is launching a new product and new business unit called <a href="https://www.fabrik.com">Fabrik</a>.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO Harry Kargman explained that Fabrik is a content management system designed for publishers&#8217; modern needs and integrated with Kargo&#8217;s advertising technology.</p>
<p>Kargman suggested that he sees this as part of Kargo&#8217;s broader mission of &#8220;saving publishing.&#8221; That might seem like a tall order for an ad business, but he said the company has tried to do that &#8220;by driving extraordinary ad experiences and monetization.&#8221; And yet, he&#8217;s come to realize, &#8220;That&#8217;s not enough.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In particular, Kargman came to realize that many websites have &#8220;too much weight&#8221; and load far too slowly (to illustrate his point, he loaded the TechCrunch homepage, and it was indeed slower than I would like). This drives readers away and also has a detrimental effect on Google search rankings.</p>
<p>So the goal with Fabrik is to create a &#8220;lightning fast&#8221; web experience, which you can see for yourself on <a href="https://okmagazine.com">the OK Magazine website</a>. Fabrik says that one of the key steps to achieving this speed is by eliminating the need for third-party trackers and plugins — in fact, Kargman described plugins as &#8220;the death of the internet&#8221; and told me he often asks publishers, &#8220;Do you want to make money, or do you want to have a lot of plugins?&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;After A Decade In Business, Kargo Says It&#8217;s Growing Fast, With Big Ambitions For Premium Mobile Ads&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/29/kargo-profile/embed/#?secret=awAD5QuHkf" data-secret="awAD5QuHkf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We built it for Google&#8217;s best practices and the core <a href="https://web.dev/vitals/">Web Vitals</a>,&#8221; added COO Michael Shaughnessy. &#8220;We&#8217;re very strategic about how we load items that would really slow us down.&#8221;</p>
<p>This launch comes as many publishers are exploring business models beyond advertising, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extracrunch/">subscriptions and memberships</a>. Shaughnessy suggested that Fabrik is complementary to those efforts, because it&#8217;s &#8220;simplifying the foundation,&#8221; thus freeing teams to focus on new commercial initiatives.</p>
<p>As for the advertising side, Kargman said, &#8220;We think we’ve built our adtech directly into Fabrik in a way that there&#8217;s absolutely no reason not to use Kargo — but certainly, it doesn&#8217;t require you to exclusively use Kargo. We expect publishers to monetize their own sites, to cut branded entertainment deals, to do all the good things that they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>And as previously mentioned, the plan is for Fabrik to be a separate business unit under the Kargo&#8217;s corporate umbrella, with its own customers and its own CEO — Kargman said he&#8217;s talking to a potential hire, but it&#8217;s &#8220;not quite ready yet to announce.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[UX expert Peter Ramsey and TechCrunch reporter Steve O'Hear discuss some of Clubhouse's UX challenges as it continues to onboard new users at pace while it strives to create enough stickiness to keep them active.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Clubhouse, the social audio app that first took Silicon Valley by storm and is now gaining much wider appeal, is an interesting user experience case study.</p>
<p>Hockey-stick growth — 8 million global downloads as of last month, despite still being in a pre-launch, invite-only mode, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/report-social-audio-app-clubhouse-has-topped-8-million-global-downloads/">according to App Annie</a> — is something most startups would kill for. However, it also means that UX problems can only be addressed while in &#8220;full flight&#8221; — and that changes to the user experience will be felt at scale rather under the cover of a small, loyal and (usually) forgiving user base.</p>
<p>In our latest UX teardown, <a href="https://builtformars.co.uk/">Built for Mars founder</a> and UX expert Peter Ramsey and TechCrunch reporter Steve O&#8217;Hear discuss some of Clubhouse&#8217;s UX challenges as it continues to onboard new users at pace while striving to create enough stickiness to keep them active.</p>
<h2>Homepage curation</h2>
<p><strong>Peter Ramsey:</strong> Content feeds are notoriously difficult to get right. Which posts should you see? How should you order them? How do you filter out the noise?</p>
<p>On Clubhouse, once you’ve scrolled past all the available rooms in your feed, you’re prompted to follow more people to see more rooms. In other words, Clubhouse is inadvertently describing how it decides what content you see, i.e., your homepage is a curated list of rooms based on people you follow.</p>
<p>Except there’s a problem: I don’t follow half the people who already appear in my feed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129146" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129146" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2129146" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Peopletofollow.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="335" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Peopletofollow.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Peopletofollow.jpg?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Peopletofollow.jpg?resize=300,148 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Peopletofollow.jpg?resize=768,378 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Peopletofollow.jpg?resize=680,335 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Peopletofollow.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129146" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clubhouse</p></div></p>
<p><strong>Steve O&#8217;Hear:</strong> I get it. This could be confusing, but why does it actually matter? Won’t people just continue to use the homepage regardless?</p>
<p><strong>Peter:</strong> In the short term, yes. People will use the homepage in the same way they’d use Instagram’s search page (which is to just browse occasionally). But in the long term, this content needs to be consistently relevant or people will lose interest.</p>
<p><strong>Steve:</strong> But Twitter has a search page that shows random content that I don’t control.</p>
<p><strong>Peter:</strong> Yeah, but they also have a home feed that you do control. It’s fine to also have the more random “slot machine style” content feed — but you need the base layer.</p>
<h2>The truth about aha moments</h2>
<p><strong>Peter:</strong> In the early days of Twitter, the team noticed something in their data: When people follow at least 30 others, they’re far more likely to stick around. This is often described as an &#8220;aha moment&#8221; — the moment that the utility of a product really clicks for the user.</p>
<p>This story has become startup folklore, and I’ve worked with many companies who take this message too literally, forgetting the nuance of what they really found: It’s not enough to just follow 30 random people — you need to follow 30 people who you genuinely care about.</p>
<p>Clubhouse has clearly adopted a similar methodology, by pre-selecting 50 people for you to follow while signing up.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that some people have accumulated millions of followers really quickly? It’s because the same people are almost always recommended — I tried creating accounts with polar opposite interests, and the same people were pre-selected almost every time.</p>
<p>At no point does it explain that following those 50 people will directly impact the content that is available to you, or that if your homepage gets uninteresting, you’ll need to unfollow these people individually.</p>
<p>But they should, and it could look more like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2129147 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Otherstofollow.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="434" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Otherstofollow.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Otherstofollow.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Otherstofollow.jpg?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Otherstofollow.jpg?resize=768,490 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Otherstofollow.jpg?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Otherstofollow.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><strong>Steve:</strong> Why do you think Clubhouse does this? Laziness?</p>
<p><strong>Peter:</strong> I think in the early days of Clubhouse they just wanted to maximize connections, and by always recommending the same people (Clubhouse’s founders and investors), they could somewhat control the content that is shown to new users.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We have an incredible line up of folks joining us on the show, which breaks down how successful founders got their early funding and what VCs are looking for in a startup. Historically, Extra Crunch Live has been for Extra Crunch members only, but we&#8217;ve decided to make the live events free for everyone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter today is <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/community/2021/welcome-reshuffle-to-twitter.html">announcing</a> what the company calls a &#8220;strategic acquihire&#8221; of the API integration platform <a href="https://www.reshuffle.com/">Reshuffle</a>. The startup&#8217;s commercial technology, which allows developers to build workflows and connect systems using any API, will be wound down as a result of Twitter&#8217;s deal. However, Reshuffle&#8217;s entire team of seven, including co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amirshevat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/amirshevat/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616534940059000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGRo0rinYJo8J3KeWM8xKEDd4g4kg">Amir Shevat</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/avnerbraverman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/avnerbraverman/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616534940059000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFBpXJViCNn1plFuBEascgFM2E-qg">Avner Braverman</a>, will be joining Twitter where they&#8217;ll work to accelerate the work being done to modernize Twitter&#8217;s new, unified API.</p>
<p>The new Twitter API 2.0 was first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week/">introduced last year</a>, having been rebuilt from the ground up for the first time since 2012. It now includes features missing from the older version, like conversation threading, poll results, pinned tweets, spam filtering, and more powerful stream filtering and search query language. It&#8217;s also been designed in a way that will allow Twitter to release new functionality faster as the company itself rolls out more features. For example, the API has added new support for newer features like &#8220;<a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/hide-replies/introduction">hide replies</a>&#8221; and <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/annotations">tweet annotations</a>. And as Twitter&#8217;s pace of development has recently been sped up, the company now has even more significant product launches on the horizon, including the public release of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-launches-its-voice-based-spaces-social-networking-feature-into-beta-testing/">Twitter Spaces</a> (audio rooms) and soon, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">Super Follow</a> (a subscription service for creators and their fans).</p>
<p>In addition, Twitter&#8217;s API team is working to develop products that meet the various needs of different types of developers, including consumer-facing app developers, business and enterprise developers, and academic researchers. In January, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitters-new-api-platform-now-opened-to-academic-researchers/">Twitter&#8217;s API opened up to researchers</a>, and Twitter promised more functionality would soon be on the way.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Reshuffle&#8217;s team will be immediately tasked with helping Twitter accelerate its API efforts and building tools for developers.</p>
<p>Reshuffle&#8217;s CEO Avner Braverman, who has nearly two decades of experience in both engineering and technical consumer-facing roles across startups and larger companies like IBM, will join Twitter&#8217;s Developer Platform team. Meanwhile, Reshuffle&#8217;s CPO Amir Shevat, whose previous roles included VP of Platform for Twitch, Head of Developer Relations at Slack, and Senior Developer Relations Manager at Google, will join Twitter as a senior member of the Developer Platform team.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re doubling down on our investment and ambitions by bringing the Reshuffle team on board,&#8221; noted a Twitter blog post announcing the deal, co-authored by Twitter Revenue Product Lead Bruce Falck and Twitter Developer Platform Lead Sonya Penn. &#8220;Their experience building developer platforms will accelerate and enhance our work by building the tools that will make it easier and quicker for developers to find value on our platform,&#8221; it read.</p>
<p>Reshuffle&#8217;s existing product will wind down operations over the coming weeks, following the acquihire. However, the team will continue to maintain its open source project for the developer community, Twitter notes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Twitter has been on an acquisition and acquihire spree in recent months, having bought <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">newsletter platform Revue,</a> which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/twitter-quietly-rolls-out-revue-newsletters-integration-on-web/">already integrated into Twitter&#8217;s website</a>; as well as teams from social podcasting app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/twitter-acquires-social-podcasting-app-breaker-team-to-help-build-twitter-spaces/">Breaker</a>, screen sharing social app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/twitter-acquires-screen-sharing-social-app-squad/">Squad</a>, creative design agency <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-acquihires-creative-agency-ueno-to-help-design-new-products/">Ueno</a>; and last year, stories template maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/twitter-chroma-stories/">Chroma Labs</a>.</p>
<p>Twitter says it will continue to look for more acquihire opportunities in the future as a means of scaling its own teams and accelerating their work.</p>
<p>The company declined to share deal terms for the Reshuffle acquihire.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/187550-29#signals">Pitchbook</a>, Reshuffle was backed by $6.35 million in funding from investors including Cardumen Capital, Cerca Partners, Maverick Ventures, Meron Capital, Dell Technologies Capital, Engineering Capital, and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Pitchbook says the business was valued at $11.85 million.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Since the dawn of the internet, knowing (or, perhaps more accurately, <em>not</em> knowing) who is on the other side of the screen has been one of the biggest mysteries and thrills. In the early days of social media and online forums, anonymous usernames were the norm and meant you could pretend to be whoever you wanted to be.</p>
<p>As exciting and liberating as this freedom was, the problems quickly became apparent — predators of all kinds have used this cloak of anonymity to prey upon unsuspecting victims, harass anyone they dislike or disagree with, and spread misinformation without consequence.</p>
<p>For years, the conversation around moderation has been focused on two key pillars. First, what rules to write: What content is deemed acceptable or forbidden, how do we define these terms, and who makes the final call on the gray areas? And second, how to enforce them: How can we leverage both humans and AI to find and flag inappropriate or even illegal content?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While these continue to be important elements to any moderation strategy, this approach only flags bad actors after an offense. There is another equally critical tool in our arsenal that isn’t getting the attention it deserves: verification.</p>
<p>Most people think of verification as the “blue checkmark” — a badge of honor bestowed upon the elite and celebrities among us. However, verification is becoming an increasingly important tool in moderation efforts to combat nefarious issues like harassment and hate speech.</p>
<p>That blue checkmark is more than just a signal showing who’s important — it also confirms that a person is who they say they are, which is an incredibly powerful means to hold people accountable for their actions.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges that social media platforms face today is the <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-fake-accounts-constantly-manipulate-what-you-see-on-social-media-and-what-you-can-do-about-it-139610">explosion of fake accounts</a>, with the Brad Pitt <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessedamiani/2021/02/16/the-curious-case-of-brad-pitt-on-clubhouse/?sh=6a4e7f7b13ef">impersonator</a> on Clubhouse being one of the more recent examples. Bots and sock puppets spread lies and misinformation like wildfire, and they propagate more quickly than moderators can ban them.</p>
<p>This is why <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-new-authenticity-measures-on-instagram/">Instagram began implementing new verification measures last year</a> to combat this exact issue. By verifying users’ real identities, Instagram said it “will be able to better understand when accounts are attempting to mislead their followers, hold them accountable, and keep our community safe.”</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			It’s important to remember that verification is not a single tactic, but rather a collection of solutions that must be used dynamically in concert to be effective.					</blockquote>
	</div>

<p>The urgency to implement verification is also bigger than just stopping the spread of questionable content. It can also help companies ensure they’re staying on the right side of the law.</p>
<p>Following an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-rape-trafficking.html?searchResultPosition=3">exposé</a> revealing illegal content was being uploaded to Pornhub’s site, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/pornhub-removes-all-unverified-content-following-reports-of-exploitation/">the company banned posts from nonverified users</a> and deleted all content uploaded from unverified sources (more than 80% of the videos hosted on its platform). It has since <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7a4eq/pornhub-new-verification-policy-biometric-id">implemented</a> new measures to verify its users to prevent this kind of issue from infiltrating its systems again in the future.</p>
<p>Companies of all kinds should be looking at this case as a cautionary tale — if there had been verification from the beginning, the systems would have been in a much better place to identify bad actors and keep them out.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to remember that verification is not a single tactic, but rather a collection of solutions that must be used dynamically in concert to be effective. Bad actors are savvy and continually updating their methods to circumvent systems. Using a single-point solution to verify users — such as through a photo ID — might sound sufficient on its face, but it’s relatively easy for a motivated fraudster to overcome.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://withpersona.com/">Persona</a>, we’ve detected increasingly sophisticated fraud attempts ranging from using celebrity photos and data to create accounts to intricate photoshopping of IDs and even using deepfakes to mimic a live selfie.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s critical for verification systems to take multiple signals into account when verifying users, including actively collected customer information (like a photo ID), passive signals (their IP address or browser fingerprint), and third-party data sources (like phone and email risk lists). By combining multiple data points, a valid but stolen ID won’t pass through the gates because signals like location or behavioral patterns will raise a red flag that this user’s identity is likely fraudulent or at the very least warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>This kind of holistic verification system will enable social and user-generated-content platforms to not only deter and flag bad actors but also prevent them from repeatedly entering your platform under new usernames and emails, a common tactic of trolls and account abusers who have previously been banned.</p>
<p>Beyond individual account abusers, a multisignal approach can help manage an arguably bigger problem for social media platforms: coordinated disinformation campaigns. Any issue involving groups of bad actors is like battling the multiheaded Hydra — you cut off one head only to have two more grow back in its place.</p>
<p>Yet killing the beast is possible when you have a comprehensive verification system that can help surface groups of bad actors based on shared properties (e.g., location). While these groups will continue to look for new ways in, multifaceted verification that is tailored for the end user can help keep them from running rampant.</p>
<p>Historically, identity verification systems like Jumio or Trulioo were designed for specific industries, like financial services. But we’re starting to see the rise in demand for industry-agnostic solutions like Persona to keep up with these new and emerging use cases for verification. Nearly every industry that operates online can benefit from verification, even ones like social media, where there isn’t necessarily a financial transaction to protect.</p>
<p>It’s not a question of <em>if</em> verification will become a part of the solution for challenges like moderation, but rather a question of <em>when</em>. The technology and tools exist today, and it’s up to social media platforms to decide that it’s time to make this a priority.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Social media executives will be answering to Congress directly for their role in January&#8217;s deadly attacks on the U.S. Capitol this week. Facebook&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter&#8217;s Jack Dorsey and Google&#8217;s Sundar Pichai will all appear virtually before a joint House committee <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-disinformation-nation-social-medias-role-in-promoting">Thursday at 12 p.m. Eastern Time</a>.</p>
<p>The hearing, held by the House&#8217;s Subcommittee on Communications and Technology and the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce, will focus on social media&#8217;s role in spreading disinformation, extremism and misinformation. The Energy and Commerce Committee previously held a parallel hearing reckoning with traditional media&#8217;s role in promoting those same social ills.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone Jr., joined by more than 20 other Democrats, <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/ec-democrats-demand-accountability-for-facebook-s-advertising-practices-in">sent a letter to Zuckerberg</a> pressing the Facebook CEO for answers about why tactical gear ads showed up next to posts promoting the Capitol riot. &#8220;Targeting ads in this way is dangerous and has the potential to encourage acts of violence,&#8221; the letter&#8217;s authors wrote. In late January, Facebook said that it would pause ads showing weapon accessories and related equipment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the subcommittee has signaled its interest in Facebook&#8217;s ad practices, organic content on the site has historically presented a much bigger problem. In the uncertain period following the election last year, the pro-Trump <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/facebook-blocks-sharpiegate-hashtag-election-conspiracies/">&#8220;Stop the Steal&#8221; movement swelled to massive proportions</a> on social media, particularly in Facebook groups. The company took<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/facebook-says-it-will-remove-references-to-stop-the-steal-across-its-platform/"> incremental measures at the time</a>, but that same movement, born of political misinformation, is what propelled the Capitol rioters to disrupt vote counting and enact deadly violence on January 6.</p>
<p>The hearing is likely to go deep on extremists organizing through Facebook groups too. Chairs from both subcommittees that will question the tech CEOs this week previously questioned Facebook about reports that the company was well aware that its algorithmic group recommendations<a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/Facebook%20Letter%20re%20Misinformation%20Feb%202021.pdf"> were funneling users toward extremism</a>. In spite of warnings from experts, Facebook continued to allow armed anti-government militias to openly organize on the platform until late 2020. And in spite of bans, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2021-03-23/report-extremist-groups-thrive-on-facebook-despite-bans">some continued to do so</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yM45FxyjTd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gretchen-whitmer-kidnapping-plot-facebook-groups-militias-fbi/">Militia tied to plot to kidnap Gov. Whitmer was removed from Facebook in boogaloo purge</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Militia tied to plot to kidnap Gov. Whitmer was removed from Facebook in boogaloo purge&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gretchen-whitmer-kidnapping-plot-facebook-groups-militias-fbi/embed/#?secret=yM45FxyjTd" data-secret="yM45FxyjTd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Justice Department is reportedly considering charging members of the Oath Keepers, one prominent armed U.S. militia group involved in the Capitol attack, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/us/politics/sedition-oath-keepers-capitol-riot.html">with sedition</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook plays a huge role in distributing extremist content and ferrying it to the mainstream, but it isn&#8217;t alone. Misinformation that undermines the integrity of the U.S. election results is generally just as easy to find on YouTube and Twitter, though those social networks aren&#8217;t designed to connect and mobilize people in the same way that Facebook groups do.</p>
<p>Facebook began to course-correct its own rules around extremism, slowly through 2020 and then quickly this January when the company removed former President Trump from the platform. Facebook&#8217;s external policy oversight board continues to review that decision and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/facebook-trump-oversight-board-public-comment/">could reverse it in the coming weeks</a>.</p>
<p>Over the course of the last year, Twitter made an effort to demystify some of its own policy decisions, transparently communicating changes and introducing ideas it was considering. Under Dorsey&#8217;s guidance the company treated its platform rules like a living document — one it&#8217;s begun to tinker around with in an effort to shape <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/twitter-retweet-prompt-android/">user behavior for the better</a>.</p>
<p>If Twitter&#8217;s recent policy decision making is akin to thinking out loud, YouTube took the opposite approach. The company wasn&#8217;t as proactive in shoring up its defenses ahead of the 2020 elections and rarely responded in real-time to events. YouTube waited a full month after Biden&#8217;s victory to articulate rules that would rid the platform of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/youtube-declares-war-on-us-election-misinformation-a-month-late/">disinformation declaring that the election was stolen from Trump</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully the joint hearing can dig a bit more into why that was, but we&#8217;re not counting on it. The subcommittees&#8217; decision to bring Google CEO Sundar Pichai to testify is a bit strange considering that YouTube&#8217;s CEO Susan Wojcicki — who has yet to be called to Congress for one of these high profile tech hearings — would make the better witness. Pichai is ultimately accountable for what YouTube does too, but in past hearings he&#8217;s proven a very polished witness who&#8217;s deft at neutralizing big picture criticism with technical detail.</p>
<p>Ultimately Wojcicki would have more insight into YouTube&#8217;s misinformation and extremism policies and the reason the platform has dragged its feet on matters of hate and misinformation, <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/youtube-explains-why-a-racist-video-didnt-violate-its-hate-speech-rules-3d74befde097">enforcing its own policies unevenly</a> when it chooses to do so at all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In what looks like both an endorsement of its Premier Access streaming strategy and a tacit acknowledgement that theatrical moviegoing won&#8217;t be returning to normal anytime soon, Disney just announced that its movies &#8220;Black Widow&#8221; and &#8220;Cruella&#8221; will be coming to Disney+ at the same time that they&#8217;re released in theaters.</p>
<p>That means Disney+ subscribers will have the option to pay an additional, one-time $29.99 fee to watch the live action remake of &#8220;Cruella&#8221; at home on May 28, or to do the same for &#8220;Black Widow&#8221; on July 9. (The movies will later become available to all Disney+ subscribers at no extra charge.)</p>
<p>Disney first tested out this strategy with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/mulan-is-coming-to-disney-on-september-4-for-an-additional-price-of-29-99/">the release of the live action &#8220;Mulan&#8221; last fall</a>, followed by the animated &#8220;Raya and the Last Dragon&#8221; earlier this month. The studio has released other movies, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/original-content-podcast-pixars-soul-offers-a-lively-visit-to-pre-pandemic-new-york/">like Pixar&#8217;s &#8220;Soul,&#8221;</a> directly to Disney+ without an extra fee, and it says it will do the same for Pixar&#8217;s &#8220;Luca&#8221; on June 18.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other big Disney releases have been pushed back repeatedly — &#8220;Black Widow,&#8221; for example, was originally supposed to be released on May 1 of last year, and Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige has <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/kevin-feige-black-widow-theatrical-release/">reportedly resisted</a> sending it straight to Disney+. (This will be the first Marvel Studios film released since the beginning of the pandemic.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cSgHPjNjPu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/disney-investor-day/">Disney+ has plans for 10 Marvel shows and 10 Star Wars shows in the next few years</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Disney+ has plans for 10 Marvel shows and 10 Star Wars shows in the next few years&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/disney-investor-day/embed/#?secret=cSgHPjNjPu" data-secret="cSgHPjNjPu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>However, Disney executives may only be willing to wait for so long. And because Marvel&#8217;s movies and new Disney+ shows are often interconnected, delaying one release can also require pushing back several others at the same time.</p>
<p>As vaccinations continue and COVID-19 case numbers decline from their peaks, movie theaters are reopening in major markets like Los Angeles and New York — but at reduced capacity, with box office numbers still <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/2021W12/?ref_=bo_wey_table_1">far below</a> what they were pre-pandemic.</p>
<p>In the face of this uncertainty (as well as a general shift to streaming), other Hollywood studios have adopted a variety of hybrid strategies for their 2021 theatrical slates. All Warner Bros. movies will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/warner-bros-hbo-max-simultaneous-release/">released simultaneously on HBO Max</a> this year, while Paramount will be bringing its films to Paramount+ in an accelerated fashion, 30 to 45 days after the theatrical release.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As exciting as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/mars-rover-perseverance-touches-down-tomorrow-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">entire Perseverance mission to Mars</a> is, one of the events most looked forward to by us Earthlings must be the first flight of Ingenuity. After conducting numerous checks and double-checks, the Perseverance team has set April 8 as the date on which they hope to attempt the first controlled powered flight on another planet.</p>
<p>If all goes well, then in about two weeks Ingenuity will make its first hovering flight about 10 feet above the Martian soil. But the meantime will be chock full of preparation.</p>
<p>In the first place the team had to identify an &#8220;airfield,&#8221; a ten-meter-square space of flat ground close at hand to Perseverance&#8217;s landing zone. Having done so, the rover will soon make its way to the exact center and confirm its location.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cAJYiGvZag"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/perseverance-lands-safely-on-mars-and-sends-back-its-first-images-of-the-surface/">Perseverance lands safely on Mars and sends back its first images of the surface</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Perseverance lands safely on Mars and sends back its first images of the surface&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/perseverance-lands-safely-on-mars-and-sends-back-its-first-images-of-the-surface/embed/#?secret=cAJYiGvZag" data-secret="cAJYiGvZag" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Then the helicopter itself must be detached from the belly of the rover, to which it is apparently locked, bolted, <em>and</em> cabled. These are meant to keep it secure during the chaotic landing process, and are irreversible — so the team has to be 100 percent sure this is the spot and the conditions are right. The process should take about five days.</p>
<p>Once Ingenuity has been detached from Perseverance and rotated to flight-ready position, it will hang just five inches above the surface and use its few remaining connections with the rover to charge its batteries. Perseverance will then set it down and quickly drive away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every step we have taken since this journey began six years ago has been uncharted territory in the history of aircraft,&#8221; said Bob Balaram, chief engineer of the project at JPL, in a NASA news release. &#8220;And while getting deployed to the surface will be a big challenge, surviving that first night on Mars alone, without the rover protecting it and keeping it powered, will be an even bigger one. Once we cut the cord with Perseverance and drop those final five inches to the surface, we want to have our big friend drive away as quickly as possible so we can get the Sun’s rays on our solar panel and begin recharging our batteries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once the helicopter detaches, it has 30 Martian days, or sols, in which it is sure to have enough power to work — beyond that they can&#8217;t be sure.</p>
<p>The next couple days will involve tests of Ingenuity&#8217;s systems and a test spin-up of its rotors to 2,537 RPM. The atmosphere of Mars is only a tiny fraction of that on Earth, making flight considerably more difficult in many ways. But that&#8217;s what makes it so fun to try!</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/0RQWv1ybsjM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent&#038;listType=playlist&#038;list=PLTiv_XWHnOZpzQKYC6nLf6M9AuBbng_O8' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>If all the tests and checks are green, then on April 8 at the earliest Ingenuity will attempt to lift off, going up to 3 meters and staying for 30 seconds. The team should know if the flight was a success within a couple hours — and maybe even get some black and white imagery from the Ingenuity&#8217;s on-board cameras. Color imagery will come a few days later.</p>
<p>The team will evaluate what to do next based on this first flight, and the next weeks may bring more — and farther — forays around the airfield. We&#8217;ll know more after the data comes back.</p>
<p>A touching inclusion on Ingenuity&#8217;s chassis is a tiny scrap of the material from the Wright brothers&#8217; first aircraft, the Flyer. So the machine that flew first on Earth will be present in a small way at the first on another planet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Y Combinator’s latest batch &#8212; W21 &#8212; features 350 startups from 41 nations. Fifty percent of the firms, the highest percentage to date, in the new batch are based outside of the United States.</p>
<p>India is the second-largest demographic represented in the new batch. The world’s second-largest internet market has delivered 43 startups in the new batch, another record figure in the history of the storied venture firm. (For comparison, the W20 batch had 25 Indian startups, up from 14 in S20, 12 each in S19 and W19 and one each in W16, S15 and W15.)</p>
<p>“YC going remote has helped make YC more attractive to companies at different stages and far away geographies. For companies in India, founders no longer have to spend three months away from their customers or teams. Covid has also taught us that building a program that is remote and more software based makes YC more accessible to founders around the globe,” the firm said in a statement to TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“When it comes to choosing founders in India, we accept them based on the same criteria we judge companies from anywhere else. Founders must be able to communicate their local context to investors. That is an important skill.”</p>
<p>Here’s a list of startups, in no particular order, from India that have made it to YC W21, with some context &#8212; wherever possible &#8212; on what they are attempting to build (several have elected to stay off the record).</p>
<p><a href="http://creatoros.co">QuestBook</a>, from CreatorOS, is an app for professionals to teach in bite-sized courses using chat and a mobile-first experience.

<p>In India only a fraction of the nation’s 1.3 billion people currently have access to insurance and some analysts say that digital firms could prove crucial in bringing these services to the masses. According to rating agency ICRA, insurance products had reached less than 3% of the population as of 2017.</p>
<p>An average Indian makes about $2,100 a year, according to the World Bank. ICRA estimated that of those Indians who had purchased an insurance product, they were spending less than $50 on it in 2017.</p>
<p>Three startups in the current batch are planning to disrupt this market, which is largely commanded by state and bank-backed insurers.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">All successful companies start off as a <em>great idea</em>, scribbled on the back of a cocktail napkin during a late-night meeting of the minds or gleaned from a fleeting inspiration that leaves you with a feeling of “I could do that better.”</p>
<p>For most, that’s as far as entrepreneurship ever goes, because, unfortunately, a <em>great idea</em> can’t raise money, develop a product or disrupt an industry.</p>
<p>It’s only an <em>idea.</em></p>

<p>New data from the <a href="https://www.docsend.com/index/docsend-startup-index/">DocSend Startup Index</a> show that for early-stage fundraising, particularly in the pre-seed round, founders need to approach VCs with much more than a great idea to secure funding. Our <a href="https://try.docsend.com/fundraising-report?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=referral%20traffic&amp;utm_campaign=2021-02%20preseed%20report%20byline&amp;utm_content=techcrunch&amp;utm_term=preseed%20report">newest report</a> on the state of pre-seed fundraising shows that investors became laser-focused on sections of the pitch deck that address monetization and business viability — signs that founders need to come to the table with better-defined businesses in order to succeed.</p>
<h2><strong>Do not pass go — VCs insist pitch decks meet 3 key criteria </strong></h2>
<p>According to the data, overall founder and VC activity took a nosedive in early 2020 once the serious nature of the pandemic became apparent. But as the year progressed and investors adjusted to the new market conditions and remote dealmaking, overall activity quickly surpassed pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>Despite this flurry of activity and an unprecedented appetite for new startup pitches, investors made it very clear that strong positioning in three sections of the pitch deck was nonnegotiable.</p>

<li><strong>Competitive landscape — </strong>When we published our 2019 pre-seed report, the competitive landscape section of pitch decks was firmly in the middle of the pack in terms of time spent reviewing by investors: They averaged around 35 seconds to clearly articulate their own uniqueness and product-market fit. In 2020, the VC time spent on the same section increased by 51% to an average of 53 seconds across both successful and unsuccessful decks (those that did or did not lead to a funding offer).<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

At the time, tech entrepreneu<span id="rmm">r</span> David Heinemeier Hansson had <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1192540900393705474">called out Apple Card program</a>, jointly run by Apple and Goldman Sachs, for gender-based discrimination after he received a credit limit that was 20 times higher than what his wife was offered &#8212; even though the couple filed joint tax returns and his wife had a higher credit score than he did.</p>
<p>Hansson&#8217;s tweet storm detailing the problem ending up going viral, generating responses from several others, including Apple co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/stevewoz/status/1193425587773198336">Steve Wozniak</a>, who claimed they had similar experiences when applying for the Apple Card with their partners.</p>

<p>David&#8217;s wife, Jamie Heinemeier Hansson, had also penned a blog post <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90429224/i-applied-for-an-apple-card-what-they-offered-was-a-sexist-insult">documenting</a> her experiences in more detail.</p>
<p>The numerous consumer complaints soon drew the attention of the New York Department of Financial Services, which then <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-09/viral-tweet-about-apple-card-leads-to-probe-into-goldman-sachs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched an investigation</a> into Goldman Sachs&#8217; credit card practices in order to see if gender-based discrimination was taking place, as alleged.</p>
<p>The NYDFS report, first spotted today by <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/23/goldman-sachs-cleared-of-apple-card-discrimination-claims">Appleinsider</a>, notes that Goldman Sachs re-reviewed the credit files of the some of the women who had been initially been offered dramatically lower credit scores than their spouses, and decided to raise their limits to match those of their spouses. At the time, the bank also eliminated the six-month waiting period for appeals on credit decisions.</p>
<p>These actions seemed to indicate that the Apple Card algorithms were making bad calls on credit worthiness, potentially even on the basis of gender; but the Department says that&#8217;s not the case &#8212; though it did stress the need or credit score reforms and updating existing laws around credit access.</p>
<p>The NYDFS said it reviewed several thousands pages of record and written responses from Apple and Goldman Sachs, interviewed witnesses, met with representatives from Apple and the bank, and analyzed the bank&#8217;s underwriting data using a data set covering nearly 400,000 New York applicants. It also interviewed the consumers who had complained of discrimination.</p>
<p>The Department concluded that there was no &#8220;unlawful discrimination&#8221; against applicants under fair lending law. However, statements made by the Superintendent of Financial Services Linda A. Lacewell, did stress that there is still discrimination built into the credit lending system itself, and the way credit scores can lead to unequal access to credit.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we found no fair lending violations, our inquiry stands as a reminder of disparities in access to credit that continue nearly 50 years after the passage of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) ,&#8221; <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr202103231">Lacewell said</a>. &#8220;The report also notes that the use of credit scoring in its current form and laws and regulations barring discrimination in lending are in need of strengthening and modernization to improve access to credit. Consumer frustration with the Apple Card policy of not permitting an account holder to add an authorized user drew attention to the following: a person who relies on a spouse&#8217;s access to credit, and only accesses those accounts as an authorized user, may incorrectly believe they have the same credit profile as the spouse. This is one part of a broader discussion we must have about equal credit access,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>One common factor among the consumers who complained was a belief that a spouse who had access to the same shared bank account or other shared assets, like credit cards &#8212; even if only as authorized users &#8212; would receive the same credit terms as their spouses. But the way the system works today, underwriters don&#8217;t have to consider an authorized user the same as an account holder, and they may consider other factors, too. Combined, these are what led to the lower lending decisions, the investigation found.</p>
<p>The Department said that, when asked, Goldman Sachs was able to document underwriting that determined its lending decisions for the consumer complaints. Gender was not a factor, but spouses&#8217; credit scores, indebtedness, income, credit utilization, missed payments and other credit history elements were. None of the factors identified was an &#8220;unlawful basis&#8221; for a credit determination, the Department said.</p>
<p>Of course, the credit score system itself is one<a href="https://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/credit-score-gender-pay-gap/"> that overall, favors men</a>. (And <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/01/many-minorities-avoid-seeking-credit-due-to-decades-of-discrimination.html">specifically</a>, white men). There is no one single reason as to why that&#8217;s the case, but often has to do with women&#8217;s role as a primary caregiver, combined with how the credit scoring model operates. This is a system that needs reform, but as it relates to the Apple Card program and discrimination complaints, it was &#8220;lawfully&#8221; used to make the Apple Card lending decisions.</p>
<p>However, the Department did point out that there was a lack of transparency around Apple Card&#8217;s lending decisions &#8212; noting that although it was able to obtain the data about the bank&#8217;s decision for these complaints, the impacted consumers could not. It also suggested Apple could have offered a more robust appeals process, instead of requiring a six-month wait.</p>
<p>Apple has since responded to some of the issues raised, including by launching &#8220;Path to Apple Card&#8221; last year, which helps applicants follow steps that lead to an Apple Card approval. To date, more than 70K consumers have enrolled in this program and nearly 5,000 have been approved. Apple also updated its website with more information about how Apple Card approvals work. And now it&#8217;s in the process of adding support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/01/apple-card-multi-user-support-ios-14-5/">for Apple Card family sharing features</a> &#8212; meaning, authorized users. This would address issues around spouses not being able to gain access to the higher credit lending limits at least.</p>
<p>But this investigation highlighted the problems Apple faced by pairing its trusted brand with a credit card issued by a traditional lender and the accompanying crummy banking practices consumers hate, as well as how a lack of transparency had undermined trust in the lending decisions that were made.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs offered a statement regarding the investigation&#8217;s findings.</p>
<p>&#8220;We appreciate the Department of Financial Services’ thorough investigation and welcome its conclusion of no fair lending violations. We remain committed to providing fair and equal access to credit,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Hansson, whose original tweet set this whole investigation into motion, has this to say:</p>
<p>&#8220;This read like a press release from Goldman Sachs, and ignores the specific facts in our case. My wife had a HIGHER credit score than I did, yet was determined to be worth a tenth the credit. There’s zero transparency in the credit assessment process, applicants can’t tell why they’re being denied, and Goldman Sachs and Apple employees don’t even seem to know. The algorithmic black box outcomes continue, there’s no possibility of doing audits, and unfair outcomes continue. Total regulatory failure.&#8221;</p>
