										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.flextock.com/">Flextock</a>, one of the 10 African startups from the recent Y Combinator winter batch, has bagged an impressive pre-seed round </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> two months after graduation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The five-month-old company, which helps consumers and businesses manage e-commerce and fulfillment operations &#8212;  from warehousing and logistics to delivery and cash collection &#8212; has closed a $3.25 million pre-seed investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it stands, this is a record high for the MENA region, which also had a record-high two months ago in fellow Egyptian and YC winter batch startup Dayra</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The fintech company raised $3 million in debt and equity.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-mossaad-50903438">Mohamed Mossaad</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/enas-siam-18150115/">Enas Siam</a> founded <a href="https://www.flextock.com/">Flextock</a> in September 2020. However, the company didn&#8217;t launch until January 2021</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/flextock-is-a-yc-backed-e-commerce-fulfillment-provider-for-africa-and-the-middle-east/">covered the company in March</a>, it had </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised $850,000 but CEO Mossaad made it clear that more was still to come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investors in this round include Egyptian VC Foundation Ventures, Y Combinator, MSA Capital, CRE Ventures, Alter Global, Abdul Latif Jameel Technology Fund, B&amp;Y Ventures Partners and Access Bridge Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also received angel investments from an unnamed Sequoia Capital scout and investors in the GCC region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flextock currently serves the Egyptian market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It leverages proprietary software to offer merchants end-to-end e-commerce fulfillment and logistics solutions on demand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since its launch, the company claims to have signed more than 100 merchants to its platform, with thousands of stock-keeping units (SKUs). The company also says it is growing 25% week-on-week. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the last two months we launched different products to help merchants grow their brands more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">efficiently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; Mossaad told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; We&#8217;ve built various partnerships with different logistics services providers in the market to offer merchants an E2E experience, quadrupled the number of merchants and doubled the size of our team</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flextock wants to capture a large </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of MENA&#8217;s $25 billion e-commerce logistics market, and Mossaad says the funding will help with that ambition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to put the funding into strengthening its presence in Egypt, technology, recruitment and regional expansion before the end of the year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the MENA region, Flexport will face competition from Trella, another Egyptian logistics company backed by YC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The accelerator has now invested in four logistics and digital freight startups, including Nigeria&#8217;s Kobo and SEND, ever since it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">successfully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> backed Flexport in 2014</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite having a global operation, the freight forwarder is testing the waters in the MENA region &#8212; on the Flexport website, there&#8217;s a role for a Partnerships Manager, Turkey &amp; Middle East. Although Flexport has freight forwarding and custom partners in the region, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">its interest in deepening reach in MENA might have spurred it to examine other opportunities. Flextock appears to be one as the Egyptian company revealed that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it received a &#8220;strategic investment&#8221; from the logistics giant in this round.   </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Mossaad said that having Flexport onboard not only serves as a strong vote of confidence to the company&#8217;s growth potential but will help it build a regional interconnected network of e-commerce logistics services providers by leveraging their wide network of partners around the world</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, it will be interesting to see how this investment plays out in the foreseeable future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Mazen Nadim, the managing partner at Foundation Ventures, Flextock&#8217;s e-commerce fulfillment and logistics play will be key to realizing the regional dominance it craves</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We recognize the massive opportunity in logistics presented by the rise of e-commerce in the region,” he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Flextock is building the underlying infrastructure so that any e-commerce player can scale their operations on-demand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flextock&#8217;s investment continues the series of seven-figure pre-seed rounds that have become more prevalent in the African tech scene</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. No less than six startups (including Flextock) have raised $1 million or more in this round in the past year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They include Egypt&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zedny,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Cassbana and Flick; and Nigeria&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/nigerian-fintech-okra-raises-3-5m-backed-by-accenture-ventures-and-susa-ventures/">Okra</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/nigerias-autochek-raises-3-4m-for-car-sales-and-service-platform/">Autochek</a>, with the latter raising the largest pre-seed investment yet in Africa at $3.4 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More money for the edtech boom: Munich-based <a href="https://www.studysmarter.de/en/">StudySmarter</a>, which makes digital tools to help learners of all ages swat up &#8212; styling itself as a &#8216;lifelong learning platform&#8217; &#8212; has closed a $15 million Series A.</p>
<p>The round is led by sector-focused VC fund, Owl Ventures. New York-based Left Lane Capital is co-investing, along with Lars Fjeldsoe-Nielsen (ex WhatsApp, Uber and Dropbox; now GP at Balderton Capital), and existing early stage investor Dieter von Holtzbrinck Ventures (aka DvH Ventures).</p>
<p>The platform, which launched back in 2018 and has amassed a user-base of 1.5M+ learners &#8212; <span style="font-weight: 400;">with a 50/50 split between higher education students and K12 learners, and with main markets so far in German speaking DACH countries in Europe </span>&#8212; uses AI technologies like natural language processing (NLP) to automate the creation of text-based interactive custom courses and track learners&#8217; progress (including by creating a personalized study plan that adjusts as they go along).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>StudySmarter claims its data shows that 94% of learners achieve better grades as a result of using its platform.</p>
<p>While NLP is generally most advanced for the English language, the startup says it&#8217;s confident its NLP models can be transferred to new languages without requiring new training data &#8212; claiming its tech is &#8220;scalable in any language&#8221;. (Although it concedes its algorithms increase in accuracy for a given language as users upload more content so the software itself is undertaking a learning journey and will necessarily be at a different point on the learning curve depending on the source content.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how StudySmarter works: Users input their study goals to get recommendations for relevant revision content that&#8217;s been made available to the platform&#8217;s community.</p>
<p>They can also contribute content themselves to create custom courses by uploading assets like lecture slides and revisions notes. StudySmarter&#8217;s platform can then turn this source material into interactive study aids &#8212; like flashcards and revision exercises &#8212; and the startup touts the convenience of the approach, saying it enables students to manage all their revision in one place (rather than wrangling multiple learning apps).</p>
<p>In short, it&#8217;s both a (revision) content marketplace <em>and</em> a productivity platform for learning &#8212; as it helps users create their own study (or lesson) plans, and offers them handy tools like a digital magic marker that automatically turns highlighted text into flashcards, while the resulting &#8220;smart&#8221; flashcards also apply the principle of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/yak-tack-is-a-super-simple-app-to-boost-vocabulary/">spaced repetition learning</a> to help make the studied content stick.</p>
<p>Users can choose to share content they create with other learners in the StudySmarter community (or not). The startup says a quarter (<span style="font-weight: 400;">25%) of its users are creators, and that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">80% of the content they create is shared. </span>Overall, it says its platform provides access to more than 25 million pieces of shared content currently.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s topic agnostic, as you&#8217;d expect, so course content covers a diverse range of subjects. We&#8217;re told the most popular courses to study are: Economics, Medicine, Law, Computer Science, Engineering and school subjects such as Maths, Physics, Biology and English.</p>
<p>Regardless of how learners use it, the platform uses AI to nudge users towards relevant revision content and topics (and study groups) to keep extending and supporting their learning process &#8212; making adaptive, ongoing recommendations for other stuff they should check out.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">The ease of creating learning materials on the StudySmarter platform results in a democratization of high-quality educational content, driven by learners themselves,&#8221; is the claim.   </span></p>
<p>As well as user generated content (UGC), StudySmarter&#8217;s platform hosts content created by verified educationists and publishers &#8212; and there&#8217;s an option for users to search only for such verified content, i.e. if they don&#8217;t want to dip into the UGC pool.</p>
<p>&#8220;In general, there is no single workflow,&#8221; says co-founder and CMO Maurice Khudhir. &#8220;We created <span class="il">StudySmarter</span> to adapt to different learner types. Some are very active learners and prefer to create content, some only want to search and consume content from other peers/publishers.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our platform focuses on the art of learning itself, rather than being bound by topics, sectors, industries or content types. This means that anyone, regardless of what they’re learning, can use StudySmarter to improve how they learn. We started in higher education as it was the closest, most relevant market to where we were at the time of launch. We more recently expanded to K12, and are currently running our first corporate learning pilot.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Gamification is a key strategy to encourage engagement and advance learning, with the platform dishing out encouraging words and emoji, plus rewards like badges and achievements based on the individual&#8217;s progress. Think of it as akin to Duolingo-style microlearning &#8212; but where users get to choose the subject (not just the language) and can feed in source material if they wish.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Duolingo EC-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/embed/#?secret=lejQl2O6jP" data-secret="lejQl2O6jP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>StudySmarter says it&#8217;s taken inspiration from tech darlings like Netflix and Tinder &#8212; baking in recommendation algorithms to surface relevant study content for users -(a la Netflix&#8217;s &#8216;watch next&#8217; suggestions), and deploying a Tinder-swipe-style learning UI on mobile so that its &#8220;smart flashcards&#8221; can to adapt to users&#8217; responses.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Firstly, we individualise the learning experience by recommending appropriate content to the learner, depending on their demographics, demands and <span class="il">study</span> goals,&#8221; explains Khudhir. &#8220;For instance, when an economics student uploads a PDF on the topic of marginal cost, <span class="il">StudySmarter</span> will recommend several user-generated courses that cover marginal cost and/or several flashcards on marginal cost as well as e-books on <span class="il">StudySmarter</span> that cover this topic.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;In this way, <span class="il">StudySmarter</span> is similar to Netflix &#8212; Netflix will suggest similar TV shows and films depending on what you’ve already watched and <span class="il">StudySmarter</span> will recommend different learning materials depending on the types of content and topics you interact with.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;As well, depending on how the student likes to learn, we also individualise the learning journey through things such as the smart flashcard learning algorithm. This is based on spaced repetition. For example, if a student is testing themselves on microeconomics, the flashcard set will go through different questions and responses and the student can swipe through the flashcards, in a similar way to Tinder. The flashcards’ sequence will adapt after every response.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The notifications are also personalised &#8212; so they will remind the student to learn at particular points in the day, adapted to how the student uses the app.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">There&#8217;s also a scan functionality which uses OCR (optical character recognition) technology that lets users upload (paper-based) notes, handouts or books &#8212; and a sketch feature lets them carry out further edits, if they want to add more notes and scribbles.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once ingested into the platform, this scanned (paper-based) content can of course also be used to create digital learning materials &#8212; extending the utility of the source material by plugging it into the platform&#8217;s creation and tracking capabilities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;A significant cohort of users access <span class="il">StudySmarter</span> on tablets, and they find this learning flow very useful, especially for our school-age pupils,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>StudySmarter can also offer educators and publishers detailed learning analytics, per Khudhir &#8212; who says its overarching goal is to establish itself as &#8220;the leading marketplace for educational content&#8221;, i.e. by using the information it gleans on users&#8217; learning goals to directly recommend (relevant) professional content &#8212; &#8220;making it an extremely effective distribution platform&#8221;, as he puts it.</p>
<p>In addition to students, he says the platform is being used by <span style="font-weight: 400;">teachers, professors, trainers, and corporate members &#8212; ie. to create content to share with their own students, team members, course participants etc, or just to publish publicly. And h</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e notes a bit of a usage spike from teachers in March last year as the pandemic shut down schools in Europe. </span></p>

<p>What about copyright? Khudir says they follow a three-layered system to minimize infringement risks &#8212; firstly by not letting users share or export any professional content hosted on the platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Uploaded documents like lecture notes and users&#8217; own comments can be shared within one university course/class in a private learning group. But only UGC (like flashcards, summaries and exercises) can be shared freely with the entire <span class="il">StudySmarter</span> community, if the user wants to.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;It’s important to note that no content is shared without the author’s permission,&#8221; he notes. &#8220;We also have a contact email for people to raise potential copyright infringements. Thanks to this system, we can say that we never had a single copyright issue with universities, professors or publishers.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another potential pitfall around UGC is quality. And, clearly, no student wants to waste their time revising from poor (or just plain wrong) revision notes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">StudySmarter says it&#8217;s limiting that risk by tracking how learners engage with shared content on the platform &#8212; in order to create quality scores for UGC &#8212; monitoring factors like how often such stuff is used for learning; how often the students who study from it answer questions correctly; and by looking the average learning time for a particular flashcard or summary, etc.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We combine this with an active feedback system from the students to assign each piece of content a dynamic quality score. The higher the score is, the more often it is shown to new users. If the score falls below a certain threshold, the content is removed and is only visible to the original creator,&#8221; he goes on, adding: &#8220;We track the quality of shared content on the creator level so users who consistently share low-quality content can be banned from sharing more content on the platform.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are unlikely to be quality issues with verified educator/publisher content. But since it&#8217;s professional content, StudySmarter can&#8217;t expect to get it purely for free &#8212; so it says it &#8220;mostly&#8221; follows revenue-sharing agreements with these types of contributors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is also sharing data on learning trends and to help publishers reach relevant learners, as mentioned above. So the information it can provide education publishers about potential customers is probably the bigger carrot for pulling them in.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We are very happy to say that the vast majority of our content is not created or shared on </span><span class="il" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">StudySmarter</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> for any financial incentive but rather because our platform and technology simply make the creation significantly easier,&#8221; says Khudir, adding: &#8220;We have not paid a single Euro to any user on </span><span class="il" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">StudySmarter</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to create content and do not intend to do so going forward.&#8221; </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">It&#8217;s still early days for monetization, which he says isn&#8217;t front of mind yet &#8212; with the team focused on building out the platform&#8217;s global reach &#8212; but he notes that the model allows for a number of b2b <span style="font-weight: 400;">revenue streams, adding that t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hey&#8217;ve been doing some early b2b monetization by working with employers and businesses to promote their graduate programs or to support recruitment drives. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The new funding will be put towards <span style="font-weight: 400;">product development and supporting the platform&#8217;s global expansion, per <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Khudir</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’ve run successful pilots in the U.K. and U.S. so they’re our primary focus to expand to by Q3 this year. In fact, following a test pilot in the U.K. in December, we became the number one education app within 24 hours (ahead of the likes of Duolingo, Quizlet, Kahoot, and Photomath), which bodes well!&#8221; he goes on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Brazil, India and Indonesia are key targets for us due to a wider need for digital education. We’re also looking to launch in France, Nordics, Spain, Russia and many more countries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the fact our platform is content-agnostic, and the technology that underpins it is universal, we’re able to scale effectively in multiple countries and languages. Within the next 12 months, we will be expanding to more than 12 countries and support millions of learners globally.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>StudySmarter&#8217;s subject-agnostic, feature-packed, one-stop-shop platform approach sets it apart from what <span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Khudir</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> refers to</span></span> as &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">single-feature apps&#8221;, i.e. which just help you learn one thing &#8212; be that Duolingo (only languages), or apps that focus on teaching a particular skill-set (like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/math-learning-app-photomath-raises-23-million-as-it-reaches-220-million-downloads/">Photomath</a> for maths equations, or dedicated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/14/yc-backed-py-is-a-duolingo-style-learn-to-code-app/">learn-to-code</a> apps/courses (and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/gift-guide-22-stem-toy-gift-ideas-for-every-little-builder/">toys</a>)). </span></p>
<p>But where the process of learning is concerned, there are lots of ways of going about it, and no one that suits everyone (or every subject), so there&#8217;s undoubtedly room for (and value in) a variety of approaches (which may happily operate in parallel). So it seems a safe bet that broad-brush learning platforms aren&#8217;t going to replace specialized tools &#8212; or (indeed) vice versa.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">StudySmarter names the likes of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/course-hero-a-profitable-edtech-unicorn-raises-rare-cash/">Course Hero</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/studocu">StuDocu</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/quizlet-valued-at-1-billion-as-it-raises-millions-during-a-global-pandemic/">Quizlet</a> and <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net">Anki</a> as taking a similar broad approach &#8212; while simultaneously claiming they&#8217;re not doing it in &#8220;quite the same, holistic, end-to-end, all-in-one bespoke platform for learners&#8221; way.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Albeit, some of those edtech rivals are doing it with a lot more capital already raised. So StudySmarter is going to need to work smart and hard to localize and grab students&#8217; attention as it guns for growth far beyond its European base.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa&#8217;s insurance market stands at a 3% penetration rate, per a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Middle%20East%20and%20Africa/Africas%20insurance%20market%20is%20set%20for%20takeoff/SVGZ-AfricaInsurance-Ex1.svgz">McKinsey study</a> in 2018 comparing six insurance regions on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If the South African market </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is excluded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this number drops to a measly 1.12%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike other parts of the world, most African insurance providers neglect the importance of tailored and affordable insurance products to the average African consumer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <a href="https://www.lami.world/">Lami Technologies</a>, a startup out of Kenya armed with $1.8 million in seed money, is looking to change that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was led by</span><a href="https://www.accion.org/how-we-work/invest/accion-venture-lab"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Accion Venture Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a seed-stage investment firm that supports financial services targeted at underserved markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other VCs that participated include AAIC, Consonance, P1 Ventures, Acuity Ventures, The Continent Venture Partners and Future Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low insurance uptake in Africa is somewhat due to the traditional distribution of insurance policies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">customarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rely on brick-and-mortar channels to sell and process policies. This takes a long processing cycle and has poor customer satisfaction and higher distribution costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sequentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the ways premiums </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are paid</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is affected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. From the McKinsey report in 2018, the total gross written premiums (GWP) in Eastern Africa was $3.3 billion. In comparison, South Africa did $48.3 billion worth of GWP that same year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, CEO <a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/jihan-abass-09b609125">Jihan Abass</a> founded the company in 2018 to democratize insurance products in Kenya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For us, the main problem we wanted to solve was that 97% of Africans don&#8217;t buy insurance. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were trying to understand the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">methodology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> behind that, especially in Kenya where there are over 50 insurance companies but the penetration level is 2.4%,&#8221; she told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Kenyan insurtech startup Pula raises $6M Series A to derisk smallholder farmers across Africa&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/kenyan-insurtech-startup-pula-raises-6m-series-a-led-by-tlcom-capital/embed/#?secret=DAEcVJg4bk" data-secret="DAEcVJg4bk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The driving force for us was making insurance </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">widely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We felt that building the technological infrastructure to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilitate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the distribution of insurance was the best way to increase the penetration level in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But selling </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to consumers would be a meticulous process as they rarely buy insurance from trusted organizations, let alone a third-party company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Lami adopted a B2B2C approach to leverage the trust already built by platforms that converse with customers daily and innovate around it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Via an API, it allows businesses like banks, startups, and organizations to offer digital insurance products to their users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The product can also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> partner businesses to manage their own insurance needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some customers like Stanbic Bank in Kenya use Lami&#8217;s API to run insurance operations; HR platform WorkPay makes insurance products available to the businesses using its platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With over 20 insurance writers, the company is also launching an insurance marketplace on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/jumia-co-ceo-jeremy-hodara-talks-african-e-commerce-and-his-companys-path-to-profitability/">e-commerce platform Jumia</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can get a quote for motor, medical or other tailored insurance products through its API</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also can customize the benefits and adjust the premium to suit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them, get their policy documents and access claims</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it takes about 90 days for claims to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be processed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for an average African insurer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abass said Lami has reduced this to a week &#8212; it is one way the three-year-old company has developed trust with customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2147706" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2147706" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2147706" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg?w=680" alt="Jihan Abbas - Founder &amp; CEO of Lami" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg 1008w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jihan-Abbas-Founder-CEO.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2147706" class="wp-caption-text">Jihan Abbas (Founder &amp; CEO)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another challenge that Lami has been able to overcome is getting insurance companies onboard</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the CEO, transitioning from a traditional way of offering insurance to digital distribution channels only worked because Lami began to show early the value of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> customer experience and journey which requires getting the right insurance to the right customer at the right time</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is what makes Lami stand out, Abass continued. It co-designs products with its underwriting partners. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And approaching design in this manner helps the businesses to offer unique insurance products to their underlying customer base</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She illustrates an offering with a bus-booking platform where passengers&#8217; insurance points </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are calculated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a per-trip basis</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It counts when they board the bus and stops when they alight. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She believes an innovative process like this will take the continent&#8217;s insurance play to a more desirable place</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there&#8217;s huge potential in the insurance industry. Despite the low penetration, the annual market is worth more than $60 billion a year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people are starting to open their eyes to insurance as opposed to other financial services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the insurtech startup has sold more than 5,000 policies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has partnered with more than 25 active underwriters, including Britam, Pioneer and Madison Insurance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These underwriters help distribute more than 30 products from medical and employee benefits to motor and device insurance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lami will use the seed investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to hire more people, improve its technology and grow its presence across Africa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accion Venture Lab is placing a bet on Lami&#8217;s embedded finance play. Here&#8217;s what its African director, Ashley Lewis said of the investment. “&#8230; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By embedding customized insurance within businesses that customers know and trust, Lami is making insurance accessible for underserved populations in Africa and enabling them to build financial resilience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lami&#8217;s investment also represents a spark in a Kenyan tech ecosystem where being both an indigenous and female founder is an incongruous mix</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A <a href="https://www.timoncapital.com/african-startup-compensation-survey">study</a> in 2019</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed that Kenya had the strongest presence of expat co-founders of any of the Big Four tech ecosystems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the country has a better female co-founder representation than other countries (1 in 4), the percentage of those from Kenya is about 12%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a handful of female founders who have raised million-dollar rounds. Though Abass sits </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">comfortably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in this illustrious club, it took thick skins and confidence in her product to get in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The funding landscape in Kenya is generally biased towards male founders and in East Africa, especially to foreign founders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So it was a lot harder to get investors excited and onboard with us. For us, we&#8217;ve built something quite exciting, although it took some time. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One key thing why we wanted to make this publicized is so other female founders can see that there&#8217;s an opportunity to do the same too,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; she said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many publishers are focused on converting visitors to subscribers, but there’s another important bracket: people who want to view a premium article or video, but not enough to sign up for a subscription. <a href="https://www.fewcents.co/">Fewcents</a>, a Singapore-based fintech startup that enables publishers to take “micropayments” for individual pieces of content, announced today it has raised $1.6 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>Fewcents can be used to monetize articles, video and podcasts. It accepts 50 currencies and is meant to serve as a complementary stream of revenue to advertisements and subscriptions. Its current clients include India’s Dainik Jagran, which has a readership of 55 million; Indonesian news site DailySocial; and streaming video site Dailymotion. The company, which monetizes by sharing revenue with digital publishers, also struck a partnership with Jnomics Media to expand in Europe.</p>
<p>M Venture Partners and Hustle Fund participated in the round, as well as angel investors from some of the top fintech, adtech and media companies: Koh Boon Hwee (fomer chairman of DBS Bank); Kenneth Bishop (former managing director of Southeast Asia at Facebook); Jeremy Butteriss (head of partnerships at Stripe); Shiv Choudhury (partner and managing director of the Boston Consulting Group); Francesco Alberti (former APAC regional sales director for Bloomberg Media Distribution); Lisa Gokongwei-Cheng (Summit Media president); Prantik Mazumdar (Dentsu managing director), Saurabh Mittal (Mission Holdings chairman and founder) and Nitesh Kripalani (former director and country head of Amazon Video India).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fewcents was launched last year by Abhishek Dadoo and Dushyant Khare (pictured above). Dadoo’s previous startup Shoffr, an online-to-offline attribution platform, was <a href="https://affle.com/media/affle_news/singapores-o2o-platform-shoffr-acquired-by-microsoft-backed-affle">acquired by Affle</a> in 2019. Khare spent 12 years working at Google, including as director of strategic partnerships in Southeast Asia and India.</p>
<p>In an email, Dadoo and Khare told TechCrunch that only 1% to 5% of publishers’ active users are willing to commit to a monthly subscription. The majority are casual or referred users, and publishers rely on advertising to monetize that traffic.</p>
<p>Content creators are experimenting with micropayments, and other services include Flattr, which allows people to make one-time contributions and Axate’s pay-per-article tools. But publishers still<a href="https://www.cjr.org/opinion/micropayments-subscription-pay-by-article.php"> debate how effective the model is</a> and last year, TechCrunch reported that Google decided not to launch a tipping feature for sites.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5OjtLf0YEV"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/google-contributor-donate-tips/">Google ditched tipping feature for donating money to sites</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google ditched tipping feature for donating money to sites&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/google-contributor-donate-tips/embed/#?secret=5OjtLf0YEV" data-secret="5OjtLf0YEV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>To successfully implement a pay-per-content model, publishers not only need to produce compelling content, but also make it extremely easy for people to pay for it. For Fewcents, this means solving three key challenges, Dadoo and Khare said. First, they need to create a ubiquitous platform, since casual users won’t want to sign up for a new service every time they visit another site. It also needs to accept cross-border payments in local currency using the most popular payment methods, like digital wallets. And publishers need to be able to manage digital rights, like how long someone has access to content.</p>
<p>Publishers also need to determine price points that won’t turn away buyers, but will generate substantial enough revenue. Fewcents currently uses existing traffic data to manually price each piece of content. “Based on the supply-demand curve within each geography, we retroactively change the price to get the best revenue results,” Dadoo said. “However, as we develop our AI algorithms, the intent is to dynamically suggest the pricing depending on the geography and the semantics of the content.”</p>
<p>Khare said that by unbundling content, Fewcents can also provide deeper data than pageviews, helping them understand the preferences of specific markets and user segments, and develop customized “micro-bundles.” He added that Fewcents’ goal is to be able to automatically recommend customized content bundles for each user.</p>

<h2>Are startup valuations about to fall?</h2>
<p>Hello, friends! <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> here to talk to you for a hot second about money. Then we’ll get into startups, venture capital, what Big Tech is up to and more. I promise. But hang with me for a moment.</p>
<p>Tech stocks got hammered today: The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell by more than 2%. Cloud stocks endured twice the damage. What happened? The U.S. government said that it might raise interest rates. So what? Well, when rates were low, lots of money that might have been invested elsewhere was instead <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/a-theory-about-the-current-ipo-market/">funneled into tech stocks</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/inside-the-us-epic-first-quarter-venture-capital-results/">VC funds that invest in startups</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now, with the government saying that it might shake up the current state of affairs, investors are responding by selling tech stocks. Bessemer Venture Partners investor Byron Deeter noted the drop, <a href="https://twitter.com/bdeeter/status/1389617299783512067">tweeting</a> that after a “brutal few days in the clouds,” with software stocks off “~5% today and ~10% on the week,” he was curious if valuations are “just taking a breather after a massive 2020” or starting “a broader reset.”</p>
<p>That’s a great question. More on the underlying economics of the situation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/the-current-narrative-explaining-why-tech-stocks-are-getting-hammered/">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/10/what-do-investors-bidding-up-tech-shares-know-that-the-rest-of-us-dont/">here</a>. Now, into startup-land.</p>
<h2>Twitter doubles down on subscriptions</h2>
<p>If you were curious about how Twitter was going to pursue its subscription strategy, the answer, to a degree, is buying startups. Today Big Tweet <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/twitter-acquires-distraction-free-reading-service-scroll-to-beef-up-its-subscription-product/">announced that it is buying Scroll</a>, a startup that charges its users a fee, providing them with an ad-free experience on various media sites. Scroll then split its user fee with those sites.</p>
<p>A neat model, yeah? It’s a bit like the startup called Contenture that TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/21/the-anti-ad-network-contenture-shuts-its-doors/">covered a few times back in 2009</a>. Only Scroll made more progress than Contenture did. And your humble servant was not a co-founder at Scroll.</p>
<p>Regardless, the Scroll-Twitter deal matters because the social media company is busy rolling up startups and products into its ecosystem to better craft a set of services that may help it monetize more effectively over the long haul. <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahintampa?lang=en">Sarah</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Scroll] will become a part of Twitter’s larger plans to invest in subscriptions, the company says, and will later be offered as one of the premium features Twitter will provide to subscribers. Premium subscribers will be able to use Scroll to easily read their articles from news outlets and from Twitter’s own newsletters product, Revue, another recent acquisition that’s already been integrated into Twitter’s service. When subscribers use Scroll through Twitter, a portion of their subscription revenue will go to support the publishers and the writers creating the content, explains Twitter in an announcement.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">Twitter vs. Substack</a>? Yep. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">Twitter vs. Clubhouse</a>? Yep. And if Twitter can help media companies better monetize and thus not die? Well, then it’s Twitter versus <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/the-only-take-about-the-future-of-media-is-that-media-is-the-future/">the a16z media operation</a>. I didn&#8217;t really expect a Jack versus Marc 2021 but am here for it all the same.</p>

<h2>A typical day in today’s startup funding market</h2>
<p>There was a cornucopia of startup news today on the site, so I’ve narrowed it a bit to get you what you need in a hurry. Also, shoutout to <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann</a> for covering half of it all by herself.</p>
<p>Here’s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/honeybook-raises-155m-at-1b-valuation-to-help-smbs-freelancers-manage-their-businesses/">HoneyBook raises $155M at $1B+ valuation to help SMBs, freelancers manage their businesses</a> &#8212; Tiger participated in this particular Series D led by Durable Capital.

That’s one hell of a COVID-era growth cycle.</li>

Perhaps F1 is that expensive.</li>
</ul>
<p>To round out our startup and venture capital notes, here are two more bits of news: Austin-based Multicoin Capital has raised a $100 million fund to “further capitalize on rampant excitement in the crypto world,” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/multicoin-capital-debuts-100-million-venture-fund-to-bet-on-crypto-startups-and-tokens/">per our own reporting</a>. Oh, and London-based seed investment fund Stride VC <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/londons-stride-vc-raised-second-138-6m-seed-fund-hunts-for-third-partner/">has raised a £100 million fund</a>.</p>
<h2>Advice and analysis from Extra Crunch</h2>
<h3 style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">How to break into Silicon Valley as an outsider</h3>
<p>There is no magic spell that will induce an investor to meet with you. As with most things in life, it all comes down to who you know and what you have to offer.</p>
<p>“Nothing beats building human networks,” says Domm Holland, CEO and co-founder of Fast. “That’s the way that you’re going to get this done in terms of fundraising.”</p>
<p>Since its founding in 2019, Fast has raised $124 million across three rounds as it lands new users and partners like Stripe for its one-click checkout product. In this interview, Holland, a native Australian, shares actionable advice for other outsiders with startup dreams.</p>
<p>“Raising money isn’t the only thing,” Holland says. “You’ve got to hire people, you’ve got to build a team, you’ve got to build customers and suppliers, and you’ve got to build entire ecosystems.</p>

<h2>The enterprise strikes back</h2>
<p>Before we get into the enterprise news, here’s what you want to read about: Tesla spent $3 (not a typo) to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/tesla-taps-tiny-startups-tech-to-build-cheaper-cleaner-batteries/">purchase patents relating to battery tech</a> that we think could really matter.</p>
<p>On the enterprise front, <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller?lang=en">Ron</a> has two stories today from tech giants that matter. The first is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/sap-ceo-christian-klein-looks-back-on-his-first-year/">an interview with SAP CEO Christian Klein</a>. SAP, you will recall, spun out Qualtrics a little bit ago. What’s ahead for the software giant? Ron is on the case!</p>
<p>From the same pen, Box’s time in the barrel continues as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/starboard-value-puts-box-on-notice-that-its-looking-to-take-over-board/">some of its largest public shareholders are agitating</a> to “inject [Box’s] board with still more new blood, taking a swipe at the Box leadership team while it was at it.” This is a fight worth watching as it could encourage, or discourage, more unicorns from going public.</p>
<p>Finally from Big Tech, some good news. Namely that Instagram is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/instagram-adds-a-captions-option-for-stories-and-soon-reels/">working on improving its caption tech</a>, which could help with accessibility. And our own Twitter-free Devin reports that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/microsofts-reading-progress-makes-assessing-reading-levels-easier-for-kids-and-teachers/">Microsoft wants to help kids read</a>.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>We asked everyone on Twitter about their experience trying to learn a foreign language, and you can <a href="https://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1389664946103984137">weigh in here.</a> Some of you have tried using Duolingo (with success!) and some shockingly got through German class in junior high without learning a single sentence of the language. Regardless of your personal experience, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/">give the Duolingo EC-1 a read</a> and learn about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-origin/">how the company started</a>, how they figured out how to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-monetization/">make money</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-future/">what’s up next for them</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier today <a href="https://twitter.com/alexrkonrad/status/1389685887953420295?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">recent dog-parent</a> Alex Konrad and fellow Forbes staffer <a href="https://twitter.com/ElizaHaverstock">Eliza Haverstock</a> broke <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizahaverstock/2021/05/04/billcom-is-set-to-acquire-utah-billion-dollar-software-startup-divvy/?sh=58f0ce673915">the news that Divvy</a>, a Utah-based corporate spend unicorn, is considering selling itself to Bill.com for a price that could top $2 billion. For the fintech sector, it&#8217;s big news.</p>
<p>Corporate spend startups including Ramp and Brex are raising <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/spend-management-startup-ramp-confirms-115m-raise-1-6b-valuation/">rapid-fired rounds</a> at ever-higher valuations and growing at venture-ready cadences. Their growth and its resulting private investment were earned by a popular approach to offering corporate cards, and, increasingly, the group&#8217;s ability to build software around those cards that took into account a greater portion of the functionality that companies needed to track expenses, manage spend access, and, perhaps, save money.</p>
<p>The latter category was what <a href="http://ramp.com">Ramp</a> focused on when it launched. It worked. More recently Ramp added expense tracking efforts to its own software suite. And <a href="http://brex.com">Brex</a>, an early leader in its efforts to get corporate cards into the hands of smaller, and more nascent businesses, has also built out its software efforts. So much so that the company, in conjunction <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/brex-raises-425m-at-a-7-4b-valuation-as-the-corporate-spend-war-rages-on/">with its huge recent fundraise</a>, announced that it will begin offering a software package for a monthly fee.</p>
<p>Competitors like <a href="https://www.airbase.com/">Airbase</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/spend-control-focused-airbase-adds-23-5m-to-its-series-a-as-it-posts-quick-growth/">charge for their code</a>, while some, like <a href="http://Divvy.com">Divvy</a>, traditionally have not.</p>
<p>Enter Bill.com. As the software work from the corporate spend startups has improved, it may have begun cutting into the corporate payments and expense software categories. For Bill.com in the payments world, and Expensify in the expense universe, that possible incursion could prove to be a growth-retarding concern. Thus, it makes sense to see Bill.com decide to take on the yet-private corporate spend startups that are playing the field; why not absorb a growing customer base and fend off competition in a single move?</p>
<p>To get a better handle on how the startups that compete with Divvy feel about the deal, TechCrunch reached out to both Ramp CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/eglyman">Eric Glyman</a>, and Brex CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/hdubugras?lang=en">Henrique Dubugras</a>. We&#8217;ll start with Glyman, who broadly agrees with our read of the situation:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[Revel's founder and CEO discusses what he learned from building the company, how its business strategy has evolved, and what lies ahead.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s only been three years since they hit the streets and Revel&#8217;s blue electric mopeds have already become a common sight in New York, San Francisco and a growing number of U.S. cities. However, Revel founder and CEO Frank Reig has set his sights far beyond building a shared moped service.</p>
<p>In fact, since the beginning of 2021, Revel has launched an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/shared-scooter-startup-revel-adds-electric-bike-subscriptions-to-its-business/">e-bike subscription service</a>, an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/electric-moped-startup-revel-launches-an-ev-charging-business/">EV charging station </a> venture and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/revel-launches-an-all-electric-rideshare-service-with-a-fleet-of-50-teslas/">an all-electric rideshare service</a> driven by a fleet of 50 Teslas.</p>
<p>So we caught up with Reig to talk about what he learned from building the company, how Revel&#8217;s business strategy has evolved, and what lies ahead.</p>
<p>Before we get to the good stuff, here&#8217;s some background:</p>
<p>The idea for Revel seems like it came from the classic entrepreneur&#8217;s guidebook: Reig had a need that no existing company addressed. He&#8217;d seen mopeds used as major, if not dominant, forms of transportation as he traveled around Europe, Asia and Latin America, and he wondered why this logical (and fun) mode of transport was largely absent from American cities in general, and in his hometown, New York City, in particular.</p>
<p>So in 2018, Reig quit his job, raised $1.1 million from 57 people, and launched a small pilot program involving 68 mopeds in Brooklyn. In May 2019, he raised $4 million in VC funding, which helped him expand to 1,000 electric mopeds across Brooklyn and Queens. Revel secured another $33.8 million in September 2019, in a round that included funding from Ibex Investments, Toyota Ventures, Maniv Capital, Shell and Hyundai, according to Reig. This has allowed the founder to execute a grander plan to build an electric mobility company.</p>
<p>The company now operates more than 3,000 e-mopeds in New York City, and has another 3,000 across Washington, D.C., Miami, Oakland, Berkeley and San Francisco.</p>
<p><b>TechCrunch: You’ve added three new business lines and told us previously that you have more on the way. That’s a lot.</b></p>
<p><b>Frank Reig: </b>Yes, we have had a busy start to 2021! We began the year announcing our fast-charging stations across the city that will help fill the large gap in infrastructure to support the wide-scale adoption of EVs. We launched our e-bike subscription program to offer New Yorkers another way to navigate their city, and with our newly announced electric ride-sharing program, we are solving the &#8220;chicken and egg&#8221; problem of EV charging and demand. We are focused on building out these business lines and our moped business as well and very much looking forward to what is to come.</p>
<p><b>When shared micromobility companies expand, they often just offer different vehicles. You seem to be going, &#8220;Ok, we’ll offer a different vehicle — an e-bike, but it’s a subscription. And we’re also doing electric vehicle chargers, and let&#8217;s add an EV rideshare to the mix.&#8221; It’s pretty broad.</b></p>
<p>If we’re talking about electrifying mobility in major cities, it starts with infrastructure. And we’re the company rolling up our sleeves and doing it now by building that infrastructure and operating fleets. Because in a city like New York, the infrastructure does not exist for electric mobility.</p>
<p>There are a few Tesla superchargers around the city, usually behind parking paywalls, so you have to pay the garage to even use it. And, of course, you need a Tesla for that infrastructure to even be relevant. And when you think about other public fast-charging access points in the city, they are few and far between. We’re building 30 in one site and many more beyond that in 2021.</p>
<p>New York is a complicated city to operate in, so it’s easier for us to add e-bikes as a service because I already have the infrastructure and on-the-ground operations that we built with the mopeds. I have multiple warehouses throughout this city. I have full-time staff that I&#8217;ve employed, from field technicians to mechanics, and a fleet of over 3,000 vehicles on the streets in New York. So it’s a natural extension of the platform to be able to add another product to it, to reach a new type of user, or to supplement the use case of our current moped users. All we needed to do was finance some e-bikes, and then you have another line of business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Investors gave Lyft&#8217;s value a small bump Tuesday after the American ride-hailing company reported results that weren&#8217;t quite as bad as the company, and Wall Street, had expected. Shares of the Uber competitor rose as much as 4.5% in after-hours trading following the disclosure of its financial performance from the first three months of the year. As of the time of writing those gains have fallen to a smaller 2.5% gain.</p>
<p>Turning to <a href="https://investor.lyft.com/financials-and-reports/quarterly-results/default.aspx">its results</a>, Lyft&#8217;s revenue fell 36%, to $609 million, in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period last year before the COVID-19 pandemic upended the economy, and, more specifically, the ride-hailing industry. That disparity in revenue can be directly tied to fewer active riders using its app. The company said it had 13.49 million active riders in the first quarter, down more 36.4% from the 21.2 million riders on its network in the same period last year.</p>
<p>But while the company&#8217;s ride base and revenues did fall, the drops were not as extreme as the company, or its backers, feared. As Lyft trumpeted at the top of its quarterly results deck, its revenue in the period was $59 million greater than the midpoint of its guidance. That&#8217;s investor speak for overshooting the mean, which apparently is an A+ in today&#8217;s market. Lyft also stuck by its previous forecast that it can achieve adjusted EBITDA profitability in the third quarter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="XTpRvbwZXW"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/ride-hailings-profitability-promise-is-in-its-final-countdown/">Ride-hailing’s profitability promise is in its final countdown</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ride-hailing’s profitability promise is in its final countdown&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/ride-hailings-profitability-promise-is-in-its-final-countdown/embed/#?secret=XTpRvbwZXW" data-secret="XTpRvbwZXW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company reported an adjusted EBITDA loss totaling $73 million in the first quarter, which was far better than anticipated. The company had expected a sharper $135 million adjusted EBITDA deficit for the period.</p>
<p>In addition to beating its own Q1 2021 goals to some degree, Lyft posted 7% revenue growth over what it recorded in Q4 2020, a detail that Lyft pointed to as a sign that the company was on the road to recovery. Lyft said ridership also improved some 8% from the previous quarter.</p>
<p>The company remains deeply unprofitable, despite its partial recovery. Lyft reported a net loss of $427.3 million in the first quarter, a 7.3% worsening from the $398.1 million net loss it recorded during the same period last year. Those losses included $180.7 million of stock-based compensation and related payroll tax expenses and $128.0 million related to changes to the liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historical periods.</p>
<p>Despite the losses, Lyft executives said they were buoyed by stronger rider demand, which has picked up in recent months.</p>
<p>The company also emphasized the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/lyft-sells-self-driving-unit-to-toyotas-woven-planet-for-550m/"> sale of its self-driving unit</a>, called Level 5, which was announced last week. Lyft sold the autonomous vehicle unit to Toyota&#8217;s Woven Planet Holdings subsidiary for $550 million, the latest in a string of acquisitions spurred by the cost and lengthy timelines to commercialize autonomous vehicle technology. Uber also sold its self-driving tech, work that was once seen as existential to the ride-hailing game.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RjfwXRMyRe"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/lyft-sells-self-driving-unit-to-toyotas-woven-planet-for-550m/">Lyft sells self-driving unit to Toyota&#8217;s Woven Planet for $550M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lyft sells self-driving unit to Toyota&#8217;s Woven Planet for $550M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/lyft-sells-self-driving-unit-to-toyotas-woven-planet-for-550m/embed/#?secret=RjfwXRMyRe" data-secret="RjfwXRMyRe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lyft&#8217;s so-called Level 5 division will be folded into Woven Planet Holdings once the transaction closes in the third quarter of 2021. Lyft will receive $550 million in cash, with $200 million paid upfront. The remaining $350 million will be made in payments over five years. About 300 people from Lyft Level 5 will be integrated into Woven Planet. The Level 5 team, which in early 2020 numbered more than 400 people in the U.S., Munich and London, will continue to operate out of its office in Palo Alto, California.</p>
<p>Lyft reported $2.2 billion of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>Considering the company&#8217;s quarter in aggregate it&#8217;s easy to make the bearish and bullish case regarding its performance. On the bearish side of things, Lyft is smaller, and losing even more money than it did in the year-ago period. And the road to recovery for its operations will prove winding as COVID-19 declines to fuck off, even in the face of rising global vaccination levels.</p>
<p>On the bullish side of things, the following chart from the Lyft earnings deck is perhaps the best single-image argument that could be made for Lyft&#8217;s recovery being deeply underway:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has launched 60 more of its Starlink internet broadband satellites — on &#8220;Star Wars Day,&#8221; no less, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/spacex-launches-60-more-starlink-satellites/">only five days after it launched the last batch</a>. The company has now delivered 420 Starlink satellites since the beginning of March, a sum that the SpaceX CEO and founder must not be aware of because he definitely would&#8217;ve tweeted about it by now if he was.</p>
<p>This launch took off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 3:01 PM ET (12:01 PM PT), and used a re-used Falcon 9 booster that has flown eight times previously. That booster also landed back on SpaceX&#8217;s floating drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean, tying the record for SpaceX&#8217;s reusable flight program in terms of flying resumed boosters, which it just set in March. This is the company&#8217;s 115th Falcon 9 launch so far.</p>
<p>SpaceX also shared updated figures around its Starlink consumer hardware, which is used to transmit and receive signals from the constellation for broadband service. The company has received &#8220;over half a million&#8221; pre-order reservations for its service so far, which includes advance deposits on the hardware.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That strong demand helps explain why there appears to be such a significant backlog in terms of fulfilling orders for Starlink. Customers looking to use the service can sign up via SpaceX&#8217;s Starlink <a href="https://www.starlink.com/">website</a>, and place a preorder for the kit, which induces the Starlink receiver, a router, power supplies and mounting hardware for your home.</p>
<p>The service is available to beta customers in six countries thus far, including Australia, New Zealand, the U.K., Mexico, the U.S. and Canada, but the goal is to continue to expand coverage to achieve near-global reach by the end of 2021 in terms of service availability, with a number of additional launches planned throughout the rest of the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">unceremoniously confiscated</a> Trump’s biggest social media megaphone months ago, but the former president might be poised to snatch it back.</p>
<p>Facebook’s Oversight Board, an external Supreme Court-like policy decision making group, will either restore Trump’s Facebook privileges or banish him forever on Wednesday. Whatever happens, it’s a huge moment for Facebook’s nascent experiment in outsourcing hard content moderation calls to an elite group of global thinkers, academics and political figures and allowing them to set precedents that could shape the world&#8217;s biggest social networks for years to come.</p>
<p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Trump’s suspension from Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/facebook-stormthecapitol-hashtag-dangerous-organizations-policy/">in the immediate aftermath of the Capitol attack</a>. It was initially a temporary suspension, but two weeks later Facebook said that the decision would be sent to the Oversight Board. &#8220;We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great,&#8221; Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in January.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s VP of Global Affairs Nick Clegg, a former British politician, expressed hope that the board would back the company&#8217;s own conclusions, calling Trump&#8217;s suspension an &#8220;unprecedented set of events which called for unprecedented action.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump inflamed tensions and incited violence on January 6, but that incident wasn&#8217;t without precedent. In the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man killed by Minneapolis police, President Trump ominously declared on social media “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” a threat of imminent violence <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/facebook-employees-stage-virtual-walkout-in-protest-of-companys-stance-on-trump-posts/">with racist roots that Facebook declined to take action against</a>, prompting internal protests at the company.</p>

<p>The former president skirted or crossed the line with Facebook any number of times over his four years in office, but the platform stood steadfastly behind a maxim that all speech was good speech, even as other social networks grew more squeamish.</p>
<p>In a dramatic address in late 2019, Zuckerberg evoked Martin Luther King Jr. as he defended Facebook&#8217;s anything goes approach. “In times of social turmoil, our impulse is often to pull back on free expression,&#8221; Zuckerberg said. &#8220;We want the progress that comes from free expression, but not the tension.&#8221; <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/before-showdown-with-congress-mark-zuckerberg-frames-the-conversations-facebook-would-rather-have">King&#8217;s daughter strenuously objected. </a></p>
<p>A little over a year later, with all of Facebook’s peers doing the same and Trump leaving office, Zuckerberg would shrink back from his grand free speech declarations.</p>
<p>In 2019 and well into 2020, Facebook was still a roiling hotbed of misinformation, conspiracies and extremism. The social network hosted thousands of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gretchen-whitmer-kidnapping-plot-facebook-groups-militias-fbi/">armed militias organizing for violence</a> and a sea of content amplifying QAnon, which moved from a fringe belief on the margins to a mainstream political phenomenon through Facebook.</p>
<p>Those same forces <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/facebook-stormthecapitol-hashtag-dangerous-organizations-policy/">would converge at the U.S. Capitol on January 6</a> for a day of violence that Facebook executives characterized as spontaneous, even though it had been festering openly on the platform for months.</p>

<h3>How the Oversight Board works</h3>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s Oversight Board <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/facebook-oversight-board-controversy/">began reviewing its first cases last October</a>. Facebook can refer cases to the board, like it did with Trump, but users can also appeal to the board to overturn policy decisions that affect them after they exhaust the normal Facebook or Instagram appeals process. A five member subset of <a href="https://oversightboard.com/meet-the-board/">its 20 total members</a> evaluate whether content should be allowed to remain on the platform and then reach a decision, which the full board must approve by a majority vote. Initially, the Oversight Board was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/facebooks-oversight-board-already-a-bit-frustrated-and-it-hasnt-made-a-call-on-trump-ban-yet/">only empowered to reinstate content</a> removed on Facebook and Instagram, but in mid-April began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/facebook-instagram-users-can-now-ask-oversight-panel-to-review-decisions-not-to-remove-content/">accepting requests to review controversial content that stayed up</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, the Oversight Board <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/20/facebook-oversight-doubts-trump-ban-483469">replaced departing member Pamela Karlan</a>, a Stanford professor and voting rights scholar critical of Trump, who left to join the Biden administration. Karlan’s replacement, PEN America CEO Suzanne Nossel, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-01-27/facebook-donald-trump-oversight-board">wrote an op-ed in the LA Times in late January</a> arguing that extending a permanent ban on Trump “may feel good” but that decision would ultimately set a dangerous precedent. Nossel joined the board too late to participate in the Trump decision.</p>
<p>The Oversight Board’s earliest batch of decisions leaned in the direction of restoring content that’s been taken down — not upholding its removal. While the board’s other decisions are likely to touch on the full spectrum of frustration people have with Facebook’s content moderation preferences, they come with far less baggage than the Trump decision. In one instance, the Oversight Board voted to restore an image of a woman’s nipples used in the context of a breast cancer post. In another, the board decided that a quote from a famous Nazi didn’t merit removal because it wasn’t an endorsement of Nazi ideology. In all cases, the Oversight Board can issue policy recommendations, but Facebook isn’t obligated to implement them — just the decisions.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KBABdai9mQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/facebook-instagram-users-can-now-ask-oversight-panel-to-review-decisions-not-to-remove-content/">Facebook, Instagram users can now ask &#8216;oversight&#8217; panel to review decisions not to remove content</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook, Instagram users can now ask &#8216;oversight&#8217; panel to review decisions not to remove content&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/facebook-instagram-users-can-now-ask-oversight-panel-to-review-decisions-not-to-remove-content/embed/#?secret=KBABdai9mQ" data-secret="KBABdai9mQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Befitting its DNA of global activists, political figures and academics, the Oversight Board might have ambitions well beyond one social network. Earlier this year, Oversight Board co-chair and former Prime Minister of Denmark Helle Thorning-Schmidt declared that other social media companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/facebook-oversight-board-other-social-networks-beyond-facebook/">would be &#8220;welcome to join&#8221; the project</a>, which is branded in a conspicuously Facebook-less way. (The group calls itself the “Oversight Board” though everyone calls it the &#8220;Facebook Oversight Board.&#8221;)</p>
<p>&#8220;For the first time in history, we actually have content moderation being done outside one of the big social media platforms,&#8221; Thorning-Schmidt declared, grandly. &#8220;That in itself… I don’t hesitate to call it historic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook’s decision to outsource some major policy decisions is indeed an experimental one, but that experiment is just getting started. The Trump case will give Facebook’s miniaturized Supreme Court an opportunity to send a message, though whether the takeaway is that it’s powerful enough to keep a world leader muzzled or independent enough to strike out from its parent and reverse the biggest social media policy decision ever made remains to be seen.</p>
<p>If Trump comes back, the company can shrug its shoulders and shirk another PR firestorm, content that its experiment in external content moderation is legitimized. If the board doubles down on banishing Trump, Facebook will rest easy knowing that someone else can take the blowback this round in its most controversial content call to date. For Facebook, for once, it’s a win-win situation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube today <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-main-stream-highlights-10th-annual-brandcast-delivered">gave advertisers a sneak peek</a> at its plans to make its video platform more shoppable. The company will soon be introducing a new interactive feature aimed at advertisers, called brand extensions, which will allow YouTube viewers to learn more about a product they see on the screen with a click of a button.</p>
<p>The new ad format will allow the advertiser to highlight their website link or another call-to-action in their connected TV video ad. The viewer can then click the option &#8220;send to phone,&#8221; which then sends that promotion or URL directly to their mobile device, without interrupting their viewing experience.</p>
<p>From the mobile device, the consumer could then shop the website as they would normally &#8212; browsing products, adding items to the cart and completing the transaction. But they can do it when they&#8217;re ready to engage with that product information, instead of having to stop their video to do so.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The advertisers will also be able to smartly target the ads to the correct audience, based on the video content. For example, a fitness video may feature a brand extension ad that shows a new pair of running shoes.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/dvcZcDjYgAI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Advertisers will be able to measure the conversions generated by these brand extensions directly in Google Ads, YouTube says.</p>
<p>In a related e-commerce ad effort, brands can now also add browsable product images to their <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads/new-ways-to-drive-action/">direct response video ads</a>, in order to encourage interested shoppers to click to visit their website or app.</p>
<p>These are only a few of the efforts YouTube has been working on with the goal of expanding further into e-commerce.</p>
<p>Consumers, and particularly younger Gen Z users, today like to watch videos and engage while they shop, leading to the emergence of numerous video shopping services &#8212; like <a href="https://popshoplive.com/">Popshop Live</a>, <a href="https://thentwrk.com/">NTWRK</a>, <a href="https://shopshops.live/">ShopShops</a>, <a href="https://talkshop.live/">TalkShopLive</a>, <a href="https://bambuser.com/">Bambuser</a> and others. Facebook has also invested in live shopping and video-based shopping across both Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, TikTok has become home to video-based e-commerce, with Walmart (which also tried to acquire a stake in the app when Trump was trying to force a sale) hosting multiple shopping <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/walmart-to-host-a-new-live-stream-shopping-event-on-tiktok-following-successful-pilot/">livestreams</a> in recent months. TikTok also found success with e-commerce as it has rolled out more tools to direct video viewers to websites through <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/tiktok-lays-out-plans-for-new-ecommerce-integrations-as-it-eyes-the-next-st/594717/">integrated</a> links and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/tiktok-invests-in-social-commerce-via-new-shopify-partnership/">integrations with Shopify,</a> for example.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jOMsy8iELR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/walmart-to-host-a-new-live-stream-shopping-event-on-tiktok-following-successful-pilot/">Walmart to host a new livestream shopping event on TikTok, following successful pilot</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Walmart to host a new livestream shopping event on TikTok, following successful pilot&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/walmart-to-host-a-new-live-stream-shopping-event-on-tiktok-following-successful-pilot/embed/#?secret=jOMsy8iELR" data-secret="jOMsy8iELR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But YouTube still has a sizable potential audience for video shopping, as it represents 40% of watch time of all ad-supported streaming services, per Comscore data. And of the top five streaming services in the U.S. that account for 80% of the connected TV market, only two are ad-supported, YouTube noted.</p>
<p>Ads are only one way YouTube will drive e-commerce traffic. Creators will also play a role.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-09/google-tries-to-turn-youtube-into-a-major-shopping-destination?sref=gni836kR">report from Bloomberg</a> this past fall said YouTube was asking creators to tag and track the products they were featuring in their clips. <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/neal-innovation-series/">YouTube later revealed more about this effort in February</a>, saying it was beta testing a shopping experience that lets viewers shop from their favorite creators, and that this would roll out more broadly in 2021.</p>
<p>Brand extensions are separate from that effort, however, as they&#8217;re focused on giving the advertiser their own means to drive a shopping experience from a video.</p>
<p>YouTube says the new brand extension ads are only the first of more interactive features the company has in store. The feature will roll out globally later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An issue every developer faces is dealing with problems on a live application without messing it up. In fact, in many companies such access is restricted. <a href="https://cased.com/">Cased</a>, an early stage startup, has come up with a solution to provide a way to work safely with the live application.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced a $2.25 million seed round led by Founders Fund along with a group of prestigious technology angel investors. The company also announced that the product is generally available to all developers today for the first time. It&#8217;s worth noting that the funding actually closed last April, and they are just announcing it today.</p>
<p>Bryan Byrne, CEO and co-founder at Cased says he and his fellow co-founders, all of whom cut their teeth at GitHub, experienced this problem of working in live production environments firsthand. He says that the typical response by larger companies is to build a tool in-house, but this isn&#8217;t an option for many smaller companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We saw firsthand at GitHub how the developer experience gets more difficult over time, and it becomes more difficult for developers to get production work done. So we wanted to provide a developer friendly way to get production work done,&#8221; Byrne explained.</p>
<p>He said without proper tooling, it forces CTOs to restrict access to the production code, which in turn makes it difficult to fix problems as they arise in production environments. &#8220;Companies are forced to restrict access to production and restrict access to tools that developers need to work in production. A lot of the biggest tech companies invest in millions to deliver great developer experiences, but obviously smaller companies don&#8217;t have those resources. So we want to give all companies the building blocks they need to deliver a great developer experience out of the box,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This involves providing development teams with open access to production command line tools by adding logging and approval workflows to sensitive operations. That enables executives to open up access with specific rules and the ability to audit who has been accessing the production environment.</p>

<p>They currently have five people including the four founders, but Byrne says that they have had a good initial reaction to the product and are in the process of hiring additional employees. He says that as they do, diversity and inclusion is a big priority for the founders, even as a very early stage company.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very prominent in our company handbook, so that we make sure we prioritize an inclusive culture from the very beginning because [ … ] we know firsthand that if you don&#8217;t invest in that early, it can really hold you back as a company and as a culture. Culture starts from day one, for sure,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As part of that, the company intends to be remote first even post-pandemic, a move he believes will make it easier to build a diverse company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will definitely be remote first. We believe that also helps with diversity and inclusion as you allow people to work from anywhere, and we have a lot of experience in leading remote-first culture from our time at GitHub, so we began as a remote culture and we will continue to do that,&#8221; he said.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Domm Holland, co-founder and CEO of e-commerce startup<a href="https://www.fast.co/"> Fast</a>, appears to be living a founder’s dream.</p>
<p>His big idea came from a small moment in his real life. Holland watched as his wife’s grandmother tried to order groceries, but she had forgotten her password and wasn’t able to complete the transaction.</p>
<p>“I just remember thinking it was preposterous,” Holland said. “It defied belief that some arbitrary string of text was a blocker to commerce.”</p>
<p>So he built a prototype of a passwordless authentication system where users would fill out their information once and would never need to do so again. Within 24 hours, tens of thousands of people had used it.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Nothing beats building human networks. That&#8217;s the way that you&#8217;re going to get this done in terms of fundraising.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Shoppers weren’t the only ones on board with this idea. In less than two years, Holland has raised $124 million in three rounds of fundraising, bringing on partners like<a href="https://www.indexventures.com/"> Index Ventures</a> and<a href="https://stripe.com/"> Stripe</a>.</p>
<p>Although the success of Fast’s one-click checkout product has been speedy, it hasn’t been effortless.</p>
<p>For one thing, Holland is Australian, which means he started out as a Silicon Valley outsider. When he arrived in the U.S. in the summer of 2019, he had exactly one Bay Area contact in his phone. He built his network from the ground up, a strategic process he credits to one thing: hard work.</p>
<p>On<a href="https://blog.foundersuite.com/how-to-raise-strategic-capital-e-g-from-stripe-domm-hollands-series-b-for-fast-co/"> an episode of the “How I Raised It” podcast</a>, Holland talks about how he built his network, why it’s important — not just for fundraising but for building the entire business — and how to avoid the mistakes he sees new founders make.</p>
<h2><strong>Reach out with relevance</strong></h2>
<p>Holland’s primary strategy in building networks sounds like an obvious one — reach out to relevant people.</p>
<p>“When I first got to the States, I wanted to build networks,” Holland said, “but I didn&#8217;t really know anyone here in the Bay Area. So I spent a lot of time reaching out to relevant people — people working in payments, people working in technology, people working in identity authentication — just really relevant people in the space working in Big Tech who were building large-scale networks.”</p>
<p>One of the people Holland connected with was <a href="https://twitter.com/abarrallen">Allison Barr Allen</a>, then the head of global product operations at Uber. Barr Allen managed her own angel investment fund, but Holland wasn’t actually looking for money when he reached out to her. He was much more interested in her perspective as the leader of an enormous financial services operation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Among the many, many tasks required of grade school teachers is that of gauging each student&#8217;s reading level, usually by a time-consuming and high-pressure one-on-one examination. Microsoft&#8217;s new <a href="https://education.microsoft.com/en-us/resource/50b18238">Reading Progress</a> application takes some of the load off the teacher&#8217;s shoulders, allowing kids to do their reading at home and using natural language understanding to help highlight obstacles and progress.</p>
<p>The last year threw most educational plans into disarray, and reading levels did not advance the way they would have if kids were in school. Companies like Amira are emerging to fill the gap with AI-monitored reading, and Microsoft aims to provide teachers with more tools on their side.</p>
<p>Reading Progress is an add-on for Microsoft Teams that helps teachers administer reading tests in a more flexible way, taking pressure off students who might stumble in a command performance, and identifying and tracking important reading events like skipped words and self-corrections.</p>
<p>Teachers pick reading assignments for each student (or the whole class) to read, and the kids do so on their own time, more like doing homework than taking a test. They record a video directly in the app, the audio of which is analyzed by algorithms watching for the usual stumbles.</p>
<p>As you can see in this video testimony by 4th grader Brielle, this may be preferable to many kids:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/z9g0-rzT8lE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>If a bright and confident kid like Brielle feels better doing it this way (and is now reading two years ahead of her grade, nice work Brielle!), what about the kids who are having trouble reading due to dyslexia, or are worried about their accent, or are simply shy? Being able to just talk to their own camera, by themselves in their own home, could make for much better reading — and therefore a more accurate assessment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not meant to replace the teacher altogether, of course — it&#8217;s a tool that allows overloaded educators to prioritize and focus better and track things more objectively. It&#8217;s similar to how Amira is not meant to replace in-person reading groups — impossible during the pandemic — but provides a similarly helpful process of quickly correcting common mistakes and encouraging the reader.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Four years ago, Argo AI made its first acquisition as a young, newly backed self-driving vehicle startup. Now, Argo says its acquisition of lidar company Princeton Lightwave is paying off and is poised to help it deliver autonomous vehicles that can operate commercially on highways and in dense urban areas starting next year.</p>
<p>Argo AI unveiled Tuesday details on a long-range lidar sensor that it claims has the ability to see 400 meters away with high-resolution photorealistic quality and the ability to detect dark and distant objects with low reflectivity. The first batch of these lidar sensors are already on some of Argo&#8217;s test vehicles, which today is comprised of Ford Fusion Hybrid sedans and Ford Escape Hybrid SUVs. By the end of the year, Argo&#8217;s test fleet will transition to about 150 Ford Escape Hybrid vehicles, all of which will be equipped with the in-house lidar sensor. Ford, an investor in and customer of Argo, plans to deploy autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing and delivery in 2022. Argo&#8217;s other investor and customer, Volkswagen, said it will launch commercial operations in 2025.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just the technical capabilities of the lidar sensor that matter, Argo CEO and co-founder Bryan Salesky told TechCrunch in a recent interview. The lidar sensor was developed to be cost-effective and manufactured at scale, two factors that matter for any company trying to commercialize autonomous vehicle technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When we first started, I knew that the market did not have an adequate long-range lidar,&#8221; Salesky said, who noted that while Waymo had developed its own lidar sensors with long-range capabilities it was not available for other developers to buy. &#8220;We decided to make an acquisition focused on plugging the hole for that long-range need. It has really been a game-changer for our self-driving system and has enabled us to be able to move really fast, to the point now where we&#8217;re starting to equip cars with the sensor, and it&#8217;s opening up testing in urban and highway environments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lidar, the light detection and ranging radar that measures distance using laser light to generate a highly accurate 3D map of the world, is considered by most in the industry a critical sensor required to safely deploy autonomous vehicles at a commercial scale. More than 70 companies, some of which have recently gone public via mergers with special purpose acquisition companies, are developing lidar — all claiming technical breakthroughs and cost benefits. And then there are the AV developers such as Cruise and Aurora, which just like Argo have acquired lidar companies in hopes of developing an in-house solution that will give them an edge over the competition and free them from working with an outside supplier like Velodyne.</p>
<p>Ford, which invested $1 billion into Argo, had also backed lidar maker Velodyne, the dominant supplier in the market. But progress within Argo has changed Ford&#8217;s stance. Veoneer, which announced in 2019 that it was leveraging Velodyne&#8217;s technology for a contract to supply the sensor to an unnamed AV customer, reported in February that it had lost its contract. It wasn&#8217;t clear exactly who the customer was, although many speculated it was Ford or Argo. That same month, Ford reported in a regulatory filing that it had dissolved its 7.6% stake in Velodyne, cementing its bet on Argo&#8217;s in-house lidar.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Assuming the sensor lives up to the claims, it should provide a substantial performance advantage over Velodyne and give them the flexibility to operate more safely at highway speeds,&#8221; said Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst with researcher Guidehouse Insights. Abuelsamid points to a few factors, including its wavelength and sensitivity, that could give Argo an edge.</p>
<h2>Low-speed urban areas to high-speed boulevards</h2>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Lidar sensors send out millions of beams or pulses every second to detect surrounding objects and then measure the return to create a point cloud or 3D image. That point cloud shows the objects and calculates their range.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Argo sensor is based on what it describes as Geiger-mode time of flight lidar, which it says uses beam detectors that can detect the smallest particle of light. Argo says its single-photon sensors are able to build up images of low-reflectivity objects like a black-painted car at a much greater distance than can a traditional linear time of flight lidar. Argo also said its lidar sensor operates at a wavelength above 1400 nanometers, which theoretically enables more power to help the range.</p>
<p>Abuelsamid noted that more common 905 nm lidars are largely limited to vehicles traveling about 40 mph to 45 mph, which suggests that Argo&#8217;s sensor could be used at highway speeds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Argo lidar’s use of the Geiger-mode photodiode and binning of pixels also contributes to the increased sensitivity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The ability to detect a single photon and then using the software to do statistical analysis to aggregate them and reject noise seems like it should help as well. Being able to pick up low reflectivity objects like truck tire treads or very black vehicles is important.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also noted that the Argo sensor is a mechanical spinning lidar, which is a common design based on the original Velodyne HDL-64. However, Argo&#8217;s lidar rotates the outer surface, a design decision to help throw off water from the sensor to help keep it clean.</p>
<p>Combining all of this will allow Argo to develop a self-driving system for a variety of use cases such as low-speed dense urban sectors, higher-speed boulevards that have a mix of pedestrian, cyclists and cars to contend with as well as highways.</p>
<p>Argo has spent much of its time testing in urban environments, specifically in Austin, Detroit, Miami, Palo Alto, Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C. But Volkswagen, the company&#8217;s newest backer and customer, is also interested in autonomous driving on highways. Argo plans to begin testing in additional cities this year, including Munich.</p>
<h2>Manufacturing partner and future applications</h2>
<p>Argo has been working for more than a year with a contract manufacturer that has experience in assembling optoelectronics. Hundreds of sensors will be manufactured by the end of the year and ramp up from there. Argo declined to name the contract manufacturer.</p>
<p>Argo&#8217;s self-driving system is designed to be agnostic, meaning it could be used in multiple business models. Argo&#8217;s customers Ford and VW will of course dictate what those business applications will be, and for now it is robotaxis and middle-mile delivery. However, Salesky noted that the sensors could be applied to trucking.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re kind of focused on goods movement and people movement, but I think trucking is something that we&#8217;re taking a hard look at,&#8221; Salesky said. &#8220;This isn&#8217;t something that we&#8217;ve prioritized yet, but we&#8217;re definitely keeping trucking open and I think it&#8217;s absolutely an interesting place for our technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Argo also has aspirations beyond manufacturing a long-range lidar for its own needs. Salesky told TechCrunch that the underlying technology can be packaged in other ways to create different types of sensors. &#8220;It is a really interesting potential license opportunity,&#8221; he said, cautioning that the priority is on autonomous vehicle applications.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a little too soon to start selling within the automotive realm, but it&#8217;s an opportunity that&#8217;s there,&#8221; Salesky said. &#8220;I do think that this underlying technology can be packaged in a bunch of ways to service other industries such as mining, agriculture, oil and gas.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Of the many frustrations of having a severe motor impairment, the difficulty of communicating must surely be among the worst. The tech world has not offered much succor to those affected by things like locked-in syndrome, ALS and severe strokes, but startup <a href="https://www.cognixion.com/">Cognixion</a> aims to with a novel form of brain monitoring that, combined with a modern interface, could make speaking and interaction far simpler and faster.</p>
<p><a href="https://one.cognixion.com/">The company&#8217;s One headset</a> tracks brain activity closely in such a way that the wearer can direct a cursor — reflected on a visor like a heads-up display — in multiple directions, or select from various menus and options. No physical movement is needed, and with the help of modern voice interfaces like Alexa, the user can not only communicate efficiently but freely access all kinds of information and content most people take for granted.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not a miracle machine, and it isn&#8217;t a silver bullet. Here&#8217;s how it got started.</p>
<h2>Overhauling decades-old brain tech</h2>
<p>Everyone with a motor impairment has different needs and capabilities, and there are a variety of assistive technologies that cater to many of these needs. But many of these techs and interfaces are years or decades old — medical equipment that hasn&#8217;t been updated for an era of smartphones and high-speed mobile connections.</p>
<p>Some of the most dated interfaces, unfortunately, are those used by people with the most serious limitations: those whose movements are limited to their heads, faces, eyes — or even a single eyelid, like Jean-Dominique Bauby, the famous author of &#8220;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the tools in the toolbox is the electroencephalogram, or EEG, which involves detecting activity in the brain via patches on the scalp that record electrical signals. But while they&#8217;re useful in medicine and research in many ways, EEGs are noisy and imprecise — more for finding which areas of the brain are active than, say, which sub-region of the sensory cortex or the like. And of course you have to wear a shower cap wired with electrodes (often greasy with conductive gel) — it&#8217;s not the kind of thing anyone wants to do for more than an hour, let alone all day every day.</p>
<p>Yet even among those with the most profound physical disabilities, cognition is often unimpaired — as indeed EEG studies have helped demonstrate. It made Andreas Forsland, co-founder and CEO of Cognixion, curious about further possibilities for the venerable technology: &#8220;Could a brain-computer interface using EEG be a viable communication system?&#8221;</p>
<p>He first used EEG for assistive purposes in a research study some five years ago. They were looking into alternative methods of letting a person control an on-screen cursor, among them an accelerometer for detecting head movements, and tried integrating EEG readings as another signal. But it was far from a breakthrough.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144512" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EEG-lab.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144512" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2144512" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EEG-lab.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EEG-lab.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EEG-lab.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EEG-lab.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EEG-lab.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EEG-lab.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EEG-lab.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EEG-lab.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EEG-lab.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2144512" class="wp-caption-text">A modern lab with an EEG cap wired to a receiver and laptop &#8212; this is an example of how EEG is commonly used. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> BSIP/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>He ran down the difficulties: &#8220;With a read-only system, the way EEG is used today is no good; other headsets have slow sample rates and they&#8217;re not accurate enough for a real-time interface. The best BCIs are in a lab, connected to wet electrodes — it&#8217;s messy, it&#8217;s really a non-starter. So how do we replicate that with dry, passive electrodes? We&#8217;re trying to solve some very hard engineering problems here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The limitations, Forsland and his colleagues found, were not so much with the EEG itself as with the way it was carried out. This type of brain monitoring is meant for diagnosis and study, not real-time feedback. It would be like taking a tractor to a drag race. Not only do EEGs often work with a slow, thorough check of multiple regions of the brain that may last several seconds, but the signal it produces is analyzed by dated statistical methods. So Cognixion started by questioning both practices.</p>
<p>Improving the speed of the scan is more complicated than overclocking the sensors or something. Activity in the brain must be inferred by collecting a certain amount of data. But that data is collected passively, so Forsland tried bringing an active element into it: a rhythmic electric stimulation that is in a way reflected by the brain region, but changed slightly depending on its state — almost like echolocation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144494" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cognixion-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144494" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2144494" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cognixion-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cognixion-2.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cognixion-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cognixion-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cognixion-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cognixion-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cognixion-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cognixion-2.jpg?resize=2048,1153 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cognixion-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2144494" class="wp-caption-text">The Cognixion One headset with its dry EEG terminals visible. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cognixion</p></div></p>
<p>They detect these signals with a custom set of six EEG channels in the visual cortex area (up and around the back of your head), and use a machine learning model to interpret the incoming data. Running a convolutional neural network locally on an iPhone — something that wasn&#8217;t really possible a couple years ago — the system can not only tease out a signal in short order but make accurate predictions, making for faster and smoother interactions.</p>
<p>The result is sub-second latency with 95-100% accuracy in a wireless headset powered by a mobile phone. &#8220;The speed, accuracy and reliability are getting to commercial levels — we can match the best in class of the current paradigm of EEGs,&#8221; said Forsland.</p>
<p>Dr. William Goldie, a clinical neurologist who has used and studied EEGs and other brain monitoring techniques for decades (and who has been voluntarily helping Cognixion develop and test the headset), offered a positive evaluation of the technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s absolutely evidence that brainwave activity responds to thinking patterns in predictable ways,&#8221; he noted. This type of stimulation and response was studied years ago. &#8220;It was fascinating, but back then it was sort of in the mystery magic world. Now it&#8217;s resurfacing with these special techniques and the computerization we have these days. To me it&#8217;s an area that&#8217;s opening up in a manner that I think clinically could be dramatically effective.&#8221;</p>
<h2>BCI, meet UI</h2>
<p>The first thing Forsland told me was &#8220;We&#8217;re a UI company.&#8221; And indeed even such a step forward in neural interfaces as he later described means little if it can&#8217;t be applied to the problem at hand: helping people with severe motor impairment to express themselves quickly and easily.</p>

<p>Sad to say, it&#8217;s not hard to imagine improving on the &#8220;competition,&#8221; things like puff-and-blow tubes and switches that let users laboriously move a cursor right, right a little more, up, up a little more, then click: a letter! Gaze detection is of course a big improvement over this, but it&#8217;s not always an option (eyes don&#8217;t always work as well as one would like) and the best eye-tracking solutions (like a Tobii Dynavox tablet) aren&#8217;t portable.</p>
<p>Why shouldn&#8217;t these interfaces be as modern and fluid as any other? The team set about making a UI with this and the capabilities of their next-generation EEG in mind.</p>

<p>Their solution takes bits from the old paradigm and combines them with modern virtual assistants and a radial design that prioritizes quick responses and common needs. It all runs in an app on an iPhone, the display of which is reflected in a visor, acting as a HUD and outward-facing display.</p>
<p>In easy reach of, not to say a single thought but at least a moment&#8217;s concentration or a tilt of the head, are everyday questions and responses — yes, no, thank you, etc. Then there are slots to put prepared speech into — names, menu orders and so on. And then there&#8217;s a keyboard with word- and sentence-level prediction that allows common words to be popped in without spelling them out.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve tested the system with people who rely on switches, who might take 30 minutes to make 2 selections. We put the headset on a person with cerebral palsy, and she typed our her name and hit play in 2 minutes,&#8221; Forsland said. &#8220;It was ridiculous, everyone was crying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Goldie noted that there&#8217;s something of a learning curve. &#8220;When I put it on, I found that it would recognize patterns and follow through on them, but it also sort of taught patterns to me. You&#8217;re training the system, and it&#8217;s training you — it&#8217;s a feedback loop.&#8221;</p>
<h2>&#8220;I can be the loudest person in the room&#8221;</h2>

<p>One person who has found it extremely useful is <a href="http://djofability.com/">Chris Benedict, a DJ, public speaker and disability advocate</a> who himself has Dyskinetic Cerebral Palsy. It limits his movements and ability to speak, but doesn&#8217;t stop him from spinning (digital) records at various engagements, however, or from explaining his experience with Cognixion&#8217;s One headset over email. (And you can see him demonstrating it in person in the video above.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2145827" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chris-dj.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2145827" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2145827" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chris-dj.jpg" alt="DJ Chris Benedict wears the Cognixion Headset in a bright room." width="450" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chris-dj.jpg 1954w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chris-dj.jpg?resize=117,150 117w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chris-dj.jpg?resize=234,300 234w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chris-dj.jpg?resize=768,983 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chris-dj.jpg?resize=531,680 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chris-dj.jpg?resize=1201,1536 1201w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chris-dj.jpg?resize=1601,2048 1601w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chris-dj.jpg?resize=39,50 39w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2145827" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cognixion</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Even though it’s not a tool that I’d need all the time it’s definitely helpful in aiding my communication,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;Especially when I need to respond quickly or am somewhere that is noisy, which happens often when you are a DJ. If I wear it with a Bluetooth speaker I can be the loudest person in the room.&#8221; (He always has a speaker on hand, since &#8220;you never know when you might need some music.&#8221;)</p>
<p>The benefits offered by the headset give some idea of what is lacking from existing assistive technology (and what many people take for granted).</p>
<p>&#8220;I can use it to communicate, but at the same time I can make eye contact with the person I’m talking to, because of the visor. I don’t have to stare at a screen between me and someone else. This really helps me connect with people,&#8221; Benedict explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s a headset I don&#8217;t have to worry about getting in and out of places, there is no extra bulk added to my chair that I have to worry about getting damaged in a doorway. The headset is balanced too, so it doesn’t make my head lean back or forward or weigh my neck down,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;When I set it up to use the first time it had me calibrate, and it measured my personal range of motion so the keyboard and choices fit on the screen specifically for me. It can also be recalibrated at any time, which is important because not every day is my range of motion the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alexa, which has been extremely helpful to people with a variety of disabilities due to its low cost and wide range of compatible devices, is also part of the Cognixion interface, something Benedict appreciates, having himself adopted the system for smart home and other purposes. &#8220;With other systems this isn’t something you can do, or if it is an option, it’s really complicated,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>As Benedict demonstrates, there are people for whom a device like Cognixion&#8217;s makes a lot of sense, and the hope is it will be embraced as part of the necessarily diverse ecosystem of assistive technology.</p>
<p>Forsland said that the company is working closely with the community, from users to clinical advisors like Goldie and other specialists, like speech therapists, to make the One headset as good as it can be. But the hurdle, as with so many devices in this class, is how to actually put it on people&#8217;s heads — financially and logistically speaking.</p>
<p>Cognixion is applying for FDA clearance to get the cost of the headset — which, being powered by a phone, is not as high as it would be with an integrated screen and processor — covered by insurance. But in the meantime the company is working with clinical and corporate labs that are doing neurological and psychological research. Places where you might find an ordinary, cumbersome EEG setup, in other words.</p>

<p>The company has raised funding and is looking for more (hardware development and medical pursuits don&#8217;t come cheap), and has also collected a number of grants.</p>
<p>The One headset may still be some years away from wider use (the FDA is never in a hurry), but that allows the company time to refine the device and include new advances. Unlike many other assistive devices, for example a switch or joystick, this one is largely software-limited, meaning better algorithms and UI work will significantly improve it. While many wait for companies like Neuralink to create a brain-computer interface for the modern era, Cognixion has already done so for a group of people who have much more to gain from it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["I think every founder I know thinks that their decks are shared a lot more. I don’t feel like that, but I know that comes from experience."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There’s a stark contrast between Oura’s deck and the others we pored through on Extra Crunch Live. The slides CEO Harpreet Rai brought to the event were the clear output of a more mature and confident company seeking out its Series B. It’s a company with a focus, aware of where it wants the product to go and do (and it went there, announcing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/fitness-ring-maker-oura-raises-100m/">a massive followup round</a> on Tuesday).</p>
<p>Then there’s that giant image of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, with the company’s smart ring adorning Harry’s right hand. From there, it’s a parade of celebrity faces: Will Smith, Lance Armstrong, Bill Gates, Arianna Huffington and Seth Rogen, to name a few.</p>
<p>It’s clearly been a wild half-dozen years since the company was founded. Rai joined up in 2018, not long before the company embarked on its $28 million Series B. Forerunner General Partner Eurie Kim got on board during the round.</p>
<p>“[I] enthusiastically took the meeting and Harpreet shared his story and the story of Oura. The deck is what we talked through,” says Kim. “Because I was a consumer, it was just a no-brainer that I knew what he was trying to build. So we were very excited to lead the round.”</p>
<p>Kim and Rai joined us on Extra Crunch Live to discuss the process of taking Oura to the next level &#8212; and beyond &#8212; as the product found a second (or third) life during the pandemic through partnerships with sports leagues like the NBA. And as we’re wont to do, we asked the pair to take a look and a handful of user-submitted pitch decks. If you&#8217;d like your deck to be reviewed by experienced founders and investors on a future episode, you can submit it <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">here</a>.</p>
<h2>On the hardness of hardware</h2>
<p>By the time Oura sought out its Series B, the startup had already progressed pretty far. Kim compares the first-generation product (circa 2016 &#8212; predating both Rai and Kim’s time with the company ) to a “Power Rangers ring.” You’ve got to start somewhere, of course &#8212; and if nothing else, the admittedly bulky original edition of the product served as a powerful proof of concept.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Crypto startups couldn&#8217;t be hotter as currencies push past all-time highs and investor appetite reaches mania for new projects. Crypto investment firms that have been investing in blockchain startups for years are not only beginning to see major movement from their portfolio, but are gaining renewed appetite from LPs after a lengthy crypto winter to make bigger, more audacious bets.</p>
<p>Austin-based <a href="https://multicoin.capital/">Multicoin Capital</a> has been around since 2017 investing in blockchain startups, cryptocurrencies and tokens with a venture fund and separate hedge fund. Today, the firm announced the raise of its second venture fund as it aims to further capitalize on rampant excitement in the crypto world. The new $100 million fund will help the company back new entrants in the space, including companies tackling DeFi, digital collectibles, Web3 and crypto-enabled infrastructure.</p>
<p>Multicoin&#8217;s team says that it has already been investing out of this fund for several months and it seems the timing is more aligned with the promotion of three of the firm&#8217;s employees &#8212; <a title="https://twitter.com/mattshap1" href="https://twitter.com/mattshap1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Shapiro</a>, <a title="https://twitter.com/Mable_Jiang" href="https://twitter.com/Mable_Jiang" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mable Jiang</a> and <a title="https://twitter.com/johnrobertreed" href="https://twitter.com/johnrobertreed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Robert Reed</a> &#8212; to partner status. The team is just 12, but is looking to expand as they build out their remote presence in other geographies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The firm&#8217;s previous bets include The Graph, Solana, Torus, StarkWare and Arweave, among others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been a wild couple of years for Oura. Last year, in particular, proved to be a major driver for the wearable fitness manufacturer. With the pandemic bringing professional sports to a screeching halt in 2020, a number of major leagues have adopted the ring, including the NBA, WNBA, UFC and NASCAR.</p>
<p>The company has also been making a major push into health research courtesy of UCSF, which has published peer-review studies around the ring’s temperature monitor. That feature in particular has made it a big draw for the aforementioned leagues, as temperature spikes could point to larger issues, including the early stages of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Today the company is announcing a $100 million Series C. The round, led by The Chernin Group and Elysian Park (the Dodgers’ investment arm), brings the wearable company’s total funding up to $148.3 million. New investors include Temasek, JAZZ Venture Partners and Eisai, joining existing investors Forerunner Ventures, Square, MSD Capital, Marc Benioff, Lifeline Ventures, Metaplanet Holdings and Next Ventures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company initially set itself apart with its form factor, joining a crowded field that largely revolved around the wrist. Clearly, however, it’s come into its own over the last few years. To date, it&#8217;s sold more than 500,000 rings.</p>
<p>“The wearables industry is transitioning from activity trackers to health platforms that can improve people&#8217;s lives,” CEO Harpreet Singh Rai said in a press release tied to the news. &#8220;Oura focused first on sleep because it’s a daily habit, and lack of sleep has been linked to worsening health conditions including diabetes, cardiac disease, Alzheimer’s, cancer, poor mental health, and more.”</p>
<p>The company says the round will go toward R&amp;D (both hardware and software development) and hiring, including additional marketing and customer experience. The round also sees the hiring of a number of key roles, including head of Science, Shyamal Patel; site leader Tommi Heinonen and Daniel Welch, who has been promoted to CFO.</p>
<p>“This year has shined a spotlight on gaps in our healthcare industry, and the increasing need for each of us to take control over our own health,” Forerunner Managing Director Eurie Kim said in the release. “Oura is emerging as the trusted leader and community in the space by empowering people with personalized data that provides actionable insights for health improvement.”</p>
