										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiktok" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tiktok">TikTok <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> this morning <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/">announced</a> a new set of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=en">Community Guidelines</a> that aim to strengthen its existing policies in areas like harassment, dangerous acts, self-harm and violence, alongside the introduction of four new features similarly focused on the community&#8217;s well-being. These include updated resources for those struggling with self-harm or suicide, opt-in viewing screens that hide distressing content, a text-to-voice feature to make TikTok more accessible and an expanded set of COVID-19-related resources.</p>
<p>While many of the topics were already covered by TikTok&#8217;s Community Guidelines ahead of today&#8217;s changes, the company said the updates add more specifics to each of the areas based on what behavior it&#8217;s seen on the platform, heard through community feedback and received via input from experts such as academics, civil society organizations and TikTok&#8217;s own Content Advisory Council.</p>
<p>One update is to the guidelines related to suicide and self-harm, which have now incorporated feedback and language used by mental health experts to avoid normalizing self-injury behaviors. Specifically, TikTok&#8217;s policy on eating disorder content has added considerations aimed at prohibiting the normalization of or the glorification of dangerous weight loss behaviors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2086947" style="width: 401px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086947" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2086947" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-and-Support.png?w=391" alt="" width="391" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-and-Support.png 808w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-and-Support.png?resize=86,150 86w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-and-Support.png?resize=173,300 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-and-Support.png?resize=768,1334 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-and-Support.png?resize=391,680 391w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-and-Support.png?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086947" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>Stronger policies on bullying and harassment now further detail the types of content and behaviors that aren&#8217;t welcome on TikTok, including doxxing, cyberstalking and a more extensive policy on sexual harassment. This one is particularly interesting, given that there have been some cases of TikTok users figuring out where anti-masker nurses worked &#8212; and at least <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/11/oregon-nurse-placed-on-leave-over-anti-mask-covid-19-tiktok.html">one incident led to the nurse being put on leave</a>. It&#8217;s unclear how TikTok will approach this sort of &#8220;doxxing&#8221; behavior, however, as it didn&#8217;t involve publishing a home address &#8212; only alerting an employer.</p>
<p>Another update expanded the guidelines around TikTok&#8217;s dangerous acts policy to more explicitly limit, label or remove content depicting dangerous acts and challenges. Through a new &#8220;harmful activities&#8221; section to the minor safety policy, TikTok reiterates that content promoting dangerous dares, games and other acts that may jeopardize the safety of youth is prohibited.</p>
<p>TikTok also updated its policy around dangerous individuals and organizations to focus on the issue of violent extremism. The new guidelines now describe in greater detail what&#8217;s considered a threat or incitement to violence, as well as the content that will be prohibited. This one is timely, too, as many Trump supporters have been pushing for a new civil war or other violence as a result of Trump losing the U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>In terms of new features, TikTok worked with behavioral psychologists and suicide prevention experts &#8212; including <a href="https://www.providence.org/en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.providence.org/en&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608059290014000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH2Ghej2gRlOM8_Hel95vzkHeDr3w">Providence</a>, <a href="https://samaritanshope.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://samaritanshope.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608059290014000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGa3So6LwR4KgxqsSGDv2hMqkZ7qw">Samarita<wbr></wbr>ns</a><a href="https://samaritanshope.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://samaritanshope.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608059290014000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGa3So6LwR4KgxqsSGDv2hMqkZ7qw"> of Singapore</a> and members of its U.S. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/transparency?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tiktok.com/transparency?lang%3Den&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608059290014000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5GwrqBOL67DLDSZ4wr4NkSDnGtw">Content Advisory Council</a> &#8212; to create new resources that include evidence-based actions users can take for searches related to self-harm. These new resources will appear when users search for terms like &#8220;selfharm&#8221; or &#8220;hatemyself.&#8221; Access to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Crisis Text Line will continue to be available for emergency support, as before.</p>
<p>TikTok will also introduce new opt-in viewing screens that will appear on top of videos of content some may find graphic or distressing. These videos are already ineligible for the For You feed, but may not be prohibited. For example, the screens might cover violence or fighting that&#8217;s not being removed due to documentary reasons; animals in nature doing something some find upsetting &#8212; like hunting and killing their prey; or otherwise scary stuff, like horror clips.</p>
<p>When TikTok becomes aware of this disturbing content through user flagging, it will apply the screens to the videos to reduce unwanted viewing. Users who then come across the video can either tap the button at the bottom of the screen to &#8220;skip video&#8221; or the other to &#8220;watch anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, a new text-to-voice feature, aimed at accessibility, allows people to convert their typed text to a voice that plays over it in a video. This follows TikTok&#8217;s recent launch of a feature to support people with <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/making-tiktok-more-accessible-to-people-with-photosensitive-epilepsy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/making-tiktok-more-accessible-to-people-with-photosensitive-epilepsy&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608059290014000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFalF2i7rrcKRjmgyUgRKoGL6PQMg">photosensitive epilepsy.</a></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086945" style="width: 353px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086945" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2086945" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg?w=343" alt="" width="343" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg?resize=76,150 76w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg?resize=151,300 151w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg?resize=768,1523 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg?resize=343,680 343w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg?resize=774,1536 774w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg?resize=1032,2048 1032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086945" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>TikTok is also adding questions and answers about COVID-19 vaccines to its in-app coronavirus resource hub. These will be provided by public health experts, like the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), for example, and will be linked to from the Discover page, search results and via banners on COVID-19 and vaccine-related videos. The company says its COVID-19 hub has already been viewed more than 2 billion times in the last six months. TikTok is partnering with <a href="https://teamhalo.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://teamhalo.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608059290014000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGGTpSMEEisQvuEk3aMJhFOE6Cm5w">Team Halo</a> as well, so scientists all over the world can share the progress being made on the vaccine through video updates.</p>
<p>TikTok has been fairly aggressive about moderating content on its platform. If you scroll through the feed long enough, you&#8217;ll find users lamenting about videos of theirs that were taken down for policy violations. You&#8217;ll also come across videos where users have reuploaded another person&#8217;s deleted video in order to respond to it. It even quickly addressed much of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/tiktok-takes-down-some-hashtags-related-to-election-misinformation-leaves-others/">the election misinformation</a> that was being spread in November by blocking top hashtags, like #RiggedElection and #SharpieGate.</p>
<p>Its new policies out today also include changes that address what&#8217;s been more recent user behavior, like the calls for violence following the election.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keeping our community safe is a commitment with no finish line,&#8221; said TikTok, in its announcement today about its updates. &#8220;We recognize the responsibility we have to our users to be nimble in our detection and response when new kinds of content and behaviors emerge. To that end, we&#8217;ll keep advancing our policies, developing technology to automatically detect violative content, building features that help people manage their TikTok presence and content choices, and empowering our community to help us foster a trustworthy environment. Ultimately, we hope these updates enable people to have a positive and meaningful TikTok experience,&#8221; the company said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon today is launching a way for customers to create custom clothing with a new service called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/amazonmadeforyou">Made for You</a>, which lets shoppers create a custom T-shirt to their exact measurements. But unlike some companies that <a href="https://www.mtailor.com/how-it-works.html">use mobile technology to scan and measure</a> your body from an app, Amazon Fashion&#8217;s Made for You service requires users to provide the company with their height, weight, body style, and two photos of themselves to get measured for their custom fit.</p>
<p>After users provide their data, they can then choose from a selection of eight different colorways, as well as preferred sleeve and shirt lengths, necklines and fabrics.</p>
<p>To get started with Made for You, users choose between the two types of fabrics to customize the design. This includes either the Medium-weight 100% Pima Cotton shirt or the Lightweight 56% Pima Cotton, 38% Modal, and 6% Elastane tri-blend options. They can then choose other aspects of their shirt &#8212; like either a slim, classic or relaxed fit, a crew or V-neck, and short or long sleeve length, for example.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The shirts can even include your name printed on the label, as a small perk.</p>
<p>When finished, customers can view the product they customized on a virtual body double before placing the order. The experience works both on web and inside the Amazon app.</p>
<p>The custom shirts cost $25 are available to all Amazon customers in the U.S., not just Prime members.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2087075" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Made-for-You-CX-3-Red-Shirt-.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Made-for-You-CX-3-Red-Shirt-.png 828w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Made-for-You-CX-3-Red-Shirt-.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Made-for-You-CX-3-Red-Shirt-.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Made-for-You-CX-3-Red-Shirt-.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Made-for-You-CX-3-Red-Shirt-.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Made-for-You-CX-3-Red-Shirt-.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Made-for-You-CX-3-Red-Shirt-.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /></p>
<p>At launch, influencers including <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blakescott/?hl=en">Blake Scott</a> (650K followers on Instagram), <a href="https://www.instagram.com/caralynmirand/?hl=en">Caralyn Mirand</a> (253K Instagram followers), and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/scoutthecity/?hl=en">Sai de Silva</a> (330K Instagram followers) are touting the new feature on Amazon&#8217;s behalf and are featured in its marketing.</p>
<p>Custom clothing is often seen as a luxury and this process does make it more affordable. That can be helpful for those who struggle with fit due to measurements that fall outside of traditional sizing. But the service also seems to be a pretty transparent attempt to grab customer data for the Amazon Fashion business.</p>
<p>Amazon, however, characterizes Made for You as part of its ongoing efforts to eliminate online shopping challenges &#8212; this time, size and fit. Over time, the company says it wants to expand Made for You with more styles and selection, based on customer feedback.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087064" style="width: 463px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087064" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2087064" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ryan-Clark.jpg?w=453" alt="" width="453" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ryan-Clark.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ryan-Clark.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ryan-Clark.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ryan-Clark.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ryan-Clark.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ryan-Clark.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ryan-Clark.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ryan-Clark.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2087064" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The retailer has been focused on its fashion business for years, having <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/04/27/68516/amazons-echo-look-rates-your-outfits-and-slurps-up-revealing-data/">experimented in the past</a> with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/29/how-echo-look-could-feed-amazons-big-data-fueled-fashion-ambitions/">Echo Look camera</a> that would help users rate their styling choices. Today, Amazon uses data from its social feature, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/finds/ref=s9_acss_bw_cg_ggwhead_9a1_w?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-2&amp;pf_rd_r=0HGYNCMMYWB7VAAG78C9&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=98c55ba7-fb82-44d8-b396-63413e7f5172&amp;pf_rd_i=19419848011">#FoundItOnAmazon</a> to feed images to &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=19419848011">Style by Alexa</a>&#8221; for fashion inspiration and to drive sales. And with Prime Wardrobe and its optional styling service, Amazon attempts to learn what its customers like to wear and then automate the shopping process by curating items to try on at home in batches.</p>
<p>Though Amazon didn&#8217;t explain how it may put the collected data to use to aid its Amazon Fashion business beyond custom clothing, it did say the data was securely stored and customers could delete their data at any time by tapping the profile icon at the top left of the Made for You home page. Amazon also says the uploaded photos aren&#8217;t stored and are deleted immediately after being used to create the virtual body double and determine measurements.</p>
<p>With Amazon&#8217;s goal with all these efforts is to improve online apparel shopping, it could potentially extend to other areas &#8212; for example, by helping Amazon build out its <a href="https://ww.fashionnetwork.com/news/Amazon-fashion-fostering-over-100-private-label-brands,1156429.html">dozens of private labels</a> in apparel. And with the added data on real-world customer sizing, the retailer could learn how to better cut its clothing for the best fit. It could even be working on systems that could later help customers select their right size just from a photo, perhaps.</p>
<p>Made for You is launching today in the U.S. across web and mobile.</p>

Welcome has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/welcome-raises-6m-to-help-your-company-hire-and-keep-employees/">managed the feat</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/skyflow-raises-17-5m-more-to-help-companies-protect-your-personal-data/">along with Skyflow</a> and others. Public&#8217;s Series C, therefore, fits into the trend of investors doubling down into startups that they think have potential.</p>
<p>After an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/30/the-second-wave-of-unicorn-layoffs-is-brutal/">initial freeze during the early pandemic months</a>, venture capitalists and other investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/3-investors-discuss-the-state-of-saas-investing-in-2020/">accelerated the pace</a> at which they deploy late-stage checks to upstart companies. Public&#8217;s Series C typifies the tendency, representing just over 72% of its total fundraising to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Public round also exemplifies another developing venture trend, namely that of existing investors preempting portfolio companies&#8217; proximate rounds. In this case <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/accel" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="accel">Accel <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> led the new investment. It also led Public&#8217;s Series A and B rounds.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vDByipQZZN"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/skyflow-raises-17-5m-more-to-help-companies-protect-your-personal-data/">Skyflow raises $17.5M more to help companies protect your personal data</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Skyflow raises $17.5M more to help companies protect your personal data&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/skyflow-raises-17-5m-more-to-help-companies-protect-your-personal-data/embed/#?secret=vDByipQZZN" data-secret="vDByipQZZN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But trends alone are not enough to pull any round together. So, TechCrunch got on the phone with Public co-founders Jannick Malling and Leif Abraham to better understand what investors see in the fintech upstart.</p>
<h2>Growth</h2>
<p>Public grew quickly in 2020, expanding its user base by a multiple of 10 since the start of the year.</p>
<p>According to Abraham, the company&#8217;s growth has been consistent instead of lumpy, expanding at around 30% each month. The co-founder also stressed that most of Public&#8217;s users find its service organically, implying that the startup&#8217;s marketing costs have not been extreme, nor its growth artificially boosted.</p>
<p>That user growth explains why Public was able to raise more. But why did it want to?</p>
<p>The founding duo told TechCrunch that they had plenty of cash in the bank from their preceding round, but saw the raise as a way to double-down on their model.</p>
<p>While competing services to Public also sport zero-cost trading, Public&#8217;s model hinges on a social focus (TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/as-investing-apps-boom-public-doubles-down-on-its-social-focus/">covered an element of Public&#8217;s social platform here</a>, for example). And in the eyes of its founders, Public gets better as more people use it.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yDK7YXVZDt"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/as-investing-apps-boom-public-doubles-down-on-its-social-focus/">As investing apps boom, Public doubles down on its social focus</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As investing apps boom, Public doubles down on its social focus&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/as-investing-apps-boom-public-doubles-down-on-its-social-focus/embed/#?secret=yDK7YXVZDt" data-secret="yDK7YXVZDt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So, the startup intends to use its new capital to continue investing into product work, keeping its flywheel alive.</p>
<p>That self-reinforcing dynamic works something like this: Public offers a place where investors can discuss and execute trades for free. Those same investors tell their friends about Public, who later show up and take part in the conversation. Those conversations are enriched by the new participants &#8212; as Public deals with securities, it only has users who have registered as themselves, limiting trolling &#8212; and the process repeats.</p>
<p>So far it has worked. How much longer Public and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/robinhood" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="robinhood">Robinhood <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and M1 and Wealthfront and others can continue to accrete net-new investors to their platforms is an open question, however.</p>
<h2>Revenue?</h2>
<p>Astute readers will note that we discussed Public&#8217;s growth in the above paragraphs only from a user perspective. What about revenue?</p>
<p>Like other companies that offer free stock trades, Public makes money from what&#8217;s called payment for order flow. It&#8217;s the routing of trades to different market makers. Robinhood <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/with-a-2021-ipo-in-the-cards-what-do-we-know-about-robinhoods-q3-performance/">generates oceans of income</a> from the practice, for example.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="km3bf1qhZA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/with-a-2021-ipo-in-the-cards-what-do-we-know-about-robinhoods-q3-performance/">With a 2021 IPO in the cards, what do we know about Robinhood&#8217;s Q3 performance?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;With a 2021 IPO in the cards, what do we know about Robinhood&#8217;s Q3 performance?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/with-a-2021-ipo-in-the-cards-what-do-we-know-about-robinhoods-q3-performance/embed/#?secret=km3bf1qhZA" data-secret="km3bf1qhZA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Before chatting with Public, I dug into its <a href="http://public.s3.com/rule606/apex/">trading partner Apex&#8217;s filings</a> to learn about its payment for order flow results from its recent filings. The resulting sums are somewhat modest for Apex&#8217;s collected clients. This means that Public&#8217;s revenue metrics, a portion of the aggregate sums, are even more unassuming.</p>
<p>Naturally, we were curious if the company had changed up its business model and thus had revenues heading into its new investment that we could not spot from external documentation. The founding team told TechCrunch that it had not changed its model, and that their company is more focused on user growth than near-term revenue targets.</p>
<p>This makes some sense. Public emphasized to TechCrunch that most of its users are long-term holders. The longer a user holds securities, the less they likely trade. That limits <em>trading</em> incomes like payment for order flow. So, trading likely won&#8217;t make a lot of money for the company.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s monetization plans remain opaque. This means that the company&#8217;s new check will not only fund its product work in terms of its social experience, but also, we presume, its future revenue generation.</p>
<p>You can look around the fintech market and find examples of ways that Public could further monetize its user base.</p>
<p>This is not to say that revenue at Public has not grown. It has. I asked the company if trading volume <em>generally</em> scales with user growth. It&#8217;s correlated, the founders said. So, we can infer that the company&#8217;s growing user base has executed more trades over time, as a whole.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see what Public builds next, and how soon we get a taste for its future plans for generating ample top line from its users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This is not a review of the 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E Sport SUV.</p>
<p>A few weeks back, I spent two short hours in Ford&#8217;s upcoming EV. I don&#8217;t feel comfortable declaring a conclusion with just a couple of hours behind the wheel. I need more time with the Mach-E, and after Ford reads this article, I&#8217;ll probably be last in line for long-term tests.</p>
<p>During my short time with the Mach-E, one thing became clear: The Mach-E should not be called a Mustang, and it should not be called an SUV.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By calling the Mach-E a Mustang SUV, Ford is selling buyers an experience not found in the Mach-E. This isn&#8217;t a fight over semantics. The Mach-E isn&#8217;t a sporty SUV in a traditional manner. For that, look at the Audi E-Tron Sportback or <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Model X. Those offer several key characteristics missing from the Mach-E SUV. They&#8217;re sturdy, stout and powerful, whereas the Mach-E feels small, loose and sloppy.</p>
<p>There are several areas of concern. I found the vehicle dynamics questionable. The throttle is nauseating, and the rear end has a hard time keeping traction. The range is poor compared to competitors; the AWD version gets 50 miles less than a comparable Tesla. And what&#8217;s more important in an electric vehicle than driving characteristics and electric range?</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2079337,2079341,2079330,2079339,2079338,2079336,2079335,2079332,2079334,2079340"]</p>
<h2>Early impressions</h2>
<p>A few weeks back I took a 2021 Mustang Mach-E AWD around a familiar route in lower Michigan. Every auto journalist knows this area by Hell, Michigan. Despite the name, it&#8217;s a lovely area with old-growth hardwoods lining gentle winding roads where cars can breathe. And for fun, turn off the main road for a bit of dipping and diving on gravel roads. This area was not kind to the Mach-E.</p>
<p>The test was short, but I was still left with several impressions.</p>
<p>The Mach-E bumbles around like an economy crossover. There&#8217;s nothing confident or reassuring about the ride or handling. Even with the Mustang name, the Mach-E doesn&#8217;t drive like a Mustang (hold your jokes; the latest Mustangs are fantastic). The Mach-E isn&#8217;t a car that can be thrown into a corner and expect to emerge safely. The body rolls, rear tires break loose and you lose respect for the Mustang name.</p>
<p>The throttle is touchy and over-expressive. Tap the peddle and Mach-E leaps forward. Combined with aggressive regenerative braking, the Mach-E takes some getting used to. I found the powertrain nauseating. Electric vehicles are an exercise in finesse. The electric motors need to provide power in a smooth, predictable fashion that&#8217;s exciting and confident without being overbearing. It&#8217;s a hard formula and something that few automakers have gotten right the first time.</p>
<p>I was immediately taken aback by the AWD Mach-E&#8217;s poor handling. Most modern EVs drive so well they&#8217;re boring. Not the Mach-E. The rear end is too lively for a pedestrian-vehicle, and not in a sporty manner. This is just sloppy and nauseating. The tires easily break free on everyday turns. Press down on the accelerator, turn the wheel and the vehicle often has to engage traction control to keep the rear wheels from spinning.</p>
<p>By insisting on marketing the Mach-E as sporty, Ford set the expectations on the capability outside of its technical ability. Things get loose when the driver leans into the performance aspects of the Mach-E. During my time with the Mach-E, there were several times I was rounding a normal corner and the back tires became unpredictable or took the car too wide. This is exaggerated with additional speed. I&#8217;m curious how the AWD system handles snow and ice. Several times during my test drive it struggled on gravel.</p>
<p>I later asked a Ford engineer about the tremendous amount of oversteer, and he replied, &#8220;Yeah, only if you drive it that way.&#8221; That stuck with me because I don&#8217;t think it was my fault. I don&#8217;t think I was driving the Mach-E around Ann Arbor, Michigan in an aggressive fashion, but even still, the roads were dry, and the traction control kicked on several times during my short drive. That shouldn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>The Mach-E performs better in a straight line. The acceleration is quick. With the go-pedal mashed to the floor, the Mach-E rears on its back legs and jumps forward with enthusiasm. Is it quicker than a Tesla? No, but it&#8217;s still quicker than most vehicles in its price range and plenty fast enough to speed away from a stop light.</p>
<p>The Mach-E has three driving modes. In the standard and economy mode, the throttle delivers power in a more refined method than the performance mode, which seems messy and crude. All three modes offer one-peddle driving through aggressive regenerative braking.</p>
<p>The electric range is another factor to consider with the Mach-E. The AWD version tops out at an EPA-estimated 270 miles compared to the 326 miles found in Tesla&#8217;s AWD Model Y. The RWD-only version of the Mach-E tops out at 300 miles per charge.</p>
<p>With such a short test, I&#8217;m unable to dive deep into the real-world battery range of the Mach-E. I need to live with the car and use it for a variety of tasks, both around town and long distance. All I can report is the results from my 2 hour drive: I average 2.7 miles to kilowatt-hour, I returned it with 112 miles remaining on the battery, which the vehicle says is 56%. I was driving the AWD model with the extended range battery. The EPA and Ford says this version is good for 270 miles per charge.</p>
<p>The Mach-E&#8217;s pricing is competitive with a starting price of $42,895. The AWD, extended-range version starts at $54,700 and heads north depending on options. Most U.S. buyers are eligible for a $7,500 tax credit. The Tesla Model 3 starts at $37,990. The long-range, AWD Model 3 that starts at $46,990; the Model Y crossover costs $49,990.</p>
<div data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-en-clipboard="true">Competitors have downsides, too. The Tesla Model 3 and Model Y are novel vehicles with class-leading range, but they&#8217;re not without flaws, including questionable build quality. Other vehicles like the Polestar 2 are fantastic but have less electric range and a higher starting price of $59,900.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2086643,2086642,2086640,2086638,2086634"]</p>
<p>The Mach-E&#8217;s interior is fantastic, and that was not a surprise. Ford builds some of the nicest interiors in its class, and the inside of the Mach-E is lovely.</p>
<p>Like most EVs, Ford took great steps to replace traditional automotive components with modern equivalents. Instead of a gauge cluster, a small, narrow LCD screen sits in front of the driver. It&#8217;s classy and efficient. A large LCD screen sits in the center stack for media playback and climate controls. A rotating knob is glued onto the screen at the bottom and provides physical volume control. I really like the volume knob.</p>

<p>The seats seem fine. I was only in them for two hours.</p>
<p>The inside is a bit cramped, but it&#8217;s acceptable for a small crossover. The driver sits in a commanding position, which could be the reason for the SUV designation. Two adults can sit in the back for a cross-town jaunt, but I wouldn&#8217;t want to sit back there for an extended amount of time, as legroom is lacking.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m frustrated about the vehicle&#8217;s dynamics, which overshadow fun features found within the Mach-E. Owners can use their smartphone as a key and preprogram navigation routes through a robust road-trip app. The doors are operated by a button, allowing for a cleaner exterior. Ford is even adding hands-free driving through an over-the-air-update, too. But these items hardly matters. Who cares if the cake&#8217;s pretty if it tastes like sadness?</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<p>My first impressions of the Mach-E are poor, and I went into this short test with excited optimism. For me, this Ford Mach-E was supposed to bring the joy of electric vehicles to the masses through a familiar nameplate and legacy manufacturer. I&#8217;m a Ford guy who lives in Michigan and looks at the Mach-E development with local pride. I&#8217;m disappointed.</p>
<p>Right now, based on first impressions, I can only recommend shoppers try competitors before buying the Ford Mustang Mach-E. I don&#8217;t think this vehicle is good enough to buy over a Tesla.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup hailing from far-flung Iceland is emerging as one of the key players in the race to distribute one of the key Coronavirus vaccines around the world. <a href="https://controlant.com/">Controlant</a> — which has a unique real-time supply chain monitoring technology based on GSM networks and is specifically geared to areas like pharmaceuticals and life sciences —  has confirmed it is providing its monitoring services to Pfizer as it delivers the mRNA-based Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine globally. The Controlant platform involves screen-based IoT tags which-link to GSM networks and then feed into web and mobile apps.</p>
<p>Last week the Governor of New York held up a box (see image above and video below) containing the vaccine, with an unidentified tag that looked like a Controlant GSM tracking device. TechCrunch contacted Controllant and the company confirmed that it was indeed their technology.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086846" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086846" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Controlant-Cold-Chain-as-a-Service-Solution.png" alt="Controlant Cold Chain as a Service Solution" width="720" height="480" class="size-full wp-image-2086846" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Controlant-Cold-Chain-as-a-Service-Solution.png 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Controlant-Cold-Chain-as-a-Service-Solution.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Controlant-Cold-Chain-as-a-Service-Solution.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Controlant-Cold-Chain-as-a-Service-Solution.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Controlant-Cold-Chain-as-a-Service-Solution.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086846" class="wp-caption-text">Controlant Cold Chain as a Service Solution</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In September Controlant secured $15 million in Series B funding to drive the market expansion of its real-time &#8216;Cold Chain as a Service&#8217; platform. It has largely Iceland-based investors including <a href="http://sjova.is">Sjova</a> and <a href="http://vis.is">VIS</a>. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/frumtak">Frumtak</a>, a VC firm in Iceland, first invested in Controlant in 2011. The recent financing brought Controlant’s total funding to date to $50 million. Frumtak recently sold 11% of its stake in Controlant (a transaction handled by <a href="https://www.arionbanki.is/english/">Arion Bank</a>) for close to $14 million, but will continue to hold a 13% stake through its Frumtak II fund.</p>
<p>In addition to the visibility and monitoring solutions that Controlant is providing to Pfizer, it’s also working directly with the U.S. Government, the CDC, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and stakeholders in &#8216;Operation Warp Speed&#8217;. The platform is being used throughout the entirety of the U.S. supply chain journey of the vaccines.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC) has issued <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with a fine of €450,000 (~$547k) for failing to promptly declare and properly document a data breach under Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>The decision is noteworthy as it&#8217;s the first such cross-border <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gdpr" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gdpr">GDPR <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> decision by the Irish watchdog, which is the lead EU privacy supervisor for a number of tech giants &#8212; having a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/lack-of-big-tech-gdpr-decisions-looms-large-in-eu-watchdogs-annual-report/">backlog</a> of some 20+ ongoing cases at this point, including active probes of Facebook, WhatsApp, Google, Apple and LinkedIn, to name a few.</p>
<p>&#8220;The DPC’s investigation commenced in January, 2019 following receipt of a breach notification from Twitter and the DPC has found that Twitter infringed Article 33(1) and 33(5) of the GDPR in terms of a failure to notify the breach on time to the DPC and a failure to adequately document the breach. The DPC has imposed an administrative fine of €450,000 on Twitter as an effective, proportionate and dissuasive measure,&#8221; the regulator writes in a press release.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The GDPR requires most breaches of personal data to be notified to the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours of the controller becoming aware of the breach.</p>
<p>The regulation also requires they document what data was involved and how they&#8217;ve responded to the security incident &#8212; in order that the relevant data supervisor can check against compliance.</p>
<p>In this case Twitter was found to have failed on both counts.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the social media company for comment, including asking whether it plans to accept the decision and pay up &#8212; or if it&#8217;s considering its legal options.</p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong>Twitter has now sent this statement, attributed to Damien Kieran, its chief privacy officer and global data protection officer:</p>
<blockquote><p>Twitter worked closely with the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) to support their investigation. We have a shared commitment to online security and privacy, and we respect the IDPC’s decision, which relates to a failure in our incident response process. An unanticipated consequence of staffing between Christmas Day 2018 and New Years’ Day resulted in Twitter notifying the IDPC outside of the 72 hour statutory notice period. We have made changes so that all incidents following this have been reported to the DPC in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>We take responsibility for this mistake and remain fully committed to protecting the privacy and data of our customers, including through our work to quickly and transparently inform the public of issues that occur. We appreciate the clarity this decision brings for companies and consumers around the GDPR’s breach notification requirements. Our approach to these incidents will remain one of transparency and openness.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company also told us that since this specific incident, where inadequate staffing over the 2018 holiday period led to a delay in reporting the breach, it has made all relevant incident reports to the DPC within the required 72 hour period.</p>
<p>The DPC&#8217;s decision relates to a breach that Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/17/twitter-bug-revealed-some-android-users-private-tweets/">publicly disclosed in January 2019</a> &#8212; when it said a bug in its ‘Protect your tweets’ feature could have meant some Android users who’d applied the setting to make their tweets non-public may have had their data exposed to the public Internet since as far back as 2014. (Though GPDR would only apply to data the bug exposed since May 2018.)</p>
<p>Since fessing up to the &#8216;Protect your tweets&#8217; bug, Twitter has had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/twitter-says-some-business-users-had-their-pivate-data-exposed/">plenty more egg on its face</a> where security is concerned &#8212; including suffering a high profile account hijacking episode <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/twitter-accounts-hacked-crypto-scam/">earlier this year</a>, after crypto-scam-spreading hackers gained network access credentials using a social engineering technique.</p>

<p>Ireland&#8217;s DPC, meanwhile, continues to face criticism for the length of time it&#8217;s taking to reach decisions on major cross-border GDPR cases where impacts on individual rights can scale to hundreds of millions of European Internet users.</p>
<p>Last year commissioner Helen Dixon said its first major GDPR decisions would come &#8220;early&#8221; in 2020.</p>
<p>In the event the first cross-border decision has crossed the line days before the end of the year &#8212; underlining the challenges for the bloc in effectively enforcing its digital rulebook against tech giants. (GDPR technically begun being applied in May 2018, although platform giants have faced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/19/french-court-slaps-down-googles-appeal-against-57m-gdpr-fine/">precious little enforcement to date</a>.)</p>
<p>In this specific case, some half a year extra was added to the decision timeline after a draft outcome Ireland submitted to other EU DPAs for review, back in May, was not accepted by all of them &#8212; triggering a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/twitter-could-face-its-first-gdpr-penalty-within-days/">majority vote mechanism</a> in the GDPR for settling disagreement between the bloc&#8217;s data supervisors.</p>
<p>The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has published this Article 65 decision and the full final decision <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/consistency-findings/binding-decisions_en">on its website here</a>.</p>
<p>The (now) final outcome on the Twitter case comes at a key time &#8212; with EU lawmakers due to set out their next major pieces of digital policy later today, as part of an ambitious push to accelerate regional digitization by rolling out a reassuring promise of European guardrails wrapping around all this tech.</p>
<p>Yet with GDPR enforcement proving such a tedious, friction-filled process that threatens to take the shine off the nascent Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act many months (or even years) before they can become EU law &#8212; raising questions about how the whole strategy can be expected to function in the absence of effective (i.e. fair but fast) enforcement.</p>
<p>The wider risk here is European citizens losing faith in the rights-based framework they&#8217;re told they enjoy, under EU law and the bloc&#8217;s patchwork of regulatory frameworks, if the animal turns out to be such a plodding house-cat when people do try to obtain relief.</p>
<p>So the Commission&#8217;s strategy of claiming expanded digital rules will act as a public trust booster risks falling into a trough of disillusionment at the legislative proposal stage.</p>
<p>Simple put: You can&#8217;t allow your regulators to move so slowly and expect your rulebook to touch tech giants whose playbook is to move fast in order to disrupt the rule of law in their own business&#8217; interests.</p>
<p>The DPC&#8217;s decision in the Twitter case is thus a measure of how sizeable a gap sits between the rhetoric EU policymakers ply around the bloc&#8217;s &#8216;powerful&#8217; digital rules &#8212; and the messier and more faltering reality: Nearly two years since Twitter disclosed the breach and waiting for a hammer to drop in what should be a relatively straightforward case.</p>
<p>A data breach is not an investigation into the lawfulness of Facebook&#8217;s business model vs GDPR, after all, nor does it delve into the intricacies of Google&#8217;s adtech &#8212; both of which are still open case files on the DPC&#8217;s desk.</p>
<p>The penalty itself is also a fraction (a little over 0.1%) of Twitter&#8217;s full-year 2019 revenue; a far cry from the up to 4% of global annual turnover maximum allowed for under the GDPR (or the up to 2% max for the specific infringements involved in the breach case).</p>
<p>The size of the fine calculated by Ireland was one of the objections raised by other EU DPAs during the <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/edpb/files/files/file1/edpb_bindingdecision01_2020_en.pdf">dispute of the draft decision</a> &#8212; the DPC initially proposed an <em>even smaller fine</em> (in the range of <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">0.005% and 0.01% of Twitter&#8217;s annual turnover; or between €</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">135k and €275k). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Article 65 intervention forced Ireland to increase the size of the penalty (though not by much), with the EDPB issuing a binding requirement that Ireland reassess the calculation &#8220;</span>so as to ensure it is appropriate to the facts of the case&#8221;. (It did not specify how large an increase would be required.)</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the DPC for comment.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Maximum fine in Twitter’s case is 60$M. <br />DPC proposed fine of 150-300$K. <br />But other enforcers said no. <a href="https://twitter.com/EU_EDPB?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EU_EDPB</a> made binding decision: DPC must set a bigger fine to discourage Twitter from future breaches. <br />DPC made a small increase 450€M. <br />For context, Germans wanted 7-22$M. <a href="https://t.co/Q4AraN0pdI">pic.twitter.com/Q4AraN0pdI</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>EU DPAs also disagreed on the controller/processor status of Twitter&#8217;s Irish business vs its US entity &#8212; with Ireland accepting Twitter Ireland as the data controller and Twitter Inc as the processor, a designation that seems intended to reduce its liability.</p>
<p>So this first cross-border GDPR decision looks more millstone than milestone for the Commission, at the fag end of 2020.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not a lot for commissioners to celebrate here, even though they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">suggested in the summer</a> that the best answer to GDPR enforcement concerns would be for Ireland to get a decision out. The problem now is the black marks against the bloc&#8217;s record on digital enforcement look stubbornly set in &#8212; just as the Commission is laying out a plan to go <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/big-techs-blackbox-algorithms-face-regulatory-oversight-under-eu-plan/">all in on platform regulation</a>.</p>
<p>The questions over enforcement are going to keep coming.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Accessing and sharing data is a complicated issue for large businesses, and doing this in a secure, compliant way is a problem for many. <a href="http://www.exate.com">eXate</a>, a London-based data software firm is attacking this problem and has now raised a £2.3 million seed round led by Outward VC, with additional backing from ING Ventures and Triple Point Ventures.</p>
<p>eXate is competing with those that tend to do more specific types of data privacy such as  Hazy, Privitar, and Very Good Security. By contrast, eXate says it aggregates multiple types of privacy into one solution, and provides central governance and control.</p>
<p>eXate was founded by Peter Lancos and Sonal Rattan, former digital business leaders at HSBC. Its clients include ING, its new investor.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Peter Lancos, CEO, eXate, said in a statement: “Organisations that store and process large volumes of data experience many challenges when it comes to data sharing. We see the biggest obstacles arise from the lack of joined-up thinking.  The use of expensive multiple single-point solutions, coupled with monitoring complicated country-by-country policies adds time and budget to data initiatives.”</p>
<p>The funding will enable eXate to capitalize on DataSecOps demand by growing its team, accelerating platform development and expanding into new geographies and verticals.</p>
<p>Andi Kazeroonian, Investor at Outward VC, commented on the investment: “Ensuring the protection of sensitive data is a mission-critical challenge for companies that wish to utilise data to deliver value to its stakeholders. eXate’s unique platform provides companies with the tools it requires to ensure data privacy and protection by design.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.taxdoo.com/">Taxdoo</a>, a startup that has built what it calls an &#8220;automated platform for financial compliance&#8221; aimed at cross-border e-commerce companies, has raised  $21 million in new funding.</p>
<p>Leading the Series A round is venture capital firm Accel, with participation from Visionaries Club, 20VC and existing investor HTGF. The funding will be invested in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/taxdoo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="taxdoo">Taxdoo’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> growth &#8212; including international expansion&#8211; increased hiring, R&amp;D, sales, and customer support. Accel’s Harry Nelis has joined the Taxdoo board.</p>
<p>The inclusion of Harry Stebbings’ 20VC is noteworthy, as the podcaster-turned-VC <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/from-twenty-minute-vc-to-20vc-harry-stebbings-launched-a-micro-vc-off-the-back-of-his-popular-podcast/">originally said</a> his micro fund was targeting U.S. startups across various stages, and therefore there wasn’t any perceived conflict with his role as a partner at European VC Stride. Taxdoo is based out of Hamburg, Germany. “20VC essentially invests largely in the U.S. but can also invest where Stride does not, anywhere in Europe outside of the U.K. and Paris,” clarified Stebbings in a WhatsApp message.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in May 2016, after its three founders &#8212; Christian Koenigsheim, Matthias Allmendinger, and Roger Gothmann &#8212; finished their PhDs in finance at the University of Hamburg, Taxdoo wants to use automation to meet the tax and compliance burden faced by cross-border e-commerce companies that sell on various marketplaces and platforms such as Amazon, eBay, and Shopify. This sees those businesses facing increasing complexity around VAT, accounting and other compliance requirements, with data siloed across multiple online systems.</p>
<p>Taxdoo brings that data into a single place and then uses its own tech to automate transaction-level data ingestion, tax calculation and filings across Europe. Customers can also collaborate with their tax advisors through the platform and reduce other compliance burdens, including Intrastat filings.</p>
<p>“While it has become easier and easier to sell products across borders in Europe from a marketing and logistics standpoint, the resulting compliance obligations – like accounting or VAT – are a nightmare for sellers,” Taxdoo’s Christian Koenigsheim tells me.</p>
<p>“Handling these issues manually using spreadsheets is a recipe for disaster. To solve this problem, we&#8217;ve used our in-house expertise to automate the entire process – from the collection of data to the filing of VAT returns in different countries and the integration of transactions into the seller&#8217;s accounting system”.</p>
<p>Koenigsheim says a typical Taxdoo customer sells products on different marketplaces and their own shop, with annual revenues of around €5-10 million. “Our largest customers are global consumer brands with annual revenues of €150 million and above,” he says.</p>
<p>Examples include D2C brands like air up and YFood or e-commerce companies OmniDeal and sellvin. “Among others, we partner with tax professionals, ERP systems, and e-commerce agencies to help them handle these complex issues for their clients,” adds Koenigsheim.</p>
<p>“Our secret sauce is that we automate the entire workflow from end-to-end. This starts with the aggregation of data from different channels like marketplaces, shops, and ERP systems using our automated connectors. Our system [then] analyses data under all applicable regulations and prepares the required returns across the EU, which are filed by an international network of tax partners using a convenient software solution created by us”.</p>
<p>Taxdoo data can also be exported to a seller’s accounting system, enabling them to more easily collaborate with local tax advisors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the addressable market is growing fast, in part helped by accelerated digitisation during the pandemic and the growth of e-commerce. Taxdoo cites data showing that cross-border transactions now represents approximately 25% of total e-commerce transactions in Western Europe and Scandinavia, and is rising.</p>
<p>Cue statement from Accel’s Harry Nelis: “With a booming e-commerce landscape and companies of all sizes looking to sell their products and services internationally, we see an acute need for integrated financial and tax compliance. Taxdoo’s founders bring together unique experience at the intersection of tax, finance and software and we are excited to work with them to build Taxdoo into a category defining company”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/deena-shakir" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="deena-shakir">Deena Shakir <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> joined <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lux-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lux-capital">Lux Capital <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as a partner last year after spending seven years with Google, the last of them with GV, Google&#8217;s venture unit.</p>
<p>While Shakir seems to fit right in with the firm &#8212; known for its wealth of PhDs and moonshot investments &#8212; venture wasn&#8217;t something she was focused on as a career, as she told us during a lengthy interview last week. An Iraqi-American who grew up in Silicon Valley after her parents immigrated to the region, Shakir put herself through both Harvard, then Georgetown&#8217;s School of Foreign Service through a mix of merit scholarships and work and thought she might become a doctor or nab a PhD in anthropology.</p>
<p>Instead, an internship with the BBC saw her cover an historic White House speech, which led her to spend more than two years at the State Department, working for then Secretary Clinton. When she later headed home to be with her family, she was aware that she wanted to make an impact; she didn&#8217;t foresee making it through her investments, yet that&#8217;s what&#8217;s now happening.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know Shakir, it&#8217;s worth listening to our conversation <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lux-capitals-deena-shakir-frontier-tech-is-going-mainstream/id1498270180?i=1000502187169">here </a>at some point; in the meantime, here are some lightly edited excerpts that shine a light on where she is placing her bets and why.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Lux is known for investing in rocket companies and satellites, though its website actually lists 21 different industries in its portfolio. Did the firm&#8217;s deals arise from these industries that interest the firm or because of teams that interest the firm and that happen to operate in these industries? </strong></p>
<p>DS: I actually find some of this industry categorization as problematic because if you look through the portfolio, you&#8217;ll see we love healthcare, meats, robotics, AI, food production, industrial IoT, and data meets FinTech. It really is intersectional in terms of how we approach industries; that&#8217;s the nature of how we think about investing. But in terms of how we think about where we want to make investments, we certainly have areas where historically we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time that have given us insights into where there are white spaces [such as having worked on] autonomous vehicles and having insights through that experience into the types of software platforms that could power the next generation of autonomy. So there&#8217;s definitely a lot of generational and evolutionary investing.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Last week, Lux participated in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/space-manufacturing-startup-varda-incubated-at-founders-fund-emerges-with-9-million-in-funding/">seed round</a> a startup called Varda that is centered around manufacturing in space. What is it trying to make in space and why?</strong></p>
<p>DS: There are few companies that I think would be perceived as more of a Lux fit than Varda. We pride ourselves on companies that turns science fiction into fact [including in the] space space. We were in Relativity Space; we&#8217;re in a number of satellite companies &#8212; Orbital Insight and Planet and several others.</p>
<p>But this is not only a space that we&#8217;re interested in, but also the founding team is one that we&#8217;ve had the chance to get to know over time and felt very strongly about. It is not an intuitive company, which is probably part of the reason why you might be asking about it, like: what exactly do they do, right? At the end of the day, it&#8217;s quite early, but they&#8217;re working on two things that we really love &#8212; manufacturing and space &#8212; abd there are some really interesting innovations that we&#8217;re just at the very beginning of understanding their application in space [including around] physical processes and the supply chain. And this team is at the forefront of taking those on.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Is it going to be manufacturing carbon nanotubes in space to take to the ISS? What&#8217;s the need it&#8217;s addressing?</strong></p>
<p>DK: At the end of the day, the need is around cost and supply chain. It&#8217;s still extremely expensive to launch anything into orbit &#8212; we&#8217;re talking tens of millions of dollars if not more. That&#8217;s the key problem that they want to solve. Manufacturing in space is the hypothesis here. And they have some fascinating and confidential, at this point, hypotheses as to how they will be able to do that.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Is there enough later-stage funding for companies that will need a lot of capital? Lux is now managing $2.5 billion in assets, after raising $1 billion last year. But some space investors say there is not [enough to go around] partly because there haven&#8217;t yet been enough liquidity events.</strong></p>
<p>DK: That&#8217;s interesting, because we got excited about what we now call frontier tech before that was really a category &#8212; certainly before it had any venture-return profile. Now, it&#8217;s becoming increasingly clear that frontier tech is no longer at the frontier. It&#8217;s becoming a key part of many large enterprises. And we&#8217;re seeing huge companies producing rockets en masse. We&#8217;re seeing private companies launch rockets into space and collaborate with NASA. We&#8217;re also seeing venture-funded companies that previously sounded like science fiction that are approaching just phenomenal valuations. So it does seem like we&#8217;re at a turning point here. If you take a look at the cap tables [of] these types of companies, you&#8217;ll see players that may not necessarily have taken those types of bets earlier on.</p>
<p><strong>TC: One of your bets is <a href="https://www.shiru.com/">Shiru</a>, which is leveraging computational design to create enhanced proteins to help feed the world. What does it say about your interests and process?</strong></p>
<p>DS: I spent a lot of time, especially at GV, with some of the alternative protein companies in our portfolio. And a big part of what I&#8217;ve done since my days in government, and certainly throughout my time at Google, has been talking to commercial partners, Fortune 500 companies, and understanding what their needs are. A big part of my role at GV was helping to plug in these large, behemoth companies with up-and-coming tech companies and help them to meet the innovation demands that they have, and that&#8217;s a large part of where my thesis came from.</p>
<p>I genuinely believe that there is a huge opportunity in food that enables these Fortune 500 food companies to meet the increasing demands from consumers, environmental demands, and cost demands [related to] animal-based ingredients. Shiru&#8217;s approach is an interesting one because they are taking a business model that has worked quite well in pharma . . .in enabling the production of novel IP. In this case, [it&#8217;s] novel plant-based proteins, using machine learning and computational biology and actually licensing it to these food companies so they can go on to produce their own versions of the Impossible Burger or Beyond Meat or simply replace a costly animal-based ingredient in one of their products.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Another of your deals is <a href="https://www.allstripes.com/">AllStripes</a>, which aggregates and analyzes medical records, then sells the de identified data to pharma companies to help them develop medicines. So the common thread is machine learning?</strong></p>
<p>DS: Yes, so for me, it&#8217;s about machine learning AI that&#8217;s streamlining a really analog industry, whether it&#8217;s education, whether it&#8217;s finance, whether it&#8217;s food, and certainly healthcare, where I spend the majority of my time.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What are some of the areas you&#8217;re digging into?</strong></p>
<p>DK: Within healthcare, specifically, I am spending a lot of time looking at women&#8217;s health and within women&#8217;s health. I am looking a lot at fertility tech, and I&#8217;ve seen everything from robotic cryo storage to embryo selection to consumerized clinics for IVF. And it&#8217;s definitely an interesting market and one that&#8217;s growing, especially if you look more broadly at demographic trends in terms of women having children later in life, as well as what we&#8217;re seeing in terms of IVF rates and other countries as well.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a mother of two young kids and had some pretty scary medical experiences myself with with both of their births, and that definitely inspired a look into that space as a patient, but also one where I think there&#8217;s really been underinvestment. I get really frustrated when I hear anyone talk about women&#8217;s health as niche, there is nothing niche about it. From the pure numbers perspective, [women] represents obviously half the population. But women also account for over 80% of dollars spent in healthcare and so companies that are focused on women in the healthcare space are also excellent wedges into other areas.</p>
<p>So outside of those areas in women&#8217;s health, I&#8217;m looking at menopause and at aging in place for anyone across the gender spectrum. Mental health is a huge one, too. I come from a family of physicians. My father is a psychiatrist. In fact, that&#8217;s the reason I grew up in the Bay Area. He came to Stanford in the &#8217;70s for his residency in psychiatry and I&#8217;ve had a lifelong fascination with mental health. In fact, like many children of immigrants, for a hot minute I thought I was going to be a doctor myself and and even interned with VA&#8217;s psychiatry department right before going to college.</p>
<p>Part of why I get excited about it is because it is one of the fields in medicine that&#8217;s still so untouched by tech &#8212; certainly on the data side in terms of being slow to adopt EHRs. On the diagnostic and therapeutic side, there have been some really interesting non-pharmacological interventions for mental health, like TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation), but it has been elusive to attack and, of course, it&#8217;s top of mind for many folks right now with the mental health burden on everyone at the pandemic. So we&#8217;re seeing a lot of really interesting novel approaches emerge, as well as tailwinds propelling some companies that have been around for a while in a space.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Lux actually formed a $345 million <a href="https://medium.com/lux-capital/announcing-lux-health-tech-acquisition-corp-2f02fa4b39ba">health-care focused SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, in October.</a> Is that one of many to come and also, is the idea to perhaps back a company that Lux has funded earlier in time or an outfit it has no association with whatsoever?</strong></p>
<p>DS: We believe that SPACs are really powerful for companies that have an exciting big story to tell and whose value isn&#8217;t necessarily best evaluated by looking in the rearview mirror. And given the changing nature of health care, particularly given everything the pandemic has done, it&#8217;s a particularly salient and interesting opportunity for health care.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve have gotten some <em>really</em> interesting inbound from some of the top companies in the healthcare space. As you can imagine, it&#8217;s just a very, very interesting time for healthcare. We&#8217;re not looking at our own portfolio companies. But a number of our companies are going down that path, and we&#8217;re encouraging them to [pursue it].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zenoti" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zenoti">Zenoti, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a 10-year-old startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/11/zenoti-raises-15-million-for-spa-bookings/">develops services for the spa and salon industry</a>, is the latest entrant to the coveted unicorn list.</p>
<p>The Bellevue, Washington-headquartered SaaS startup has raised $160 million in its Series D financing round that valued it at “well past $1 billion,” said Sudheer Koneru, founder and chief executive of Zenoti, in an interview with TechCrunch earlier this week. The round was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/advent-international" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="advent-international">Advent International <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from Tiger Global and Steadview Partners. The startup has raised about $251 million to date.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zenoti.com/">Zenoti</a>, which started its journey in India, has built a cloud management solution for health and wellness industries. The startup’s platform allows customers to pay directly from a mobile app after their appointment. It also checks them in when they walk into the store and notifies the providers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For their clients, Zenoti allows them to accept bookings, accept digital payments, handle payroll, manage backend inventory, and transfer the tip from customers to directly a staff’s bank account. The startup was founded in 2010, but it wasn’t until 2012 when it had built this complete stack and went to the market.</p>
<p>Zenoti’s platform combines both the ERP and CRM tools. And that’s what this industry, which had surprisingly been underserved prior to Zenoti’s entry, needed, explained Shekhar Kirani, partner at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/accel" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="accel">Accel, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Accel was the first investor to back Zenoti. Unlike offerings from companies such as Microsoft and Notion, for instance, that have built “horizontal” services that people across the industries use, the spa and salon industry needed a “vertical” player that just looked at solving the issues that they were facing, he explained. Zenoti did just that.</p>
<p>It became very clear early on that Zenoti could pursue customers beyond India. That early bet has proven right for the startup, for which the U.S. now accounts for 60% of the revenue, followed by the UK. Over 12,000 businesses including Hand &amp; Stone and Gene Juarez in more than 50 countries today use Zenoti&#8217;s offering. The startup works with higher-end businesses.</p>
<p>Kirani described the success of Zenoti as a growing SaaS movement in India, which has produced scores of startups such as Freshworks, Zoho, MindTickle, and Crazybee that started in the world’s second largest internet market but now have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/chargebee-raises-55-million-to-help-businesses-move-to-subscriptions/">most of their customers outside of the country</a>.</p>
<p>Zenoti&#8217;s offerings have proven even more useful in recent months as the pandemic prompted firms to move several aspects of their businesses digital. An increasingly growing number of spa and salon chains that previously did not adopt digital offerings are now embracing mobile apps and ways to cut reliance on paper bills.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are seeing businesses embrace Zenoti’s technology to help pivot and strengthen their offering, and we are impressed by the company’s growth over the last year, particularly among some of the most established brands in the industry,” said Eric Wei, Managing Director of Advent International, in a statement.</p>
<p>Despite the pandemic, the startup has grown by 100% this year, its best to date, and has a large backlog of businesses who want to become customers, said Koneru, who is hopeful to maintain this growth momentum next year. (Zenoti employees also donated $250,000 to help the workers in the industry they serve.)</p>
<p>Zenoti, which employs about 550 people, does not make money from end-customers and instead charges a subscription fee to businesses. Koneru, who previously worked at Microsoft and invested in offline spa businesses, said that while the startup is currently not turning a profit, its margin has improved and the revenue growth has accelerated. He declined to share figures.</p>
<p>The startup plans to deploy the fresh capital to expand to some additional categories such as grooming. In recent months, it has started to serve gyms and other fitness centres. Zenoti is also open to exploring M&amp;A opportunities, Koneru said, adding that these acquisitions would ideally fuel the startup&#8217;s customer growth instead of broadening the technology stack.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in 2018, Tencent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/02/tencent-reorg-enterprise/">pledged</a> to put more focus on enterprises as traditional industries in China increasingly tapped technology to boost productivity. The firm&#8217;s industrial projects range from using AI to screen medical images to building customer management tools for retailers on its WeChat messenger.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Most recently, Tencent invested in FJ Dynamics, a Chinese startup selling <a href="https://www.fjdynamics.com/en/aboutus">agricultural automation solutions</a> such as smart tractors and rice transplanters as well as unmanned vehicles for ports and factories to clients around the world. The funding from Tencent and other undisclosed investors amounted</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to &#8220;hundreds of millions of yuan&#8221; ($1= 6.55 yuan), Tencent said in an announcement <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/jA0GHrTCb9cUrQP12QnUzg">on Tuesday</a>. </span></p>
<p>Founded 2017, FJ Dynamics has links to several big-name corporations in China. Among its shareholders are drone maker DJI and Dongfeng Asset Management, a Chinese state-owned automaker, according to the firm&#8217;s <a href="https://www.tianyancha.com/company/3300185708">business registration filing</a>. There are clues in its name, too: FJ is short for &#8220;Feng&#8221; and &#8220;Jiang&#8221; in Chinese, which are taken from the Chinese spelling of Dongfeng and DJI respectively. Its founder and chief executive officer Wu Di also hailed from DJI, where he worked as<a href="https://www.sohu.com/a/376881361_649045"> the chief scientist</a> and led research and development in chips.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ridedott.com">Dott</a> is better known for its electric scooter service that is available in a few cities across Europe. But the company is working on electric bikes and wants to launch a bike-sharing service in London and Paris in March 2021.</p>
<p>Dott currently doesn’t operate in London. So it looks like it’ll be the company’s 16th city with this launch.</p>
<p>As for the bike, it has been designed by Dott and it is going to be assembled in Portugal. It is built around a colorful frame made from a single piece of aluminum — there’s no welding. The company also opted for puncture-resistant tyres thanks to foam tyre inserts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As you can see on the photo, there’s no visible chain as it’s integrated in the frame. The battery can be swapped by Dott without having to bring the entire bike to the charging station. There’s also an integrated geolocation system.</p>
<p>“This European-made bike has been designed inline with our mission: to make mobility accessible to all. Our multimodal (e-bike and e-scooter) service will include the same level of operational excellence: removable batteries, secure charging, operations performed by experienced professionals, systematic repairs and recycling,” co-founder and COO Maxim Romain said in the release.</p>
<p>Dott will compete with Lime, which acquired Jump back in May as part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/uber-leads-170-million-lime-investment-offloads-jump-to-lime/">a deal with Uber</a>. Bolt has also been operating bike-sharing services in some cities.</p>
<p>And, of course, Dott will compete with pay-as-you-go docked bike rental schemes, such as Santander Cycles in London and Vélib’ in Paris. In Paris alone, Vélib’ now has 400,000 subscribers. As it is a subsidized service, it’s going to be hard to compete on price.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Only about a third of the yields Indian farmers produce reaches the big markets. Those whose produce makes it there today are able to leverage post-harvest services. Everyone else is missing out.</p>
<p>A Noida-based startup is working with all the stakeholders &#8212; farmers, food processors, traders and financial institutions &#8212; to bridge this post-harvest services gap &#8212; and it just secured new funds to continue its journey.</p>
<p>Seven-year-old <a href="https://www.aryacma.co.in/">Arya</a> said on Tuesday it has raised $21 million in its Series B financing round. The round was led by <a href="https://quona.com/">Quona Capital</a>, a venture firm that focuses on fintech in emerging markets. Existing investors LGT Lightstone Aspada and Omnivore also participated in the round, while multiple unnamed lenders are providing additional debt financing to the startup, Arya said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nearly all post-harvest interventions that exist in India today are focused largely toward major agriculture centres such as Kota in the northern Indian state of Rajasthan and Azadpur Mandi in capital New Delhi, explained Prasanna Rao, co-founder and chief executive of Arya, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>This uneven concentration has deprived millions of farmers in the country of reasonable options to efficiently store and sell their produce and of financing options to maintain their cash flow, he said.</p>
<p>“Our belief is that we should cater to the two-thirds of the market that are currently underserved. The Kota mandi (market), for instance, has 35 bank branches in a kilometre of radius. But if you travel 70 to 80 kilometres away from Kota, this really declines,” said Rao, who previously worked at a bank.</p>
<p>Arya is solving all the aforementioned challenges: It operates a network of more than 1,500 warehouses in 20 Indian states where it stores over $1 billion worth of commodities. This network allows farmers to store their produce at a centre that is much nearer to their farms, avoiding any spillage and exorbitant real estate costs of the big markets. On the credit side, Arya has disbursed over $36.5 million to farmers and its banking partners have disbursed more than $95 million.</p>
<p>“Arya is addressing a vastly underserved market of farmers in India, half of whom previously had little access to post-harvest finance,” said Ganesh Rengaswamy, co-founder and partner at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/quona-capital-management" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="quona-capital-management">Quona Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in a statement. “We believe Arya’s unique approach, providing a full-service digital platform with embedded finance and differentiated efficiencies for small farmholders, will drive the future of farming in India.”</p>
<p>The startup’s offerings have proven even more useful during the coronavirus pandemic, which saw New Delhi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/amazon-flipkart-ola-and-uber-begin-to-resume-their-services-in-india/">enforce one of the world’s strictest lockdowns</a> earlier this year. The lockdown broke the supply chain network, and prices of agricultural commodities dropped by over 20%.</p>
<p>To navigate this, Arya connected farmer produce organizers, or FPOs, with buyers through its own digital marketplace <a href="https://www.a2zgodaam.com/">a2zgodaam.com</a>. “The need for immediate liquidity saw demand increase for credit against these warehouse receipts. Arya’s credit portfolio saw a 3x jump year-on-year,” <a href="https://www.seedtoscale.com/blog/post-covid-agritech-landscape-in-india">wrote</a> Prashanth Prakash, a founding partner at Accel in India, and Mark Kahn, managing partner at Omnivore in an industry report last week.</p>
<p>Rao said Arya will deploy the fresh capital to scale its fintech platform in a “big way” as the startup broadens its network of warehouses across the country. Additionally, the startup plans to fuel the growth of a2zgodaam.com, which also aggregates unorganized warehouses, and supercharge them with their own set of financiers and insurers and ways to allow farmers to sell directly through these warehouses if they need.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.K. is moving ahead with a populist but controversial plan to regulate a wide range of illegal and/or harmful content almost anywhere online such stuff might pose a risk to children. The government has set out its final response to the consultation it kicked off back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/uk-sets-out-safety-focused-plan-to-regulate-internet-firms/">April 2019</a> &#8212; committing to introduce an Online Safety Bill next year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tech platforms will need to do far more to protect children from being exposed to harmful content or activity such as grooming, bullying and pornography. This will help make sure future generations enjoy the full benefits of the internet with better protections in place to reduce the risk of <span class="il">harm</span>,&#8221; it said today.</p>
<p>In an earlier partial response to the consultation on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/uk-sets-out-safety-focused-plan-to-regulate-internet-firms/">Online Harms white paper</a> ministers confirmed the U.K.&#8217;s media regulator, Ofcom, as its pick for enforcing the forthcoming rules.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="rhWxyBu3xF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/uk-sets-out-safety-focused-plan-to-regulate-internet-firms/">UK sets out safety-focused plan to regulate internet firms</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK sets out safety-focused plan to regulate internet firms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/uk-sets-out-safety-focused-plan-to-regulate-internet-firms/embed/#?secret=rhWxyBu3xF" data-secret="rhWxyBu3xF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Under the plans announced today, the government said <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ofcom" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ofcom">Ofcom <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> will be able to levy fines of up to 10% of a company&#8217;s annual global turnover (or £18 million, whichever is higher) on those that are deemed to have failed in their duty of care to protect impression eyeballs from being exposed to illegal material &#8212; such as child sexual abuse, terrorist material or suicide-promoting content.</p>
<p>Ofcom will also have the power to block non-compliant services from being accessed in the U.K. &#8212; although it&#8217;s not clear how exactly that will be achieved (or whether the legislation will seek to prevent VPNs being used by Brits to access blocked internet services).</p>
<p>The regulator&#8217;s running costs will be paid by companies that fall under the scope of the law, above a threshold based on global annual revenue, per the government, although it&#8217;s not yet clear where that pay-bar will kick in (nor how much tech giants and others will have to stump up for the cost of the oversight).</p>
<p>The online safety &#8220;duty of care&#8221; rules are intended to cover not just social media giants like Facebook but a wide range of internet services &#8212; from dating apps and search engines to online marketplaces, video sharing platforms and instant messaging tools, as well as consumer cloud storage and even video games that allow relevant user interaction.</p>
<p>P2P services, online forums and pornography websites will also fall under the scope of the laws, as will quasi-private messaging services, according to a government press release.</p>
<p>That raises troubling questions about whether the legal requirements could put pressure on companies not to use end-to-end encryption (i.e. if they face being penalized for not being able to monitor robustly encrypted content for illegal material).</p>
<p>&#8220;The new regulations will apply to any company in the world hosting user-generated content <span class="il">online</span> accessible by people in the UK or enabling them to privately or publicly interact with others <span class="il">online</span>,&#8221; the government writes in a press release.</p>
<p>The rules will include different categories of responsibility for content and activity &#8212; with a top tier (category 1) only applying to companies with &#8220;the largest <span class="il">online</span> presences and high-risk features,&#8221; which the government said is likely to include Facebook, TikTok, Instagram and Twitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;These companies will need to assess the risk of legal content or activity on their services with &#8216;a reasonably foreseeable risk of causing significant physical or psychological <span class="il">harm</span> to adults&#8217;. They will then need to make clear what type of &#8216;legal but harmful&#8217; content is acceptable on their platforms in their terms and conditions and enforce this transparently and consistently,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Category 1 companies will also have a legal requirement to publish transparency reports about the steps they are taking to tackle <span class="il">online</span> <span class="il">harms</span>, per the government&#8217;s PR.</p>
<p>While all companies that fall under the scope of the law will be required to have mechanisms so people can easily report harmful content or activity while also being able to appeal the takedown of content, it added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The government believes that less than 3% of U.K. businesses will fall within the scope of the legislation &#8212; adding that &#8220;the vast majority&#8221; will be Category 2 services.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Protections for free speech are also slated as being baked in &#8212; with the government saying the laws will <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">not affect articles and comments sections on news websites, for example. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The legislation will contain provisions to impose criminal sanctions on senior managers (introduced by parliament via secondary legislation). On this the government added that it will not hesitate to use the power if companies fail to take the new rules seriously (such as by not responding &#8220;fully, accurately and in a timely manner&#8221; to information requests from Ofcom).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Commenting on the plans in a statement, digital secretary Oliver Dowden said: &#8220;I’m unashamedly pro tech but that can’t mean a tech free for all. Today Britain is setting the global standard for safety <span class="il">online</span> with the most comprehensive approach yet to <span class="il">online</span> regulation. We are entering a new age of accountability for tech to protect children and vulnerable users, to restore trust in this industry, and to enshrine in law safeguards for free speech.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;This proportionate new framework will ensure we don’t put unnecessary burdens on small businesses but give large digital businesses robust rules of the road to follow so we can seize the brilliance of modern technology to improve our lives.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In another supporting statement, home secretary Priti Patel added: &#8220;Tech companies must put public safety first or face the consequences.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also commenting, Ofcom CEO Dame Melanie Dawes welcomed its new broader oversight remit, adding in a statement that: &#8220;Being <span class="il">online</span> brings huge benefits, but four in five people have concerns about it. That shows the need for sensible, balanced rules that protect users from serious <span class="il">harm</span>, but also recognise the great things about <span class="il">online</span>, including free expression. We’re gearing up for the task by acquiring new technology and data skills, and we’ll work with Parliament as it finalises the plans.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The government has said it will publish Interim Codes of Practice today to provide guidance for companies on tackling terrorist activity and <span class="il">online</span> child sexual exploitation prior to the introduction of legislation &#8212; which is unlikely to make it into law before late 2021 at the earliest to allow adequate time for parliamentary debate and scrutiny.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And while a noisy political push to &#8220;protect kids&#8221; online can expect to enjoy plenty of tabloid-level support, the wide-ranging application of the duty of care rules the government is envisaging &#8212; with large swathes of the U.K.&#8217;s tech sector set to be impacted &#8212; means ministers can expect to attract plenty of homegrown criticism too, from business groups, entrepreneurs and investors and legal and policy experts, including over specific concerns about knock-on impacts on privacy and security.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Its plan to push ahead with an Online Safety Bill that will impact scores of smaller digital businesses, instead of zeroing in on the handful of platform giants that are responsible for generating high volumes of harms, has already attracted criticism from the tech sector.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Coadec, a digital policy group that advocates for startups and the U.K. tech sector, branded the plan &#8220;a confusing minefield&#8221; for entrepreneurs &#8212; arguing it will do the opposite of fostering digital competition, counteracting other measures <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">recently announced</a> by the government in response to concerns about market concentration in the digital advertising sphere.</p>
<p>“Last week the Government announced a new unit within the CMA [Competition and Markets Authority] to promote greater competition within digital markets. Days later they have announced regulatory measures that risk having the opposite effect,&#8221; said Dom Hallas, Coadec&#8217;s executive director in a statement. &#8220;86% of UK investors say that regulation aiming to tackle big tech could lead to poor outcomes that damage tech startups and limit competition &#8212; these plans risk being a confusing minefield that will have a disproportionate impact on competitors and benefit big companies with the resources to comply.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;British startups want a safer internet. But it’s not clear how these proposals, which still cover a huge range of services that are nowhere near social media from ecommerce to the sharing economy, are better targeted than the last time government published proposals nearly a year and a half ago,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Until the Government starts to work collaboratively instead of consistently threatening startup founders with jail time it’s not clear how we’re going to deliver proposals that work.&#8221;</p>

<p>One gap in the government&#8217;s proposal is financial harms &#8212; with issues such as fraud and the sale of unsafe goods explicitly excluded from the framework (as it says it wants the regulations to be &#8220;clear and manageable&#8221; for businesses and to avoid the risk of duplicating existing rules).</p>
<p>Some &#8220;lower-risk&#8221; services may also be exempt from the duty of care requirement, per the government, to avoid the law being overly burdensome.</p>
<p>Email services will also not be in scope, it confirmed.</p>
<p>And while it says some types of advertising will be in scope (such as influencer ads posted on social media) ads placed on an in-scope service via a direct contract between an advertiser and an advertising service (such as Facebook or Google Ads) will be exempt because &#8220;this is covered by existing regulation&#8221; &#8212; which looks set to let the adtech duopoly off the harmful ads hook without good clear reason.</p>
<p>After all, existing U.K. regulations do not seem to have done much to stem the tide of crypto scam ads running on Facebook (or served via Google&#8217;s ad tools) in recent years &#8212; which led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/facebook-agrees-to-do-more-to-tackle-scam-ads-after-celebrity-defamation-lawsuit/">a campaign by a consumer advice personality</a> to get Facebook and other companies to clean up their act, for example.</p>

<p>Consumer group <em>Which?</em> has criticized the lack of government attention to financial scams in the Online Safety Bill. In a response statement, Rocio Concha, its director of policy and advocacy, said: “It’s positive that the government is recognising the responsibility of online platforms to protect users, but it would be a big missed opportunity if online scams were not dealt with through the upcoming bill. Our research has shown the financial and emotional toll of scams and that social media firms such as Facebook and search engines like Google need to do much more to protect users.</p>
<p>&#8220;We look forward to the detail and hope to see a clear plan to give online platforms greater responsibility for fraudulent content on their sites, including having in place better controls to prevent fake adverts from appearing, so that all users can be confident that they will truly be safe online.&#8221;</p>
<p>European Union lawmakers are due to unveil their own pan-EU policy package to regulate illegal and harmful content later today &#8212; but the Digital Services Act will tackle the sale of illegal goods online as well as proposing to harmonize rules for reporting troublesome content on online services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/federal-trade-commission" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="federal-trade-commission">FTC <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is ordering the companies behind many of the largest social and video platforms to explain how they use the treasure troves of data they harvest from users. Amazon, TikTok owner ByteDance, Facebook, WhatsApp, Discord, Reddit, Snap, Twitter and YouTube <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-issues-orders-nine-social-media-video-streaming-services">were all sent the order</a>, with a deadline set 45 days from now.</p>
<p>The FTC&#8217;s focus is on how these companies &#8220;collect, use, and present personal information, their advertising and user engagement practices, and how their practices affect children and teens.&#8221; Four of the FTC&#8217;s commissioners voted in favor of the order, with Commissioner Noah Joshua Phillips dissenting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite their central role in our daily lives, the decisions that prominent online platforms make regarding consumers and consumer data remain shrouded in secrecy,&#8221; Commissioners Rohit Chopra, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Christine S. Wilson said in a joint statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Policymakers and the public are in the dark about what social media and video streaming services do to capture and sell users’ data and attention. It is alarming that we still know so little about companies that know so much about us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The FTC&#8217;s new fact-finding mission is the latest federal action to put tech in its crosshairs, following last week&#8217;s news that the agency would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ftc-seeks-to-break-up-facebook-alleging-illegal-monopoly/">sue Facebook over antitrust violations</a>. The new order was issued under Section 6(b) of the FTC Act as a study of tech industry practices. It isn&#8217;t coupled with any law enforcement action, but that doesn&#8217;t preclude the agency from pursuing enforcement options with what it finds.</p>
<p>Last year the FTC signaled a deeper interest in tech, particularly on antitrust issues. The agency launched a purpose-built tech task force to monitor acquisitions and other potential competition-crushing behavior that raises red flags. In early 2020, the FTC launched an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/ftc-to-examine-every-acquisition-by-alphabet-amazon-apple-facebook-and-microsoft-in-2010-2019-over-antitrust-issues/">extensive separate study</a> examining nearly a decade&#8217;s worth of acquisitions made by Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft.</p>

<p>As part of the settlement, Pinterest will pay $20 million to Brougher and her attorneys, and both Pinterest and Brougher will commit $2.5 million toward &#8220;Advancing women and underrepresented communities&#8221; in the tech industry, <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001506293/3fef4e2e-328e-449a-8971-469b1f68011a.pdf">the company wrote in a filing</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pinterest recognizes the importance of fostering a workplace environment that is diverse, equitable and inclusive and will continue its actions to improve its culture,&#8221; Pinterest and Brougher said in a joint statement detailing the settlement. &#8220;Francoise welcomes the meaningful steps Pinterest has taken to improve its workplace environment and is encouraged that Pinterest is committed to building a culture that allows all employees to feel included and supported.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shortly after Brougher went public with her claims, Pinterest employees staged a walkout in response to her accusations as well as in response to the claims of two former Black Pinterest employees. Prior to Brougher&#8217;s claims, <a href="https://twitter.com/erikashimizu/status/1272547227177713664">Aerica Shimizu Banks</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ifeomaozoma/status/1272546213322080258">Ifeoma Ozoma</a> accused Pinterest of racial discrimination.</p>

<p>In addition to the walkout, <a href="https://www.coworker.org/petitions/put-an-end-to-all-forms-of-discrimination-and-retaliation-at-pinterest-1">a petition circulated throughout the company demanding systemic change</a>. The change they sought entailed full transparency about promotion levels and retention, total compensation package transparency and for the people within two layers of reporting to the CEO to be at least 25% women and 8% underrepresented employees.</p>
<p>Since then, Pinterest has notably made some changes at the board level. A couple of days after the walkout, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/pinterest-announces-first-black-board-member/">Pinterest announced Andrea Wishom as the company&#8217;s first-ever Black board member</a>. In October, Pinterest added its second Black board member, Salaam Coleman Smith.</p>
<p>Pinterest says it has also enhanced its hiring and interview processes to try to improve diversity at senior levels, updated its inclusion training and launched an internal wiki detailing how Pinterest makes compensation decisions.</p>

We’ll be rolling out gift guides from now through the end of December. You can find <a href="https://techcrunch.com/pages/gift-guide-2020/">our other guides right here</a>.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a difficult time to be a photographer. Getting creative feels impossible when every day is the same and the most exotic locale you visit is the living room. Travel is out this year, vacations are pushed back and everybody is cooped up inside trying not to lose it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything is hard in like 12 different ways right now, but encouraging your friends and fam to immerse themselves in new hobbies and plan future adventures is a great distraction. For photographers at a loss for what to shoot this year, it&#8217;s the perfect time to mix things up, switch up your gear entirely and try to see the world with fresh eyes.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might not seem like it, but it’s actually the perfect time to get into instant photography. As a photographer myself, I haven’t picked up my main camera in months. Nothing feels inspiring. But I started carrying a cheap instant camera on walks around my neighborhood, rain permitting, and it’s been a meditative way to appreciate the beauty of small things that otherwise just blend into my routine. This Fujifilm Instax shoots larger, square photos and they look great popping up in an Instagram feed too if you&#8217;re in it for the &#8216;gram.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another good option: The Fujifilm Instax Mini 11 Camera </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">creates smaller, rectangular photos and it’s playful design makes it perfect for anyone.</span></p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>Fujifilm Instax, <a href="https://www.adorama.com/fjim16581458.html?CategoryID=240274">$80 from Adorama</a> | Fujifilm Instax Mini, <a href="https://www.target.com/p/fujifilm-mini-11-cloud-green-camera/-/A-79785394">$70 from Target</a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a year when we can’t do a lot of the things we’d normally enjoy, many of the safest, most enjoyable things are outdoors. If your giftee is an adrenaline junkie (climbing, snowboarding, surfing, etc.) the latest GoPro is a no-brainer for in-the-moment action stills or video that you could never capture otherwise. But like an instant camera, a GoPro can also be a really fun way to switch things up for nonadventure photography. I brought one along on my honeymoon and ended up shooting stills with it half the time even when I wasn’t in the water — having a teeny indestructible pocket camera just feels really fun and different.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve met a photographer who has enough memory cards, I’d like to know their secret. These SD cards are fast, reliable and widely compatible. Much like socks, SD cards have a way of vanishing and you never have enough of them even though it feels like you buy them all the time. Good stocking material! </span></p>

<h2><strong>Sony RX100 VII</strong></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know someone who (a) wants a super compact travel camera, (b) wants to get into photography but doesn’t care about interchangeable lenses or (c) needs a small camera for anything, really? Sony’s been killing it in compact photography for years now and the RX100 series is a testament to everything it does right. The RX100 VII is an incredible camera in a really small package, capable of taking everything from beginner night sky photos and professional-looking portraits to casual photos and everything in between. Since it’s got full manual settings, new photographers can go as deep as they’d like and anyone who wants to keep it simple can stay in full auto and snap away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Since Sony is in the 6th generation of the RX100, you can find old versions for screaming good deals and you won’t even know what you’re missing. Just stick with the RX100 III on up for the included viewfinder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a weird year and we’ve all learned weird new stuff about ourselves. In my case, I have learned the weird new fact that coyotes are frequently roaming around my fairly urban backyard eating people’s pets. (Sad but also interesting!) With entertainment options slim and monotony all but guaranteed, a lot of people are paying more attention to backyard and neighborhood wildlife lately. Even if you live in a major city, there are tons of wild creatures around. Go full Nat Geo with a trail cam </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and finally find out what happens when animals stop being polite and start getting real.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also cool: We haven’t tried this one out, but the Canon PowerShot Zoom (</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08KTQBZHF/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B08KTQBZHF&amp;linkId=26ec3280aaf833810a44ed5d8fd1ec5f"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$299</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) looks like a handy present for anyone who’s started bird or wildlife watching lately and is interested in nabbing quick super-zoomed-in shots.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of photographers, myself included, have switched over from DSLRs to full-frame mirrorless cameras in recent years, and for good reason. Mirrorless cameras are smaller and lighter, but that used to mean compromising on image quality in the name of portability. Those days are long over. New mirrorless cameras have image quality on par with their larger, more traditional counterparts and their light weight and smaller size makes them easier to cart around for stuff like travel, street or outdoor photography. You really can’t go very wrong with most of the full-frame mirrorless options out there, but Sony’s a7 III is perfect for anyone getting serious about photography. The brand new Sony a7C is another mirrorless full-frame also worth a look if you want an even </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compact option on the cutting edge of what small cameras can do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is your loved one one of those pretentious film photography people who talks about how digital ruined the art and nothing feels as good as a film camera? Well for one they’re kind of right. But you might be able to delight them nonetheless with the latest from Fujifilm&#8217;s’s extremely well-loved X100 series. It’s about as close as you can get to the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">je ne sais quoi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of shooting with film, offering lots of little touches (classic design! an ISO dial!) that capture some of the magic of film photography. This is another option where you can save significant $$$ by finding a new last-generation version on the cheap. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compact mirrorless cameras are having an extended moment right now, but sometimes a regular DSLR is a better choice. For anyone learning the basics of photography for the first time, a “cropped sensor” DSLR (versus a pro-level full-frame DSLR) is really a better starting place in some ways. These camera bodies and their lenses are larger, but they’re generally more tactile in a way that will help new photographers build up a good foundation of knowledge. These bodies usually come with a “kit lens” (18-55mm) that’s not terribly impressive, but if you also pick up a cheap 50mm f/1.8 your budding photog will have plenty to play around with. Whether you go Nikon or Canon, it really doesn’t matter — just pick a horse and ride it. Did we mention these are great, affordable choices for a teen who’s just getting into photography? They are!</span></p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christywyatt/">Christy Wyatt</a> is Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board of directors at <a />Absolute</a>, a leader in endpoint resilience solutions and the industry’s only undeletable defense platform embedded in over a half-billion devices.	</div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Now more than ever, IT teams play a vital role in keeping their businesses running smoothly and securely. With all of the assets and data that are now broadly distributed, a CEO depends on their IT team to ensure employees remain connected and productive and that sensitive data remains protected.</p>
<p>CEOs often visualize and measure things in terms of dollars and cents, and in the face of continuing uncertainty, IT &#8212; along with most other parts of the business &#8212; is facing intense scrutiny and tightening of budgets. So, it is more important than ever to be able to demonstrate that they’ve made sound technology investments and have the agility needed to operate successfully in the face of continued uncertainty.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			For a CEO to properly understand risk exposure and make the right investments, IT departments have to be able to confidently communicate what types of data are on any given device at any given time.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Here are five questions that IT teams should be ready to answer when their CEO comes calling:</p>
<h2>What have we spent our money on?</h2>
<p>Or, more specifically, exactly how many assets do we have? And, do we know where they are? While these seem like basic questions, they can be shockingly difficult to answer … much more difficult than people realize. The last several months in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak have been the proof point.</p>
<p>With the mass exodus of machines leaving the building and disconnecting from the corporate network, many IT leaders found themselves guessing just how many devices had been released into the wild and gone home with employees.</p>
<p>One CIO we spoke to estimated they had “somewhere between 30,000 and 50,000 devices” that went home with employees, meaning there could have been up to 20,000 that were completely unaccounted for. The complexity was further compounded as old devices were pulled out of desk drawers and storage closets to get something into the hands of employees who were not equipped to work remotely. Companies had endpoints connecting to corporate network and systems that they hadn’t seen for years — meaning they were out-of-date from a security perspective as well.</p>
<p>This level of uncertainty is obviously unsustainable and introduces a tremendous amount of security risk. Every endpoint that goes unaccounted for not only means wasted spend but also increased vulnerability, greater potential for breach or compliance violation, and more. In order to mitigate these risks, there needs to be a permanent connection to every device that can tell you exactly how many assets you have deployed at any given time — whether they are in the building or out in the wild.</p>
<h2>Are our devices and data protected?</h2>
<p>Device and data security go hand in hand; without the ability to see every device that is deployed across an organization, it becomes next to impossible to know what data is living on those devices. When employees know they are leaving the building and going to be off network, they tend to engage in “data hoarding.”<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
