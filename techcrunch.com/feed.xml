										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is embarking on a major project to <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey</a> the venture capital investors of Europe, and their cities.</p>
<p>Our &lt;a href=&#8221;https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6”>survey of VCs in Copenhagen and Denmark will capture how the country is faring, and what changes are being wrought amongst investors by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>We’d like to know how Denmark&#8217;s startup scene is evolving, how the tech sector is being impacted by COVID-19, and, generally, how your thinking will evolve from here.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Our survey will only be about investors, and <strong>only the contributions of VC investors will be included.</strong> More than one partner is welcome to fill out the survey. (Please note, if you have filled the survey out already, there is no need to do it again).</p>
<p>The shortlist of questions will require only brief responses, but the more you can add, the better.</p>
<p><a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6"><strong>You can fill out the survey here.</strong></a></p>
<p>Obviously, investors who contribute will be featured in the final surveys, with links to their companies and profiles.</p>
<p>What kinds of things do we want to know? Questions include: Which trends are you most excited by? What startup do you wish someone would create? Where are the overlooked opportunities? What are you looking for in your next investment, in general? How is your local ecosystem going? And how has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy?</p>
<p>This survey is part of a broader <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys/">series of surveys</a> we’re doing to help founders find the right investors.</p>
<p>https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys/</p>
<p>For example, here is the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/14-vcs-discuss-covid-19-and-londons-future-as-a-tech-hub/">survey of London</a>.</p>
<p>You are not in Denmark, but would like to take part? That&#8217;s fine! Any European VC investor can STILL fill out the survey, as we probably will be putting a call out to your country next anyway! And we will use the data for future surveys on vertical topics.</p>
<p>The survey is covering almost every country on in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_for_the_Mediterranean">Union for the Mediterranean</a>, so just look for your country and city on the <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey</a> and please participate (<em>if</em> you&#8217;re a venture capital investor).</p>
<p>Thank you for participating. If you have questions you can email mike@techcrunch.com</p>
<p>(Please note: Filling out the survey is not a guarantee of inclusion in the final published piece).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A new era of venture, or just another temporary weirdness caused by zero-cost money and an overabundance of bored cash?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since last year, we&#8217;ve been tracking the growing list of capitalists who got into the SPAC game. You can read an interview we conducted with Amish Jani, the co-founder of FirstMark Capital, about his SPAC <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/why-are-vcs-launching-spacs-amish-jani-of-firstmark-shares-his-firms-rationale/">here</a>. And if you need a refresher on all things SPAC, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/almost-everything-you-need-to-know-about-spacs/">we have that for you as well</a>.</p>
<p>This morning, I want to better understand the trend by parsing a few new venture capitalist SPACs. We&#8217;ll examine <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1841948/000119312521041594/d87587ds1.htm">Lerer Hippeau Acquisition Corp.</a> and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1841873/000119312521041902/d32231ds1.htm">Khosla Ventures Acquisition Co. I</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1846069/000119312521041928/d255103ds1.htm">II</a> and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1846068/000119312521041936/d111800ds1.htm">III</a>. The SPACs are, somewhat obviously, associated with New York-based Lerer Hippeau and Menlo Park&#8217;s Khosla Ventures. And all four dropped formal S-1 filings last week.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Today&#8217;s topic may sound dry, but it really does matter. As we&#8217;ve reported, Lux Capital <a href="https://luxcapital.com/companies/lux-health-tech-acquisition-corp/">is in</a> on the SPAC wager, along <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/71057/Ribbit-Capitals-fintech-SPAC-Ribbit-LEAP-prices-$350-million-IPO-at-$10">with Ribbit</a> and, of course, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-12-23/softbank-billionaire-masa-son-puts-a-new-spin-on-spac-mania">SoftBank</a>. Adding our latest names to the mix and you have to wonder if every VC worth a damn in the future will have their own raft of SPAC offerings.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995211 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>In that way, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/the-paradox-of-2020-vc-is-that-the-largest-funds-are-doing-the-smallest-rounds/">some late-stage venture capital funds invest earlier</a> &#8212; and now later &#8212; full-service VC outfits will offer first-check to final liquidity, will such a full-stack venture outfit be able to win more deals than a group offering a limited set of financing options? If so, the recent venture capital SPAC wave could become more of a rising tide in time, to torture a metaphor.</p>
<p>Regardless, let&#8217;s quickly parse what Khosla and Lerer Hippeau are telling <em>public</em> investors about why they will be great SPACers before working our way backwards to what the resulting pitch must be to startups themselves.</p>
<h2>Full-stack capital</h2>
<p>The Lerer Hippeau SPAC is the most interesting of the two firms&#8217; combined four offerings, so we&#8217;ll start there. That isn&#8217;t to diss Khosla, but the Lerer Hippeau blank-check has some explicit wording I want to highlight.</p>
<p>From the Lerer Hippeau Acquisition Corp. S-1 filing, read the following (bolding: TechCrunch):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>As our seed portfolio matured over the last decade, we added a growth strategy to our platform through our select funds</strong>. This capital enables us to continue providing financial support to our top performing early stage companies as they scale, and to selectively make new investments in later stage companies in the Lerer Hippeau network. <strong>With our portfolio now maturing to the stage at which many are considering the public markets, we view SPACs as a natural next step in the evolution of our platform.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>After writing that it has had four portfolio companies &#8220;publicly announced business combination agreements with SPACs&#8221; and noting that it expects more of the same, Lerer Hippeau added that it considers its &#8220;expansion into the SPAC market as a highly complementary element of our strategy to support founders throughout their entrepreneurial journeys.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week&#8217;s hours-long outage at online workspace startup Notion was caused by phishing complaints, according to the startup&#8217;s domain registrar.</p>
<p>Notion was offline for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/notion-outage-dns-domain-issues/">most of the morning on Friday</a>, plunging its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/notion-hits-2-billion-valuation-in-new-raise/">more than four million users</a> into organization darkness because of what the company called a &#8220;very unusual DNS issue that occurred at the registry operator level.&#8221; With the company&#8217;s domain offline, users were unable to access their files, calendars, and documents.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;re experiencing a DNS issue, causing the site to not resolve for many users. We are actively looking into this issue.</p>
<p>&mdash; Notion Status (@NotionStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/NotionStatus/status/1360220589743480838?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Notion registered its domain name <code>notion.so</code> through Name.com, but all <code>.so</code> domains are managed by Hexonet, a company that helps connect Sonic, the <code>.so</code> top-level domain registry, with domain name registrars like Name.com.</p>
<p>That complex web of interdependence is in large part what led to the communications failure that resulted in Notion falling offline for hours.</p>
<p>In an email to TechCrunch, Name.com spokesperson Jared Ewy said: &#8220;Hexonet received complaints about user-generated Notion pages connected to phishing. They informed Name.com about these reports, but we were unable to independently confirm them. Per its policies, Hexonet placed a temporary hold on Notion&#8217;s domain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Noting the impact of this action, all teams worked together to restore service to Notion and its users. All three teams are now partnering on new protocols to ensure this type of incident does not happen again. The Notion team and their avid followers were responsive and a pleasure to work with throughout. We thank everyone for their patience and understanding,&#8221; said Ewy.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/hzje9k/people_using_notion_for_malicious_activities/">several</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/fpegan/notionso_blocked_at_work_help/">threads</a> on Reddit discussing concerns about Notion being used to host phishing sites, and security researchers <a href="https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/phishing-in-the-cloud/">have shown examples</a> of Notion used in active phishing campaigns. A Notion employee <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/f6x9mk/why_the_so_domain/">said almost a year ago</a> that Notion would &#8220;soon&#8221; move its domain to <code>notion.com</code>, which the company owns.</p>
<p>Notion&#8217;s outage is almost identical to what happened with Zoho in 2018, which like Notion, resorted to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/24/zoho-pulled-offline-after-phishing-complaints-ceo-says/">tweeting at its domain registrar</a> after it blocked <code>zoho.com</code> following complaints about phishing emails sent from Zoho-hosted email accounts.</p>
<p>It sounds like there&#8217;s no immediate danger of a repeat outage, but Notion did not return TechCrunch&#8217;s email over the weekend asking what it plans to do to prevent phishing on its platform in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber is shooting its shot at EU lawmakers as they dial up scrutiny of working conditions on gig platforms to decide whether new rules are needed to improve the lot of gig workers.</p>
<p>The ride-hailing and on-demand food delivery giant has published a <a href="https://www.uber.com/global/en/reports/a-better-deal">white paper</a> today in which it lobbies European policymakers for what it couches as a &#8216;new standard&#8217; for platform work.</p>
<p>In the paper Uber talks of the need to expand some benefits to gig workers &#8212; seeking to eschew the nightmare scenario (for Uber) of having to fund the full suite of employment rights if its drivers and riders were reclassified as workers/employees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s also trying to steer policy discussion away from issue of collective bargaining &#8212; with the paper floating the notion that app workers need more &#8220;meaningful&#8221; representation which they say is needed to reflect varying (aka individualized) needs and suggest could be achieved via a variety of channels of ongoing engagement between platform and worker.</p>
<p>Uber&#8217;s white paper is framed with the title: &#8216;A Better Deal&#8217;. And the ride-hailing giant is unquestionably after the best possible deal for its business as lawmakers look at whether new laws are needed to ensure a fairer deal for app-based workers.</p>
<p>The question EU lawmakers will need to pay close attention to in the coming months is exactly what kind of deal platforms workers are getting and, as they dig into the detail underlying tech giants&#8217; PR, whether and how to create a legislative framework that improves conditions for armies of &#8216;contractors&#8217; without undermining the much vaunted European social contract.</p>
<p>Uber has said it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/after-prop-22s-passage-uber-is-taking-its-lobbying-effort-global/">push for a California style &#8216;Prop 22&#8217; outcome globally</a> &#8212; after successfully defeating a law to reclassify gig workers in its own back yard last year.</p>
<p>But the legal and social context is very different in Europe where many platforms have faced litigation on the issue of employment classification and courts have frequently found in workers&#8217; favor.</p>
<p>On Friday Uber faces perhaps its biggest regional court test yet when the UK Supreme Court is expected to hand down its verdict on a long-running challenge by a group of former Uber drivers to its classification of them as self-employed. (The UK is now outside the EU but the outcome of the case is nonetheless likely to influence courts across the region.)</p>
<p>Greater clarification and enforcement of existing employment laws could be a way for policymakers in Europe to clamp down on platform giants that, critics say, have used self-serving classifications of algorithmic micromanagement as a high-tech hack of the legal system to profit at the expense of society (in lost tax revenue) and off of the labor of individual workers deprived of stable employment (and its associated rights).</p>
<p>At the same time, increasing consolidation in the on-demand space is concentrating the power of gig giants. So how can platform workers expect &#8216;meaningful&#8217; representation or &#8216;improved&#8217; conditions when a handful of mega platforms are busy closing off the possibility of something better by assimilating the competition &#8212; unless there&#8217;s a legislative intervention to protect them?</p>
<p>In a blog post accompanying Uber&#8217;s white paper today, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi reiterates the tech giant&#8217;s preferred &#8216;new standard&#8217; for gig worker rights should be &#8220;grounded in the principles drivers and couriers say are most important to them: Flexibility and control over when and where they want to work, earning a decent wage, access to relevant benefits and protections, and meaningful representation&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;To make a real difference, reform must also be industry-wide, requiring all platform companies to offer benefits and protections that are standardised across the sector, so that workers are protected no matter which apps they use,&#8221; Khosrowshahi goes on.</p>
<p>A universal standard for platform benefits may sound progressive but the notion of &#8216;relevant&#8217; benefits for gig workers risks fixing this labor force to a floor far below agreed standards for employment &#8212; closing off any chance of a better deal for a class of workers who are subject to persistent, algorithmic management.</p>
<p>Such an industry-wide standard may also kill the imperative for gig platforms to compete with each other by offering workers a better deal. So policymakers need to tread carefully to avoid cementing a bad deal for workers they claim they want to help.</p>
<p>Uber&#8217;s white paper is pushing for some key principles at this point, rather than delineating a detailed &#8216;deal&#8217; model for workers &#8212; which the company says would need to developed in consultation with stakeholders.</p>
<p>It also says it recognizes that platforms are likely to remain subject to a patchwork of national rules across the EU. And even if the Commission opts to legislate it would be years before such laws take effect &#8212; so case law will remain hugely important. But Uber is evidently keen to try to steer any overarching EU guidance which might exert top-down pressure on how Member States approach and apply policy in the area of gig work.</p>
<p>Platform giants have long sought to frame employment classification as a question of &#8216;flexibility vs benefits&#8217; &#8212; claiming workers value flexibility (which they define as meaning &#8216;the ability to choose when to work&#8217;) above all else, even as they apply datafication and tracking to manage individuals&#8217; service delivery via high tech micromanagement of a non-employed labor force.</p>
<p>Thing is: Sure you can log on to such a platform to work &#8216;when you choose&#8217; but without legal protections such as a mandatory minimum wage there&#8217;s no guarantee that gig work &#8216;flexibility&#8217; will sum to a liveable income for the individual. Which in turn means platform workers may not have <em>defacto</em> flexibility/freedom to choose when and how they work &#8212; unless they have other income to rely on.</p>
<p>The platforms are therefore often pushing a paradoxical defence of a business model that critics accuse of being abusive by design &#8212; with critical unions dubbing it exploitative and extractive of human labor, accusing platforms of circumventing the social contract and stability offered by traditional employment.</p>
<p>In a section of Uber&#8217;s white paper that argues why &#8220;employment is not the answer for platform workers&#8221; the tech giant points on cue to &#8216;flexibility&#8217; &#8212; saying its model means that &#8220;drivers can connect freely to meet that demand or choose a quieter time of day if they wish&#8221;. Yet people who need to earn a living may not be able to &#8216;choose&#8217; a quieter time of day if they&#8217;re being paid by the job, since doing so would reduce their earnings, so how much flexibility (or pay decency) does Uber really offer?</p>
<p>(Related: The large sums of money many of these gig giants have spent on trying to accelerate the development of automation technologies; ergo, money they save on not paying employment-linked taxes is being ploughed into trying to replace human workers entirely. So where&#8217;s the dignity in that?)</p>

<h2>Decision time for the gig economy</h2>
<p>In her December 2019 <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/sites/comm-cwt2019/files/commissioner_mission_letters/mission-letter-nicolas-schmit_en.pdf">mission letter</a> to the job commissioner, the European Commission president Ursula Von der Leyen tasked the Nicolas Schmit with looking at<em> &#8220;</em>ways to improve the labour conditions of platform workers<em>&#8221; &#8212;</em> including by ensuring that enforcement of current laws is working &#8212; writing that: <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Dignified, transparent and predictable working conditions are essential to our economic model.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Soon after Schmit got his instructions, he sounded a balanced tone on the contentious issue of platform (profits) vs worker (rights), telling <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/nicolas-schmit-the-first-dignity-of-work-is-to-pay-people-a-fair-wage/">Euroactiv</a> that he&#8217;s &#8220;not against platforms&#8221;, and sees them as &#8220;part of our new economy&#8221; &#8212; arguing too that it&#8217;s &#8220;important for Europe, not to lose the edge with this economy&#8221;.</p>
<p>But he also warned that the bloc must not allow high tech tools to be used to embed a new &#8220;underprivileged&#8221; worker underclass, saying: &#8220;We cannot have the economy of the 21st century with working conditions that are more comparable to those in the 19th century.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Deliveroo&#8217;s &#8216;flexible&#8217; labor model likened to 20th century dockyards&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/deliveroos-flexible-labor-model-likened-to-20th-century-dockyards/embed/#?secret=TAK7PPOfRw" data-secret="TAK7PPOfRw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Quite how the Commission will square the circle of &#8216;improving&#8217; precarious platform work in policy terms remains to be seen. But the imperative for it to do good work here has only increased since Von der Leyen issued the instruction: The coronavirus pandemic has shone an excoriating spotlight on the risks &#8212; individual and societal &#8212; of the lack of a proper social safety net for platform workers, even as on-demand platform work (especially in areas like food and grocery delivery) has been fired up as a side effect of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Uber&#8217;s white paper riffs on the theme of the pandemic and the need for platform businesses to &#8216;go further&#8217; in supporting workers &#8212; aka &#8220;to ensure independent workers have access to benefits and protections when they need them most&#8221;, as it puts it &#8212; even as it lobbies against providing all the rights and benefits of employment.</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes sense for them to be pushing for a minimum standard of benefits,&#8221; says Joe Aiston, senior associate in the employment group at international law firm Taylor Wessing, discussing Uber lobbying for a &#8216;new standard&#8217; for gig work in the white paper. &#8220;As sort of appropriate minimums/protections. And perhaps things which are easier to give without significant disruption to the business model.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whereas having to reclassify everyone as employees or as workers would involve quite significant disruption to the business model &#8212; and is obviously going to result in significant extra cost for them as a business. Both from the point of view of things like minimum wage and holiday pay, but also the potential knock-on effect from a tax perspective as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>And whilst analysis of worker status does not automatically make those people employees for tax purposes,  Aiston says tests are &#8220;pretty similar&#8221;. Hence litigation over employment classification presents a clear risk to Uber&#8217;s tax status &#8212; and thus to its (potential) profitability.</p>
<p>On the issue of how to improve gig work, the European Commission has been gathering evidence as it works towards determining how best to proceed &#8212; including holding a conference on platform work last September. But big decisions are looming for EU lawmakers this year.</p>
<p>Later this month the Commission will launch a formal consultation of workers&#8217; and employers&#8217; representatives. And Uber&#8217;s white paper is clearly targeted at that process so we&#8217;re likely to see a number of self-interested attempts to influence platform working condition &#8216;improvements&#8217; kick off in earnest.</p>
<p>Exactly what will be in play, policy wise, isn&#8217;t yet clear. But, last March, the Commission published a 285-page <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=en&amp;catId=89&amp;newsId=9582&amp;furtherNews=yes">study</a> in which it said the &#8220;main&#8221; challenges identified vis-a-vis the working conditions of platform workers include: Employment status; information available to the workers about their working conditions; dispute resolution; collective rights and non-discrimination. (So pretty much a full house, then.)</p>
<p>Dig into the actual study and it also discusses low remuneration and insecure income in plenty of detail and as &#8216;significant stressors&#8217; for platform workers.</p>
<p>Pay certainly looks set to be a significant area of discussion/contention &#8212; not least because another of Von der Leyen&#8217;s instructions to Schmit asked him to put forward a legal instrument &#8220;to ensure that every worker in our Union has a fair minimum wage&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a common criticism of platform work that earnings may fall below the legal minimum for a worker (as pay by gig jobs typically only generate earnings during a job or on completion of a delivery, not for all the down time spent waiting to score a gig or pick up the goods). So if the EU&#8217;s fair minimum wage for &#8216;every worker&#8217; ends up meaning &#8216;except platform workers&#8217; that will sum to the Commission rubberstamping a tech-enabled &#8220;underprivileged&#8221; worker class &#8212; just as Schmit said it mustn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Uber&#8217;s approach to the issue of pay in its white paper sidesteps the minimum wage issue by talking only of &#8220;fair and transparent earnings&#8221; (or &#8220;decent&#8221; pay) for platform workers.</p>
<p>The tech giant also says it&#8217;s &#8220;ready to lead the industry by advocating for changes to the way platform workers are paid&#8221; &#8212; though it makes it clear it won&#8217;t budge on remuneration without the sought for industry-wide enabling framework (&#8220;for flexible earning opportunities, with industry-wide benefits and protections that all platform companies must offer independent workers&#8221;).</p>
<p>&#8220;This could include universal standards, such as the Proposition 22 legislation recently introduced in California. Or it could be based on a European model of social dialogue, where platform workers, policy-makers and industry representatives work together to set earning principles for the industry,&#8221; Uber suggests.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;After Prop 22&#8217;s passage, Uber is taking its lobbying effort global&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/after-prop-22s-passage-uber-is-taking-its-lobbying-effort-global/embed/#?secret=PsCwy8TOYn" data-secret="PsCwy8TOYn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;For example, in Italy the food delivery industry and the General Labour Union signed an agreement confirming the self employed status of couriers while requiring the industry to provide working standards for couriers, including provisions about earnings, injury, third-party insurance and training.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Critically, whatever the earning model, it must be based on an industry-wide level playing field to ensure all independent workers have a consistent earnings baseline, whichever platform they choose to work with,&#8221; Uber adds.</p>
<p>Clearly, then, the stakes are high all round on this one: For gig workers&#8217; rights; for platform giants&#8217; profits; and for EU lawmakers&#8217; credibility in claiming a socially progressive agenda.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s not 100% certain the bloc will come with legislation at this point, either. A Commission spokeswoman suggested policymaking could be off the table if platforms and workers can come to a consensus agreement over what &#8216;better&#8217; precarious work looks like. (But, yeah, good luck with that.)</p>

<p>The formal consultation of &#8220;social partners&#8221; that&#8217;s set to kick off later this month will consist of two stages, per the Commission spokeswoman.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first stage seeks their views on the need of a possible EU initiative to improve the working conditions of people working through platforms. In the second stage, they will be consulted on the possible content of such an initiative,&#8221; she said, noting that the Commission will &#8220;carefully assess social partners’ replies&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Provided social partners do not decide to negotiate an agreement among themselves, the Commission intends to put forward a legislative initiative by the end of 2021,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman confirmed that the policy areas where challenges had been identified &#8212; and where &#8220;improvements may be needed&#8221; &#8212; include &#8220;precarious working conditions, transparency and predictability of contractual arrangements, health and safety challenges and adequate access to social protection&#8221;.</p>
<p>Asked to confirm whether &#8216;precarious working conditions&#8217; includes low and unstable renumeration she declined to specify, saying: &#8220;I’m afraid the [aforementioned list] is as far as we can go regarding the initiative at this stage.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Employment status</h2>
<p>Among a number of policy considerations summarized at the end of the Commission-instigated study into gig worker conditions is the statement that employment status remains a core challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some platforms seem to operate at the margins between self-employed and employee, adjusting practices to maximise control over platform workers without unequivocally assuming the role of employers,&#8221; the report observes, noting the discrepancy between the (plodding) pace of case law clarifying where the employment classification line lies and the &#8220;fast-changing business practices characterising platform work&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless Member States widen the concept of employee or introduce a rebuttable presumption on the employment status of platform workers [through legislation or case law], platforms are likely to continue or expand their reliance on labour from self-employed individuals,&#8221; it continues.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reclassification of individual cases may happen on the basis of EU law or on national legislation, but it is unlikely that this will drastically reverse the main trend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Actions aimed at protecting self-employed platform workers who are economically dependent on the platforms to ensure some minimum standards as to their ‘working conditions’ seem advisable,&#8221; the report also adds &#8212; while an associated &#8216;policy implication&#8217; suggests that the EU and Member States &#8220;should consider clarifying which platform practices are incompatible with self-employment for platform workers&#8221;.</p>
<p>Clarification of self-employment tests &#8212; or of practices that should fail the test &#8212; is one way for pan-EU policymakers to move. Though, again, it remains to be seen which ideas the Commission will choose to champion as it takes more feedback on the gig economy.</p>
<p>On the employment classification case law front, a major decision is looming in the UK in relation to Uber&#8217;s ride-hailing business. A 2016 employment tribunal challenge to Uber&#8217;s classification drivers as self employed is headed for a final judgement on Friday &#8212; when the UK Supreme Court is expected to deliver its verdict on a case that has seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/10/uber-loses-uk-tribunal-appeal-over-driver-employment-rights/">Uber lose</a> a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/uber-loses-another-appeal-against-drivers-rights-in-uk/">number of appeals</a> over the last five years.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court ruling will likely have ramifications for the ~45,000 drivers who Uber says operate on its platform in London &#8212; and likely more widely across the UK.</p>
<p>It could also ripple out beyond that, given the active attention now being paid to improving the lot of gig workers by EU policymakers.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/uber-driver-reclassified-as-employee-in-france/">Last year</a> a French court of last resort<a href="https://www.courdecassation.fr/jurisprudence_2/communiques_presse_8004/prestation_chauffeur_9665/press_release_44526.html"> ruled</a> that a former Uber driver should have been considered an employee instead of a self-employed partner.  It found there was a relationship of subordination between the company and the driver &#8212; flagging issues such as the inability of drivers to set prices; build their own customer base; or choose how to execute a task. “The driver participates in a managed transportation service and Uber unilaterally defines the operating terms,” it wrote.</p>
<p>However Uber denied the case set a precedent while also claiming to have made a number of changes to how its platform operates since the challenge was lodged in 2017 &#8212; suggesting drivers have been given more control over how they use Uber and now have greater &#8220;stronger social protections&#8221; (such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/uber-is-going-to-provide-accident-insurance-in-france-for-free/">free accident insurance</a>).</p>
<p>The case underlines the difficulties of relying on complaint-based case law to shape coherent outcomes for platform workers, plural.</p>
<p>The length of time such challenges take to reach a final outcome also give the platforms plenty of time to reconfigure their operations so they can at least try to claim specific findings no longer apply.</p>
<p>So legislation may indeed be required to lock in improvements for the conditions of gig workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true to say that things can change &#8212; so if Uber, following [the Supreme Court] decision materially change how the business model works then it&#8217;s possible they could then bring the drivers outside of the definition again,&#8221; says Aiston, although he points out the required changes in that context may, as it turns out, not be &#8220;acceptable&#8221; to Uber.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to wait to see what the variables the Supreme Court decides push it one way or the other but they would have to make a determination as to whether it works in the context of their business model to make such potentially significant changes to how things work,&#8221; he goes on, adding: &#8220;I suspect that they may already have been putting in place changes to how the business model works &#8212; perhaps to prepare for the judgement.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I guess the point there is the case law is so context-specific that that&#8217;s an argument to say that actually legislation and specific definitions are key rather than perhaps relying on very specific case law.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s study does also notes a number of challenges holding back policymaking in this area &#8212; even things as basic as clearly defining platform work; or gathering sufficiently comprehensive data to inform evidence-based policymaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once someone is classified as a worker, rather than an independent contractor, then that does potentially increased their ability and right to collectively bargain &#8212; so it&#8217;s another potential knock on effect should the Supreme Court decision go against Uber,&#8221; adds Aiston. &#8220;It might lead to the potential for a greater ability for their drivers/riders to collectively bargain so that will be something the relevant unions are looking out for keenly as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Attempts to regulate and legislate are, meanwhile, in train in Europe at a national level. Such as in Spain where the government has sought for several years to crack down on platforms using so called &#8216;<em>falsos autonomos</em>&#8216; (aka falsely self-employed workers), and is in the process of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.es/trabajo-creara-ley-acabar-falsos-autonomos-riders-586109">reforming labor laws</a> to reflect and capture platform work.</p>
<p>That national labor reform process could result in platforms being required to hire delivery workers, per <a href="https://www.elmundo.es/economia/2021/02/10/6024035e21efa06b6c8b465a.html">recent reports</a> &#8212; and such moves give platform giants added incentive to lobby the Commission for &#8216;more flexible&#8217; pan-EU rules which may at least limit how far national law can travel to influence rules on the grounds elsewhere in the bloc (so limit potential damage to their business model).</p>
<p>The UK government has also suggested legislation is coming. It conducted a major <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/good-work-the-taylor-review-of-modern-working-practices">review of modern working practices</a> back in 2017 &#8212; which included looking at gig work. And among the Taylor Review&#8217;s recommendations was that the current (UK) legal classification of ‘worker’ should be updated to better reflect gig work &#8212; with the report suggesting ‘dependent contractor’ would be a more appropriate framing now &#8212; and also that greater focus should be paid to the control exercised over workers by platforms.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The review led to a </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/07/uk-outs-plan-to-bolster-gig-economy-workers-rights/">government plan</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to bolster worker rights, as it was billed with much fanfare. </span>However the &#8216;Good Work Plan&#8217; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/17/uk-workplace-rights-reform-doesnt-look-disruptive-to-gig-economy-giants/">reform package</a> unveiled at the end of 2018 was instantly dismissed as weak and lacking substance by labor unions (vs the government trumpeting it as a massive expansion of workers rights). Not does it seem to have done much to address gig work specifically, as yet.</p>
<p>A commitment by the UK government as part of that plan in 2018 by the UK government to legislate to improve the clarity of employment status tests &#8212; in order to “reflect the reality of the modern working relationships” &#8212; has not <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/employment-law-in-the-modern-economy-the-good-work-plan/">amounted to anything yet</a>.</p>
<p>The planned legislation may have been delayed as result of the pandemic. Aiston suggests it&#8217;s also possible the government is waiting for the Supreme Court judgement in the Uber tribunal case to inform its policy thinking. So for all Uber&#8217;s slick regional PR push to influence policymaking, it may have relatively little say in the matter vs European case law and the court of public opinion.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the Supreme Court judgement does against [Uber] in the sense that the drivers were workers I think that&#8217;s probably going to make things at least a bit more difficult for them. Because in the UK at least they&#8217;re going to have decide that well either we accept that all drivers are workers or &#8212; depending on reasons given for the judgement &#8212; can we adjust our business model to bring it away from that analysis,&#8221; says Aiston.</p>
<p>&#8220;They may be keen to do the latter, on the basis that they are obviously keen to keep people being self-employed rather than workers but I guess from a PR perspective that might not look great for them to do that. Once a judgement has been made that they are workers, one view is that you just need to accept that now and move on and acknowledge that they have those rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>He points to examples of gig economy companies trying to &#8216;pre-empt or negate&#8217; the risk of reclassification of &#8216;self-employed&#8217; contractors as workers by putting in place benefits packages &#8212; such as Uber offering free or low cost insurances to drivers and riders in Europe &#8212; &#8220;to show that they are a &#8216;good&#8217; company and they want to look after people&#8221;.</p>
<p>Such efforts fall short of the suite of rights reclassified platform workers <em>could</em> get so there&#8217;s more movement that could happen here &#8212; and may have to in order to keep the travelling public on side.</p>
<p>&#8220;They tend not to go to the extreme and say well we&#8217;ll acknowledge that they&#8217;re workers and therefore they&#8217;re entitled to minimum wage and their rest breaks and that kind of thing. So it&#8217;s something to look out for as well with these gig economy businesses,&#8221; Aiston suggests. &#8220;I think it will become more competitive from that perspective.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether or not they acknowledge that people are workers is one thing but I think you can see a definite move towards gig economy businesses realizing that they have a duty to look after people&#8230; Obviously that serves a dual purpose of people getting some benefits but also it being a positive thing from a PR perspective and the point of view of the public view of these companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that UK employment law is more nuanced than some national employment law &#8212; as it does already recognize the concept of a &#8216;worker&#8217; (i.e, not an employee and not self-employed) &#8212; while Aiston notes some other European countries (and also the US) have a more limited set of classifications (i.e. employed vs self employed).</p>
<p>&#8220;European courts will look to things like the Supreme Court decision in the UK. And whilst they&#8217;re not bound by that decision you can imagine that the way that this swings will have at least some kind of knock-on effect to how any similar judgements are taken across Europe,&#8221; he suggests. &#8220;The interesting thing to bear in mind is that in the UK we have this middle classification of a worker. Whereas in most European countries you&#8217;re either self employed, a contractor or an employee. So there&#8217;s a bigger dichotomy elsewhere in Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a way the UK&#8217;s in a better position because we have this middle ground. And some people might say that has made the UK courts be in a position more easily to reclassify &#8212; assuming that the Supreme Court goes the same was as the court of appeal did [in the Uber employment tribunal case], which was to state that these drivers were in fact workers. So it&#8217;s important to note there&#8217;s a difference there,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the UK you can understand why it has perhaps been a bit more easy for a court to make a decision that the driver should fit within this middle category where they attract some protections but not all of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>If EU policymakers were to decide to create a pan-EU standard akin to &#8216;worker&#8217; that would present a huge opportunity/risk for Uber et al &#8212; with the chance to influence key parameters in their interests as a means of reducing the threat employment litigation poses to their core business model (and staving off a larger tax bill).</p>
<p>Though there will clearly be costs involved in an expansion of the level of protection offered to gig workers. The question for tech giants would be how much they can shrink those costs &#8212; aka what&#8217;s the bare minimum in &#8216;relevant&#8217; standards they can sell across Europe?</p>
<p>Alternatively, EU lawmakers could seek to stipulate and enforce a list of &#8216;dos and don&#8217;ts&#8217; for platforms vis-a-vis workers &#8212; as a way to establish appropriately &#8216;fair&#8217; operational employment limits &#8212; which in turn might have the potential to be disruptive to the business model of on-demand giants whose profits (often still <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-results/uber-sees-profit-by-end-of-2020-but-still-expects-full-year-loss-idINKBN2002UQ">theoretical</a> at this point) depend on access to plentiful, low cost labor supplied by lots of people they claim not to employ.</p>
<p>Setting a list of specific operational requirements for platforms is exactly what the Commission has proposed in an overarching platform regulation that EU lawmakers set out in December (the Digital Markets Act) &#8212; in that case aimed at intermediating platforms which have the most market power to push for fair dealing with other businesses (and foster digital competition).</p>
<p>Something similar for gig platforms that aims to ensure a fair deal for workers is at least conceivable.</p>
<p>It would surely be preferable to Uber et al vs being legally required to put hundreds of thousands of on-demand workers on the payroll. But it would also put an end to the free ride these giants used to scale in the first place.</p>
<p>So it may not be the end of the road for the platform economy in Europe but a period of considerable adjustable looks inevitable &#8212; and business models will need to adapt to changing (and/or better enforced) employment laws.</p>
<p>Aiston says organisations will have to weigh up the pros and cons of adjusting their business models &#8212; with a view to either seeking to keep arrangements away from employee or worker status (but potentially reducing how much control they can apply, e.g. over price); or to accept people are workers and adapt the business model and pricing structure accordingly (such as by, say, restricting the ability to work for rival platforms).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India said on Monday local firms will no longer need a license or other permission to collect, generate, store and share geospatial data of the country, bringing sweeping changes to its earlier stance that it admitted hindered innovation.</p>
<p>Until now, New Delhi required Indian firms to seek licenses and additional approvals to create and publish topographical data. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said today’s &#8220;deregulation&#8221; step will help the country become more self-reliant and reach its $5 trillion GDP goal.</p>
<p>“The regulations that apply to geospatial data and maps henceforth stand radically liberalised. The Department of Science and Technology is announcing sweeping changes to India’s mapping policy, specifically for Indian companies. What is readily available globally does not need to be restricted in India and therefore geospatial data that used to be restricted will now be freely available in India,” New Delhi said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/dev3/final-approved-guidelines-on-geospatial-data">guidelines</a>, New Delhi said local firms will be permitted access to &#8220;ground truthing/verification&#8221; that includes access to Indian ground stations and augmentation services for real-time positioning. Indian firms will also be provided access to terrestrial mobile mapping surveys, street view surveys and surveying in Indian territorial waters.</p>
<p>New Delhi said in the guidelines that only Indian firms shall be permitted access to the aforementioned surveys. Google has previously <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/google-street-view-proposal-rejected-by-govt/articleshow/63482412.cms?from=mdr">made unsuccessful attempts</a> to launch its Street View service in India. A Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company was reviewing the guidelines and had no immediate comment to offer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Foreign companies and foreign owned or controlled Indian companies can license from Indian Entities digital Maps/Geospatial Data of spatial accuracy/value finer than the threshold value only for the purpose of serving their customers in India. Access to such Maps/Geospatial Data shall only be made available through APIs that do not allow Maps/Geospatial Data to pass through Licensee Company or its servers. Re-use or resale of such map data by licensees shall be prohibited,&#8221; the guidelines added.</p>
<p>Devdatta Tengshe, who works in the GIS space, told TechCrunch that the government&#8217;s move today was significant for the local ecosystem, including citizens, as previous restrictions had created an uncertainty on what precisely was permitted.</p>
<p>“Today’s announcement makes it explicitly clear that Indian entities can perform any location data collection and we can collect data on our own,” he said. “Additionally, the location data from agencies like municipality will be made available to Indian entities.”</p>
<p>Flipkart-backed 25-year-old firm MapMyIndia said today’s move by the government is “historic” as it opens up maps and the geospatial sector and ushers the self-reliance era in “strategic areas of maps to empower all 1.3 billion Indians and give unprecedented opportunities and growth for Indian companies.”</p>
<p>Modi said: &#8220;The reforms will unlock tremendous opportunities for our country’s start-ups, private sector, public sector and research institutions to drive innovations and build scalable solutions. India’s farmers will also be benefited by leveraging the potential of geo-spatial &amp; remote sensing data. Democratizing data will enable the rise of new technologies &amp; platforms that will drive efficiencies in agriculture and allied sectors. These reforms demonstrate our commitment to improving ease of doing business in India by deregulation.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM revealed Sunday a refreshed Chevrolet Bolt EV and a new, bigger — yet still compact — crossover called the Chevrolet Bolt EUV as part of the automaker&#8217;s goal to introduce 30 electric vehicles in the next four years.</p>
<p>The vehicles, which are expected to go on sale this summer, are like siblings: the pair share much of the same DNA but have their own distinct differences. The 2022 Chevy Bolt EUV is bigger than the Chevy Bolt hatchback. GM lengthened the wheelbase of the EUV by about 3 inches. In all, the EUV sits some 6 inches longer than the Bolt EV. The result is a compact crossover with 39.1 inches of rear seat legroom.</p>
<p>The EUV — a GM acronym that means electric utility vehicle — also has the notable distinction of being the first Chevrolet to have the hands-free driver assistance system known as Super Cruise. The hands-free system won&#8217;t come standard, however. Drivers will have to upgrade beyond the EUV&#8217;s $33,995 base price.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That $33,995 price point stands out because it&#8217;s actually slighter cheaper than the 2021 Chevy Bolt that is currently sitting in dealerships. The new refreshed Chevy Bolt, which is described in greater details below, has also received a price cut.</p>
<p>The takeaway: GM is using its scale to keep prices low in hopes of attracting customers who have a growing pool of EV options.</p>

<p>The EUV will have an estimated range of 250 miles, which is a few miles lower than the Bolt EV. The vehicle will also come with a standard dual level charge cord with a changeable plug that lets drivers choose 120V and 240V charging.</p>
<p>The EUV will also come with native navigation. That&#8217;s an important addition in this two-member Bolt portfolio. The Chevy Bolt EV, which first debuted in 2016, doesn&#8217;t have a native in-car navigation and instead relies on either Android Auto or Apple CarPlay for maps and driving directions.</p>
<p>Importantly, neither one of these vehicles is part of the new Ultium battery platform that GM revealed in spring 2020. The Ultium platform is designed to support a wide range of products across its brands, including compact cars, work trucks, large premium SUVs, performance vehicles. The Bolt EUV and Bolt EV should be viewed as an important placeholder, two vehicles that will help keep it in the game while it works on its more ambitious EV strategy.</p>

<p>The Bolt EUV wasn&#8217;t the only vehicle GM revealed Sunday. The automaker has also refreshed the Chevrolet Bolt, the hatchback electric vehicle that first debuted more than four years ago.</p>
<p>The upshot: many of the specs stayed the same, the interior got an upgrade and the price dropped by $5,500.<br />
The 2022 Chevy Bolt&#8217;s underlying battery platform, the BEV2, has remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The car, which goes on sale this summer, has a 65 kilowatt-hour battery pack that provides an estimated 259 miles of range. It is also still powered by a single motor &#8212; just like the original &#8212; that generates 200 horsepower and 266 pound-feet of torque. The vehicle is the same width as before, but gained a skosh in height and is now 63.4 inches taller, while losing less than an inch in length.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2112878" style="width: 5710px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2022-Chevrolet-BoltEV-014.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2112878" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2112878 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2022-Chevrolet-BoltEV-014.jpg" alt="" width="5700" height="3800" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2022-Chevrolet-BoltEV-014.jpg 5700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2022-Chevrolet-BoltEV-014.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2022-Chevrolet-BoltEV-014.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2022-Chevrolet-BoltEV-014.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2022-Chevrolet-BoltEV-014.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2022-Chevrolet-BoltEV-014.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2022-Chevrolet-BoltEV-014.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2022-Chevrolet-BoltEV-014.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5700px) 100vw, 5700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2112878" class="wp-caption-text">2022 Chevrolet Bolt EV</p></div></p>
<p>The 2022 Chevy Bolt, which starts at $31,995, is a couple grand cheaper than the new Bolt EUV. For that price, GM tried to pack in a bit more such as an updated modern interior and &#8220;more comfortable&#8221; bucket seating, according to the company. GM said the improvements were based on customer feedback.</p>
<p>The vehicle includes a touchscreen display that is a bit larger at 10.2 inches as well as an 8-inch digital instrument cluster. Just like the previous version, the 2022 model comes standard with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. As mentioned before, the 2022 Chevy Bolt still doesn&#8217;t come standard with in-car navigation, relying instead on CarPlay or Android Auto.</p>
<p>One new feature is a button in the center console that when engaged allows one-pedal driving. The driver depresses the accelerator pedal to move; once the driver&#8217;s foot leaves the pedal, the vehicle&#8217;s regenerative braking kicks in and will bring the vehicle to a stop.</p>
<p>The Chevy Bolt doesn&#8217;t come with GM&#8217;s hands-free driver assistance system known as Super Cruise. GM chose the Chevy Bolt EUV for that system, which has been corralled over in Cadillac for the past several years. The Bolt hatchback does come standard with the &#8220;Chevy Safety Assist,&#8221; six  features that includes lane keeping assist and a warning if the vehicle leaves the lane.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The only people who truly understand a relationship are the ones who are in it. Luckily for us, we&#8217;re going to have a candid conversation with both parties in the relationship between Ironclad CEO and cofounder Jason Boehmig and his investor and board member Accel partner Steve Loughlin.</p>
<p>Loughlin led Ironclad&#8217;s Series A deal back in 2017, making it one of his first Series A deals after returning to Accel.</p>
<p>This episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> goes down on Wednesday at 3pm ET/12pm PT, just like usual.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk to the duo about how they met, what made them &#8216;choose&#8217; each other, and how they&#8217;ve operated as a duo since. How they built trust, maintain honesty, and talk strategy are also on the table as part of the discussion.</p>
<p>Loughlin was an entrepreneur before he was an investor, founding RelateIQ (an Accel-backed company) in 2011. The company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/11/salesforce-buys-big-data-startup-relateiq-for-up-to-390m/">acquired by Salesforce in 2014 for $390 million</a> and later became Salesforce IQ. Loughlin then &#8220;came back home&#8221; to Accel in 2016, and has led investments in companies like Airkit, Ascend.io, Clockwise, Ironclad, Monte Carlo, Nines, Productiv, Split.io, and Vivun.</p>
<p>Not entirely unsurprising for a man who has dominated the legal tech sphere, Jason Boehmig is a California barred attorney who practiced law at Fenwick &amp; West and was also an adjunct professor of law at Notre Dame Law School. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ironclad/">Ironclad</a> launched in 2014 and today the company has raised more than $180 million and, according to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/mary-meekers-vc-firm-bond-invests-in-ironclad-at-nearly-1-billion-valuation">reports</a>, is valued just under $1 billion.</p>
<p>Not only will we peel back the curtain on how this investor/founder relationship works, but we&#8217;ll also hear from these two tech leaders on their thoughts around bigger enterprise trends in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Then, it&#8217;s time for the pitch deck teardown. On each episode of Extra Crunch Live, we take a look at decks submitted by the audience and our experienced guests give their live feedback. If you want to throw your deck in the ring, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">submit your deck</a> for a future episode.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The tech industry has long grappled with an overwhelming lack of diversity among employees, executives, venture-backed founders, venture capital firms and board members. And despite recent efforts to increase diversity throughout the industry, tech still remains predominantly white and male.</p>
<p>Over the years, many have argued that the lack of diversity in tech is caused by a so-called pipeline problem: that there is little diversity in tech because there is not enough qualified talent from diverse backgrounds.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, there is</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/upshot/dont-blame-recruiting-pipeline-for-lack-of-diversity-in-tech.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">well-established data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that proves the lack of diversity in tech cannot be attributed to a pipeline problem, Uber Chief Diversity Officer Bo Young Lee told TechCrunch.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If we want to claim that it&#8217;s a pipeline issue, we would first have to claim that we&#8217;ve hired what is available in the pipeline,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a pipeline issue as much as it is a recruiting process challenge.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>But the notion that there is a pipeline problem, despite the evidence showing there is not one, at least partly remains in the public psyche. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Courri Brady, director at diversity, equity and inclusion consulting firm Paradigm, recognizes there are still some folks who have yet to rid themselves of the myth of the pipeline problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s still a perception to some degree that there&#8217;s a pipeline problem within some companies that I&#8217;m personally supporting,&#8221; Brady told TechCrunch. &#8220;But there are a couple of dynamics at play. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of those dynamics, Brady said, pertains to recruiting processes, which are relatively fixed inside tech companies. </span></p>
<p>If companies are convinced only certain schools, programs or other companies are the only places that produce good talent, and those people are not diverse, Brady said, &#8220;then those issues are going to perpetuate themselves.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="http://joyrankin.com/">Dr. Joy Lisi Rankin</a>, a research lead for gender, race and power in artificial intelligence at the <a href="https://ainowinstitute.org/">AI Now Institute</a>, is actively researching the history of the pipeline problem. In the next six months, the plan is to publish it as a report and potentially turn it into a book. Rankin was kind of enough to give TechCrunch a sneak peek into some of her research so far.</p>
<p>&#8220;The very high-level view is, people have been talking about a pipeline problem in some form since the seventies,&#8221; Rankin told me. &#8220;And before that, often, it was like a quote, manpower problem, by focusing on who has PhDs or master&#8217;s degrees in a field or who has elite jobs in a field. But that focus is always on individuals. It&#8217;s on tracking people, not institutions and not structures. So this is why I think it continues to be a convenient excuse for a host of sins, because talking about a pipeline makes it seem as if all things are equal in the United States, and we just have to find a way to keep people in. But the truth is, when we think about a STEM pipeline, we don&#8217;t talk about the fact that education in the United States is by no means equal from birth onwards.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are, of course, programs like Black Girls Code, Girls Who Code, Code.org and others that aim to step in to help introduce kids to technology. But these issues go deeper than just STEM education, Rankin said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a long time, it was you had to have a certain SAT score to get in somewhere or a certain GRE score for graduate school,&#8221; Rankin said. &#8220;But we know, literally decades of research have shown SATs correlate in no way with how you&#8217;re going to do in college or how you might be as a student, but correlate everything with how wealthy your family is, which also then correlates with race and access to all other sorts of things like tutoring and etc. But that same time of credentialing pops up time and time again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The entire education system has historically functioned as a gatekeeper to knowledge through credentialing, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Credentialing is a form of gatekeeping and protecting who has access to power and who doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There&#8217;s this term that I think was coined a few years ago about how Silicon Valley tech companies are not meritocracies, but &#8216;mirrortocracies,&#8217; so you&#8217;re hiring people who have similar credentials to you, had the same sort of schooling, etcetera. But that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean they&#8217;re more qualified. We know that all sorts of diversity often yields better work and better outcomes in a variety of situations, but focusing on certain types of quote, qualifications and credentials, don&#8217;t reflect that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond education, however, there are also other pipelines at play. There&#8217;s the cradle to prison pipeline, which I&#8217;ve referred to as &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/31/the-other-pipeline/">the other pipeline</a>,&#8221; as well as &#8220;the revolving door of H1B visa workers who are treated with lower status,&#8221; Rankin said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="915KC84FDJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/31/the-other-pipeline/">The other pipeline</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The other pipeline&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/31/the-other-pipeline/embed/#?secret=915KC84FDJ" data-secret="915KC84FDJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;The pipeline is a way to silo all of that out and say, &#8216;we just need to get more Black women in tech,&#8217; as opposed to saying, &#8216;actually, these companies are and have been racist and white supremacist and misogynist, and it&#8217;s those institutions and larger societal and global capitalist structures that need to change.&#8221;</p>
<p>What the idea of the pipeline also doesn&#8217;t capture is the fact that women were often tasked with doing manual computing in the 1950s and sixties, Rankin said. Back then, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/magazine/women-coding-computer-programming.html">many considered coding to be a woman&#8217;s job</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it was only as it became clear how socially and economically and politically important that computing would be, that the profession over a decade or so became masculine. [&#8230;] It clearly shows that as certain types of computing and programming became culturally valuable, more of those jobs that were better paying went to men. And it wasn&#8217;t that the work was any different but that because there was a prestige shift, there was also a shift in how it was gendered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those are just some of the ideas Rankin will outline in her research paper, which she hopes will help to change the conversation happening in the tech industry about diversity, equity and inclusion. Instead of relying on the pipeline as an excuse, Rankin said she hopes the tech industry will focus more on inequities, structural racism, misogyny and how micro-inequities can lead to macro problems.</p>
<p>Rankin&#8217;s report will also have some recommendations, such as working to make education truly equitable and addressing surveillance, as well as the school to prison pipeline. She also believes salary data should be public information.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as we have more transparency around salaries, we can have more meaningful conversations,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/silenced-no-more-act-seeks-to-ban-use-of-ndas-in-situations-involving-harassment-or-discrimination/">Last week</a>, former Pinterest employee Ifeoma Ozoma introduced legislation with the backing of California State Senator Connie Leyva to empower those who experience workplace discrimination and/or harassment. The Silenced No More Act (SB 331) would prevent the use of non-disclosure agreements in workplace situations involving all forms of discrimination and harassment.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s certainly a step in the right direction,&#8221; Rankin said.</p>
<p>The proposed bill would expand the current protections workers have through the Stand Together Against Non-Disclosures Act, also authored by Leyva, that went into effect in 2019. Ozoma, along with former co-worker Aerica Shimizu Banks, came forward with claims of both racial and gender discrimination last year. They eventually settled with Pinterest, but the STAND Act technically only protected them for speaking out about gender discrimination. This new bill would ensure workers are also protected when speaking out about racial discrimination.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be huge and not just for tech, but for your industry as well,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/silenced-no-more-act-seeks-to-ban-use-of-ndas-in-situations-involving-harassment-or-discrimination/">Ozoma told me earlier this week</a>. &#8220;I believe that we don&#8217;t have real progress unless we approach things intersectionally and that&#8217;s the lesson from all of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meredith Whittaker, AI Now Faculty Director and co-organizer of the 2018 Google walkout, said this type of legislation absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;From a structural perspective, it&#8217;s really evident we&#8217;re not going to change toxic, discriminatory tech environments without naming the problems,&#8221; Whittaker told TechCrunch. &#8220;We have decades of failed DEI PR, decades of people blaming the pipeline and decades of brilliant people like Ifeoma, Aerica and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/googles-co-lead-of-ethical-ai-team-says-she-was-fired-for-sending-an-email/">Timnit</a> being harassed and pushed out of these environments. And oftentimes, people aren&#8217;t able to speak about their experiences so that the deep toxicity of these environments &#8212; the way it&#8217;s built into the structural operating procedures of these companies and workplaces &#8212; doesn&#8217;t get aired.&#8221;</p>
<p>There also needs to be more transparency around hiring and corporate recruiting, Rankin said. Pinterest, which was one of the first companies to set goals around diversity, <a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/diversity-report-2020">disclosed last year</a> that its hiring rates for women engineers, underrepresented minority engineers and underrepresented employees. But there&#8217;s room for even more transparency, like how many new hires come from those programs.</p>
<p><a href="https://d1nyezh1ys8wfo.cloudfront.net/static/PDFs/CR24198_BOS-CWW_Uber_2020_Diversity_Report.pdf?uclick_id=85bc6a82-8520-44dd-8b82-ca6f13f82b32">In Uber&#8217;s most recent diversity report</a>, Uber talks about university recruiting, diversifying internship programs and more but the company&#8217;s reported data does not disclose how many hires came from those efforts.</p>
<p>Uber&#8217;s Bo Young Lee says the company is working on better tracking its top-of-funnel pipeline to ensure it&#8217;s representative of the available talent. This is called the <a href="https://www.diversitylab.com/mansfield-rule-4-0/#:~:text=The%20Mansfield%20Rule%2C%20inspired%20by,partner%20promotions%2C%20formal%20client%20pitch">Mansfield rule</a>, which takes the Rooney Rule a couple of steps further. If Uber gets this right, then 14% of its recruiting pipeline would be Black and Hispanic, Lee said, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/upshot/dont-blame-recruiting-pipeline-for-lack-of-diversity-in-tech.html">citing a 2016 New York Times article about engineering graduates</a>. It&#8217;s early days for Uber&#8217;s implementation of the Mansfield Rule, but the plan is to publish some of the data, Lee said. Though, she hasn&#8217;t yet decided exactly what that will look like.</p>
<p><a href="https://kstatic.googleusercontent.com/files/25badfc6b6d1b33f3b87372ff7545d79261520d821e6ee9a82c4ab2de42a01216be2156bc5a60ae3337ffe7176d90b8b2b3000891ac6e516a650ecebf0e3f866">Meanwhile, in Google&#8217;s latest diversity report</a>, the company outlined how more than 1,300 women in Latin America were trained on web development and UX design with the help of Google volunteers and a Google.org grant. As a result, Google said 75% of the women who participated found jobs in tech. What Google did not mention, however, was how many women found jobs at Google.</p>
<p>In that same report, Google mentioned that it hired from 15 Historically Black College and Universities (HBCUs), 39 Hispanic-serving institutions and nine women&#8217;s colleges in the U.S. That all sounds good, but in December, <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&amp;jsonp=vglnk_161307400352510&amp;key=07fc33cfae8c975920593b7e84c31bbc&amp;libId=kl1aj1c20102c1o6000DLc64jqh5z&amp;loc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedailybeast.com%2Fdiversity-recruiter-april-christina-curley-says-google-fired-her-because-she-flagged-their-racist-bullshit&amp;v=1&amp;out=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FRealAbril%2Fstatus%2F1341135819487100928&amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;title=Diversity%20Recruiter%3A%20Google%20Fired%20Me%20Because%20I%20Called%20It%20Out%20on%20%E2%80%98Racist%20Bullshit%E2%80%99&amp;txt=opened%20up%20about%20her%20firing%20in%20a%20lengthy%20Twitter%20thread%20Monday%20night">former Google diversity recruiter April Curley came forward</a> about how she was fired after she &#8220;became aware of all the racist shit put in place to keep black and brown students out of their pipeline.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a large team of recruiters who work incredibly hard to increase the hiring of Black+ and other underrepresented talent at Google, including a dedicated team that partners and strengthens our relationships with HBCUs,&#8221; a Google spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. &#8220;This work is critical &#8211; in 2019 we welcomed graduates from 19 HBCUs and over the past decade, we’ve expanded our recruiting efforts to more than 800 schools. At the same time, we are absolutely committed to maintaining an inclusive and supportive workplace.  We don’t agree with the way April describes her termination, but it’s not appropriate for us to provide a commentary about her claims.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite what may have happened at Google or what happens at other tech companies, it&#8217;s the overall lack of transparency around recruiting processes with which Rankin takes issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s its own form of pipeline that is problematic and inequitable,&#8221; Rankin said. &#8220;[&#8230;] But how do you break down the scale of the problem so that it&#8217;s not just focusing on individuals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rankin does not work inside tech companies and can&#8217;t speak to the inner workings of DEI departments, but said she does believe there are good people who are trying to make things better.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this is a larger problem of education and perspective and how you can get to a point where you have an engineering degree or you get hired by a tech company and you&#8217;ve never had to think about race as a deeply rooted historical, structural problem,&#8221; she said. &#8220;[&#8230;] I think it&#8217;s convenient to disregard some of these larger issues and at some point, ignorance isn&#8217;t an excuse, especially given the events of the past few years.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The new Netflix series &#8220;Lupin&#8221; is a loose adaptation of the Arséne Lupin stories by Maurice Leblanc, but it&#8217;s set in the present day, with a hero who&#8217;s inspired by the exploits of Leblanc&#8217;s fictional &#8220;gentleman thief.&#8221;</p>
<p>Through flashbacks, we meet Assane Diop (played by Omar Sy) as a young Senegalese immigrant who has recently arrived in Paris with his father. As an adult, he&#8217;s transformed himself into an impossible-to-catch thief and master of disguise.</p>
<p>While some of Assane&#8217;s schemes have a satisfying clockwork intricacy, others rely more on his willingness to walk into any room and act as if he belongs there. As the series&#8217; five episodes continue (with more to come), Assane is pulled into a mystery around the crime that put his father in prison.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As we explain on the latest episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">the Original Content podcast</a>, enjoying &#8220;Lupin&#8221; requires some suspension of disbelief — Assane&#8217;s success depends on both an astonishingly incompetent police force and his ability to disappear in a way that&#8217;s hard to imagine in contemporary society. But if you can go that far, the show is a joy to watch, thanks in large part to Sy&#8217;s charismatic performance, as well as the character&#8217;s delightful confidence and ingenuity.</p>
<p>We open the episode by discussing a very different show with the same setting, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/17/original-content-emily-in-paris/">&#8220;Emily in Paris,&#8221;</a> which was recently (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/feb/03/emily-in-paris-writer-on-i-may-destroy-you-snub-golden-globes">and controversially</a>) nominated for two Golden Globes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>You&#8217;ve landed on Human Capital, a weekly newsletter detailing the latest in diversity, equity, inclusion and labor. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here</a> to receive the newsletter every Friday at 1 p.m. PT.</em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s some new legislation that hopes to prevent the use of non-disclosure agreements in workplace situations involving all forms of discrimination and harassment. That would be huge for the tech industry, where NDAs have become commonplace in severance agreements.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, All Raise, Coursera and Niantic announced some new initiatives designed to increase diversity in tech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I&#8217;ve also included an early look of a story I&#8217;m working on about the pipeline myth. Lots more to discuss so let&#8217;s get to it.</p>
<p><b>New legislation seeks to get rid of NDAs in cases of harassment or discrimination</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ifeoma Ozoma, a former Pinterest employee who alleged racial and gender discrimination at the company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/silenced-no-more-act-seeks-to-ban-use-of-ndas-in-situations-involving-harassment-or-discrimination/">is co-leading new legislation with California State Senator Connie Leyva and others to empower those who experience workplace discrimination and/or harassment</a>. The Silenced No More Act (SB 331) would prevent the use of non-disclosure agreements in workplace situations involving all forms of discrimination and harassment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was a legal gamble,” Ozoma told TechCrunch about coming forward with claims of both racial and gender discrimination, despite having signed an NDA. Pinterest could’ve decided to sue both Ozoma and Banks, Ozoma said, but that would’ve required the company to admit wrongdoing.</span></p>
<p><strong>Meredith Whittaker, faculty director at AI Now and Google walkout co-organizer on SB 331</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also caught up with Whittaker, who said this type of legislation is absolutely necessary:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a structural perspective, it&#8217;s really evident we&#8217;re not going to change toxic, discriminatory tech environments without naming the problems. We have decades of failed DEI PR, decades of people blaming the pipeline and decades of brilliant people like Ifeoma, Aerica and</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/googles-co-lead-of-ethical-ai-team-says-she-was-fired-for-sending-an-email/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Timnit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being harassed and pushed out of these environments. And oftentimes, people aren&#8217;t able to speak about their experiences so that the deep toxicity of these environments &#8212; the way it&#8217;s built into the structural operating procedures of these companies and workplaces &#8212; doesn&#8217;t get aired.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>Musings on the pipeline problem</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My conversation with Whittaker led to me being introduced to Dr. Joy Lisi Rankin, a research lead for gender, race and power in artificial intelligence at the</span><a href="https://ainowinstitute.org/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">AI Now Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She’s actively researching the history of the pipeline problem and took some time to chat with me about it. I’m not done with the story yet, but here’s a little teaser:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The very high-level view is, people have been talking about a pipeline problem in some form since the seventies,&#8221; Rankin told me. &#8220;And before that, often, it was like a quote, manpower problem, by focusing on who has PhDs or master&#8217;s degrees in a field or who has elite jobs in a field. But that focus is always on individuals. It&#8217;s on tracking people, not institutions and not structures. So this is why I think it continues to be a convenient excuse for a host of sins, because talking about a pipeline makes it seem as if all things are equal in the United States, and we just have to find a way to keep people in. But the truth is, when we think about a STEM pipeline, we don&#8217;t talk about the fact that education in the United States is by no means equal from birth onwards.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>Ex-Salesforce manager alleges microaggressions and inequity</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cynthia Perry, a former design research senior manager at Salesforce who left earlier this month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/ex-salesforce-manager-alleges-microaggressions-and-inequity/">posted her resignation letter on LinkedIn that detailed her negative treatment at the company.</a> In it, Perry, a Black woman, alleges she experienced “countless microaggressions and inequity” during her time there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, Perry said she left her job because she had been “Gaslit, manipulated, bullied, neglected, and mostly unsupported” by folks she chose not to name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce provided the following statement to TechCrunch:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For privacy reasons, we can’t comment on individual employee matters but Equality is one of our highest values and we have been dedicated to its advancement both inside and outside of our company since we were founded almost 22 years ago.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>All Raise aims to increase diversity at the board level</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite recent efforts to improve diversity at the board level, the number of Black, brown and women board members is still low. All Raise is looking to fix that with the </span><a href="https://medium.com/allraise/all-raise-launches-board-xcelerate-to-diversify-the-boards-of-high-growth-tech-companies-9b48185dd20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent launch of Board Xcelerate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Already, its 90-day search process has resulted in the placement of five independent board members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the gist of the program:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We start by talking with investors, talent partners, and CEOs who want to fill their open independent board seats. Then, we kick off a fast, 90-day closed search process through a pool of talent sourced from our own network and an external advisory committee, supported and executed by a retained executive search firm. Finally, we connect the companies and candidates to interview and determine the best fit.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>Coursera makes some Black History Month commitments </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ed tech company </span><a href="https://blog.coursera.org/coursera-partners-with-howard-university-expands-social-justice-content-and-collaborates-with-facebook-to-offer-scholarships-to-black-learners/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coursera partnered with Howard University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a historically Black university, to beef up its social justice content on the online platform. Coursera also partnered with Facebook to provide scholarships to Black folks who would like to learn more about social media marketing. Lastly, Coursera partnered with non-profit Black Girls Code to offer up to 2,000 young Black girls free access to the Coursera catalog.</span></p>
<p><b>Niantic launches Black Developers Initiative</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Niantic, the augmented reality company behind Pokemon Go, </span><a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/black-developers-initiative/?hl=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched a new initiative to fund new projects from Black game developers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Black Developers Initiative aims to not only fund those projects, but also offer resources and mentorship to Black game and AR developers.</span></p>
<p><b>Alphabet Workers Union has its first win</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, AWU filed a complaint with the NLRB alleging Google contract workers were silenced about pay and that the company fired a worker for speaking out about it. Now, the worker in question, Shannon Wait, is back at work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shannon&#8217;s back at work b/c she had a union to turn to when she was illegally suspended,” </span><a href="https://twitter.com/AlphabetWorkers/status/1359562922603671552"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AWU said in a tweet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “She came to us, we raised hell, &amp; a week later, she&#8217;s back.”</span></p>
<p><b>Amazon warehouse worker union vote begins </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this week, Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama began voting to decide whether or not they will unionize with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. The beginning of the vote came shortly after the National Labor Relations Board rejected Amazon’s attempt to delay the vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By unionizing, Amazon workers hope to gain the right to collectively bargain over their working conditions, like safety standards, pay, breaks and other issues. Unionizing would also enable workers to potentially become “just cause” employees versus at-will, depending on how the negotiations go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mail-in voting ends March 29, with the NLRB set to begin counting ballots the following day on a virtual platform.</span></p>
<p><strong>The latest in Prop 22 battles</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the CA Supreme Court rejecting to hear the lawsuit challenging Prop 22’s constitutionality, the Service Employees International Union filed a similar suit in a lower court, the Alameda County Superior Court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, </span><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/California-Supreme-Court-rejects-Uber-Lyft-15941181.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the CA Supreme Court rejected Uber and Lyft’s request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for it to review a lower court’s decision about whether they misclassified their drivers as independent contractors. The decision in question stated that drivers should be classified as employees, but then Prop 22 passed and made it so, moving forward, Uber and Lyft are legally able to classify their drivers as independent contractors.</span></p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch Sessions: Justice agenda is out!</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/announcing-the-agenda-for-techcrunch-sessions-justice/">released the agenda</a> for the upcoming Justice event on March 3. We’re pumped to be able to host Backstage Capital founder and Managing Partner Arlan Hamilton, Gig Workers Collective’s Vanessa Bain, Alphabet Workers Union Executive Chair Parul Koul, Color of Change President Rashad Robinson, Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tickets are just $5. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on </span></i><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but free, and made for your weekend reading. Want it in your inbox every Saturday morning? Sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</span></i></p>
<p>Earlier this week TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/robinhoods-pain-is-publics-gain-as-vcs-rush-to-give-it-more-money/">broke the news</a> that Public, a consumer stock trading service, was in the process of raising more money. Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fintech-publiccom-valued-at-about-12-billion-in-round-led-by-tiger-2021-2">quickly filled in details</a> surrounding the round, that it could be around $200 million at a valuation of $1.2 billion. Tiger could lead.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Public wants to be the anti-Robinhood. With a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/as-investing-apps-boom-public-doubles-down-on-its-social-focus/">focus on social</a>, and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/trading-app-public-drops-payment-for-order-flow-in-favor-of-tips/">recent move away</a> from generating payment for order flow (PFOF) revenues that have driven Robinhood’s business model, and attracted criticism, Public has laid its bets. And investors, in the wake of its rival’s troubles, are ready to make it a unicorn.</p>
<p>Of course, the Public round comes on the heels of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-long-weekend-brings-a-total-of-3-4-billion-to-its-balance-sheet/">Robinhood’s epic $3.4 billion raise</a>, a deal that was shocking for both its scale and speed. The trading service’s investors came in force to ensure it had the capital it needed to continue supporting consumer trades. Thanks to Robinhood’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-q4-2020-revenue-shows-a-return-to-growth/">strong Q4 2020 results</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/how-the-gamestop-stonkathon-helped-robinhood-raise-3-4b-last-week/">implied growth in Q1 2021</a>, the boosted investment made sense.</p>
<p>As does the Public money, provided that 1) The company is seeing lots of user growth, and 2) That it figures out its forever business model in time. We cannot comment on the second, but we can say a bit about the first point.</p>
<p>Thanks not to Public, really, but M1 Finance, a Midwest-based consumer fintech that has a stock-buying function amongst its other services (more on it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/m1-finance-closes-45m-series-c-mere-months-after-it-raised-its-33m-series-b/">here</a>). It told TechCrunch that it saw a quadrupling of signups in January as compared to December. And in the last two weeks, it saw six times as many signups as the preceding two weeks.</p>
<p>Given that M1 doesn’t allow for trading &#8212; something that its team repeatedly stressed in notes to TechCrunch &#8212; we can’t draw a perfect line between M1 and Public and Robinhood, but we can infer that there is huge consumer interest in investing of late. Which helps explain why Public, which is hunting up a way to generate long-term incomes, can raise another round just months after it closed a different investment.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/17/saving-not-spending-is-the-new-hotness-in-fintech/">notes last year</a> on how savings and investing were the new thing last year are accidentally becoming even more true than we expected.</p>
<h2>Market Notes</h2>
<p>As the week came to a close, Coupang filed to go public. You can read our first look <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/coupang-files-for-mega-us-ipo/">here</a>, but it’s going to be big news. Also on the IPO beat, Matterport is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/matterport-2-9b-spac-announcement-marks-navitas-2nd-billion-dollar-plus-portfolio-company-public-valuation-since-december-301226552.html">going out via a SPAC</a>, I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/as-more-insurtech-offerings-loom-ceo-dan-preston-discusses-metromiles-spac-led-debut/">chatted with Metromile CEO Dan Preston</a> about his insurtech public offering this week that also came via a SPAC, and so on.</p>
<p>Oscar Health filed, and it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/oscar-healths-ipo-filing-will-test-the-venture-backed-insurance-model/">doesn’t look super strong</a>. So its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/how-will-investors-value-metromile-and-oscar-health/">impending valuation</a> is going to test public traders. That’s not a problem that Bumble had when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/bumble-prices-ipo-at-43-per-share/">priced above-range this week</a> and then skyrocketed after it started to trade. Natasha and I (she’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/does-softbank-have-20-more-doordashes/">on Equity</a>, as well) have some notes from Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd that we’ll get to you early next week. (Also I chatted about the IPO with the BBC a few times, which was neat, the first of which you can <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p096q3zc">check out here</a> if you’d like.)</p>
<p>Roblox’s impending public debut was also back in the news this week. The company was a bit bigger than it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/the-roblox-gambit/">thought last year</a> (cool), but <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/roblox-says-revenue-was-higher-than-reported-pushes-listing-to-march.html">may delay its direct listing to March</a> (not cool).</p>
<p>Near to the IPO beat, Carta started to allow its own shares to trade recently, on the back of news that its revenues have <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/revenue-climbs-at-carta-a-vc-favorite-now-valued-at-6-9-billion-after-private-stock-sales">scaled to around $150 million</a>. Not bad Carta, but how about a real IPO instead of staying private? The company’s valuation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/cartas-startup-liquidity-service-cartax-conducts-first-transactions-on-its-own-cap-table/">more than doubled</a> during the secondary transitions.</p>
<p>And then there were so very many cool venture capital rounds that I couldn’t get to this week. This <a href="https://siliconcanals.com/crowdfunding/koa-health-closes-30m/">Koa Health round</a>, for example. And <a href="https://twitter.com/SlyncIO/status/1357292820181225474">whatever this Slync.io news is</a>. (If you want some earlier-stage stuff, check out recent rounds <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/treinta-announces-500k-in-funding-for-its-microbusiness-financial-app/">from Treinta</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/level-closes-1-5m-to-provide-financial-services-to-gig-workers/">Level</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/ramp-secures-150m-debt-line-from-goldman-sachs-as-the-corporate-spend-market-grows/">Ramp</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/monte-carlo-raises-25m-for-its-data-observability-service/">Monte Carlo</a>.</p>
<p>And to close, a small callout to Ontic, which provides “protective intelligence software” and said that <a href="https://ontic.co/press-release/protective-intelligence-software-innovator-ontic-reports-record-177-annual-revenue-increase-as-physical-threats-to-companies-soar/">its revenue grew 177% last year</a>. I appreciate the sharing of the numbers, so wanted to highlight the figure.</p>
<h2>Various and Sundry</h2>
<p>Wrapping this week, I have a final bit for you to chew on from Mark Mader, the CEO of Smartsheet, a public company &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/24/collaboration-platform-smartsheet-nabs-52m-at-800m-valuation/">former startup</a>, it’s worth noting &#8212; that plays in the no-code, automation and collaboration markets. That’s a rough summary. Anyhoo, I asked Mader about no-code trends in 2021, as I have my eyes on the space. Here’s what he wrote for us:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you thought the sudden shift to remote work sped up corporate America’s shift to digital, you haven’t seen anything yet. Digital transformation is going to accelerate even more rapidly in 2021. Last year, the workforce was exposed to many different types of technology all at once. For example, a company may have deployed Zoom or DocuSign for the first time. But much of this shift involved taking analog processes like meetings or document signing and approval and bringing them online. Things like this are merely a first step. 2021 is the year the companies will begin to connect large-scale digital events to infrastructure that can make them automated and repeatable. It’s the difference between one person signing a document and hundreds of people signing hundreds of documents, with different rules for each one. And that’s just one example. Another use case could involve linking HR software to project management software for automated, real-time resource allocation that allows a company to get more out of both platforms, as well as its people. The businesses that can automate and simplify complex workflows like these will see dramatically improved efficiency and return on their technology investments, putting them on the path to true transformation and improved profitability.</p></blockquote>
<p>We shall see!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/zeta-joint-card-seed/">There’s always a fintech angle</a>, even on Valentine’s Day.</p>
<p>This week, I covered Zeta, a new startup working on joint finances for modern couples. It aims to take away the money chores of a relationship, from splitting the bill at dinner to requesting rent through a payment app every month.</p>
<p>Aditi Shekar, the co-founder, gave me some notes about why the ongoing popularity of Venmo is validation for the company, instead of competition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/zeta-joint-card-seed/">Here’s what I learned</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The success of Zeta hinges on the idea that people want to share their finances in an ongoing and meaningful way, and that the world of finance is ready to shift from individualism to collectivism earlier and louder. It sounds daunting, but we already know that social finance is big, as shown by apps like Venmo and Splitwise, and phenomena like the GameStop saga from just a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Other startups have taken notice too, entering the world of multiplayer fintech, a term that categorizes socially focused and consumer-friendly financial services. Braid, a group-financing platform, is trying to make transactions work for various entities, from shared households to side hustles to creative projects.</p></blockquote>
<p>Money is emotional and complex, and the opportunity within the multiplayer fintech reflects just that. The next wave of products will be able to straddle the line of comfort to successfully get adoption, and cultural shift to successfully deliver a truly collaborative cash experience.</p>

<h2><strong>Data on startups is dreadful</strong></h2>
<p>Data about startups is helpful to understand directional trends and how the flow of capital works and changes over time. But as ventures as an asset class grows and the documentation around raises gets thornier, the data can sometimes be missing a big chunk of what’s actually happening on the scenes.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know per Danny Crichton and Alex Wilhelm:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/psa-most-aggregate-vc-trend-data-is-garbage/">PSA: most aggregate VC trend data is garbage</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/are-safes-obscuring-todays-seed-volume/">Are SAFEs obscuring today’s seed volume</a> are two pieces that explain some of the reasons why the numbers might be flawed today. The good news is that the government is also in the dark about funding data; the bad news is that without good tracking, we don’t know how progress is being made.</p>

<h2><strong>The new CEO </strong></h2>
<p>Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos announced weeks ago that he was shifting into an executive chairman role and AWS CEO Andy Jassy would take over as chief executive. In this analysis, our enterprise cloud reporter Ron Miller explores the question: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/is-overseeing-cloud-operations-the-new-career-path-to-ceo/">is overseeing cloud operations the new path to CEO?</a></p>

<p><strong>Here’s what to know, per Andrew Bartels, an analyst at Forrester Research: </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“In both cases, these hyperscale business units of Microsoft and Amazon were the fastest-growing and best-performing units of the companies. [ … ] In both cases, cloud infrastructure was seen as a platform on top of which and around which other cloud offerings could be developed,” Bartels said. The companies both believe that the leaders of these two growth engines were best suited to lead the company into the future.</p></blockquote>

<h2><strong>A triple-hitter Demo Day</strong></h2>
<p>TechCrunch covered favorites from Techstars’ three Demo Days, which were focused on Chicago, Boston and workforce development.

<blockquote><p>The agreement to go public and the order from United Airlines comes less than a year after Archer Aviation came out of stealth. Archer was co-founded in 2018 by Adam Goldstein and Brett Adcock, who sold their software-as-a-service company Vettery to The Adecco Group for more than $100 million. The company’s primary backer was Lore, who sold his company Jet.com to Walmart in 2016 for $3.3 billion. Lore was Walmart’s e-commerce chief until January.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020.</p>
<p>Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This week, we’re taking a look at the Bumble IPO, app store subscription revenue and talk to a developer on a crusade against the fake ratings plaguing the App Store. We&#8217;re also checking in on the missing Google privacy labels&#8230;with a spreadsheet of all 100 apps.</p>

<h1>Top Stories</h1>
<h3>Bumble IPO</h3>
<p>Bumble, the dating app positioned as one of Tinder&#8217;s biggest rivals, began trading on public markets on Thursday. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/bumble-prices-ipo-at-43-per-share">priced its shares at $43,</a> above its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/bumble-files-to-go-public/">earlier</a> target range of $37 to $39. But once live, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/bumble-ipo-bmbl-starts-trading-on-nasdaq.html">BMBL began trading up nearly 77%</a> at $76 per share on Nasdaq, closing the day with a market cap of $7.7 billion and the stock at $70.55.</p>

<p>The app itself was founded in 2014 by early Tinder exec Whitney Wolfe Herd, who now, at 31, is the youngest woman founder to take a U.S. company public and, thanks to the IPO, the world&#8217;s youngest self-made woman billionaire, as well, <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/02/11/bumble-ipo-stock-price-bmbl-shares-whitney-wolfe-herd-net-worth-billionaire-stock-market-update/">said Fortune</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f4cd.png" alt="📍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> From Austin, TX, Bumble CEO &amp; Founder <a href="https://twitter.com/WhitWolfeHerd?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WhitWolfeHerd</a> rings the <a href="https://twitter.com/Nasdaq?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Nasdaq</a> Opening Bell in celebration of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BumbleIPO?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BumbleIPO</a>. <a href="https://t.co/LN4iJuBJqy">pic.twitter.com/LN4iJuBJqy</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Nasdaq (@Nasdaq) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nasdaq/status/1359889158567788547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Wolfe Herd successfully leveraged her knowledge of the online dating market, then combined that with an understanding of how to position a dating app to make it more appealing to women.</p>
<p>On Bumble, women message first, for example, and the company often touts features and updates designed to protect women from bad actors. A lot of what Bumble does is just marketing and spin overlaid on the Tinder model. Like other dating apps, Bumble uses a similar format to connect potential matches: a swipeable &#8220;people catalog,&#8221; where users look at photos, primarily, to determine interest. Bumble, like others, also makes money by charging for extra features that give users a better shot or more efficient experience.</p>
<p>But all this works because users <em>believe</em> Bumble to be different. They believe Bumble is also capable of delivering higher-quality matches than Tinder, which has increasingly re-embraced its persona as a hook-up app.</p>
<p>The IPO&#8217;s success also sends a signal that investors are expecting in-person dating to rebound post-pandemic, and getting in early on the next big mass market dating app is an easy win.</p>
<h3>Developer crusades against scammy subscription apps</h3>
<p>Developer Kosta Eleftheriou, a Fleskly co-founder, has been on a crusade against the scammy and spammy apps overrunning the App Store, as well as Apple&#8217;s failure to do much about it.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Kosta <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/apple-urged-to-root-out-rating-scams-as-developer-highlights-ugly-cost-of-enforcement-failure/">complained that copycat apps were undermining his current business,</a> as the developer of an Apple Watch keyboard app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flicktype-keyboard/id1359485719">FlickType</a>. Shady clones boosted by fake ratings and reviews promised the same features as his legit app, but then locked their customers into exorbitant subscriptions, earning the scammers hundreds of thousands per month.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple urged to root out rating scams as developer highlights ugly cost of enforcement failure&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/apple-urged-to-root-out-rating-scams-as-developer-highlights-ugly-cost-of-enforcement-failure/embed/#?secret=dDCXyvSWAP" data-secret="dDCXyvSWAP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In his eyes, the problem wasn&#8217;t just that clones existed, but that Apple&#8217;s lack of attention to fake reviews made those apps appear to be the better choice.</p>

<p>“The apps you love, from a place you can trust” they tell you. But the reality is far from it.</p>
<p>A 4.5-star app? Might as well be a multi-million dollar scam.</p>
<p>How, you ask?</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Although Apple finally removed most of his fraudulent competitors after his rants gained press attention, he&#8217;s frustrated that the system was so broken in the first place.</p>
<p>This week, Kosta returned with <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1360146130936320001">another Twitter thread</a> detailing the multimillion-dollar scams that pretend to be the best Roku remote control app. One app, &#8220;Roku Remote Control &#8211; Roki,&#8221; for example, had a 4.5 stars across 15K+ ratings. The app was a free download, but immediately tries to lock users into a $4.99/week subscription or a lifetime payment of $19.99. However, the app offers a &#8220;buggy, ad-infested, poorly designed&#8221; experience, Kosta says.</p>
<p>He then used AppFigures to see only those reviews of the Roki app that also had text. When displayed like this, it was revealed that &#8220;Roki&#8221; was really just a 1.7-star app, based on consumers who took the time to write a review.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s worse, Kosta has also argued, that even when Apple reacts by removing a bad actor&#8217;s app, it will sometimes allow the developer to continue to<a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1357446762949054464"> run other, even more profitable scams</a>.</p>
<p>Kosta says he decided to spearhead a campaign about App Store scams to &#8220;get the word out about how all these scams manage to sustain themselves through a singular common flaw in the App Store &#8212; one that has been broken for years.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also notes that <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1359901745187463174?s=20">although Apple responded to him</a>, he believes the company is hoping for the story to blow over.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear Director at Apple who emailed me:</p>
<p>I already know that many of the apps I’ve reported have been removed.</p>
<p>Please acknowledge there’s a fake ratings problem plaguing the App Store, so we can begin an honest conversation.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone more senior will *finally* say it?</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f928.png" alt="🤨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/wZ0ziQhtrW">https://t.co/wZ0ziQhtrW</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1359901745187463174?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;The way Apple tried to communicate with me also didn’t help ease my concern &#8212; they either don’t get it, or are actively trying to let the story fizzle out through some token gestures. But what they need to do first and foremost, is acknowledge the issue and protect their customers,&#8221; Kosta told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>One potential argument here is that because Apple financially benefits from successful subscription app scams, it&#8217;s not motivated to prioritize work that focuses on cleaning up the App Store or fake ratings and reviews. But Kosta believes Apple isn&#8217;t being intentionally malicious in an effort to grow the subscription business, it&#8217;s just that fake App Store reviews have become &#8220;a can that&#8217;s been perpetually kicked down the road.&#8221; Plus, since Apple touts the App Store as a place users can trust, it&#8217;s hard for them to admit fault on this front, he says.</p>
<p>Since the crusade began, Kosta has heard from others developers <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1359037219021836290?s=20">who have sent</a> him examples &#8220;dozens and dozens of scams.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will just keep exposing them until Apple acknowledges the problem,&#8221; he says.</p>
<h3>Top subscription apps grew 34% to $13B in 2020</h3>
<p id="speakable-summary">Apps saw record downloads and consumer spending in 2020, globally reaching somewhere around <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/app-revenue-and-downloads-2020">$111 billion</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/app-stores-to-see-130-billion-downloads-in-2020-and-record-consumer-spend-of-112-billion/">$112 billion</a>, according to various estimates. But a growing part of that spend was subscription payments, a <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/subscription-apps-revenue-2020">report</a> from Sensor Tower indicates. Last year, global subscription app revenue from the top 100 subscription apps (excluding games),<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/top-100-subscription-apps-grew-34-to-13b-in-2020-share-of-total-spend-remained-the-same/"> climbed 34% year-over-year to $13 billion</a>, up from $9.7 billion in 2019.</p>
<p>The App Store, not surprisingly, accounted for a sizable chunk of this subscription revenue, given it has historically outpaced the Play Store on consumer spending. In 2020, the top 100 subscription apps worldwide generated $10.3 billion on the App Store, up 32% over 2019, compared with $2.7 billion on Google Play, which grew 42% from $1.9 billion in 2019. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/top-100-subscription-apps-grew-34-to-13b-in-2020-share-of-total-spend-remained-the-same/">Read more here</a>.)</p>

<h3>Google-Apple Privacy Label war drags on</h3>
<p>Google said it would update its iOS apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/google-to-add-app-store-privacy-labels-to-its-ios-apps-as-soon-as-this-week/">with privacy labels weeks ago</a>. While it did roll out some, it has yet to update top apps with Apple&#8217;s new labels, including key apps like the Google search app, Google Pay, Google Assistant, Google One, Google Meet, Google Photos, Google Calendar, Google Maps, Google News, Google Drive, Gmail and others.

<p>Overall, the majority of Google&#8217;s apps don&#8217;t have labels. While Google probably needed some time (and a lot of lawyers) to look this over, it&#8217;s now super late to put its labels out there. At this point, its iOS apps are out of date &#8212; which Google <a href="https://spencerdailey.com/2021/02/10/google-itself-is-now-telling-users-their-apps-are-out-of-date-despite-no-updates-being-available/">accidentally alerted</a> users to earlier this week. This is awful optics for a company users already don&#8217;t trust, and a win for Apple as a result. (Which, of course, means we need to know for sure that Apple isn&#8217;t delaying Google&#8217;s submissions here&#8230;)</p>
<p>Still, Google had time to get this done. Its December code freeze is long over, and everyone else, for the most part, has gotten on board with the new labels. Why can&#8217;t Google?</p>

<p><strong>Apple may soon allow users to set a different default music service</strong>. The company already opened up the ability to choose a different default browser and email app, but now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/08/ios-14-5-beta-siri-default-music-service/">a new feature in the iOS 14.5 beta</a> indicates it may allow users to set another service, like Spotify, as the default option when asking Siri to play tunes. This, however, could be an integration with HomePod and Siri voice control support in mind, rather than something as universal as switching from Mail app to Gmail.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Maps to gain Waze-like features for reporting accidents, hazards and speed traps.</strong> Another new feature in the iOS 14.5 beta <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/apple-maps-to-gain-waze-like-features-for-reporting-accidents-hazards-and-speed-traps/">will allow drivers to report road issues and incidents</a> by using Siri on their iPhone or through Apple’s CarPlay. For example, during navigation, they’ll be able to tell Siri things like “there’s a crash up head,” “there’s something on the road,” or “there’s a speed trap here.”</p>

<p><strong>Apple tests a new advertising slot on the App Store.</strong> Users of Apple&#8217;s new iOS 14.5 beta have reported <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/08/app-store-new-ad-slot/">seeing a new sponsored ad slot</a> that appears on the Search tab of the App Store, under the &#8220;Suggested&#8221; heading (the screen that shows before you do a search). The ad slot is also labeled &#8220;Ad&#8221; and is a slightly color to differentiate it from the search results. It&#8217;s unclear at this time if Apple is planning to launch the ad slot or is just testing it.</p>

The Trump administration claimed TikTok was a national security threat, and ordered TikTok owner ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations if it wanted to continue to operate in the country. Several large tech companies stepped up to the plate to take on the potential windfall. But Biden&#8217;s review of the agency action <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/tiktoks-forced-sale-to-oracle-is-put-on-hold/">puts Trump&#8217;s plan on an indefinite pause</a>.

Discussions between U.S. national security officials and ByteDance are continuing, however.</p>

<p><strong>Apple will begin to proxy Google&#8217;s &#8220;Safe Browsing&#8221; service used by Safari through its own servers starting with iOS 14.5.</strong> Safari on iPhone and iPad includes a &#8220;Fraudulent Website Warning&#8221; feature that warns users if they&#8217;re visiting a possible phishing site.

Before, Google may have collected user&#8217;s IP address during its interaction with Safari, when the browser would check the website URL against Google&#8217;s list.

<p id="speakable-summary">A new startup called <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/">Insight</a> is bringing web browser extensions to the iPhone, with the goal of delivering a better web browsing experience by blocking ads and trackers, flagging fake reviews on Amazon, offering SEO-free search experiences or even calling out media bias and misinformation, among other things. These features are made available by way of the browser&#8217;s &#8220;extensions,&#8221; which work by way of a “sub-tab” workflow where you navigate using swiping gestures. For example, when online shopping, you could view the product you’re interested in, then swipe over to see the available coupons, the trusted product reviews or to comparison shop across other sites.</p>
<p>The app is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1531407280?mt=8">a free download on iOS</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">About a decade ago, I remember having a conversation with a friend about big data. At the time, we both agreed that it was the purview of large companies like Facebook, Yahoo and Google, and not something most companies would have to worry about.</p>
<p>As it turned out, we were both wrong. Within a short time, everyone would be dealing with big data. In fact, it turns out that huge amounts of data are the fuel of machine learning applications, something my friend and I didn&#8217;t foresee.</p>
<p>Frameworks were already emerging like Hadoop and Spark and concepts like the data warehouses were evolving. This was fine when it involved structured data like credit card info, but data warehouses weren&#8217;t designed for unstructured data you needed to build machine learning algorithms, and the concept of the data lake developed as a way to take unprocessed data and store until needed. It wasn&#8217;t sitting neatly in shelves in warehouses all labeled and organized, it was more amorphous and raw.</p>
<p>Over time, this idea caught the attention of the cloud vendors like Amazon, Microsoft and Google. What&#8217;s more, it caught the attention of investors as companies like Snowflake and Databricks built substantial companies on the data lake concept.</p>
<p>Even as that was happening startup founders began to identify other adjacent problems to attack like moving data into the data lake, cleaning it, processing it and funneling to applications and algorithms that could actually make use of that data. As this was happening, data science advanced outside of academia and became more mainstream inside businesses.</p>
<p>At that point there was a whole new modern ecosystem and when something like that happens, ideas develop, companies are built and investors come. We spoke to nine investors about the data lake idea and why they are so intrigued by it, the role of the cloud companies in this space, how an investor finds new companies in a maturing market and where the opportunities and challenges are in this lucrative area.</p>
<p>To learn about all of this, we queried the following investors:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/caryn-marooney/">Caryn Marooney</a>, general partner, Coatue Management</li>
<li>Dharmesh Thakker, general partner, <a href="https://www.battery.com/our-team/member/dharmesh-thakker/">Battery Ventures</a></li>
<li>Casey Aylward, principal, <a href="https://www.costanoavc.com/team-member/casey-aylward/">Costanoa Ventures</a></li>
<li>Derek Zanutto, general partner, <a href="https://capitalg.com/team/derek-zanutto/">CapitalG</a></li>
<li>Navin Chaddha, managing director, <a href="https://www.mayfield.com/team/navin-chaddha/">Mayfield</a></li>
<li>Jon Lehr, co-founder and general partner, <a href="https://www.work-bench.com/team">Work-Bench</a></li>
<li>Peter Wagner, founding partner, <a href="https://www.wing.vc/people/peter-wagner">Wing Ventures</a></li>
<li>Nicole Priel, managing director, <a href="https://www.ibexinvestors.com/#leadership">Ibex Ventures</a></li>
<li>Ilya Sukah, partner, <a href="https://matrixpartners.com/team/ilya-sukhar/">Matrix Partners</a></li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Where are the opportunities for startups in the data lakes space with players like Snowflake and the cloud infrastructure vendors so firmly established?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Caryn Marooney:</strong> The data market is very large, driven by the opportunity to unlock value through digital transformation. Both the data lake and data warehouse architectures will be important over the long term because they solve different needs.</p>
<p>For established companies (think big banks, large brands) with significant existing data infrastructure, moving all their data to a data warehouse can be expensive and time consuming. For these companies, the data lake can be a good solution because it enables optionality and federated queries across data sources.</p>
<p><strong>Dharmesh Thakker: </strong>Databricks (which Battery has invested in) and Snowflake have certainly become household names in the data lake and warehouse markets, respectively. But technical requirements and business needs are constantly shifting in these markets &#8212; and it’s important for both companies to continue to invest aggressively to maintain a competitive edge. They will have to keep innovating to continue to succeed.</p>
<p>Regardless of how this plays out, we feel excited about the ecosystem that’s emerging around these players (and others) given the massive data sprawl that’s occurring across cloud and on-premise workloads, and around a variety of data-storage vendors. We think there is a significant opportunity for vendors to continue to emerge as “unification layers” between data sources and different types of end users (including data scientists, data engineers, business analysts and others) in the form of integration middleware (cloud ELT vendors); real-time streaming and analytics; data governance and management; data security; and data monitoring. These markets shouldn’t be underestimated.</p>
<p><strong>Casey Aylward: </strong>There are a handful of big opportunities in the data lake space even with many established cloud infrastructure players in the space:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business intelligence/analytics/SQL may end up converging with machine learning/code like Scala or Python in certain products, but these domains have different end users and communities, programming language preferences and technical skills. Generally, architectural lock-ins are a big point of fear within core infrastructure. This is true for end users with their cloud providers, storage solutions, compute engines, etc. Solutions will be heterogeneous because of that and technology that enables this flexibility will be important.</li>
<li>As data moves around today, it is being reprocessed in each platform, which at scale is inefficient and expensive. There is an opportunity to build technology that allows users to move data around without rewriting transformations, data pipelines and stored procedures.</li>
<li>Finally, we&#8217;re seeing more traction around general data processing frameworks that are not MapReduce under the hood, especially in the Python data science ecosystem. This is a transition from Hadoop or even Spark, since they aren’t always best suited for unstructured, more modern algorithms.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[However, finding funding for startups is still a “difficult task today” said one, as the ecosystem suffers from a lack of "scale capital" for later rounds.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We surveyed five investors from the Brussels, Belgium ecosystem, and overall the mood was upbeat.</p>
<p>Investors are backing companies in smart living, life sciences (“a really promising sector for Belgium”), B2B, &#8220;industry 4.0,&#8221; fintech, mobility, health and music tech. Food tech appears “an overcrowded space.” Another says: “COVID confirmed our strategy to invest in local companies and with a sector focus on smart living life science and tech.”</p>
<p>Belgium has a “dynamic ecosystem of health actors, from biotech firms, universities and startups and scaleups. We follow the #BeHealth initiative, which unites the various parts of the Belgian health sector.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Belgium is “not a market for B2C startups” as it has a “small but complex market with different regions/cultures/languages.” They are focusing on Belgium and neighboring countries for investing.</p>
<p>However, finding funding for startups is still a “difficult task today” said one, as it suffers from a lack of &#8220;scale capital&#8221; for later rounds.</p>
<p>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in the city? “As a well-educated environment, multicultural, multilingual,” says one. “The ecosystem is very dynamic, with great opportunities. While valuations are usually lower compared to other hubs in Europe, there is quite some money available on the market,” says another.</p>
<p>Brussels’ geography makes it “very well-connected to Europe and international by nature.” It is multicultural and multilingual, so as a result startups position themselves for international expansion, “whether first to France or the Netherlands or beyond. For investors that are scoping opportunities in Belgium, they should recognize that Belgian startups are well-suited for international growth.”</p>
<p>As a small and very dense country, Belgium “already has a distributed founder geography.”</p>
<p>Investors have also been advising companies “to make sure that they have enough cash to last until the end of next 2021 at least.”</p>

Smart living, life sciences and tech.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Univercells — Series C.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
More startups needed in the smart living sector. In general, companies with international ambitions maintaining local sticky jobs.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Daring entrepreneurs within growing markets.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
We are wary of blockchain and crypto currencies.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
More than 50%.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Life sciences, including biotech, is a really promising sector for Belgium. On the contrary, Belgium is not a market for B2C startups (small but complex market with different regions/cultures/languages).</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
They feel Brussels is one of the main tech hubs in Belgium. Though the private equity and risk-on mentality is still not here. Finding funding for startups is still a difficult task today.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t think it will have a substantial impact, as many startups were already favoring remote work and flexible working hours.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19?</strong><br />
Definitely travel and hospitality (part of smart living). It suffered a lot. But it&#8217;s a good time to invest. It&#8217;s an opportunity for startups to rethink their model and challenge the way they were seeing things before.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
COVID-19 confirmed our strategy was right … to focus on local competitiveness in the backbones of our economy: smart living, life sciences and tech. But within each sector, each company may be impacted differently. So a case-by-case analysis and in-depth due diligence is a necessity more than ever. Our advice to startups is to consider this environment will stay for another year and to plan the cash flows very carefully.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
The last lockdown giving much more freedom to companies to continue to operate and witness that many of them adapted their way of working to stay operational.</p>
<h2>Frederic Convent, partner, TheClubDeal</h2>

<a href="http://www.univercells.com">Univercells</a> Series C.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
More companies active in smart living, life sciences and tech.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Blockchain and crypto.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
50%.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Fintech is doing well in Brussels. We like an Antwerp mortgage B2B fintech: <a href="https://www.opercredits.com/">Oper</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
As a well-educated multicultural, multilingual environment.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Most startups are already used to working remotely so the impact for the hubs is less, as they and their clients proved able to work elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19?</strong><br />
Travel and hospitality will suffer a lot in this COVID crisis. Life sciences are well-positioned to address the crisis.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
COVID confirmed our strategy to invest in local companies and with a sector focus on smart living, life sciences and tech.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
In medtech, essential medical intervention some green shoots benefit from the crisis.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
The last lockdown pushed companies to adapt their business model and to focus on the new situation.</p>
<h2>Alexandre Dutoit, partner, ScaleFund</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
We aim at bridging the equity gap between seed rounds and Series A.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Kaspard, a silver economy company having developed a fall-detection technology.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
We like B2B. Industry 4.0 type of deals lack a bit in our opinion.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Above all, we need a great team. Then we want to see some commercial traction, being POCs, first contracts.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Food tech appears to us as an overcrowded space. A lot of B2C entrepreneurs are doing &#8220;more of the same.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We focus on Belgium and neighboring countries.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Biotech is definitely a hit in Belgium. Fintech and music tech are also growing.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
The ecosystem is very dynamic, with great opportunities. While valuations are usually lower compared to other hubs in Europe, there is quite some money available on the market.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t see that coming, especially as entrepreneurs like to network, share experiences and be in an emulative environment.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong></p>
<p>Very few, as great teams are able to adapt. We have in our portfolio a company closely tied to events that has been able to rethink its business model and is now even more profitable compared to before the crises. Besides, companies that foster remote work or can install service at a distance will be short-term winners.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
COVID has not impacted our strategy. Entrepreneurs are afraid of the uncertainty and lack of perspective. We encourage them to prepare themselves for the next opened window and to work on tech and processes, while reassuring them on the financing side.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Utopix, a startup linked to the event industry, has been able to rethink its business model as their sales were falling down. They have down their best month ever since then.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
I have seen hope after the summer period when companies were angry to do business again. Unfortunately, that hasn&#8217;t lasted very long. We try to remain positive and focus on important things.</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong><br />
Brussels is a growing scene for startups, very well-connected to Europe and international by nature.</p>
<h2>Olivier de Duve, partner, Inventures Investment Partners</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
At Inventures, we invest in a range of startups that have strong financial returns and a measurable social and environmental impact. Looking to 2021, we’re most excited about the mobility sector, HR tech, the blue economy (investing in technologies around water and ocean health) and the circular economy. These sectors started to grow rapidly in Europe, and we’re excited to source some great deals in the coming year.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
We just led a round in MySkillCamp, a Belgian HR tech company that equips SMEs and corporates with an adaptable platform for employee learning. MySkillCamp has been stunning us with their rapid growth, even during the pandemic, and it’s a testament to the fact that companies need solutions for upskilling and reskilling their workforce.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
I’ll flip this question to be investor-centric. We’d really like to see more impact venture capital firms that are active in the Series B and beyond stage in Europe. For now, the largest impact VCs are concentrated in the US — having that source of capital here in Brussels or in neighboring ecosystems will help earlier-stage European VCs continue to scale and support their portfolio companies in later rounds. Having that access to capital is key for making a sustainable ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Our investment thesis is to find startups that are financially strong and tackle one of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Broadly that has meant companies in health, mobility, renewable energy, climate and more. As we’re rounding out our second fund, our next investment has to hit our sweet spot of clear commercial traction, a stellar team and solid plans for scaling internationally.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Several markets are oversaturated like shared light vehicle scooters or telemedicine solutions. D2C medical devices is also a tough market to break into. Given the pandemic situation, startups active in the recreational sector like tourism and sport are struggling more than ever. All products or services that are not digital are less resilient and will need to shift as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
About half of our startups are coming from Belgium. We’ve historically invested in the U.K., France, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, however we’re open to investing across the EU.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Two sectors that come to mind are mobility and health. Belgium is a hyperconnected country, and mobility startups that address user needs for a more sustainable and efficient transportation will do well here. As for health, Belgium has a dynamic ecosystem of health actors, from biotech firms, universities, and startups and scaleups. We follow the #BeHealth initiative, which unites the various parts of the Belgian health sector. One company that we wanted to highlight is Citizen Lab — they are a digital democracy platform that helps local governments organize voting, participatory budgeting and more. They’re setting the conversation around civic tech and we’re so excited to see what the founders Wietse Van Ransbeeck and Aline Muylaert have in store for 2021.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Belgium is a multicultural, multilingual country — so startups that are grown here naturally are positioning themselves for international expansion, whether first to France or the Netherlands or beyond. For investors that are scoping opportunities in Belgium, they should recognize that Belgian startups are well-suited for international growth and a role that they could play as investors is helping to introduce Belgian startups to other markets.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
As a small and very dense country, Belgium already has a distributed founder geography. In Brussels we have Co.Station, which is home to dozens of startups. However, we also see strong growth in innovation coming from Leuven, Ghent, Antwerp, Liege — and these cities are maximum two hours away by train. Our latest investment, MySkillCamp, for example, is based in Tournai, with an office in Brussels.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
We found out in our portfolio that companies are quite resilient to the crisis because they are addressing societal issues like health, climate and energy. SaaS companies or other digital services are also less exposed, which points out that digitalization is key to survive. Companies that are highly dependent on large governmental contracts could be more exposed to shifts in spending patterns due to COVID.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
COVID-19 has not impacted our investment strategy so much as our post-investment strategy. Since the pandemic started, we’ve been “all hands on deck” with helping our portfolio companies weather the storm — from organizing new fundraising to scoping out new markets and helping on strategic growth projects. We’ve been advising our companies to make sure that they have enough cash to last until the end of next 2021 at least. What we’re seeing is that contracts are taking longer to be signed, especially for our companies looking to partner with governments that are more cash strapped and limited because of the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Definitely! On the ecosystem level, we’ve seen a lot of fundraising activity in the last six months, particularly in the health and biotech sector — one example of that is Belgium-based Univercells. For our portfolio, we’ve seen that tools that serve governments and the transition to a more digital economy has created enormous opportunities for our B2B and B2G companies to thrive during this time.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
A few moments have given us hope during 2020. Seeing the racial reckoning in the U.S. spark conversations in Europe about justice and D&amp;I has given me a lot of hope around the role of the venture capital and startup sector in creating a more equal society. Initiatives like Diversity VC are helping us to do that. Also, the sheer number of startups with climate benefits, from cultured meat to sustainable packaging and more, has showcased the financial viability and the demand for expanding the world’s options for sustainability — another large societal challenge.</p>

Belgium is home to a vibrant, active and fast-growing startup scene!</p>

<p>Before the pandemic began, I took about seven or eight hailed rides each month. Since I began physically distancing from others to stem the spread of the coronavirus in March 2020, I&#8217;ve taken exactly <strong>10 hailed rides</strong>.</p>
<p>Your mileage may vary, but last year, Uber and Lyft both reported steep revenue losses as travelers hunkered down at home. Today, Alex Wilhelm says both transportation platforms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/will-ride-hailing-profits-ever-come/">plan to reach adjusted profitability by Q4 2021</a>.</p>
<p>He unpacked the numbers &#8220;to see if what the two companies are dangling in front of investors is worth desiring.&#8221; Since he usually doesn&#8217;t focus on publicly traded stocks, I asked Alex why he focused on Uber and Lyft today.</p>
<p>&#8220;Utter confusion,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Investors have bid up their stocks like the two companies are crushing the game, instead of playing a game with their numbers to reach some sort of profit in the future,&#8221; Alex explained. &#8220;The stock market makes no sense, but this is one of the weirder things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Neoinsurance company Metromile began trading publicly this week after it combined with a special purpose acquisition company.</p>
<p>Metromile will likely be one of 2021&#8217;s many SPAC-led debuts, so <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/as-more-insurtech-offerings-loom-ceo-dan-preston-discusses-metromiles-spac-led-debut/">Alex interviewed CEO Dan Preston</a> to learn more about the process and what he learned along the way.</p>
<p>A notable takeaway: &#8220;Preston said SPACs are designed for a specific class of company; namely those that want or need to share a bit more story when they go public.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have a hard time envisioning all of the hurdles deep tech founders must overcome before they can land their first paying customer.</p>
<p>How do you sustainably scale a company that probably doesn&#8217;t have revenue and isn&#8217;t likely to for the foreseeable future? How big is the TAM for an unproven product in a marketplace that&#8217;s still taking shape?</p>
<p>Vin Lingathoti, a partner at Cambridge Innovation Capital, says entrepreneurs operating in this space face <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/commercializing-deep-tech-startups-a-practical-guide-for-founders-and-investors/">a unique set of challenges</a> when it comes to managing growth and risk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Often these founders with Ph.D.s and postdocs find it hard to accept their weaknesses, especially in nontechnical areas such as marketing, sales, HR, etc.,&#8221; says Lingathoti.</p>

<p>This week, auto insurance startup Metromile completed its combination with SPAC INSU Acquisition Corp. II.</p>
<p>Last Friday, health insurance company Oscar Health announced its plans to launch an initial public offering.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: Past performance is no guarantee of future results, but using 2020 debuts by neoinsurance firms Lemonade and Root as a reference point, Alex says <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/how-will-investors-value-metromile-and-oscar-health/">the IPO window is wide open for other players</a> in the space.</p>

<p>Simple agreements for future equity are an increasingly popular way for startups to raise funds quickly, but &#8220;they don’t generate the same paperwork exhaust,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/are-safes-obscuring-todays-seed-volume/">Alex Wilhelm noted this week</a>.</p>
<p>This creates cognitive dissonance: Investors see a hot market, while people who rely on public data (like journalists) get a different picture.</p>
<p>&#8220;SAFEs have effectively pushed a lot of public signal regarding seed deals, and even smaller rounds, underground,&#8221; says Alex.</p>

<p>Many enterprise companies were snapping up container security startups before the pandemic began, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/container-security-acquisitions-increase-as-companies-accelerate-shift-to-cloud/">but the pace has picked up</a>, reports Ron Miller.</p>
<p>The growing number of companies going cloud-native is creating security challenges; the containers that package microservices must be correctly configured and secured, which can get complicated quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The acquisitions we are seeing now are filling gaps in the portfolio of security capabilities offered by the larger companies,&#8221; says Yoav Leitersdorf, managing partner at YL Ventures.</p>

<p>In December 2019, Alex Wilhelm began reporting on startups that had reached the $100M ARR mark. A year later, he decided to reframe his focus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mostly what we managed was to collect a bucket of companies that were about to go public,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Since then, he has recalibrated his sights. In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/two-50m-ish-arr-companies-talk-growth-and-plans-for-the-coming-quarters/">the latest entry of a new series focusing on &#8220;$50M-ish&#8221; companies</a>, he studies SimpleNexus, which offers digital mortgage software, and photo-editing service PicsArt.</p>
<p>Alex has more interviews and data dives coming on other companies in this cohort, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>Dating platform Bumble initially set a price of $28 to $30 for its upcoming IPO, but at its new range of $37 to $39, Alex calculated that it could reach a max valuation of $7.4 billion to $7.8 billion.</p>

<p>Softbank&#8217;s recent earnings report shows that its $680 million bet on DoorDash paid off handsomely, bringing back $9 billion. Compared to its competition, &#8220;the fund is actually doing quite decent right now,&#8221; he wrote. But Softbank has invested $66 billion in 74 unexited 74 companies that are worth $65.2 billion today.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;SoftBank quietly chopped half of the performance fees for its VC managers, from $5B to $2.5B, which led us to ask: are the best investments in the fund already in SoftBank’s rearview mirror?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tony Florence isn&#8217;t as well known to the public as other top investors like Bill Gurley or Marc Andreessen, but he&#8217;s someone who founders with SaaS and especially marketplace e-commerce companies know &#8212; or should. He&#8217;s responsible for the global tech investing activities for NEA, one of the world&#8217;s biggest venture firms in terms of assets under management (it closed its newest fund with $3.6 billion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/nea-venture-capitals-quiet-giant-closes-on-3-6-billion/">last year</a>).</p>
<p>Florence has also been involved with a long list of e-commerce brands to break through, including Jet, Gilt, Goop, Casper, Letgo, and Moda Operandi.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s because we talked <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/maisonette-is-becoming-a-go-to-brand-for-fashion-conscious-families-heres-the-strategy/">earlier this week</a> with one of his newer e-commerce bets, <a href="https://www.maisonette.com/">Maisonette</a>, that we wanted to ask him about brand building more than a year into a pandemic that has changed the world in both fleeting and permanent ways. We wound up talking about how customer acquisition has changed; what he thinks of the growing number of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/thrasio-raises-750m-more-in-equity-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/">companies</a> trying to roll up third-party sellers on Amazon; and how upstarts can maintain momentum when even younger companies become a shiny new fascination for customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Note: one topic that he couldn&#8217;t and wouldn&#8217;t comment on is the future of one founder who Florence has backed twice, Marc Lore, who stepped down from Walmart last month to begin building what he <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/1/15/22232033/marc-lore-walmart-leaving-jet-city-future-capitalism">recently told Vox</a> is a multi-decade project to build “a city of the future.” (More on this to come, evidently.)</p>
<p>Part of our chat with Florence, lightly edited for length and clarity, follows:</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;ve funded a number of very different businesses that have managed to grow even as Amazon has eaten up more of the retail market. Is there any sector or vertical you wouldn&#8217;t back because of the company?</strong></p>
<p>TF: You have to be thoughtful about Amazon. I wouldn&#8217;t say there&#8217;s one particular area that you either can ignore or feel like you&#8217;re completely comfortable and open to, given the scale of their platform. At the same time, there are founding principles and fundamentals that we think about as they relate to companies being able to compete and operate successfully.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And these are what? You&#8217;ve backed Marc Lore, Philip Krim (of Casper), Sylvana and Luisana of Maisonette. Do they have something in common?</strong></p>
<p>TF:  Sometimes [founders] come at the problem organically; they&#8217;re living it [and want to solve it]. Other times, somebody like Marc sees a business opportunity and just attacks it. But there are commonalities. These are folks who are very customer centric, who are focused on good, fundamental unit economics, and who are obsessive about their people, their teams. It takes a village to build a young successful company, and all of those founders you mentioned are great at recruiting world-class people. There&#8217;s a sense of vision and mission and culture.</p>
<p>When you wake up and decide to do something, the majority of people you talk to just want to tell you the reasons why it can&#8217;t work, so it also takes a certain [wherewithal] to have such conviction around what you&#8217;re doing that you&#8217;re kind of all in on it, and you&#8217;re going to break through no matter what.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Maisonette was going to open a brick-and-mortar store but put a pin in that plan because of COVID. Will we go back to seeing direct-to-consumer brands opening real-world locations when this is over? Has the pandemic permanently changed that calculation?</strong></p>
<p>TF: Leading up to the pandemic, a lot of the young DTC companies that were direct-to-consumer brands, and even the traditional e-commerce marketplaces, were experimenting with offline. Some of it was out of necessity, frankly. Sometimes [customer acquisition costs] became so expensive that it was actually cheaper for them to go offline. In other cases, it was done because the customer wanted that closed loop experience, as with [mattress maker] Casper.</p>
<p>A lot of companies [opened these stores] in a contained way and it worked really well. It&#8217;s very accretive financially to the overall business contribution, margin wise. It was accretive for the overall customer experience. And in many cases, it didn&#8217;t cannibalize anything. It just expanded the [total addressable market].</p>
<p>We&#8217;re spending a lot of time right now continuing to think through what are the permanent changes that are going to come out of the pandemic, but I would say the omnichannel model has really has started to take shape and succeed if you look at big retailers like Walmart and Target, so I think there will be an omnichannel dynamic to many of these companies that we&#8217;re talking about. Also, over the last 12 months, the cost of acquisition and the efficacy of marketing has swung back in the favor of these young companies. It&#8217;s improved to a point where we don&#8217;t really even need to think about offline.</p>
<p><strong>TC: I know it had become expensive to acquire customers digitally because it was so crowded out there. Did it become less crowded?</strong></p>
<p>TF: There were very few platforms that these companies could use pre pandemic that weren&#8217;t oversaturated . . . it was just very competitive, and that would bid up the cost of acquisition. In the last 12 months, you&#8217;ve seen big parts of that market go away. With airlines and financial services and a lot of the spend going way down, it&#8217;s become a lot cheaper for companies to market digitally.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Still, it feels at times that it&#8217;s hard to maintain a brand&#8217;s momentum over time; there&#8217;s always some new outfit nipping at its heels. How does a brand keep itself fresh and relevant in 2021?</strong></p>
<p>TF: There&#8217;s a hits dynamic &#8212; a fad dynamic &#8212; in the consumer space, so that&#8217;s always a challenge. You [compete by] continually reinventing and adding [to your offerings]. You see that in social categories, you see that in marketplaces [where they add] managed services and other components [like] payments, and you clearly see it in the way some of the direct-to-consumer companies continue to add new products to the mix.</p>
<p>You focus on the core aspects of your brand and its mission and vision and make sure that the customers really feel that. There&#8217;s a community dynamic that has really occurred the last four or five years around e-commerce companies. Glossier is a great example of a company that built a great community around a core set of product offerings, and that has really propelled that company beyond its core customer customer base.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a contextual commerce opportunity. Goop is a great example this; Gwyneth [Paltrow] brilliantly came up with [an effective way] to merge content and commerce, and that&#8217;s something a lot of companies in the commerce space have started to invest in.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Content, community and not necessarily speed, so focusing on what Amazon does not. Can I ask: do you think Amazon needs to be reigned in?</strong></p>
<p>TF: If you&#8217;re competing with them [in the] cloud market or a commerce market, they&#8217;re a very formidable competitor, and you got to take them very, very seriously. They&#8217;re at a scale that&#8217;s just incredibly impressive. But I do think you&#8217;re seeing a lot of innovation around the edges and companies finding areas that Amazon maybe can&#8217;t focus on or isn&#8217;t focusing on.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What do you think of these Amazon Marketplace roll-ups that we&#8217;re seeing? There&#8217;s been at least a half of dozen of them already, including Thrasio, which announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/thrasio-raises-750m-more-in-equity-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/">$750 million</a> this week. All are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/heroes/">raising money</a> hand over first.</strong></p>
<p>TF: We haven&#8217;t made an investment in the area, though we&#8217;re watching very closely. It can be a very capital intensive strategy to execute on because you&#8217;re buying brands and then bringing them onto the platform to consolidate and grow, but there&#8217;s just an enormous long tail to the e-commerce space and this is an opportunity to consolidate that.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Like, an infinite opportunity? How many roll-ups can the market support?</strong></p>
<p>TFL I do think that we&#8217;ll see a handful of these companies get to decent scale. The question will be whether you&#8217;ve got more of an arbitrage going on [by] buying companies and generating synergies or there&#8217;s some fundamental bigger breakthrough. If you could use AI [and] machine learning to understand how to better serve customers and think about customer acquisition a little bit better, that would be really interesting. If there are real economies of scale to the supply chains [or] baseline infrastructure, that would certainly be interesting.</p>

<p>Oh, and before we get started: Consider applying to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/announcing-the-tc-early-stage-pitch-off/">the Early Stage pitch off</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/get-feedback-on-your-pitch-deck-from-tech-leaders-on-extra-crunch-live/">submitting a pitch deck for feedback</a> on Extra Crunch Live!</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Jack Dorsey and Jay Z invest in bitcoin development</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
