According to Crunchbase data, the app has raised $20.2 million from investors [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/reddit" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="reddit">Reddit <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://redditblog.com/2020/12/13/reddit-welcomes-video-platform-dubsmash-to-team/">announced</a> that it has acquired short video platform <a href="https://dubsmash.com/">Dubsmash</a>. The deal’s terms were undisclosed. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dubsmash" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="dubsmash">Dubsmash <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> will retain its own platform and brand, and Reddit will integrate its video creation tools. Its co-founders, Suchit Dash, Jonas Drüppel and Tim Specht, will join Reddit.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dubsmash/company_financials">Crunchbase data</a>, the app has raised $20.2 million from investors including Lowercase Capital, Index Ventures, Eniac Ventures, Heartcore Capital and Sunstone Life.</p>
<p>Dubsmash is now one of TikTok’s biggest rivals, but struggled for several years after a brief stint of popularity in 2015 during its first incarnation as a lip-sync video app. In 2017 it began transforming itself into a social platform and moved its headquarters from Berlin to Brooklyn. By the beginning of this year, Dubsmash’s share of the United States’ short-form video market was second only to TikTok when counted by app installs, and it <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-snap-held-talks-to-buy-tiktok-rival-dubsmash">reportedly held acquisition talks with Facebook and Snap</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Credit for much of Dubsmash’s success goes to Black and Latinx users. While many of TikTok’s highest-profile stars are white, Dubsmash is known for its large communities of Black and Latinx content creators. The polarization between the two apps began to gain more attention earlier this year, when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/style/the-original-renegade.html">the New York Times published a piece</a> about how dance moves by Black Dubsmash stars are frequently appropriated without credit by TikTok influencers, which means their creators miss out on opportunities like larger followings, brand deals and industry connections.</p>
<p>Reddit <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/06/reddit-racism-open-letter/612958/">has its own issues with racism</a>, and has been criticized for not doing enough to stop hate speech or giving moderators of subreddits targeted by racist trolls enough support.</p>
<p>Last year, founder and former chief executive officer Alexis Ohanian called for his position on Reddit’s board to be filled with a Black candidate when he stepped down, which current CEO Steve Huffman said the company would honor as part of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/">a larger effort to address hate speech on the platform</a> announced during anti-racism demonstrations after the killing of George Floyd by a police officer. Ohanian’s position was filled by Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel.</p>

<p>In its announcement today, Reddit linked its acquisition of Dubsmash to its inclusion efforts, acknowledging that the app’s &#8220;communities are driven by young, diverse creators—about 25 percent of all Black teens in the U.S. are on Dubsmash, and females represent 70 percent of users.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also said the integration of Dubsmash’s video creation tools will enable Reddit’s users to &#8220;express themselves in original and authentic ways that are endemic to our communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since launching native videos in 2017, Reddit said usage has increased sharply, growing 2X in 2020 alone. Much of Reddit’s content is still text-based, however, with video, gifs and images often shared from other sources, so Dubsmash’s integration can help Reddit build out its own video platform.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In the year ahead, we'll likely see lobbying efforts from both gig companies and gig worker organizations — as well as more lawsuits.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When California voters passed Proposition 22 with 58.6% of the vote, they agreed with Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates that gig workers should not be employees who are entitled to myriad labor rights. The proposition they passed stated that gig workers should be independent contractors who receive the limited benefits proposed by those companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first feeling I had was shock, disbelief and hurt,&#8221; Vanessa Bain, a worker-organizer with Gig Workers Collective, told TechCrunch. &#8220;It didn&#8217;t feel good to think that my fellow Californians voted to strip people like myself and my co-workers of our labor rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Prop 22 does not mark the end of the battle of the status of gig workers. Gig workers, lawyers and activists affiliated with Gig Workers Rising, Gig Workers Collective, the National Employment Law Project and the Working Partnerships for Families are all gearing up to redouble their efforts in the New Year. But the same goes for gig companies. Uber and Lyft are ready to take legislation similar to Prop 22 into other parts of the country and the world.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			In the year ahead, we will likely see lobbying efforts from both gig companies and gig worker organizations alike, as well as more lawsuits.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have time for more grieving because as soon as it passed, every company signaled they&#8217;re looking to expand this model to the national level, which means our organizing needs to adjust accordingly,&#8221; Bain said.</p>
<p>So, really, the fight has just begun. In the year ahead, we will likely see lobbying efforts from both gig companies and gig worker organizations alike, as well as more lawsuits.</p>
<hr />
<p>In 2019, the California state legislature passed Assembly Bill 5, which became law in January 2020.</p>
<p>AB 5 mandated that companies apply the ABC test to determine how to classify their workers. According to the ABC test, in order for a hiring entity to legally classify a worker as an independent contractor, it must prove the worker:</p>
<ul>
<li>A — is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity.</li>
<li>B — performs work outside the scope of the entity’s business, and</li>
<li>C — is regularly engaged in an “independently established trade, occupation or business of the same nature as the work performed.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Many have argued that gig economy companies do not pass the ABC test, while the companies themselves have, of course, argued that they do. As AB 5 made its way through the state legislature, gig companies banded together with their competitors to fight a collective enemy: labor rights for their respective workforces.</p>
<p>In August 2019, Uber and Lyft kicked off that fight with an initial $60 million put toward the ballot measure now known as Prop 22. Between August 2019 and November 2020, that number skyrocketed to around $205 million and brought in contributions from other companies like Postmates (now owned by Uber), Instacart and DoorDash. All that funding makes Proposition 22 the most expensive ballot measure in California since 1999.</p>

<p>On the other side, major donors in opposition of Prop 22 included Service Employees International Union, United Food &amp; Commercial Workers and International Brotherhood of Teamsters. They collectively contributed $15.9 million.</p>
<p>The ballot measure, which goes into effect this month, implements a few key benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>An earnings guarantee of at least 120% of minimum wage while picking up or dropping off passengers.</li>
<li>30 cents per engaged mile for expenses.</li>
<li>A healthcare stipend.</li>
<li>Occupational accident insurance for on-the-job injuries.</li>
<li>Automobile accident and liability insurance.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Ahead of the Prop 22 vote, Cherri Murphy, a ride-share driver for Uber and Lyft and lead organizer at Gig Workers Rising, was heavily involved in Gig Workers Rising&#8217;s efforts to combat the millions of dollars tech companies put into ensuring gig workers would be classified as independent contractors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a hell of a fight,&#8221; Murphy told TechCrunch. &#8220;We were up against a $205 million campaign but I still had to believe that we could win.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Mank&#8221; is a change of pace for director David Fincher — instead of exploring the world of startup backstabbing (&#8220;The Social Network&#8221;), political backstabbing (&#8220;House of Cards&#8221;) or actual stabbings (&#8220;Seven,&#8221; &#8220;Zodiac,&#8221; &#8220;Gone Girl,&#8221; &#8220;Mindhunter&#8221; etc.), Fincher takes us back to &#8217;30s and &#8217;40s Hollywood.</p>
<p>Working from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/david-fincher-mank-netflix/">a script by Fincher&#8217;s late father Jack</a>, the movie is shot and edited to pay homage to the classic studio films of that era — especially &#8220;Citizen Kane,&#8221; whose co-writer Herman Mankiewicz (played by Gary Oldman) is the &#8220;Mank&#8221; of the film&#8217;s title.</p>
<p>The story jumps back-and-forth in time, showing how Mank became acquainted — and then disillusioned — with newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst (Charles Dance) and his mistress Marion Davies (Amanda Seyfried), and how he drew on that knowledge while writing &#8220;Kane&#8221; for Orson Welles (Tom Burke).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That might not sound like a particularly dramatic setup for a film — as we acknowledge in the latest episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">the Original Content podcast</a>, &#8220;Mank&#8221;&#8216;s self-consciously old-fashioned filmmaking and its making-of-a-movie premise can make it feel a bit insider-y, like it&#8217;s footnote to another film.</p>
<p>But ultimately, the movie works whether or not you&#8217;ve seen &#8220;Citizen Kane.&#8221; Fincher captures both the glamor and the ugliness of the studio system, while Oldman delivers a mesmerizing performance as a talented writer who&#8217;s been content to joke and drink away his talent — until he finds himself driven to write one of the greatest movies of all time, which will turn many of his former friends and allies into enemies.</p>
<p>In addition to reviewing &#8220;Mank,&#8221; we also discuss the ambitious streaming plans that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/disney-investor-day/">Disney outlined at its investor day this week</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ue2LJZFHQMU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The place we’re in, the valley of the dolls between the vote and the Inauguration, is overshadowed by the battle to save our lives. The vaccines look promising, and so does the persistence of the Trumpster to play his games. Somehow we have to live with that, on both sides. In the business we’re in, the technology industry, broadband has penetrated to the point we can survive with a reasonable degree of fidelity to the world COVID erased.</p>
<p>This week’s move by WarnerMedia to release all 2021 pictures on HBO Max and in theaters is both a capitulation to reality and a political gambit to negotiate with theater owners. Disney, with their theme parks and investments in streaming crescendoing in layoffs and rebuilding, announced a mix of 80% streaming with only 20% theatrical. Trump’s TikTok deadline has already passed, and the administration is pretending to not pay attention in order to keep negotiations for a buyout alive. The incoming government talks of a working bromance between Biden and McConnell. It’s the opposite of reality TV, or TV reality.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Newsletters straddle mainstream and social media, rolling up links that blur the credibility of publications with the Wild West of uncredentialed freelancers. Some of these voices are playing the newsletter sweepstakes, choosing to move from a salaried position to their own subscription model. For those publications funded in part by a paywall, the transition to a newsletter comes with opportunity and risk. Selling a subscription for a single voice competes with the bundled voices of a paywall publication eventually diluting potential readers’ available funds. We’re seeing this same subscription saturation dynamic in the rise of streaming networks.</p>
<p>Another trend, notification-based news, is making inroads with live streaming over social networks. The pandemic has forced many students into working from home over Zoom for interactive sessions mixed with traditional lecture-type webinars. Events normally covered by trade publications have yielded at least for now to influencer and analyst driven watch parties. Podcasts forego subscription and advertiser revenue for lead generation and industry traction. The 24/7 nature of work from anywhere fights for eyelid time with binge viewing, listening, and reading.</p>
<p>Beyond the virus’s impact on audiences, the productions themselves have new challenges. The FX series Fargo ceased production in March, as did ABC’s Grey’s Anatomy. When you see the completed shows, it’s fascinating to try and guess which scenes were shot under the much tighter strictures of the fall. Grey’s Anatomy used the pandemic as a plot point, but it took a few shows for the actors to settle into a more relaxed rhythm. Pre-pandemic footage from the abbreviated series’ previous season lived uncomfortably alongside the new material to cover the transitional story line.</p>
<p>Citizen Kane, considered broadly as the best film Hollywood ever made, spawned a Netflix production about the author of the screenplay, one Herman J. Mankiewicz. Presented in black and white with Kane-like musical scoring and the original film’s innovations in deep focus photography and low angle shots that include the ceilings of sets, the story uses flashbacks and time-jumping to great effect. It’s streaming meets MGM’s catch phrase from the time: All the stars in the heavens. Director David Fincher tells the New York Times how he overshoots by 20% the number of pixels so he can post process and polish the rough edges and camera jiggles into a precise reflection of the intricate vision of his cinema universe.</p>
<p>40 years ago this week John Lennon was murdered by a troubled fan. I was watching Monday Night football when Howard Cosell broke in with the news. What was left of my childhood vanished in that moment. I was newly divorced, struggling to keep my momentum going, no idea of what our world would become, and stupid with sadness over someone I’d never met. The Beatles was this magic machine, a coalition of the fleeting imperfection of the group and the unifying perfection of what they had accomplished.</p>
<p>The days tick by. The vaccine trucks roll. The Supreme Court denies another desperate move to overturn the will of the people. Nobody told me there’d be days like these. Strange days indeed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to Human Capital, where I break down the latest in diversity, equity and inclusion, and labor in tech. This week, Twitter dropped its latest diversity report and Tesla released its first one ever. Meanwhile, Google CEO Sundar Pichai apologized for the way things went down with Dr. Timnit Gebru, a prominent researcher in artificial intelligence ethics.</p>

<p><b>Google’s Sundar Pichai will investigate events that led up to Dr. Timnit Gebru’s exit</b></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In light of artificial intelligence researcher Dr. Timnit Gebru’s exit from Google last week, Google </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/google-ceo-says-company-will-review-events-leading-up-to-dr-timnit-gebrus-departure/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Sundar Pichai sent a memo to staffers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/sundar-pichai-memo-timnit-gebru-exit-18b0efb0-5bc3-41e6-ac28-2956732ed78b.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">obtained by Axios</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, saying the company would investigate “the circumstances that led up to Dr. Gebru’s departure, examining where we could have improved and led a more respectful process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Pichai’s memo, he said the company needs to “accept responsibility for the fact that a prominent Black, female leader with immense talent left Google unhappily.” He also noted how it’s had a “ripple effect” through underrepresented communities at Google.</span></p>
<p>In response, <a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1336777379730116615">on Twitte</a>r, Gebru said she didn&#8217;t see any plans for accountability. Instead, she said she saw &#8220;further gaslighting.&#8221; In an <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/12/10/timnit-gebru-googles-dehumanizing-memo-paints-me-as-an-angry-black-woman/">interview with Venture Beat, </a>Gebru said Pichai&#8217;s memo is &#8220;dehumanizing&#8221; and makes her &#8220;sound like an angry Black woman.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>They paint me as this angry Black woman because they put you in this terrible workplace, and if you speak up about it, then you become a problem, and then they start talking about de-escalation strategies.</p>
<p>You write emails, they get ignored. You write documents, and they get ignored. Then you discuss how it’s being done and then they talk about you as if you’re like some angry Black woman who needs to be contained.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>More Black women and Latinas are founding startups, according to Project Diane</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2018, the number of Black women and Latina founders doubled from 334 startups to more than 650, </span><a href="https://www.projectdiane.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Project Diane</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These women have also raised more money than they did in 2018, but they’re still raising less than the national average. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, Black women and Latina founders raised $3.1 billion compared to just $1 billion in 2018. Still, the median seed round for Black women is $125,000 and $200,000 for Latina founders, while the national median seed is $2.5 million.</span></p>
<p><b>Tesla finally released a diversity report</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/downloads/2020-DEI-impact-report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla released its first-ever diversity report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, showing the company is 34% white, 22% Hispanic, 10% Black, 21% Asian and 7% “additional groups” in the United States. Those breakdowns are not bad, but it’s worth noting Tesla employs many of those folks in its factories, which are </span><a href="https://qz.com/1756552/tesla-workers-report-a-racist-work-environment-at-new-york-factory/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">notoriously</span></a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/business/tesla-factory-racism.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">problematic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and have been the subject of allegations around racism and discrimination.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the leadership level, Tesla is 59% white, 25% Asian, 4% Black and 4% Hispanic. Just 1% of those in leadership roles are from “additional groups.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Tesla’s gender diversity is objectively bad. Men account for 79% of Tesla’s overall workplace and 83% of its leaders in the United States.</span></p>
<p><b>Twitter shows slight improvement in latest diversity report</b></p>
<p><a href="https://careers.twitter.com/en/tweep-life/diversity.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter released its latest quarterly diversity report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showing an increase in the representation of women, Black, Latinx and multiracial employees across the whole company. Additionally, representation of women and Black people increased at the leadership level. Despite those gains, Twitter is still 56.7% male and 41% white. </span></p>
<p><b>Uber wants drivers and delivery workers to get priority access to COVID-19 vaccine</b></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/uber-wants-drivers-and-delivery-workers-to-get-priority-access-to-covid-19-vaccine/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi sent a letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to all 50 governors asking them to prioritize giving drivers and delivery workers the vaccine as essential workers. In the letter, Khosrowshahi argues that the work of drivers and delivery people has become essential. That&#8217;s why Uber wants them to get the vaccine &#8220;quickly, easily and for free,&#8221; he wrote in the letter. Additionally, Uber has offered to help share information about the vaccine and encouraging those who are eligible to get vaccinated.</span></p>
<p><b>Apple was reportedly complicit in violating Chinese labor laws</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three former Apple Supplier Responsibility employees </span><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-turned-blind-eye-to-supplier-breaches-of-chinese-labor-laws?utm_content=article-5108&amp;utm_campaign=article_email&amp;utm_source=sg&amp;utm_medium=email"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently said the company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> did nothing when its suppliers violated the temporary worker labor law in China. That law required that no more than 10% of a factory’s workforce be temporary workers. According to The Information, Apple didn’t take action because it was worried about an increase in costs, a drain on resources and delays in product launches. </span></p>

<div class="newsletter__block__body">
<div class="newsletter__block__body-text">
<p>Welcome to the depths of December, a time in which the news cycle should be slowing down. Instead it’s accelerating, giving me the firm worry that our holiday cycle is going to be mostly work this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regardless, we have no time for my usual bullshitting, so let’s get right to work.<b> First up: How to find your next venture capitalist.</b></p>
<p>There’s a VC firm called <a href="https://www.newstack.vc/">New Stack</a> that focuses on leading first institutional rounds into startups that are not based in San Francisco and New York. As you can imagine, part of its job is helping its portfolio companies — <a href="https://www.newstack.vc/#portfolio">here</a>, in case you wanted to peek — find their next investor.</p>
<p>So, New Stack’s Nate Pierotti tells The Exchange, his team crafts next-round plans with their portfolio companies so that the startups can avoid wasting time when they go out to raise a new round. Per Pierotti, these plans are popular with both founders and VCs alike.</p>
<p>A bit ago New Stack asked around 400 founders what their venture pain points are, an exercise that I presume many VCs execute to better understand their market. Something that came out of the study was that many founders wanted help finding their next investor.</p>
<p>In light of the results, New Stack decided to help, putting together a public version of their next-round tool. It’s called Venture Rank, and <a href="https://www.vc-rank.com/">you can check it out here</a>. If you tell it about your startup, it will suggest some funds to talk to, with over 1,700 in its database.</p>
<p>Why bring all this up? Aside from always looking for an excuse to cover Midwest startup activity, we spend a lot of time in this newsletter talking about companies busy leaving their venture capital days behind them. Here was a chance to talk about a resource that founders still in the venture mix can actually use.</p>

<p>I presume that by now you are caught up on all things <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/doordash" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="doordash">DoorDash <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> IPO (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/doordash-ipo-pricing/">pricing</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/doordash-c3-ai-skyrocket-in-public-market-debuts/">trading</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/how-doordash-and-c3-ai-can-defend-their-red-hot-ipo-valuatons/">the future</a>), C3.ai (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/the-ipo-market-looks-hot-as-airbnb-and-c3-ai-raise-price-targets/">pricing</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/how-doordash-and-c3-ai-can-defend-their-red-hot-ipo-valuatons/">trading</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/how-doordash-and-c3-ai-can-defend-their-red-hot-ipo-valuatons">the future</a>), and Airbnb (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/airbnb-said-to-price-ipo-between-67-and-68/">pricing</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/airbnbs-first-day-pop-caps-off-a-stellar-week-for-tech-ipos/">trading</a>). What follows presumes you are read-up.</p>
<p>To kick off Market Notes this weeks, some Market News: <a href="https://www.braze.com/">Braze</a> has grown 60% during the first three quarters of its fiscal year.</p>
<p>Sadly, while the New York-based customer engagement software startup joined the $100 million ARR club <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/13/the-newest-members-of-the-100m-arr-club/">just under a year ago</a>, we can’t just say that it’s at $160 million ARR today. Why not? The company has moved to counting GAAP revenue instead of ARR, so its growth number doesn’t correspond to the old metric.</p>
<p>And the time period for the 60% figure ran from February 2020 through October (it’s common for SaaS companies to start their fiscal year after January so that their fourth quarters don’t wrap up right after Christmas). But I <i>would not</i> be surprised if <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/braze" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="braze">Braze <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was at an ARR mark of $160 million or more.</p>
<p>According to its CEO, Bill Magnuson, the company has not raised funds since its October 2018-era Series E worth $80 million. The startup has been growing quickly, without the need to take on more capital to fund its growth.</p>
<p>What impact has COVID-19 had on the company? Magnuson said that Braze was probably ahead of its pre-COVID plan, but that it has re-forecasted on a rolling basis this year as the economy has changed. On the customer front, the CEO said that growth may have been similar without COVID, but different. He used an analogy of a balloon, COVID squeezed some parts of the balloon — market sectors in our analogy — but also enlarged some other parts of the balloon at the same time. Same balloon volume post-COVID, but a different market shape.</p>
<p>Is the move to GAAP indicative of a move towards an IPO? Not really, Magnuson said. Braze likes to compare its results to those of other companies to see how it can improve and where, he added, so having standard metrics helps.</p>
<p>But let’s be clear: Braze is big enough to go public, doesn’t burn that much money, and is watching companies go out at nigh-comical multiples. Surely the temptation is there.</p>
<p>And speaking of IPOs, let’s talk about a few. I got on the horn with a different players from the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/airbnb" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="airbnb">Airbnb <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and DoorDash debuts this week, which I have condensed to their respective key points for today in the honor of space:<b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Why DoorDash’s CFO is bullish on post-pandemic consumer demand:</b> Talking to Prabir Adarkar was good fun as he is both voluble and limpid. That is an excellent combination in a person from which you hope to learn something. I wanted to know what DoorDash was thinking about post-pandemic demand for food delivery. I have a slightly pessimistic take. Adarkar, as you expected, is more bullish. After discussing how the company’s huge IPO will provide the company with a cushion as it looks to more deeply penetrate the food market, and expand into new verticals, we got around to the point. The CFO argued that once users have downloaded the DoorDash app and used it a few times, it’s very sticky. He expects that stickiness to persist even after COVID-19 is behind us. And, he added, more restaurants have joined in the last few months, so the service has itself improved. That could help keep users engaged when they are allowed outside.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Why Airbnb’s chief strategy officer (CSO) is bullish on post-pandemic consumer demand:</b> Nathan Blecharczyk, one of Airbnb’s founders and CSO, talked The Exchange through his company’s post-pandemic demand thesis. First, travel will return as soon as people are allowed to go outside. That’s good for Airbnb. And, he said, Zoom is not going away — people may take a long weekend in an Airbnb and work the Friday and relax during the weekend, for example. With international travel coming back, and a cultural shift toward remote work, Airbnb could wind up with a larger marker in 2021 than it had in 2019. We’ll see.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Sequoia partner Alfred Lin on this week’s IPO pricing and results:</b> Finally from our call log, an investor. Sequoia was in both DoorDash and Airbnb, with Lin on the board of each. We chatted a bit about the IPOs, a convo from which something stood out. Lin explained, in response to my questions about the extreme prices that some IPOs were commanding after their debuts, that Airbnb had been expensive during its private life, as well. You have to pay up sometimes for the standouts, the argument seemed to go. From a venture perspective, I vibe with the point. From a public investor perspective, I understand it less. But that’s why the stock market is fun.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we catch up on some small things, after I covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/okr-focused-koan-raises-1m-adds-free-tier/">OKR-focused Koan raising another $1 million</a>, OKR-focused <a href="https://www.ally.io/">Ally.io</a> — <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/ally-raises-15m-series-b-to-scale-its-okr-focused-service/">which I have written about before</a> — reached out with some data on its growth. A sucker for such information, here’s the gist: Ally grew its revenues 3.3x in 2020, adding 500 customers in the process and seeing 145 expansions from existing customers. Ally cited a need for more planning tools for a hybrid (office and remote) working world as a driver of demand. Koan declared a similar situation as its impetus for releasing a free tier of its software.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/why-is-everyone-making-okr-software/">OKR market was hot earlier this year</a>. I suppose it still is.</p>

<div class="newsletter__block__body-text">
<p>Alright. In no particular order, here are some very interesting things from this week that I could not write whole posts about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Denver-based <a href="https://range.vc/">Range Ventures</a> has put together a $23 million fund. Why do we care? It’s focused on Denver. I did not know that the Denver scene was mature enough to warrant its own firm. I suppose I am behind on this one.</li>
<li>Brazilian software company <a href="https://www.intelipost.com.br/en/">Intelipost</a> raised $32 million this week, led by Riverwood Capital. E-commerce and logistics are hot in 2020, and Intelipost does both. This is one to keep an eye on.</li>
<li>Chicago’s <a href="https://cardr.com/">CarDr</a> raised $5 million in what it calls “launch and seed funding” from Red Fort Capital. The startup uses AI to help its team execute car diagnostics — hence, calling itself Car Doctor. According to the company, it sells to consumers, dealers, and banks alike. And the startup has earmarked about 75% of its new capital for engineering expenses, which implies that it has lots more to build in the future (a good thing, mind.) On the economics front, the company told The Exchange that it has good margins, but that they work out to be slightly lower than some SaaS companies due to the cost of AI computing time. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/21/do-ai-startups-have-worse-economics-than-saas-shops/">We’ve written about that</a>!</li>
<li>API-security focused <a href="https://salt.security/">Salt Security</a> raised $30 million this week. I am a dork for all things API, so to see the API-security space raise this much in a single round caught my attention. Sequoia led the Series B. Salt raised a $20 million Series A in June. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/skyflow-raises-17-5m-more-to-help-companies-protect-your-personal-data/">The trend of two rounds in 2020 continues</a>!)</li>
<li>A startup named <a href="https://www.beyondidentity.com/">Beyond Identity</a> raised $75 million this week. I am at a loss regarding what “passwordless” identity means, but I hope it works, as I constantly need to update my Okta password, which makes me sad.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.adaventures.com/">Ada Ventures</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/ada-ventures-closes-first-fund-at-50m-investing-in-diverse-founders-tacking-societys-problems/">closed a $50 million fund</a>. The European group intends “to invest in diverse founders tacking societal problems.” Hard to not be into that mission.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now it’s time to put on some heavy metal, play Civ 6, and not think about news for a bit.</p>

<p>Maybe it is a stock market bubble, or a tech-stock bubble at least. And maybe DoorDash, Airbnb and C3.ai and their bankers should have priced higher regardless to take advantage of all of the enthusiasm. It&#8217;s hard to avoid reactions like that, after DoorDash, for example, doubled its final private share price to $102 for its public debut on Wednesday — only to see the price climb to $175 at the end of the week.</p>
<p>Or maybe none of this will matter, because the future is way bigger and the companies are going to get there regardless. That&#8217;s what <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/early-doordash-investor-dismisses-froth-talk-says-company-could-grow-10x-from-here/">Saar Gur tells Connie Loizos</a> this week about DoorDash, which he had invested in many years ago:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>I actually started my career at Lehman Brothers on the investment banking team, and so having seen the IPO process, while I can appreciate [frustration that a] company left some money on the table based on the pricing, the tactical challenge [is that] it’s very hard to predict. You know what the market will bear once it moves to retail investors.</p>
<p>What’s exciting to me is [that] DoorDash is raising money because they are just getting started. I do think this could be a $500 billion-plus company. There’s so much to be excited about. As for the capital-raising event, I think it’s hard for the bankers to know where it will land with the broader market, so I’m not as negative as maybe some others.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Meet Natasha Mascarenhas, your future Startups Weekly newsletter author</h2>
<p>The year is coming to a close for my time writing this newsletter, too. I&#8217;m going to be returning full-time to my regular job editing Extra Crunch and stuff in the back offices here at TechCrunch virtual HQ. My colleague <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/natasha-mascarenhas/">Natasha Mascarenhas</a> will be taking over starting next week.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re in good hands. In fact you may have noticed many of her articles and her weekly contributions to Equity showing up here already. Since joining us from Crunchbase News earlier this year, she&#8217;s been covering early-stage startups and the San Francisco tech scene in general, with a big focus on edtech. We have a lot more planned across Equity, Extra Crunch and more, and she&#8217;ll be able to tie it all together around her daily coverage. Stay tuned for an action-packed 2021 (and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">follow her on Twitter in the meantime</a>).</p>

<h2>How to bootstrap to $200m+ in revenue</h2>
<p>Alex Wilhelm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/05/how-one-company-reached-revenues-of-200m-without-vc-money/">hears from one startup founder</a> who has taken a bit of an alternative approach to building a SaaS company. Here&#8217;s more:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now north of $200 million in revenue, [<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nextiva" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="nextiva">Nextiva</a>] is a quiet giant and, notably, has not taken venture capital funding along its path to scale. Chatting with CEO and co-founder Tomas Gorny, I got to dig a little under the skin of the company’s history. It goes a little something like this: After moving to California in 1996 at the age of 20, Gorny eventually founded a web hosting company in 2001 after working for tech companies during the dot-com boom. The web hosting company wound up selling to another company <a href="https://www.pehub.com/endurance-buys-ipower/">called Endurance International in 2007</a>, which sold as a combined entity for around a billion dollars in 2011, later going public before <a href="https://clearlake.com/endurance-international-group-announces-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-clearlake-capital-group-l-p-for-9-50-per-share/">being taken private</a> last month for $3 billion — you can read this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/26/weebly-web-host-endurance/">TechCrunch piece that mentions Endurance from 2010</a> for a bit of the historical record.</p>
<p>Gorny founded Nextiva in 2008, focused on what it describes today as “UcaaS,” or unified communications as a service. The startup grew to about $40 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), at which point it ran into issues with a third-party system that would integrate hardware, and support and services software, which sparked a shift in its thinking. The company set out to build a platform.</p>
<p>Nextiva expanded horizontally, adding CRM software, analytics and other functionality to its broader suite as it scaled. And it grew efficiently; starting with money from its founding team, Gorny told TechCrunch that even if he had used someone else’s money, he would have built the company in the same manner.</p></blockquote>

<h2>So why does TechCrunch cover so many early-stage funding rounds, anyway?</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/06/3-views-on-the-future-of-the-funding-round-story/">Natasha&#8217;s take</a>, from a little explainer we did this week following some Twitter conversations:</p>
<blockquote><p>The reason I love writing about tech and do the sometimes formulaic funding-round story is because I meet people who are crazy enough to bet their entire legacy on a napkin-stage idea. That’s the story, and the surprise and the tension. The dollar sign is just the first way in.</p></blockquote>
<p>Having raised fundings that got covered in TechCrunch, and having written many many funding round articles over the year, I agree. The funding round is often the only way to prove that you have traction, if you are trying to get more attention.</p>

<h2>The Klarna founding story</h2>
<p>Swedish fintech decacorn Klarna pioneered new ways for users to buy online without credit cards over the decade, and is now battling rivals large and small across the world. How did it all happen? Steve O&#8217;Hear sits down with founder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/making-sense-of-klarna/">Sebastian Siemiatkowski for an exclusive in-depth interview</a> that Extra Crunch subscribers have been eating up this week. Here&#8217;s his description:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a wide-ranging interview, Siemiatkowski confronts criticisms head on, including that Klarna makes it too easy to get into debt, and that buy now, pay later needs to be regulated. We also discuss Klarna’s business model and the balancing act required to win over consumers and keep merchants onside.</p>
<p>We also learn how, under his watch and as the company began to scale, Klarna missed the next big opportunity in fintech, instead being usurped by Adyen and Stripe. Siemiatkowski also shares what’s next for the company as it ventures further into the world of retail banking after gaining a bank license in 2017.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a painfully fascinating excerpt from Siemiatkowski:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the drawbacks that we had at the company was that none of the three co-founders had any engineering background; we couldn’t code. We were connected to five engineers that by themselves were amazing engineers, but we had a slight misunderstanding. Their idea was that they were going to come in, build a prototype, ship it, and then leave for 37% of the equity. Our understanding was that they were going to come in, ship it, and if it started scaling they would stay with us and work for a longer period of time. This is the classic mistake that you do as a startup.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Those Facebook antitrust lawsuits</h2>
<p>It seems that the US government has finally had enough of Facebook&#8217;s aggressive expansion and acquisition practices. After years of light regulation, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ftc-seeks-to-break-up-facebook-alleging-illegal-monopoly/">the Federal Trade Commission and</a>, separately, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">49 state attorneys general</a> are suing to break up social networking company. You can find lots of commentary about the details on TechCrunch and elsewhere.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s my take for you to remember, as you watch headlines about this continue into next year: Facebook was always ready. I covered the company closely during its early years, and even back then it was talking about being <em>the</em> operating system for the internet, like Microsoft Windows was for desktop. The implied and whispered goal was to get as big as possible before regulations inevitably hit, like what Microsoft did. Here we are, with Facebook in a leading market position, with a massive army of lawyers who have been preparing for years. Without getting further into the lawsuits or political landscape where it&#8217;s all happening&#8230; I don&#8217;t expect a breakup. But maybe new restrictions on acquisitions or something could limit growth potential? Its big wins this decade have been from acquisitions.</p>
<p>One boring scenario I don&#8217;t see discussed much is simply that its products remain the phone book of the era for much of the world. Somewhat regulated this way or that way in various jurisdictions and banned outright in some — and very big and successful still.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 204 billion downloads and $120 billion in global consumer spend in 2019. Not including third-party Chinese app stores, iOS and Android users <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/app-stores-to-see-130-billion-downloads-in-2020-and-record-consumer-spend-of-112-billion/">downloaded</a> 130 billion apps in 2020. Consumer spend also hit a record $112 billion across iOS and Android alone. In 2019, people <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/average-us-time-spent-with-mobile-in-2019-has-increased" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spent</a> three hours and 40 minutes per day using apps, rivaling TV. Due to COVID-19, time spent in apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/app-stores-to-see-130-billion-downloads-in-2020-and-record-consumer-spend-of-112-billion/">jumped</a> 25% year-over-year on Android.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h3>Apple defends its consumer privacy moves</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2086218" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086218" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2086218" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2048.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="445" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2048.jpeg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2048.jpeg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2048.jpeg?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2048.jpeg?resize=768,503 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2048.jpeg?resize=680,445 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2048.jpeg?resize=1536,1005 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2048.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086218" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Apple SVP Craig Federighi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/apple-takes-aim-at-adtech-hysteria-over-ios-app-tracking-change/">took aim at the adtech industry</a> in a speech to European lawmakers this week, where he downplayed and dismissed the industry backlash against the forthcoming app tracking changes as &#8220;outlandish&#8221; and even &#8220;false.&#8221; He said that online tracking is privacy’s biggest challenge and that Apple&#8217;s forthcoming App Tracking Transparency (ATT) is the front-line of defense.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mass centralization of data puts privacy at risk — no matter who’s collecting it and what their intentions might be,&#8221; Federighi said, reiterating that Apple aimed to have as little data on its customers as possible.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/08IC1AZTxls?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>This has been the company&#8217;s line to date, and it&#8217;s not necessarily the whole truth. Apple has so far characterized its decision to allow consumers to opt-out of being tracked as one that&#8217;s solely focused on consumer privacy. It positions Apple as consumers&#8217; savior and the only one fighting for our privacy. But the changes are also an example of Apple leveraging its platform power, potentially in an anticompetitive way, to give itself a seat at the table of a multi-billion-dollar market today dominated by its competitors <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Facebook.</p>
<p>In this case, Apple is inserting itself in the world of mobile advertising by forcing a shift from IDFA to its own SKAdNetwork, which limits the individualized data advertisers can access. This is good for consumers who don&#8217;t want to be targeted and tracked just because they&#8217;re using an app. Publishers, however, have argued they won&#8217;t be able to charge as much for ads where users opted out of tracking. This could have a snowball effect of hurting ad-supported businesses beyond the tech giants like Facebook.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Apple does get to collect a lot of consumer data which it uses to personalize ads. Its own App Store and Apple News apps <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074">personalize ads unless consumers opt out</a> in their iPhone&#8217;s Settings (and not through a scary pop-up warning like third-party apps have to display). Apple says <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-faces-antitrust-complaint-in-france-over-privacy-changes-in-iphones-11603893625?mod=business_lead_pos2">what it does in terms of personalization doesn&#8217;t count as &#8220;tracking</a>&#8221; because it doesn&#8217;t share the data with others or follow customers around websites and apps.</p>
<p>But as Apple moves into its own services businesses, the amount of data that can be used to personalize its own ads grows. Today, Apple&#8217;s ad targeting system includes users in segments based on the music, books, TV shows and apps they download, as well as in-app purchases and subscriptions. It also tracks users as they search the app search with keywords and tap to read App Store stories, and tracks location if permission has been granted to Apple News or the App Store.</p>

WhatsApp also argued that they don&#8217;t allow companies to share enough details about the measures they&#8217;re taking to protect consumer data.</p>
<p>Apple <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/09/apple-apps-will-show-privacy-labels/">responded</a> by saying labels for its own apps will be on its website for those apps not distributed through the App Store.</p>
<h2>Facebook antitrust lawsuits</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_1956435" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1956435" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1956435" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Facebook-Stories-Cross-Post-To-Instagram.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="368" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Facebook-Stories-Cross-Post-To-Instagram.png 2954w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Facebook-Stories-Cross-Post-To-Instagram.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Facebook-Stories-Cross-Post-To-Instagram.png?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Facebook-Stories-Cross-Post-To-Instagram.png?resize=768,415 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Facebook-Stories-Cross-Post-To-Instagram.png?resize=680,368 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Facebook-Stories-Cross-Post-To-Instagram.png?resize=1536,830 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Facebook-Stories-Cross-Post-To-Instagram.png?resize=2048,1107 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Facebook-Stories-Cross-Post-To-Instagram.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1956435" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Forty-eight attorneys general across 46 states, the territory of Guam and the District of Columbia <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">have filed an antitrust lawsuit that accuses Facebook</a> of suppressing its competition through monopolistic business practices. The states are asking the court to restrain Facebook from making further acquisitions in excess of $10 million without notifying the plaintiffs, and is asking for additional relief, including &#8220;the divestiture or restructuring of illegally acquired companies, or current Facebook assets or business lines.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ftc-seeks-to-break-up-facebook-alleging-illegal-monopoly/">FTC also voted to pursue</a> its own antitrust suit against Facebook at the federal level.</p>
<p>While the lawsuits are much larger than an app story alone, they do have the potential to impact the app ecosystem if the plaintiffs prevail, as they ask for the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, and maybe others, to be retroactively judged to be illegal and divested. This would allow for increased competition among the social app market, where Facebook leverages its power to maintain its dominant position. For instance, Facebook just integrated its messaging platform with Instagram&#8217;s, meaning <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/facebook-introduces-cross-app-communication-between-messenger-and-instagram-plus-other-features/">users can now message friends across two</a> of the largest social platforms via just one app &#8212; either Messenger or Instagram. WhatsApp could be integrated in the future, as well.</p>

<p>Twitter on Friday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/twitter-acquires-screen-sharing-social-app-squad/">announced</a> the acquisition of the screen-sharing social app Squad. The startup&#8217;s co-founders, CEO Esther Crawford and CTO Ethan Sutin, along with the rest of Squad&#8217;s team will be joining Twitter&#8217;s design, engineering and product departments. The Squad app, which had heavily relied on Snap&#8217;s Snap Kit developer tools, will shut down.</p>
<p>Twitter may be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/twitter-app-code-indicates-that-live-video-broadcasting-app-periscope-may-get-shut-down/">shuttering Periscope as well</a>, code reveals, which leaves some wondering what Twitter&#8217;s plans are in terms of streamlining its services. The company has more recently been experimenting with its own version of Stories, aka Fleets, and an audio-based networking product for group conversations.</p>

<li><strong>Google is working on an ambitious project to improve GPS accuracy in apps</strong>. In dense urban areas, it&#8217;s often hard to get an accurate GPS reading &#8212; leading to issues like wrong-side-of-the-street and even wrong-city-block errors, which greatly impact ridesharing and navigation apps. Google&#8217;s new solution uses 3D mapping-aided corrections, comprised of 3D building models, raw GPS measurements and machine learning. <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/12/improving-urban-gps-accuracy-for-your.html">Its Pixel Feature Drop in December adds these corrections to Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a (5G)</a>, which Google says will reduce wrong-side-of-street occurrences by approximately 75%. Other Android phones (Android 8+) have version 1 implemented in the FLP (Fused Location Provider API), which reduces those occurrences by around 50%. Version 2 will be available to the entire Android ecosystem (Android 8 or later) in early 2021.</li>
<li><strong>Google Play Pass arrives in 7 new countries, including key Latin American markets.</strong> The subscription-based apps and games<a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/07/google-play-pass-brings-its-curated-selection-of-ad-free-apps-and-games-to-5-new-countries/"> service came to</a> Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Russia and Saudi Arabia. This brings the total number of markets where the service is live to 42.</li>
<li><strong>Google&#8217;s <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/pixel/december-feature-drop">Pixel Feature Drop</a></strong> adds Adaptive Sound, Hold for Me (where Google Assistant waits on hold for you), Extreme Battery Saver Mode, screen sharing on Duo calls and more.</li>

<li><strong>The U.S. National Weather Service</strong> just saw a record year of weather-related disasters like the busiest Atlantic hurricane season on record and California&#8217;s wildfires. Now the agency <a href="https://www.weather.gov/media/notification/pdf2/pns20-85ncep_web_access.pdf">says</a> it&#8217;s running out of Internet bandwidth and<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/12/09/nws-data-limits-internet-bandwidth/"><strong> will need to throttle</strong></a><strong> the amount of data</strong> its clients and users can access. The move would impact weather consumers who <strong>get their weather from apps on their smartphones</strong>, as much of the forecasts and alerts they receive are based on Weather Service output and data.</li>
<li><strong>California&#8217;s CA Notify contact-tracing app</strong> for COVID-19 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/californias-ca-notify-app-to-offer-statewide-exposure-notification-using-apple-and-googles-framework/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">now reaches the full state</a>. The app uses Apple and Google&#8217;s exposure notification API.</li>
<li><strong>Cydia files anti-competition lawsuit against Apple</strong>. Third-party App Store maker Cydia, home to jailbreak apps that often added functionality beyond what Apple permitted through its terms, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/10/cydia-apple-lawsuit/">is suing Apple for using anticompetitive means</a> to destroy its rival app store. There are good examples of how denying third-party app stores a home on iOS may have been anticompetitive, but Cydia&#8217;s lawsuit may not be it. The store in its early days distributed pirated apps, not just those that fell outside Apple&#8217;s rules.</li>

<p><strong>Barter</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/barter-app-sales-widget/id1538533114">Barter</a> is an app designed for app developers alone. From the maker of the HomePass and HomeCam apps, Barter offers a way for <a href="https://www.imore.com/barter-puts-your-app-store-sales-your-iphone-home-screen-using-widgets">app developers to view their app sales</a> in a widget on iOS 14+ devices. The app includes no analytics or tracking beyond what Apple builds in to protect developer data. In the future, Pearce says he&#8217;ll expand the app to be able to show things like downloaded units, by product and more. The current version was an MVP to see if Apple would allow the app to pass App Review. Since it passed, it will soon be upgraded.</p>

This EUA follows a recommendation by an independent panel of experts commissioned by the FDA to review Pfizer&#8217;s application and provide a recommendation, which the panel unanimously supported earlier this week.</p>
<p>Following this authorization, shipment of the vaccine are expected to begin immediately, with 2.9 million doses in the initial shipment order. Patients in the category of highly vulnerable individuals, which include healthcare workers and senior citizens in long-term care facilities, are expected to begin receiving doses within just a few days not was the EUA is granted.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;FDA panel recommends approving Pfizer&#8217;s COVID-19 vaccine emergency use authorization&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/fda-panel-recommends-approving-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use-authorization/embed/#?secret=mrj797kKDw" data-secret="mrj797kKDw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This approval isn&#8217;t a full certification by the U.S. therapeutics regulator, but it is an emergency measure that still requires a comprehensive review of the available information supplied by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pfizer" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pfizer">Pfizer <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> based on its Phase 3 clinical trial, which covered a group of 44,000 volunteer participants. Pfizer found that its vaccine, which is an mRNA-based treatment, was 95% effective in its final analysis of the data resulting form the trial to date – and also found that safety data indicated no significant safety issues in patients who received the vaccine.</p>
<p>On top of the initial 2.9 million dose order, the U.S. intends to distribute around 25 million doses by the end of 2020, which could result in far fewer people actually vaccinated since the Pfizer course requires two innoculations for maximum efficacy. Most American shouldn&#8217;t expect the vaccine to be available until at least late Q1 or Q2 2021, given the pace of Pfizer&#8217;s production and the U.S. order volume.</p>
<p>Still, this is a promising first step, and a monumental achievement in terms of vaccine development turnaround time, since it&#8217;s been roughly eight months since work began on the Pfizer vaccine candidate. Moderna has also submitted an EUA for its vaccine candidate, which is also an mRNA treatment (which provides instructions to a person&#8217;s cells to produce effective countermeasures to the virus). That could follow shortly, meaning two vaccines might be available under EUA within the U.S. before the end of the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Austinites, watch out; another tech company is headed into town.</p>
<p>Just days after Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed during an interview that he has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-to-discuss-teslas-banner-year-despite-pandemic-silicon-valleys-future-11607449988">moved to Texas</a>, and less than two weeks after HP Enterprise, a spin-out of the iconic Silicon Valley company Hewlett-Packard, announced that it is separately <a href="https://apnews.com/article/houston-california-greg-abbott-texas-1ce5ef41c6e20e84b5954de11fa3c8a7">moving to Texas</a>, yet another of the Bay Area&#8217;s best-known brands &#8212; Oracle &#8212;  is pulling up stakes and headed east to Texas, too.</p>
<p>The news was first reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-11/oracle-moves-headquarters-to-texas-joins-exodus-from-california?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google">Bloomberg</a>. Oracle confirmed the move in a statement sent to TechCrunch, saying that along with a &#8220;more flexible employee work location policy,&#8221; the company has changed its corporate headquarters from Redwood Shores, California, to Austin. &#8220;We believe these moves best position <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/oracle" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="oracle">Oracle <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> for growth and provide our personnel with more flexibility about where and how they work.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A spokeswoman declined to answer more questions related to the move, but Oracle says that &#8220;many&#8221; of its employees can choose their office location, as well as continue to work from home part time or full time.</p>
<p>HPE and Oracle aren&#8217;t the first major tech companies to plot such moves in recent times. Late last year, the brokerage giant <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/charles-schwab" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="charles-schwab">Charles Schwab <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said it was <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/2019/11/30/schwab-is-the-latest-company-leaving-california-for-texas-and-it-wont-be-the-last-expert-says/">leaving the Bay Area for Texas </a>as it was announcing its $26 billion merger with TD Ameritrade, though it chose Dallas, about 200 miles away from Austin.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Elon Musk moved to Texas&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/elon-musk-has-made-the-move-to-texas/embed/#?secret=TJ64LZ6VF7" data-secret="TJ64LZ6VF7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Tech giants <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Google have also been expanding their presence in the state. Apple announced in 2018 that it was building a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/business/apple-austin-campus.html">$1 billion campus</a> in Austin. Meanwhile, Google, which opened its first Austin office 13 years ago, said last year that it was beginning to lease <a href="https://www.statesman.com/news/20190614/google-says-it-plans-significant-expansion-in-austin">far more space</a> in the city.</p>
<p>Taxes, a more affordable cost of living for employees, a lower cost of doing business and less competition for talent are among the top drivers for the companies&#8217; moves, though there is also a growing sense that culture is a factor, as well.</p>
<p>While California is led by Democrats, Texas is led by Republicans, and as the divide between the two parties grows, so does the divide between their respective supporters, with even self-described centrists saying they feel alienated.</p>
<p>Oracle co-founder and Chairman Larry Ellison has notably been one of few top tech execs to openly support President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Joe Lonsdale, a co-founder of the venture firm 8VC and Palantir Technologies (which itself recently headed to Denver from Palo Alto), recently explained his own move this year to Texas from California <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-love-it-and-leave-it-11605472619">in the WSJ</a>, writing: &#8220;Politics in the state is in many ways closed off to different ideas. We grew weary of California’s intolerant far left, which would rather demonize opponents than discuss honest differences of opinion.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a similar vein this fall, in conversation with reporter Kara Swisher, Musk suggested he was also outside of Democratic circles, describing his political views as &#8220;socially very liberal and then economically right of center, maybe, or center? I don&#8217;t know. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/opinion/sway-kara-swisher-elon-musk.html">Obviously I&#8217;m not a communist.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>While Austin is becoming a go-to spot for many of California&#8217;s wealthiest contrarians, others are headed to Florida. Coincidentally or not, Florida is another Republican-controlled state that, like Texas, does not collect state tax.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/keith-rabois" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="keith-rabois">Keith Rabois, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a Founders Fund investor who recently left the Bay Area for Miami, contributed to the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/contrib_all.php?cmte=C00610907&amp;type=A&amp;cycle=2016">NeverTrump PAC</a> in 2016 and said his first choice for U.S. president this year was Democratic contender Pete Buttigieg. But he has also worried openly about democratic socialism, of which the GOP has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/25/905895428/republicans-blast-democrats-as-socialists-heres-what-socialism-is">long accused</a> Democrats of promoting.</p>
<p>Venture capitalist <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/david-blumberg" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="david-blumberg">David Blumberg, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a Trump supporter, is also headed to Miami, he announced recently. Blumberg said he had it with &#8220;poor governance at the local level in San Francisco and statewide in California.&#8221; Yet he seemed to have grown frustrated with the Bay Area some time ago.</p>
<p>As Blumberg <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/9/17/20869679/donald-trump-silicon-valley-fundraiser-2020">told Vox last year, </a>he believes that tech platforms are biased against conservatives. He also told the outlet that the Valley was home to many more Trump supporters than might be imagined, and that &#8220;we generally keep our heads down” because “people who go out publicly for Republicans and for Trump can get business banned or get blackballed.”</p>
<p>Impetus notwithstanding, a longer-term question is whether these moves &#8212; particularly for those individuals and smaller outfits that are relocating &#8212; will prove permanent.</p>
<p>At least one tech exec, Twitter and Medium co-founder Ev Williams, has returned to the Bay Area after moving away &#8212; in his case, to New York. Williams, who was largely &#8220;looking for a change,&#8221; made the move with his family late last year after spending 20 years in the Bay Area, he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/talking-techs-exodus-twitters-new-labels-and-mediums-future-with-founder-ev-williams/">recently told</a> TechCrunch. Then COVID struck.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had never lived in New York and thought, ‘Why not go? Now seems like a good time.’ Turns out I was wrong. [Laughs.] It was a very bad time to move to New York.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You don&#8217;t have to buy into 5G conspiracy theories to think that you could do with a little less radiation in your life. One way of blocking radiation is a Faraday cage, but this is usually a metal mesh of some kind, making everyday use difficult. Researchers at Drexel University have managed to create a Faraday fabric by infusing ordinary cotton with a compound called MXene — meaning your tinfoil hat is about to get a lot comfier.</p>
<p>Faraday cages work because radiation in radio frequencies is blocked by certain metals, but because of its wavelength, the metal doesn&#8217;t even have to be solid — it can be a solid cage or flexible mesh. Many facilities are lined with materials like this to prevent outside radiation from interfering with sensitive measurements, but recently companies like <a href="https://silent-pocket.com/">Silent Pocket</a> have integrated meshes into bags and cases that totally isolate devices from incoming signals.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be frank here and say that this is definitely paranoia-adjacent. RF radiation is not harmful in the doses and frequencies we get it, and the FCC makes sure no device exceeds certain thresholds. But there&#8217;s also the possibility that your phone or laptop is naively connecting to public Wi-Fi, getting its MAC number skimmed by other devices, and otherwise interacting with the environment in a way you might not like. And honestly&#8230; with the amount of devices emitting radiation right now, who wouldn&#8217;t mind lowering their dose a little, just to be extra sure?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That may be much easier to do in the near future, as Yury Gogotsi and his team at the Drexel Nanomaterials Institute, of which he is director, have come up with a way to coat ordinary textile fibers in a metallic compound that makes them effective Faraday cages — but also flexible, durable and washable.</p>
<p>The material, which they call MXene and is more of a category than a single compound, is useful in lots of ways, and <a href="https://nano.materials.drexel.edu/publications/">the subject of dozens of papers by the team</a> — this is just the most recent application.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have known for some time that MXene has the ability to block electromagnetic interference better than other materials, but this discovery shows that it can effectively adhere to fabrics and maintain its unique shielding capabilities,&#8221; <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/du-ff121120.php">said Gogotsi in a news release</a>. You can <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/pub/251432.php">see the fabric in action on video here</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086223" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mxene-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086223" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2086223" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mxene-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="663" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mxene-2.jpg 2438w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mxene-2.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mxene-2.jpg?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mxene-2.jpg?resize=768,497 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mxene-2.jpg?resize=680,440 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mxene-2.jpg?resize=1536,994 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mxene-2.jpg?resize=2048,1326 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mxene-2.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2086223" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Drexel University</p></div></p>
<p>MXenes are conductive metal-carbon compounds that can be fabricated into all sorts of forms: solid, liquid, even sprays. In this case it&#8217;s a liquid — a solution of tiny MXene flakes that adhere to the fabric quite easily and produce a Faraday effect, blocking 99.9% of RF radiation in tests. After sitting around for a couple years (perhaps forgotten in a lab cupboard) it kept 90% of their effectiveness, and the treated fabric can also be washed and worn safely.</p>
<p>You wouldn&#8217;t necessarily want to wear a whole suit of the stuff, but this would make it easier for clothing to include an RF-blocking pocket in a jacket, jeans or laptop bag that doesn&#8217;t feel out of place with the other materials. A hat (or underwear) with a layer of this fabric would be a popular item among conspiracy theorists, of course.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still a ways from showing up on the rack, but Gogotsi was optimistic about its prospects for commercialization, noting that Drexel has multiple patents on the material and its uses. Other ways of infusing fabric with MXenes could lead to clothes that generate and store energy as well.</p>
<p>You can read more about this particular application of MXenes <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0008622320311982?via%3Dihub#!">in the journal Carbon</a>.</p>

We&#8217;ve spoken to folks like Aileen Lee, Mark Cuban, Roelof Botha, Charles Hudson and many, others. You can browse the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/ecl">full library of episodes here</a>.</p>
<p>Check out our full conversation with Boyce and Boyle in the YouTube video below, or skim the text for the highlights.</p>
<h2>Which personality traits are most important in founders</h2>
<p><strong>Katherine Boyle:</strong> I look for what I would call this obsessive trait, where they are learning more about the regulatory complications, where they are constantly trying to figure out how to solve a problem.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say that the common theme among the founders that I support are that they have this sort of obsessive gene or personality, where they will go deeper and deeper and deeper. When we invest in these companies, it becomes very clear that they often have sort of a contrarian view of the industry. Maybe they are not industry-native. They come at it from a different perspective of problem solving. They&#8217;ve had to defend that thesis for a very, very long time in front of a variety of different customers and different people. In some ways, that makes them much stronger in terms of the way they approach problems.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Boyce:</strong> I think the first would be being magnetic for talent. It ends up influencing the speed of learning and development. Really incredible founding teams that can be magnetic for talent and learning just kind of spirals out of control in really good ways over time. I really look for the speed and the sources of learning. And can folks be really intentional? Can they get the right set of advisors and teammates around them?</p>
<p>The second would be the personal connection to the problem space. It&#8217;s like there&#8217;s this kind of deep-seated source of energy and fuel that actually isn&#8217;t going to run out. Catherine and I&#8217;ve been lucky to work across a number of different particular thematic areas, but the thing they have in common is just this personal connection to how and why their business needs to exist. Because I just think that that fuel doesn&#8217;t run out, you know what I mean? Like, that&#8217;s renewable.</p>
<h2>On fundraising and building trust remotely</h2>
<p><strong>Boyle:</strong> If you&#8217;re someone who&#8217;s comfortable presenting on Zoom, making connections on Zoom, or using Signal and using Twitter and being very online, then I 100% think that you can make investments, build community and build connections through digital worlds and digital platforms. If you really like that in-person connectivity, then you might consider staying in a tech hub, or you might consider sort of these distanced walks until things go back to normal. <div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">At the end of 2019, no one would have predicted what an unpredictable and difficult year it has been for both startups and VCs in the fundraising world. Now we are staring down the end of 2020 and looking toward what we all hope is a better, safer 2021. What will this new year bring? With an end-of-year sprint to close deals, the anticipation of a new presidential administration and the hope of a COVID-19 vaccine on the horizon, startups and VCs know that change is on the horizon — but how much of that change will be positive?</p>
<p>As 2020 proved, no one can say for sure what 2021 will bring, but I’d like to put a few predictions on the table based on DocSend’s data and research, including the <a href="https://www.docsend.com/index/2020-docsend-startup-index/">DocSend Startup Index</a>, as well as some trends I’ve seen and my own experiences. These predictions center around how we’ll fundraise post-pandemic, how the funding divide may widen for some, what fundraising activity could look like into 2021, a few sectors we think will fare well and will incorporate some tips on how to succeed in the new year, no matter what comes our way.</p>
<h2>We’ll interact through a mix of the old and the new</h2>
<p>The pandemic forced all of us to drastically change how we work and interact with colleagues and clients. When the pandemic subsides and vaccines are widely available, in-person meetings and gathering back at the office will definitely resume, but it’s safe to say the old ways of networking and fundraising won’t shift back 100%. Founders and VCs alike have navigated the ups and downs of remote networking and fundraising interactions and will stick to what works and what doesn’t.</p>
<p>Is traveling to a conference the best way for a founder to have a chance at meeting the VC who is right to support their business? Will a VC want to drive an hour through Bay Area traffic for an in-person status update meeting on their latest investment? Zoom fatigue aside, video conference calls do have some benefits — efficiency, no travel time — although not all meetings are best conducted virtually.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			No matter what 2021 has in store, founders can still take proactive steps to help them succeed in their fundraising efforts.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The extent to which businesses go in-person or stick to virtual meetings could depend directly on what round of fundraising they are working toward or have completed. Businesses in the <a href="https://try.docsend.com/fundraising-report">pre-seed round</a> might stick with more Zoom meetings in order to conserve resources.</p>
<p>Founders in the seed round will likely split between video and in-person meetings as they are under pressure to show traction in this round, as we found in <a href="https://try.docsend.com/seed-report-webinar">our report on seed fundraising</a>, yet will also need to conserve resources and time. For <a href="https://try.docsend.com/series-a-fundraising-report-webinar">Series A</a>, they might have to meet less in person because they have established relationships with their investors. Series B might see more in-person meetings as their business has reached a level of complexity that is difficult to communicate via a deck or video conference.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/benchmark" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="benchmark">Benchmark, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the storied venture firm, has brought aboard a fifth general partner: 29-year-old Miles Grimshaw, a Yale graduate who joins the outfit from Thrive Capital, where he similarly joined a team of four other partners back in 2013, helping them raise the firm&#8217;s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/miles-grimshaw/?sh=3622f9f3612c">fourth and fifth funds</a> (per Forbes).</p>
<p>From his post as a general partner with New York-based Thrive, Grimshaw had sourced deals in some of today&#8217;s buzziest startups and served on their boards, including Lattice, Mapbox, Benchling and Airtable, getting to know fellow investors at Benchmark in the process.</p>
<p>He represented Thrive on the board of <a href="https://www.benchling.com/">Benchling</a> &#8212; whose software helps lab scientists manage their biotech research &#8212; with Eric Vishria, a former entrepreneur and operator who joined Benchmark as a general partner in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/23/eric-vishria-benchmark/">2014</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Grimshaw also represented Thrive on the board of the cloud collaboration software company <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable</a> with Peter Fenton, who became the longest-serving general partner at Benchmark this year, as famed VC Bill Gurley began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/report-bill-gurley-is-stepping-away/">transitioning out</a> of an active role at the firm. (Fenton was<a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2007/05/11/peter-fenton-prominent-vc-successful-triathlete/"> poached from Accel</a> back in 2006.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1jiZu67RlR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/report-bill-gurley-is-stepping-away/">Bill Gurley is stepping away from an active role at Benchmark, 21 years after joining the firm</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bill Gurley is stepping away from an active role at Benchmark, 21 years after joining the firm&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/report-bill-gurley-is-stepping-away/embed/#?secret=1jiZu67RlR" data-secret="1jiZu67RlR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And Grimshaw has been serving on a board with Benchmark&#8217;s Sarah Tavel, who was herself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/09/benchmark-just-hired-sarah-tavel-the-first-female-general-partner-in-the-firms-history/">poached by the firm</a> in 2017, from Greylock. That company is <a href="https://supergreat.com/">Supergreat</a>, a two-year-old, New York-based site for beauty enthusiasts that&#8217;s building a community of visitors who become reviewers, who then become shoppers.</p>
<p>Supergreat is among Benchmark&#8217;s newest bets. It was announced earlier this month that Benchmark led the startup&#8217;s $6.5 million Series A round.</p>
<p>Before hiring Grimshaw, Benchmark&#8217;s newest general partner was Chetan Puttagunta, who <a href="https://abovethecrowd.com/2018/07/09/benchmarks-newest-general-partner-chetan-puttagunta/">joined the firm in 2018</a> from New Enterprise Associates, where he spent more than seven years.</p>
<p>Benchmark has done better than some firms when it comes to succession, even while many of its general partners remain involved in startups long after they move on from the firm&#8217;s day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>Firm cofounder Bruce Dunlevie, for example, joined the board of WeWork back in 2012. He&#8217;s now part of a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/legal-us-otc-wework/amid-wework-board-strife-over-softbank-suit-dissident-directors-win-access-to-skadden-discovery-idUSKBN25K2C9">lawsuit</a> alleging fellow WeWork investor SoftBank of breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, after SoftBank abandoned a tender offer to buy out earlier shareholders following WeWork&#8217;s pulled IPO last year.</p>
<p>Reportedly, Matt Cohler &#8212; a former Facebook exec who was left an active role as a general partner with Benchmark <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/10/1/17924540/matt-cohler-benchmark-mitch-lasky">in 2018 </a>after a decade with the firm &#8212; also helped Benchmark <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/benchmark-wins-deal-for-live-shopping-app-popshop-at-100-million-valuation">secure its spot</a> in summer as the lead Series A investor in Popshop Live, a live-streaming e-commerce platform. According to The Information, Cohler agreed to join the startup&#8217;s board of directors to help seal the deal.</p>
<p>In addition to Cohler and Gurley, who&#8217;ve stepped back in recent years, Mitch Lasky, who joined the firm in 2007, also stepped away from its core team in 2018.</p>
<p>Benchmark made it known this summer that it was looking to bring aboard a fifth partner, one who likely completes the firm&#8217;s roster for now. As Fenton told us in September when he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/benchmarks-peter-fenton-10-to-20-years-of-innovation-just-got-pulled-forward/">sat down</a> with us at our TechCrunch Disrupt event, Benchmark &#8220;can&#8217;t scale. When we&#8217;ve gotten above six partners, the firm doesn&#8217;t work so well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fenton talked at some length about how Benchmark views the composition of its team. We also talked about that WeWork deal. If you&#8217;re curious to learn more, you can watch that interview below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was an unprecedented year for [insert anything under the sun], and while plenty of tech verticals saw shifts that warped business models and shifted user habits, the gaming industry experienced plenty of new ideas in 2020. However, the loudest trends don&#8217;t always take hold as predicted.</p>
<p>This year, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon each leaned hard into new cloud-streaming tech that shifts game processing and computing to cloud-based servers, allowing users to play graphics-intensive content on low-powered systems or play titles without dealing with lengthy downloads.</p>
<p>It was heralded by executives as a tectonic shift for gaming, one that would democratize access to the next generation of titles. But in taking a closer look at the products built around this tech, it&#8217;s hard to see a future where any of these subscription services succeed.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Massive year-over-year changes in gaming are rare because even if a historically unique platform launches or is unveiled, it takes time for a critical mass of developers to congregate and adopt something new — and longer for users to coalesce. As a result, even in a year where major console makers launch historically powerful hardware, massive tech giants pump cash into new cloud-streaming tech and gamers log more hours collectively than ever before, it can feel like not much has shifted.</span></p>
<p>That said, the gaming industry did push boundaries in 2020, though it&#8217;s unclear where meaningful ground was gained. The most ambitious drives were toward redesigning marketplaces in the image of video streaming networks, aiming to make a more coordinated move toward driving subscription growth and moving farther away from an industry defined for decades by one-time purchases structured around single-player storylines, one dramatically shaped by internet networking and instantaneous payments infrastructure software.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Today&#8217;s products are far from dead ends for what the broader industry does with the technology.					</blockquote>
	</div>

<p>But shifting gamers farther away from one-off purchases wasn&#8217;t even the gaming industry&#8217;s most fundamental reconsideration of the year, a space reserved for a coordinated move by the world&#8217;s richest companies to upend the console wars with an invisible competitor. It&#8217;s perhaps unsurprising that the most full-featured plays in this arena are coming from the cloud services triumvirate, with Google, Microsoft and Amazon each making significant strides in recent months.</p>
<p>The driving force for this change is both the maturation of virtual desktop streaming and continued developer movement toward online cross-play between gaming platforms, a trend long resisted by legacy platform owners intent on maintaining siloed network effects that pushed gamers toward buying the same consoles that their friends owned.</p>
<p>The cross-play trend reached a fever pitch in recent years as entities like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/epic-games-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="epic-games-2">Epic Games&#8217; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Fortnite developed massive user bases that gave developers exceptional influence over the deals they struck with platform owners.</p>
<p>While a trend toward deeper cross-play planted the seeds for new corporate players in the gaming world, it has been the tech companies with the deepest pockets that have pioneered the most concerted plays to side-load a third-party candidate into the console wars.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s already clear to plenty of gamers that even in their nascent stages, cloud-gaming platforms aren&#8217;t meeting up to their hype and standalone efforts aren&#8217;t technologically stunning enough to make up for the apparent lack of selection in the content libraries.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to TechCrunch&#8217;s 2020 Holiday Gift Guide! Need help with gift ideas? We&#8217;re here to help! We&#8217;ll be rolling out gift guides from now through the end of December. </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/pages/gift-guide-2020/"><em>You can find our other guides right here.</em></a></p>
<p>For many of us, being home a lot more right now also means being online a lot more. It&#8217;s a great time to evaluate how you&#8217;re keeping your data safe — and to help others in your life do the same.</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s teaching them to use things like physical security keys or just convincing them to stop writing their passwords on sticky notes, there are LOTS of little ways to nudge your friends and family in a safer direction. We&#8217;ve put together an array of gift ideas that&#8217;ll help them keep things locked down without breaking the bank (and, if you&#8217;re the one they&#8217;d call to help clean up after a security incident, probably save you some time in the end).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Much of what we wrote for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/27/gift-guide-essential-security-and-privacy-gifts-to-help-protect-your-friends-and-family/">our 2019 guide</a> still holds true. There are some timeless security essentials that you can&#8217;t miss out on, and we&#8217;ve searched around for the best deals. But we also have a few more fun gift ideas up our sleeves for the holiday season.</p>

<h2>Timeless security essentials for your friends and family</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2085611" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085611" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2085611 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/security-essentials.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="587" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/security-essentials.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/security-essentials.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/security-essentials.jpg?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/security-essentials.jpg?resize=768,440 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/security-essentials.jpg?resize=680,390 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/security-essentials.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2085611" class="wp-caption-text">(Images from top-left clockwise: Yubico, 1Password, Amazon and Amazon)</p></div></p>
<h2 id="a-password-manager-subscription">A password manager subscription</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/25/cybersecurity-101-guide-password-manager/">Password managers</a> are a real lifesaver. One strong, unique password lets you into your entire bank of passwords. They&#8217;re great for storing your passwords and other secrets, but also for encouraging you to use better, stronger, unique passwords. And because many are cross-platform, you can bring your passwords with you. Plenty of password managers exist — from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/02/free-lastpass/">LastPass</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/mozillas-free-password-manager-firefox-lockbox-launches-on-android/">Lockbox</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/dashlane-series-d/">Dashlane</a>, to open-source versions like KeePass. Many are free, but a premium subscription often comes with benefits and better features. And if you&#8217;re a journalist, 1Password has <a href="https://1password.com/for-journalism/">a free subscription</a> just for you.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Many free; premium offerings start at $36 &#8211; $45 annually<br />
<strong>Available from:</strong> <a href="https://1password.com/sign-up/">1Password</a> | <a href="https://lastpass.com/premium/payment">LastPass</a> | <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/plans">Dashlane</a> | <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a></p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t forget about a physical two-factor key</h2>
<p>Your online accounts have everything about you and you&#8217;d want to keep them safe. A security key is a physical hardware device that offers far greater protections than a two-factor code going to your phone. A security key plugs into your USB port on your computer (or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/yubikey-dual-usb-c-lightning/">the charging port on your phone</a>) to &#8220;prove&#8221; to online services, like Facebook, Google and Twitter, that you are who you say you are. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/08/yubico-launches-a-new-nfc-security-key-and-preps-iphone-support/">YubiKeys</a> are by far our favorite and come in all shapes and sizes. The latest YubiKey 5 series has something for everyone, no matter what kind of devices they have. They&#8217;re also cheap. Google also has a range of its own branded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/14/google-titan-security-key-usb-c/">Titan security keys</a>, one of which also offers Bluetooth connectivity.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> From $25 &#8211; $55, depending on device type, from <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/compare-yubikey-5-series/">Yubico Store</a> or <a href="https://store.google.com/product/titan_security_key">Google Store</a></p>
<h2 id="a-webcam-cover-to-hide-your-modesty">A webcam cover to protect your privacy</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re all living through this pandemic together, and most of us are still working from home. If you, like me, have accidentally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/08/sorry-i-gatecrashed-your-zoom-meeting/">joined a video call by mistake</a>, you&#8217;ll be more thankful for your webcam cover than you could ever know. Webcam covers slide open when you need to access your camera, and slides to cover the lens when you don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s that easy. You can buy webcam covers from practically anywhere — just make sure you get a thin cover that supports your device so as to not damage its display when you close the lid. You can support local businesses and nonprofits — you can search for unique and interesting webcam covers on Etsy or from your favorite internet rights group.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> from $5 &#8211; $10.<br />
<strong>Available from:</strong> <a href="https://www.etsy.com/market/webcam_covers">Etsy</a> | <a href="https://supporters.eff.org/shop/laptop-camera-cover-set-ii">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a></p>
<h2 id="a-microphone-blocker">A microphone blocker to prevent hot mics (and malware)</h2>
<p>Now that you have your webcam cover, what about your microphone? Just as hackers can tap into your webcam, they can also pick up on your audio. Microphone blockers contain a semiconductor that tricks your computer or device into thinking that it&#8217;s a working microphone, when in fact it&#8217;s not able to pick up any audio. Anyone hacking into your device won&#8217;t hear a thing. Some modern Macs already come with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/apple-t2-security-chip-microphone-eavesdropping/">a new Apple T2 security chip</a> which prevents hackers from snooping on your microphone when your laptop&#8217;s lid is shut. But a microphone blocker will work all the time, even when the lid is open.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LPQJGA2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01LPQJGA2&amp;linkId=e78b907f7bb41f37fbd6a0478aa177aa">$7</a> &#8211; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V9T14N3/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07V9T14N3&amp;linkId=3b38295afe79ddde59bc38485389254d">$20</a> on Amazon</p>

<h2 id="pi-hole-to-block-pesky-ads-and-online-trackers">A Pi-hole to block pesky ads and online trackers</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2073779" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2073779" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2073779 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pi-hole.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="555" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pi-hole.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pi-hole.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pi-hole.jpg?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pi-hole.jpg?resize=768,416 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pi-hole.jpg?resize=680,369 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pi-hole.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2073779" class="wp-caption-text">(Image: Pi-hole)</p></div></p>
<p>Think of a Pi-hole as a &#8220;hardware ad-blocker.&#8221; A Pi-hole is a modified Raspberry Pi mini-computer that runs ad-blocking technology as a box that sits on your network. It means that everyone on your home network benefits from ad blocking. Online ads generate revenue for websites but are also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/apple-online-ads-private/">notorious for tracking users</a> across the web. Until ads can behave properly, a Pi-hole is a great way to capture and sinkhole bad ad traffic. The hardware may be cheap, but the ad-blocking software is free. Donations to the cause are welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> from $35.<br />

<h2 id="a-privacy-screen-for-your-computer-or-phone">Get your computer or phone a privacy screen</h2>

<p>How often have you seen someone&#8217;s private messages or documents as you look over their shoulder, or see them in the next seat over? It&#8217;s not as much of an issue when we&#8217;re all at home — but we&#8217;re also all getting pretty comfortable with having whatever on our screens right now, which might not be the best habit to develop. Privacy screens can help protect you from &#8220;visual hacking.&#8221; These screens make it near-impossible for anyone other than the device user to snoop at what you&#8217;re working on. And, you can get them for all kinds of devices and displays — including phones. But make sure you get the right size!</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> from about $17 and up, depending on display size<br />

<p><strong><span class="schedule-item__title">University Showcase — Boldly Innovating in Space, for Space (Part One)</span></strong></p>
<p>Technologies to Go Boldly in Space &#8212; For the past half century, space exploration and technology has been earth-centric. We’ve studied the earth, orbited the earth and sent images of distant places back to earth. In the coming decade, we’ll embark on a new commitment: We’re going to space to stay. We’re committing to space commerce, space habitation and space exploration in order to not just stay in space, but to extend our human footprint into this solar system. To be successful, we need bold people and new technology to build and deploy the next generation of space capabilities. We need to capture these space opportunities, avoid potential threats and deliver on the promise of a multi-planet human race. This session showcases our partners USC and MIT, as they provide insight into their space programs. They are joined by university partners UCLA, ASU and Caltech, showcasing a range of emerging space technologies. Working with the Aerospace Corporation, these emerging capabilities can be evaluated and integrated into government space-faring missions for communicating, navigating and exploring in space with NASA, NOAA and the Air Force.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announced that it is acquiring <a href="https://squadapp.io/">Squad</a> and that the team from the screen-sharing social app will be joining Twitter&#8217;s ranks. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/squad-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="squad-2">Squad&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> co-founders, CEO Esther Crawford and CTO Ethan Sutin, and the rest of the team will be coming aboard inside Twitter&#8217;s design, engineering and product departments, Twitter tells us. Crawford specifically notes that she will be leading a product in the conversations space.</p>
<p>What isn&#8217;t coming aboard is the actual Squad app, which allowed users to share their screens on mobile or desktop and simultaneously video chat, a feature that aimed to find the friend use case in screen-sharing beyond the enterprise use case of presenting. The app will be shutting down tomorrow, Twitter confirms, an unwelcome surprise for its user base largely made up of teen girls.</p>
<p>Twitter declined to share further terms of the deal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2086110" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086110" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2086110 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_rEcHcBU_Fmu7PSbh6lwJkA.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="298" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_rEcHcBU_Fmu7PSbh6lwJkA.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_rEcHcBU_Fmu7PSbh6lwJkA.png?resize=150,66 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_rEcHcBU_Fmu7PSbh6lwJkA.png?resize=300,131 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_rEcHcBU_Fmu7PSbh6lwJkA.png?resize=768,336 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_rEcHcBU_Fmu7PSbh6lwJkA.png?resize=680,298 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_rEcHcBU_Fmu7PSbh6lwJkA.png?resize=1536,673 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_rEcHcBU_Fmu7PSbh6lwJkA.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086110" class="wp-caption-text">Image via Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>The app&#8217;s functionality seems like a natural fit for the service, though the company did not confirm whether any tech was coming aboard as part of the deal. Twitter hasn&#8217;t been keen to keep separate apps functioning outside of the core Twitter app. Vine was infamously shut down, upsetting users who likely later rallied behind TikTok, a massive success story and perhaps one of the biggest missed opportunities for American social media companies. Meanwhile, Periscope which has largely bumbled along over the years, is in a particularly fragile place with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/twitter-app-code-indicates-that-live-video-broadcasting-app-periscope-may-get-shut-down/">app code emerging </a>just today that indicates an impending shutdown for the app.</p>
<p>Squad was notably partnered closely with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/snapchat" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="snapchat">Snap <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and was an early adopter of many of the company&#8217;s Snap Kit developer tools. Building so much of the app using Snap&#8217;s developer tools could have made porting the tech to Twitter&#8217;s infrastructure a more complicated task, especially when considering how often Snap Kit apps are tied quite closely to the Snapchat user graph.</p>

Squad was in the right place at the right time in early 2020. When the pandemic first struck, CEO Esther Crawford told TechCrunch that usage of her app spiked 1,100%.</p>
<p>Crawford spoke at length about the challenges of scaling a modern social app while avoiding the pitfalls of toxicity that so often seem to come with reaching new heights. In an interview with TechCrunch last year, she told us her team was “trying to learn from the best in what they did but get rid of the shit.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://esthercrawford.medium.com/squad-is-now-part-of-twitter-48dd73891f71">Medium post</a>, Crawford also took the opportunity of her startup&#8217;s exit to lobby investors to start backing more diverse founders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope that our exit will tip the scale a bit more toward convincing investors to put money into diverse teams because each success is another proof point that we, the historically under-capitalized and underestimated founders, are a good bet,&#8221; Crawford wrote in a Medium post. &#8220;Invest in women and people of color because we will make you money.&#8221;</p>
