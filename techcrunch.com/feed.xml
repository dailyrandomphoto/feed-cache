					<description><![CDATA[Sweetgreen's IPO pricing is fascinating because it fits neatly into our budding thesis regarding the value of tech-enabled companies when they go public.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sweetgreen, a fast-casual restaurant chain that attracted ample venture capital during its life as a private company, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001477815/000119312521323700/d104360ds1a.htm">set early terms for its IPO</a> this morning.</p>
<p>The well-known salad-slinger expects to sell stock in its public market debut at a range of $23 to $25 per share. Inclusive of shares reserved for its underwriting banks, Sweetgreen is worth between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion at those prices. IPO-watching group Renaissance Capital <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/88397/Looking-for-green-Salad-chain-Sweetgreen-sets-terms-for-$300-million-IPO">estimates</a> that at the midpoint of its IPO price range, Sweetgreen is worth $3.0 billion on a fully diluted basis; at the top end of its price range, Sweetgreen&#8217;s fully diluted valuation swells to $3.13 billion.</p>
<p>The prices are a win across the board for Sweetgreen, which last raised $156 million at a $1.78 billion post-money valuation, <a href="http://pitchbook.com">according to PitchBook data</a>. Its investors all stand to enjoy winsome markups on the capital they invested into the salad chain.</p>
<p>But the company&#8217;s IPO is notable for a far more interesting reason than that some already-wealthy individuals and groups are going to have more money in short order. Sweetgreen&#8217;s IPO pricing is fascinating because it fits neatly into our budding thesis regarding the value of tech-enabled companies when they go public.</p>
<h2>Upper single digits</h2>
<p>When Rent the Runway <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/rent-the-runways-ipo-pricing-indicates-bullish-market-for-unicorns-of-all-stripes/">priced its IPO</a>, it earned a revenue multiple just over the 7x mark. It has since lost ground as a public company, but still set a recent benchmark for what a tech-enabled business might be worth in a public debut. Note that the Rent multiple is not bearish; non-SaaS unicorns today can earn old-fashioned SaaS multiples, which is rather bullish, I think.</p>
<p>Allbirds was next up. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/allbirds-prices-ipo-above-range-putting-more-points-on-the-board-for-dtc-startups/">priced at $15 per share</a>, giving it what we calculated to be around a roughly 9x multiple. The company then saw its value appreciate to around $23 per share as of this morning.</p>
<p>With two upper-single-digit IPO revenue multiples for DTC companies in a row, it felt like a price range was forming. Rent declined while Allbirds rose, but their <em>IPO pricing</em> was range-setting.</p>
<p>Enter Sweetgreen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Content publishing platform <a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a> is acquiring a small startup called <a href="https://projector.com">Projector</a>. As part of the deal, the entire Projector team is joining Medium with Projector’s co-founder and CEO Trevor O&#39;Brien becoming Medium’s Chief Product Officer.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Projector, the company has been building a browser-based graphic design tool. In just a few clicks, Projector users can create graphics for social posts, such as podcast artworks, a logo for a Facebook event, an Instagram story, etc.</p>
<p>You don’t need any professional design skills to use Projector as you can also take advantage of a library of templates. You can then replace images and text to personalize them.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231276" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Some people have also been using Projector to create animated GIFs and presentations. If you want someone else to contribute, you can collaborate as a team in real-time. When you’re done, you can also share a presentation or a design with a link.</p>
<p>While Medium isn’t disclosing the terms of the acquisition, 100,000 people have used Projector and the startup had raised $23 million over three funding rounds. Upfront Ventures, Mayfield Fund, Foundry Group, Upside Partnership, Homebrew, Mantis VC and Van Wickle Ventures invested in the startup. Mark Suster and Rishi Garg served on the board of the company.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231277" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231277" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/projector_effects.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="585" class="size-full wp-image-2231277" /><p id="caption-attachment-2231277" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Medium</p></div></p>
<p>The entire Projector team of 13 is joining Medium. Projector’s co-founder and CEO Trevor O&#39;Brien, who previously led product teams at Coda, Twitter and YouTube, will become Medium’s first Chief Product Officer. The company didn’t have a CPO before today’s acquisition.</p>
<p>Projector’s co-founder and VP of Engineering Luke Millar will start a new role as Medium’s VP of Engineering.</p>
<p>“Medium will not keep Projector running as an independent product for the long-term. The focus is on the core Medium platform — leveraging Projector technologies and expertise to build world-class creator tools and reader experiences,” Trevor O&#39;Brien said.</p>
<p>“That said, Projector will continue to run through March of 2022 in order to help existing customers off-board their teams, export their work, and take their creations with them,” he added.</p>
<p>If Medium plans to take advantage of Projector’s experience, you can expect more design capabilities to customize your Medium sites, posts and newsletters. It could also lead to more real-time collaboration features.</p>
<p>Medium’s post editor have inspired many content management systems with its clean and intuitive design. Now, let’s see if Medium expands beyond words with the same design-focused approach for multimedia content.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With so much of the startup news cycle focused on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/vcs-are-racing-to-pay-more-to-get-smaller-pieces-of-less-profitable-companies/">unprecedented funding round sizes</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/bootstrapping-in-2021-goes-a-long-way/">record amounts of time bootstrapping</a>, we don&#8217;t often step back from the numbers to have a hard think about innovation. But today, that&#8217;s precisely what we are going to do.</p>
<p>The Exchange gained early access to pi Ventures&#8217; <a href="https://www.piventures.in/deeptech-shifts-2026" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deep Tech Shifts 2026 report</a>, which identifies 15 deep tech sub-sectors the firm believes will reach an inflection point by 2026.</p>
<p>The study is backed by research, but pi Ventures&#8217; founding partner Manish Singhal says its findings are also informed by conversations with entrepreneurs.</p>

<h2>Predicting 15 shifts</h2>
<p>Below are 15 sectors in which pi Ventures expects &#8220;disruptive innovation that will bring about key shifts in global businesses&#8221; in the next half-decade:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alternative protein:</strong> superfluous to vital</li>
<li><strong>Blockchain: </strong>promising to mainstream</li>
<li><strong>Brain-computer interface:</strong> measurement to insight</li>
<li><strong>Climate tech:</strong> incidental to critical</li>
<li><strong>Data privacy:</strong> identifiable to anonymous</li>
<li><strong>Energy storage</strong>: Li-Ion to alternative chemistries</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise workflows</strong>: human to human + Al</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare screening</strong>: reactive to proactive</li>
<li><strong>MLOps</strong>: in-house to managed services</li>
<li><strong>Nature co-design:</strong> materials to biomaterials</li>
<li><strong>Quantum computing:</strong> supremacy to advantage</li>
<li><strong>Robotics:</strong> automation to cognition</li>
<li><strong>Space tech &#8211; in-space:</strong> deployment to in-space management</li>
<li><strong>Space tech &#8211; launch:</strong> customization to democratization</li>
<li><strong>Synthetic Content Creation:</strong> casual to commercial</li>
</ul>
<p>First off, let&#8217;s clarify that &#8220;nature co-design&#8221; refers to biomaterials, and &#8220;synthetic content creation&#8221; is about AI-generated text, images and audio, which pi expects to escalate from casual use cases to commercial.</p>
<h2>A matter of timing</h2>
<p>Singhal told TechCrunch that the firm recently began deploying its second fund of $100 million — a significant step up from its initial fund, which invested $30 million in 15 companies based in or with a connection to India. This time around, pi&#8217;s goal is to invest into 25 early-stage startups.</p>
<p>Based in Bangalore, pi&#8217;s website boasts of &#8220;pioneering deep tech investments in India&#8221;. Not all the companies in its portfolio are based there, but they all have a strong connection with the country: ML-powered consumer trend prediction platform AI Palette is based in Singapore, with an engineering hub in Bangalore, while mental health app Wysa has offices in Bangalore, Boston and London.</p>
<p>Singhal says pi&#8217;s goal is to back companies that are &#8220;global innovators&#8221; – aiming beyond India or any single market, and leveraging deep tech. &#8220;We want to back disruptive innovation, rather than incremental innovation,&#8221; he said. On the other end of the spectrum, pi&#8217;s site notes that it doesn&#8217;t invest in &#8220;pure science or research&#8221; — it is looking for the &#8220;intersection of scalable businesses and disruptive technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Timing is key to what pi is doing, a fact that underpins the 67 pages of its new report. &#8220;If you invest too early in an innovation, then you will have sub-optimal returns,&#8221; Singhal said. &#8220;If you invest too late, you may also end up getting sub-optimal returns, because it is no longer a cutting-edge thing. If investment and the timing of innovation getting to a resonance point come together, then good things happen.&#8221;</p>
<h2>A framework for inflection points</h2>
<p>This is where pi Ventures in-house framework comes in, featuring a &#8216;demand and supply resonance map&#8217; to analyze deep tech shifts. You will see it at play in the two examples we&#8217;ll explore, but the general idea is summed up in the chart below:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230706" style="width: 2126px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230706" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2230706 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pi-Ventures-demand-and-supply-resonance-map.png" alt="pi Ventures demand and supply resonance map" width="2116" height="1180" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pi-Ventures-demand-and-supply-resonance-map.png 2116w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pi-Ventures-demand-and-supply-resonance-map.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pi-Ventures-demand-and-supply-resonance-map.png?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pi-Ventures-demand-and-supply-resonance-map.png?resize=768,428 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pi-Ventures-demand-and-supply-resonance-map.png?resize=680,379 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pi-Ventures-demand-and-supply-resonance-map.png?resize=1536,857 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pi-Ventures-demand-and-supply-resonance-map.png?resize=2048,1142 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pi-Ventures-demand-and-supply-resonance-map.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2116px) 100vw, 2116px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2230706" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <em>pi</em> Ventures</p></div></p>
<p>I found this to be a useful tool to analyze trends, and I think it could be of use for investors with different time horizons and theses, too.</p>
<p>As it previously explained in a <a href="https://www.piventures.in/blog/deeptech-investing-points-of-inflection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>, pi Ventures&#8217; area of interest is &#8220;the art of possible.&#8221; Dubbed as such by one of its limited partners, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajshah/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raj Shah</a>, that falls under zone B, and which &#8220;it is obvious to look at [ … ] for a good balance between market demand and state-of-the-art technology,&#8221; as well as zones C and E, &#8220;to account for momentum as well.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://calixa.io">Calixa</a>, the early stage startup that is building a tool specifically tuned for product-led sales cycles, announced a $12 million Series A today led by Kleiner Perkins with participation from new investors Salesforce Ventures and Twilio.</p>
<p>Product-led companies typically offer a free or open source version of the product as a way to whet the appetite of potential users, but Thomas Schiavone CEO at Calixa, a company he co-founded with CTO Fred Sadaghiani, says that the previous generation of tools wasn&#8217;t really designed to help sales teams turn those free users into sales.</p>
<p>Schiavone says that many companies understand a top-down sales motion, but when they layer on a product-led strategy, they need new tools to work alongside their current sales and marketing tools to help turn those free users into pay ones. When we last spoke to Schiavone in March, the company was announcing<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/calixa-raises-4-25m-seed-to-manage-bottom-up-sales-approach/"> a $4.25 million seed round</a>. He said at the time they were just developing the product, but over the ensuing months, it has begun to come into clearer focus.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231258" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Today, Calixa has developed into what he describes as &#8220;a workflow for high velocity sales&#8221; by directing sales to the best customers to engage with. &#8220;So it&#8217;s about prioritizing your product-qualified leads, knowing what to talk to them about and then actually engaging with them.&#8221; That comes in the form of a list of these customers with more targeting messaging.</p>
<p>&#8220;Traditionally, you&#8217;d get those marketing drip emails that are not very well targeted&#8230;Now with Calixa, you can arm reps with very tailored messaging because they can actually see what people are doing and message the customers at the right time when they&#8217;re starting starting to adopt [the product] in their journey, so it&#8217;s a much more relevant outreach,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231269" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231269" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2231269" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Calixa-Product-Image.jpg?w=680" alt="Calixa product image showing list of likely product-led customers likely to convert to paying customers." width="680" height="466" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Calixa-Product-Image.jpg 1888w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Calixa-Product-Image.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Calixa-Product-Image.jpg?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Calixa-Product-Image.jpg?resize=768,526 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Calixa-Product-Image.jpg?resize=680,466 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Calixa-Product-Image.jpg?resize=1536,1053 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Calixa-Product-Image.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2231269" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Calixa</p></div></p>
<p>Calixa grabs data from various sources including a customer&#8217;s data warehouse, Segment feed and Salesforce data, and using that information helps identify customers who are most likely to make the move to the pay product. The fact it&#8217;s using both Salesforce and Twilio Segment could help could explain the strategic investment on the part of these two companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is up to 12 employees, around double the number when we spoke to him in March for the seed round, and Schiavone hopes to reach 18 by Q1 next year. He says that being a remote first company should help him build a more diverse team.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will say one of the great things about hiring in a distributed world is it gives you access to talent, so you have less and less of an excuse to not have a diverse set of employees because it&#8217;s not like your diversity is based on how diverse the San Francisco Bay Area is or whatever city you&#8217;re based in. I can hire people from all over the world,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company was founded in early 2020 and raised over $16 million.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Netflix launched a TikTok-like &#8220;Fast Laughs&#8221; feature in its app, offering short-form funny videos that would introduce members to its comedy programs, stand-up specials and more. Now, the company is developing a similar feature for kids with a Kids Clips feature discovered inside the app and confirmed by Netflix as launching this [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, Netflix launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/netflix-launches-fast-laughs-a-tiktok-like-feed-of-funny-videos/">a TikTok-like &#8220;Fast Laughs&#8221; feature</a> in its app, offering short-form funny videos that would introduce members to its comedy programs, stand-up specials and more. Now, the company is developing a similar feature for kids with a Kids Clips feature discovered inside the app and confirmed by Netflix as launching this week.</p>
<p>The feature was discovered by developer <a href="https://twitter.com/stevemoser/status/1458082615408345096?s=21">Steve Moser,</a> and first reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-09/netflix-to-roll-out-tiktok-like-short-clip-feature-aimed-at-kids?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg</a>. Moser additionally confirmed his findings to TechCrunch, noting he found references to the addition inside the Netflix iOS app. According to the description in the app&#8217;s code, the kid&#8217;s clips feature is described as a way for younger users to watch &#8220;funny, silly, and musical short-form clips from TV shows &amp; movies.&#8221; (A prior version of the feature appeared to reference the &#8220;Clips&#8221; as &#8220;Bits,&#8221; but that has since changed.)</p>
<p>Netflix confirmed the feature to TechCrunch, noting it will roll out starting this week in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and the U.K., as well as all other English-speaking territories. It will also roll out to Spanish-speaking Latin American markets, where it&#8217;s dubbed in Spanish, and in Brazil, where it&#8217;s dubbed in Portuguese, the company said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231225" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The streamer had earlier explained its interest in short-form video content was to function more of a discovery feature that would introduce members to its catalog&#8217;s content in a &#8220;fun, fast, and intuitive&#8221; way. However, the similarities between the existing &#8220;Fast Laughs&#8221; feature for adults and the TikTok app are striking &#8212; both include a full-screen vertical video feed and engagement buttons stacked on the right side allowing users to react, share, and more. But unlike TikTok, adult users can&#8217;t comment on the content. Instead, a button allows users to add interesting titles to their Netflix list of things to watch.</p>
<p>The new Kids&#8217; Clips feature will work slightly differently, Netflix told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231263" style="width: 351px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231263" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2231263" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Row-on-Home.jpg?w=341" alt="" width="341" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Row-on-Home.jpg 3906w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Row-on-Home.jpg?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Row-on-Home.jpg?resize=151,300 151w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Row-on-Home.jpg?resize=768,1530 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Row-on-Home.jpg?resize=341,680 341w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Row-on-Home.jpg?resize=771,1536 771w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Row-on-Home.jpg?resize=1028,2048 1028w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Row-on-Home.jpg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2231263" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Netflix</p></div></p>
<p>Instead of offering a TikTok-like vertical video feed, the kid&#8217;s feature will show horizontal videos that appear in a full-screen window, not within a tab. The clips will autoplay, but parents can disable this in their settings, if they choose. The selection of clips will refresh daily, and will focus on existing shows on the service, not trailers, pulled from the full kids&#8217; catalog. However, if the kid&#8217;s profile is set to specific maturity settings, the kids&#8217; clips feature will mirror those settings, Netflix said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At launch, the feature will be limited to 10 to 20 clips and will display a countdown showing the number of clips in the upper right-hand corner of the screen.</p>
<p>A rep for Netflix said it hopes the new clips feature will help kids to discover new content as well as connect them with their favorite rewatch moments.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231264" style="width: 351px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231264" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2231264" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Home.jpg?w=341" alt="" width="341" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Home.jpg 3906w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Home.jpg?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Home.jpg?resize=151,300 151w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Home.jpg?resize=768,1530 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Home.jpg?resize=341,680 341w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Home.jpg?resize=771,1536 771w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Home.jpg?resize=1028,2048 1028w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Home.jpg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2231264" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Netflix</p></div></p>
<p>While the feature&#8217;s goal may largely be tied to catalog discovery, it&#8217;s also true that video apps like TikTok are acquiring more and more of users&#8217; time on mobile devices. Last year, one report found TikTok was being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/kids-now-spend-nearly-as-much-time-watching-tiktok-as-youtube-in-u-s-u-k-and-spain/">used nearly as much as</a> YouTube in the U.S., for example, at 80 minutes per day versus YouTube&#8217;s 85 minutes for kids ages 4 to 15.</p>
<p>The new addition isn&#8217;t the first time Netflix has borrowed ideas from social media. In earlier years, Netflix added its own &#8220;Stories&#8221; feature called Previews, which introduced users to new shows and movies.</p>
<p>The feature will only be available on iOS as it rolls out, and is still considered a &#8220;test&#8221; at this time, Netflix said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Frequency Therapeutics’ short lifetime as a company, it’s had its ups and downs. On Tuesday, during an R&amp;D event day, the company unleashed a slew of announcements that add context to the development of a flagship hearing loss drug, and propose some directions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2015, Frequency Therapeutics has focused on a regenerative medicine approach to hearing loss. The approach is centered on revamping </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5395286/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">progenitor cells</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that eventually become key sound-conducting hair cells in the cochlea. The irreversible <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hearing_loss/how_does_loud_noise_cause_hearing_loss.html">disappearance or damage of these hair cells</a> contributes to sensorineural hearing loss – the most common type of hearing loss. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, the company made several announcements regarding its FX-322 – it&#8217;s drug candidate for hearing loss. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Frequency highlighted pooled data from early trials suggesting the product has lead to clinical benefits, and suggested that a Phase 2 study&#8217;s discouraging results were due to poor study design. Then, it unveiled a new hearing loss product, and a multiple sclerosis drug program. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230912" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h3>Reforming FX-322 study design</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most cases of sensorineural hearing loss are treated with either cochlear implants, or with hearing aids. People who experience sudden hearing loss might <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4928516/">try steroid treatments,</a> b</span>ut there are no drugs approved to treat or reverse sensorineural hearing loss.</p>
<p>FX-322 got off to a good start. <a href="https://journals.lww.com/otology-neurotology/Fulltext/2021/08000/Improved_Speech_Intelligibility_in_Subjects_With.14.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One Phase 1b study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on 15 people who received the FX-322 drug and eight people who got placebo injections didn’t detect any adverse side effects. Four people who received the drug saw clinically meaningful improvement in their ability to hear specific words. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A side note: Frequency measures success of its drug based on “speech perception” rather than an ability to simply hear sounds. </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4704985/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other trials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on cochlear implants have used this endpoint, and Chief Scientific Officer Chris Loose, says that the company has “alignment” with the FDA on the utility of measuring hearing drugs this way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, these results have held up, said Carl LeBel, Frequency’s chief development officer. Unpublished durability data from five participants that have been followed over one to two years found that three subjects are still seeing statistically significant improvements, he told Tech Crunch. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That, to us, suggested some subjects are able to maintain the benefit. That benefit may last a year, it may last two years. We just have to monitor more patients that show this improvement, but it really suggests a disease modifying benefit,” said LeBel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the good news on FX-322 has been tempered. A Phase 2a clinical trial suggested the device had not shown any improvement in hearing loss compared to placebo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That study was conducted on 95 participants, half of whom received four injections of the drug, while the other half received placebos. There were limited improvements in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">both </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">groups and the company reported there was </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210323005208/en/Frequency-Therapeutics-Releases-New-Data-from-Two-FX-322-Clinical-Studies-Plans-to-Advance-Single-Dose-Regimen"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“no discernible benefit”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the drug in that trial. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shares of Frequency dropped from $36 to $7 the day the news was announced, and have </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=AOaemvJ3HMnj2pePAYNTyykE9BSPTN9XhQ:1636397015810&amp;q=frequency+therapeutics+stock+price&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRowS3w8sc9YSn9SWtOXmPU5OIKzsgvd80rySypFJLmYoOyBKX4uXj10_UNDdPycitNssuzeRaxKqUVpRaWpuYlVyqUZKQWJRaklpZkJhcrFJfkJ2crFBRlJqcCACvQ0CZiAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjPrNr2tYn0AhVql3IEHWSqA_sQ6BN6BAhKEAI&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=712&amp;dpr=2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remained well below</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> previous highs since. In response, some shareholders have filed a <a href="https://www.law.com/legalnewswire/news.php?id=2898138">class-action lawsuit</a> claiming leadership </span><a href="https://www.drugdiscoverytrends.com/frequency-therapeutics-faces-growing-legal-challenges/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">misrepresented</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> FX-322 in earnings calls, press releases, SEC filings and presentations before March 23, 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, company leadership argues that this study was tainted by bias — because patients may have underreported their own hearing ability to gain access to the trial, said LeBel. And the study didn’t adequately control for that possibility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As patients were coming in to the study, there were inconsistencies between their historical speech perception scores and the scores that they were coming into at the baseline visit of the study,” LeBel told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jason Glashow, Frequency’s senior vice president of corporate affairs, clarified that the company sees this as a “design issue” with the trial. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While there is bias in the study it’s not the fault of people who participated,” he told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the R&amp;D day, Frequency reported pooled data from three of the Phase I studies to make the case that FX-322 was showing a pattern of response, and that the Phase 2 study was an outlier. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230913" style="width: 1296px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230913" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2230913 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-5.19.27-PM.png" alt="" width="1286" height="852" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-5.19.27-PM.png 1286w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-5.19.27-PM.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-5.19.27-PM.png?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-5.19.27-PM.png?resize=768,509 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-5.19.27-PM.png?resize=680,451 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-5.19.27-PM.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1286px) 100vw, 1286px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2230913" class="wp-caption-text">Pooled data from three of Frequency Therapeutics trials on FX-322 showed a pattern of response. A Phase 2 clinical trial showed no effect compared to placebo, but leadership argues the study suffered from bias and poor design.</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear how this news may or may not impact the ongoing legal proceedings. But the experience </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">has </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">informed the construction of future studies on the FX-322 drug.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frequency has already announced the beginning of a new Phase 2b clinical trial on FX-322. This study on 124 participants included a one month “lead in” section to monitor participants’ hearing before baseline hearing is measured. The first patient was dosed in October 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will also narrow the focus on what type of hearing loss the company is targeting: these subjects will have diagnosed noise-induced or sudden sensorimotor hearing loss. It’s a fine distinction, but slightly changes the parameters of what types of hearing loss the therapy targets. (Still, noise-induced hearing loss affects between </span><a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/noise-induced-hearing-loss"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 and 40 million people per year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, per CDC estimates). </span></p>
<h3><b>A new drug candidate and MS program</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from FX-322, Frequency is, for the first time, looking to bet on more than just one product to establish itself. The company also has plans to test a new product, called FX-345, a more potent version of the small molecule in FX-322. That potency, said Loose, gives this product the ability to penetrate deeper into the cochlea. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company will be pursuing an Investigational New Drug Application IND (IND) in Q2 of next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frequency is also in the process of developing a multiple sclerosis drug  called FX-162 – another step toward one of the company’s earlier articulated goals: to focus more broadly on regenerative medicine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a presentation viewed by TechCrunch, the company does have preliminary data from mouse studies suggesting the drug has been able to help drive oligodendrocyte production. Those cells produce the fatty sheath that is degraded in patients with multiple sclerosis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the company wouldn’t disclose a timeline for upcoming studies. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Flagship Pioneering, the major investor behind Moderna, announced yet another addition to their portfolio of RNA-curious companies. Following a year of hype around mRNA, a new company, called Alltrna, will now focus on developing medicines based on Transfer RNA or tRNA.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, you’re likely familiar with the idea that messenger RNA (mRNA, the stuff used in Moderna and Pfizer’s COVID vaccines), is a set of genetic blueprints that tells the cell to assemble certain amino acids, and join them together into proteins. Think of tRNA as a n L-shaped molecule that does </span><a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Transfer-RNA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the actual work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of assembling the amino acids called for in the mRNA blueprint. Transfer RNAs perform one of the final steps our cells use to take genetic code and turn it into a functional protein in the body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alltrna’s thesis is that one tRNA could be used to treat “thousands of diseases</span><b>,” </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">as </span><a href="https://www.flagshippioneering.com/people/lovisa-afzelius"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lovisa Afzelius</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an origination partner at Flagship and co-founder of Alltrna told TechCrunch. The company has been in proto-mode for the past three years, where its team of 30 people has been developing a “platform” for tRNA therapeutic development. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230055" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s a really critical molecule,” said Afzelius. “Yet it has been, until now, completely overlooked as a modality. What we have developed is a broad tRNA platform that allows us to explore the totality of tRNA biology.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moderna and Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccines have proved to be a pretty convincing demonstration of what mRNA technology can do. But this has also been a big year for funding for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">other </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">alternative RNA projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, Flagship unveiled Laronde, a company aiming to develop 100 different endless RNA (eRNA) products and drug programs </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/flagship-pioneering-unveils-laronde-to-advance-endless-rna---a-new-class-of-programmable-medicines-capable-of-expressing-therapeutic-proteins-inside-the-body-301287088.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">within the next decade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. eRNA is a type of RNA developed specifically by Flagship, and is designed to prolong the therapeutic effects of certain medicines, or create “persistent” expression of therapeutic proteins in the body. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laronde </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/laronde-attracts-440m-in-first-external-financing-to-further-advance-endless-rna-platform-301364820.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">went on</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to raise about $440 in Series B funding this year, with investment from Flagship, as well as funds and accounts managed by T. Rowe Price, CPP investments, Fidelity Management and Research Company, Federated Hermes Kaufmann Funds, and funds and accounts managed by BlackRock. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of tRNA-based medicine is still relatively new, but it is starting to attract more attention. Three startups, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ReCode Therapeutics, Shape Therapeutics, and Tevard Biosciences, have all collectively raised $240 million to develop tRNA-based therapeutics, </span><a href="https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/drug-discovery/tRNA-therapies-help-restore-proteins/99/i34"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C&amp;EN reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in September 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alltrna’s big sell on tRNA is its potential to intervene in a huge variety of diseases. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.flagshippioneering.com/people/theonie-anastassiadis">Theonie Anastassiadis</a>, a principal at Flagship, and co-founder and chief innovation officer of Alltrna argues tRNAs have the ability to control “many aspects of translation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, certain pools of “proliferation tRNAs” are involved in cell division (and some studies have suggested that </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7781600/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">down regulating certain tRNAs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could be one way to slow cell proliferation in response to cancer). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">tRNAs can also correct issues arising from erroneous genetic code. Some genes may contain mutations that act as premature “stop” signs (called stop codons). These stop signs tell the body to stop making certain proteins, </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/stop-codon#:~:text=Premature%20stop%20codons%20are%20those,as%20truncated)%20protein%20is%20formed."><span style="font-weight: 400;">even if the protein isn’t complete</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, leading to complications. Premature stop codons are a big player in genetic disease, and could be implicated in anywhere from </span><a href="https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/drug-discovery/tRNA-therapies-help-restore-proteins/99/i34"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 percent </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK6183/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one-third</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to  of all inherited genetic disorders or cancers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea behind engineering tRNAs, says Afzelius, is that they might read those stop signs anyway, but assemble complete proteins anyway. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These actual stop codons can be the same across thousands of diseases. There is the same amino acid that needs to be resorted in all those proteins. We can actually use that same tRNA medicine across that broad range of genetic diseases,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alltrna’s approach to tRNA begins by expanding the tools needed to actually do tRNA based medicine development. Basic methodologies for expressing tRNAs, measuring their levels, modifying them and synthesizing them are currently “extremely technically challenging” says Anastassiadis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first thing we did as part of the platform was actually build these tools that are not proprietary to Alltrna,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development of this platform for tRNA therapeutics is about as specific as the company will get about its plans. So far, the company has not disclosed any partnerships, nor are they disclosing specific diseases they’re currently working on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Flagship has committed $50 million to the Alltrna – the same amount it initially supplied to LaRonde this year. In the future, Afzelius says the company will plan to pursue outside investment &#8220;when the time is right.&#8221; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Great Resignation, the pandemic-caused seismic shift in the way we work, play and live, and the boom of the creator and influencer economy has led to a surge in apps designed to serve those creators. In fact, we had a <em>very</em> long-winded discussion about it at TechCrunch just this week.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to know which apps are going to change the game and which are going to sink, but Emergence is betting big on a platform called <a href="https://www.thetalenthack.com/home">Talent Hack</a>.</p>
<p>The company is today announcing a $17 million Series A financing round, led by Emergence, with participation from existing investor Global Founders Capital.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231179" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup was founded by Alexandra Bonetti, making Talent Hack the first Latina female-led startup in the Emergence portfolio.</p>
<p>Before Talent Hack, fitness creators were stitching together a handful of platforms to run their business, from Paypal to Wix to email automation software, and more. Or, they were working for a studio or a big box gym without the freedom and flexibility to set their own course.</p>
<p>Talent Hack provides software that streamlines all of that, complete with payment processing, website design and publishing, scheduling software, email automation, and CRM.</p>
<p>This allows fitness creators to focus on their clients and their classes, rather than dealing with running their business via software.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Talent Hack says that creators that switch over to Talent Hack increase their revenue by an average of 280 percent.</p>
<p>One differentiator between Talent Hack and some of its competitors is that it doesn&#8217;t aggregate fitness creators on behalf of the customer, but rather focuses on letting the creator build out their audience with the tools they need to be successful.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building a model that doesn&#8217;t attack the creators&#8217; relationship with their clients,&#8221; said Bonetti. &#8220;We&#8217;re not building a marketplace or shopping talent around to other clients. We really protect them and our client philosophy is we never get in the way of the client/talent relationship. We really go out of our way to build that out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Talent Hack makes money by charging a processing fee for sessions booked through the platform, which is paid for by the client and not the creator. This fee ranges anywhere from three to 10 percent, and is algorithmically based on geography, spending patterns, and attendance at their classes, among other factors.</p>
<p>The startup also provides educational tools and courses to creators who are looking to grow their business. The new funding will be used to expand this program, and will also be used to build out Talent Hack Co-Spaces, which will give creators the ability to train in one-on-one sessions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest challenge we have is a very exciting market with a lot of capital, a lot of investment, both horizontally and within our vertical,&#8221; said Bonetti. &#8220;And this is a very fragmented industry and that&#8217;s the value in bringing these creators in one place. Once once we&#8217;re able to really do that, there is so much to build to serve them. But like any industry that&#8217;s starting to aggregate for the first time, that&#8217;s a hard challenge.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Good Glamm Group, the parent firm of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/amazon-backed-indian-d2c-beauty-brand-myglamm-raises-71-million/"> direct-to-consumer beauty brand MyGlamm,</a> is the latest Indian startup to join the unicorn club.</p>
<p>The Mumbai-headquartered startup has raised $150 million in its Series D financing round from Prosus Ventures and Warburg Pincus. The new round, which also saw participation from Alteria Capital and existing investors L’Occitane, Bessemer Venture Partners, Amazon, Ascent Capital and the Mankekar Family Office, values the four-year-old startup at $1.2 billion post-money.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a 12x surge in its valuation from $100 million in March this year. MyGlamm was valued at $300 million in July, when it extended and closed its Series C financing round.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231183" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>MyGlamm’s parent firm operates as a house of brands in the beauty and personal care spaces. It sells the vast majority of its products from its own website, app and over 30,000 retail touch points.</p>
<p>The firm is one of the earliest startups in India that has demonstrated success with blending content and commerce to drive sales. Its content offering, coupled with an army of over 220,000 influencers, helps customers spot new products and spur engagement.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s announcement comes at a time when MyGlamm is aggressively acquiring brands to broaden its offerings. In an interview with TechCrunch, MyGlamm co-founder and chief executive Darpan Sanghvi said the startup has spent about $270 million in equity and cash in recent months to buy a number of firms that fit with the startup&#8217;s vision.</p>
<p>MyGlamm, which last month acquired direct-to-consumer (D2C) mother and baby care brand The Moms Co for over $65 million, is finalizing talks to acquire another four brands that it expects to close by the end of this year, said Sanghvi.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The inorganic push to expand MyGlamm has proven successful for the firm, which last year acquired POPxo, a startup that has built a community around content, influencers and commerce. POPxo &#8212; founded by Priyanka Gill, who joined MyGlamm as part of the acquisition &#8212; has supercharged the larger firm&#8217;s commerce in the past one year. POPxo&#8217;s userbase, in the meantime, has ballooned to 88 million users, up from 60 million in July, said Gill in an interview.</p>

<p>Tuesday&#8217;s announcement is a major turnaround for Sanghvi, who started MyGlamm in 2017 after pivoting his previous venture. In an earlier interview, he had recalled the struggle he faced raising money for a direct-to-consumer brand, which were not as popular in the world’s second-largest internet market just five years ago. To make matters worse, MyGlamm was also among the last direct-to-consumer startups to kick off its journeys in that wave.</p>
<p>Four years is a long time in the startup world. &#8220;For years South Korea and Japan have produced large and iconic D2C brands. It&#8217;s now time India joins that club and sets new charts,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very excited to partner with the Good Glamm Group to disrupt the beauty and personal care industry and this marks our first investment in the DTC category. The Good Glamm team has paired desirable, homegrown brands with compelling content, building an incredibly engaged community and positioning them well for future growth in India and beyond,&#8221; said Ashutosh Sharma, Head of Investments India at Prosus Ventures, in a statement.</p>
<p>Naiyya Saggi, co-founder of MyGlamm, said the startup has already achieved EBIDTA break-even and the new capital will serve as a war chest as it scales. By the second half of next year, MyGlamm plans to begin its international expansion, she said in an interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fundamentally, we will be growing the growth engines we already have in place. In the offline space, we have 30,000 retail touch points of sale. How do we grow this to 100,000 points of sale in the next six months?&#8221;</p>
<p>In about two and a half years, Good Glamm Group also plans to file for an IPO.</p>
<p>&#8220;With a strong portfolio of D2C brands and proprietary content assets, the group is well positioned to scale rapidly and create a large digital-first business in the beauty and personal care space,&#8221; said Vishal Mahadevia, Managing Director and India Head at Warburg Pincus, in a statement.</p>
<p>A number of direct to consumer brands, especially in beauty and wellbeing spaces, have made significant inroads in recent years. They have a lot of credit to give to Nykaa for paving the way. The fashion commerce firm , whose IPO was subscribed over 80 times, will begin trading on local Indian exchanges on Wednesday and is expected to see over 50% bump in its final issue price.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is looking to expand its team of 33, which is currently spread across nine countries, including Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya. Having a globally distributed team, Sevey said, helps in the generation of unique insights and varying problem-solving approaches around AI.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230847" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ll also continue with more activities within Africa. This (AI) is an evolving topic, and we will get more advanced with the talks, but right now, it&#8217;s mostly an introduction to what is capable with large language models.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mantium’s AI platform, which starting today has moved from alpha to general availability beta, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">enables both technical and non-technical persons to build applications using resources of providers that include OpenAI, EleutherAI, AI21 and Cohere,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and soon to be added, Hugging Face. Together with the platform’s comprehensive documentation and API integrations, with the compatible platforms like OpenAI, users are able to mix and match capabilities on Mantium without requiring expertise in each platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The launch of the cloud-based platform is designed to make it easy and possible for users to publish live prototype applications with the click of two buttons, a capability that does not require a user to have prior coding experience. It has also integrated </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">logging and automated filtering, ensuring that users remain compliant with safety and security requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is massive potential for innovation with AI, but we need to make it easier and faster for developers and creatives to get to deployment,” said Sevey.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With Mantium, we are making it possible not only for anyone to use large language models and AI to build something, but to get to prototype faster, and share it with their communities, all while maintaining the most stringent safety and security measures,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sevey got to finally build Mantium in January this year, after he attended an OpenAI beta program where most of the participants, who were from non-technical fields, were using OpenAI resources to build products but could not share with friends or launch. The attendees&#8217; pain points inspired him to create a product that makes it easy for people to build with AI and deploy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This, he added, is the realization of his long-term dream of democratizing AI in a meaningful way &#8212; something he has wanted to do throughout involvement with machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“About 80% (of the attendees to the OpenAI program) were not technical. They had no prior coding, knowledge or experience. And they were building these really cool things. These would be things like maybe a poem generator, or some people were doing really interesting stuff with music and helping them write lyrics, all kinds of more creative focused stuff,” said Sevey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI can be used to execute various actions, including helping users generate music by parsing terabytes of data from millions of songs. It can also be used in business to do classification on text to figure out the intent, can be deployed to extract information from patient medical records and to generate synthetic data.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They had no idea how to actually share that with the rest of the world. So, we created Mantium. And one of the features that&#8217;s within Mantium is what we call one-click deploy, which essentially means that once you have your AI creation, you click two buttons and it&#8217;s live. So, you get a URL, it spins up a web application and you can interact with your creation, which you can share with your friends,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such features, he said, push the boundaries of what is possible with AI, while hastening the pace of new developments &#8212; from proof of concept to production &#8212; by eliminating barriers. This in turn ensures that users or developers have more time to fine tune and build better models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And that is a big burden lifted off, quite frankly, everyone including the technical people, who don&#8217;t want to spend hours or days to set up something like Heroku or Digital Ocean or whatever the case might be, just to share a prototype out there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re going to see the next wave of technological breakthroughs come from artists and creatives who, with the power of Mantium, can now play and build with AI.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sevey says the company is currently focused on improving its user experience with plans to make it a consumption-based business later on. However, he noted that Mantium will always have a free version “that lets people get started and lets them get their prototype out there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have client libraries (Python and JavaScript) right now. And that is certainly being used again primarily by the more technical people, but I would say the majority of the community is right &#8212; it&#8217;s about 70% creatives and the rest are more technical.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sevey said Mantium is also preparing to enter a phase where it will create impactful meaning applications beginning next year &#8212; as it moves to connect “things with AI”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So by quarter one of next year, we will have a lot more integrations with our platform so that it becomes even more of a single pane of glass so that you have your large language model, it&#8217;s generating something, or it&#8217;s classifying something and then it connects to your chatbot or to your internal accounting system,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And as we think about the future, I think this notion of connecting things with AI becomes increasingly important.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apps that let people do virtually what they would have previously had to carry out in person have seen a boom in the last 20 months of pandemic living, and one of them today is announcing a big fundraise on the back of its own strong growth. <a href="https://jackpocket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jackpocket</a>, which currently has 2.5 million active users who use its app to buy tickets to play lotteries in 10 U.S. states, has picked up $120 million in a Series D round, funding that CEO and founder Peter Sullivan said it plans to use to expand from its core business of lottery ticket sales into a wider array of mobile gaming, and to take its business to more markets both in the U.S. and further afield, both on its own and in partnership with others.</p>
<p class="p10">&#8220;We expect by the end of Q1 to be in at least five other states,&#8221; Sullivan said, adding that technology investments are also on the to-do list, by bringing in more &#8220;best practices&#8221; from the worlds of e-commerce, subscriptions and mobile wallet services, alongside exploring other forms of gaming.</p>
<p class="p10">&#8220;What a lot of people<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> don’t know about the lottery is that a percentage goes to good causes,&#8221; he said. New areas that Jackpocket wants explore include raffles, sweepstakes, bingo, social casino games. &#8220;We want to provide more fun game play and chances to win, and more ways to give back.&#8221;</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231105" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This is what Jackpocket&#8217;s expansion strategy looks like according to its most recent pitch deck:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2231186" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-6.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="376" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-6.png 2376w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-6.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-6.png?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-6.png?resize=768,425 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-6.png?resize=680,376 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-6.png?resize=1536,849 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-6.png?resize=2048,1133 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-6.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Left Lane Capital is leading the investment, with comedian Kevin Hart, Whitney Cummings, Mark Cuban and Manny Machado, among the individuals participating, alongside previous backers Greenspring Associates, The Raine Group, Anchor Capital, Gaingels, Conductive Ventures and Blue Run Ventures; and new backer Santa Barbara Venture Partners. (Jackpocket was founded in New York but also has an operation out of Santa Barbara, CA; that&#8217;s where CEO and founder Peter Sullivan is based and was speaking from when I interviewed him for this story.)</p>
<p>Sullivan said the company would not be disclosing its valuation with this round, which brings the total raised by the company to just under $200 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For some more context: Jackpocket last raised money only in February of this year, a $50 million Series C round, when it was valued at $160 million post-money, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/63994-60/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a>. But it has grown since then: its current 2.5 million active user figure is up 300% in the last eight months.</p>
<p>Sullivan said that the idea for Jackpocket came to him in part because of his father, who was, in his words, &#8220;a blue collar guy born in Brooklyn who played the state lottery in New York, but was computer illiterate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The year was 2012, and one of the big themes in the world of tech at the time was the rise of apps that were bringing previously-offline services into the digital world; another big theme was the surge of interest in mobile gaming. Putting those trends together, Sullivan saw an opportunity to build an app to order lottery tickets &#8212; something that typically required people to go into convenience stores that could be done instead from the phone.</p>
<p>&#8220;We positioned ourselves as the Uber or Instacart for lottery,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Jackpocket is part lottery ticket storefront, but also part virtualizer of the whole lottery experience. As Sullivan described it to me, people use the mobile app to order lottery tickets. At the back end, Jackpocket is doing the actual buying in advance, using proprietary software that it built to take &#8220;scans&#8221; of each ticket that the player buys. Players can see the ticket, which is watermarked by Jackpocket to keep it unique and authentic.</p>
<p>As with all kinds of other real-money online gaming, Jackpocket is built with various levers so that it complies with different regulations around age, geographical location (you have to be a resident of the state where you are playing). This includes using GPS technology to identify users&#8217; locations, but also checks to determine whether people are using VPNs, or are tied to computers via other applications. Players also need to upload identification to verify themselves and their ages.</p>
<p>The company has also made a play for being a more &#8220;responsible&#8221; player in the gambling world. It monitors user spending and doesn&#8217;t let anyone spend more than $100 per day, or whatever limit under that amount they choose to set.</p>
<p class="p10">Its business model is based on taking a 9% cut on any transactions it makes itself. That means, if you put money into the app to buy tickets, you&#8217;re charged 9%, but if you use your winnings to play, you do not. Nor are you charged to withdraw money.</p>
<p>All the same, and even with a clear market opportunity (its biggest competition at the time was the fragmented convenience store market) the startup found it very hard initially to raise money.</p>
<p class="p10">&#8220;It was considered taboo to do real money gaming at the time,&#8221; Sullivan said of his experience of knocking on doors in Sand Hill Road in the early days, one reason why the company raised relatively little (around $25 million) before this year&#8217;s Series C. &#8220;Nine years ago investors wouldn’t talk to us, but I knew lottery would hbe the key here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is the largest amount of real money gaming, largest net and lightest touch point and it works well cross-selling it to other formats.&#8221;</p>
<p>The investment tide really started to turn on the back of the success of companies like FanDuel and other real-money gaming has changed the tune for lottery, and Jackpocket, too. The company cites figures from industry group North American State and Provincial Lotteries that estimate that the total annual spend from consumers on lotteries is <a href="https://naspl.org/nasplmembers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$85.6 billion</a>. This is more than the combined spend in several other leisure categories: print and digital books (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/422595/print-book-sales-usa/#:~:text=Book%20sales%20statistics%202018&amp;text=When%20it%20comes%20to%20trade,in%20the%20same%20time%20span" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.8 billion</a>), movie tickets (<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/2018-box-office-revenue-soars-record-119m-us-hits-42b-globally-1172215/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$11.9 billion</a>), video games (<a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/rankings/top-10-countries-by-game-revenue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$31.5 billion</a>), concert tickets (<a href="https://bestclassicbands.com/2018-top-concert-tours-12-17-18/#:~:text=2018%20was%20a%20record%2Dsetting,covers%20the%20worldwide%20concert%20industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$10.4 billion</a>) and sporting events (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/194224/sports-gate-revenue-in-north-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$17.7 billion</a>).</p>
<p class="p10">&#8220;I saw my dad buy these tickets, but I never knew how big it was,&#8221; Sullivan said. And that&#8217;s not considering also the changing demographics of lottery ticket buyers, where some 70% of buyers are under the age of 45 years old. &#8220;It&#8217;s a more tech-savvy and affluent buyer,&#8221; Sullivan said, which also plays well into an app-based experience.</p>
<p class="p10">The past two years&#8217; particular set of circumstances, meanwhile, has also given a big fillip to companies like Jackpocket, with the consumers who would have previously visited their corner shops to buy items like lottery tickets spending more time at home to socially distance and avoid the spread of Covid-19, and many of those small stores that remained open switching to delivery services, or making it generally less easy to pop in to buy tickets.</p>
<p class="p6">The &#8220;cross-selling&#8221; other formats, as Sullivan describes it, will be an important area to watch. It could be about selling other kinds of lottery-style experiences, but also potentially partnering with the companies like, say instant grocery delivery startups, which are the digital extensions of the convenience stores that have been lottery&#8217;s retail bread and butter up to now, or other gaming companies. That potential is one reason to raise so much right now.</p>
<p class="p6">“Mobile gaming and lottery is experiencing an exciting and unprecedented level of growth and expansion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At Left Lane, it’s clear to us that Jackpocket is spearheading this progress and innovating at a pace never seen before in this industry,” said Harley Miller, founder and managing partner of Left Lane Capital, in a statement. “We were invigorated by the opportunity to take part in this historic moment and look forward to supporting Jackpocket’s role in this landscape.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A good thing about technology products is that they can make a particular type of service cheaper over time. We&#8217;re seeing the phenomenon play out in the corporate spend market.</p>
<p>This morning <a href="https://www.airbase.com/">Airbase</a>, one of the North American startups competing in the corporate card and expense software space, announced that it will offer a free tier of its service, and that it will return most of its transaction revenues to customers via a new set of cash-back rates on its pre-funded and charge cards.</p>
<p>Airbase users that use pre-funded Airbase cards at their company will receive 2.25% cash back, while those using charge cards will receive 1.75%, the difference due to the capital cost of offering credit.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231145" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>So what?</h2>
<p>The corporate spend market has grown quickly, leading to ample venture capital and customer interest.</p>
<p>Broadly, there have been two models in play: Free services, and those that charge. Ramp, Divvy and Brex historically offered their services for free, making money instead via interchange, or transaction revenues. Airbase took a different tack, charging for its expense and spend management software, making it more like a traditional SaaS company.</p>
<p>Over time, the two models have blurred, with Brex offering paid software and, starting today, Airbase offering a free version of its product for smaller customers. Airbase&#8217;s aggressive posture is notable for its now offering a no-cost version of its software and opening its veins by giving even free customers its interchange incomes as cash back. The company is effectively repricing free corporate spend products lower by not keeping a good-sized chunk of interchange revenues for itself.</p>
<p>More simply, Airbase is working to eliminate the margin its competitors earn by giving it back to customers, betting that its customers&#8217; graduation rate from its free service to its paid tier will make up for what it is giving away.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This could put Ramp and Brex in a modest pickle — their cost advantage is under attack by a historically more expensive competitor that is now offering its free customers all the interchange revenue that the competing two startups have long lived off.</p>
<p>The Amazon riff about margins and opportunities comes to mind here.</p>
<p>Not that TechCrunch expects Ramp or Brex to take this Airbase move lying down. They will not. Each has oceans of capital as well as venture backers that have shown a sharp willingness to provide them with more financial firepower. But it matters that Airbase is scorched-earthing interchange revenues by giving the money back to end-users. It makes it cheaper — to the point of negative cost — to use modern corporate spend services. That should help with customer acquisition.</p>
<p>TechCrunch chatted with Airbase CEO Thejo Kote about the product news, curious how much marketing effort his company was going to put into its new, free product, called Essentials. Kote said that there is a big push coming, implying that Airbase doesn&#8217;t merely want to attract a few smaller companies to its free product to later convert. It wants to get lots of them, and that, naturally, will bring it into closer competition with Ramp and Brex, which have historically focused on smaller companies.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more to the corporate spend market than just business model dynamics and fundraising. Airbase <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/airbase-adds-spend-support-for-international-subsidiaries/">expanded support</a> for international corporate subsidiaries this September, for example, and the results of that product work will be found in customer up-sell rates from free to paid versions of the company&#8217;s software, which it reckons can take a company from inception to an eventual IPO.</p>
<p>But with three American corporate spend startups bashing one another over the head with capital — Airbase<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/airbase-raises-60m-as-the-corporate-spend-market-segments-matures/"> raised $60 million in a round led by Menlo</a> rather recently, Brex is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/brex-raises-300m-at-a-12-3b-valuation/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">raising $300 million more at a $12.3 billion valuation</a>, and Ramp <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/ramp-financial-series-c--d4f66d47">raised $300 million just a few months ago</a> — it&#8217;s fun to see where they are finding market space to undercut one another, to the benefit of customers who keep getting more for less.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how Brex and Ramp respond, and if Airbase actually does manage to preclude interchange fees as a spend software monetization technique by simply deciding to give them back to users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.blockrenovation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Block Renovation</a> wants to be a part of every home renovation in America after raising $50 million in Series C funding led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2.</p>
<p>The New York-based company is carving out its piece of the <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/home-remodeling-is-a-450-billion-market-and-its-only-going-to-get-bigger-2019-03-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$450 billion U.S. home renovation market</a> with its homeowner and contractor tool to digitize and simplify the home renovation experience, which is definitely an experience if you’ve ever tried even the simplest of changes to your home.</p>
<p>Block Renovation co-founder Koda Wang told TechCrunch that <a href="https://money.com/millennials-shaping-housing-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half of all homebuyers are now under the age of 36</a> and that 87% of them hire a professional for their renovation versus trying to tackle some of the projects themselves.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230935" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The current status of home renovation is abysmal,” he added. “Homeowners hire two guys and a van and pray because they don’t know what the project will look like, how much it will cost or how long it will take.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Wall Street needs to relax, as startups show remote work is here to stay&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/wall-street-needs-to-relax-because-remote-work-is-here-to-stay/embed/#?secret=RsxUv6OHPc" data-secret="RsxUv6OHPc" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>After studying the contractor side, the company found it wasn’t much better: Most contractors enjoy the work they are doing, but also have to be small business owners, which means knowing how to do sales, marketing, billing and procurement, which they have to start from scratch with each project, Wang said.</p>
<p>As people’s expectations for consumer experiences are higher than before, Block Renovation “productizes” home renovation by packaging everything together for both the homeowner and contractor, then providing a way for the contractor and homeowner to communicate with each other at every step of the project. The contractor can even take photos of each step of the project and provide a progress update so the homeowner can see how it is going.</p>
<p>In addition, homeowners don’t often have the data of how much it costs for renovation, especially if they decide to move something like a light, or add a wall, Wang said.</p>
<p>“We’ve taken that on for them by accumulating data points and giving them an estimate within 5% to 10% accuracy,” he added.</p>
<p>Joining SoftBank in the round are existing investors Giant Ventures, NEA, Morningside and Lerer Hippeau. Other investors in the round included Obvious Ventures, Rainfall Ventures, Firstminute Capital, BoxGroup, SV Angel and a group of individual investors, including interior designer Kelly Wearstler, designer Ann Sacks, Opendoor co-founder and CEO Eric Wu, Angi CEO Oisin Hanrahan and Zillow co-founder Spencer Rascoff.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The latest investment gives the company a total of $104 million in venture funding since the company was founded by Wang and Luke Sherwin in 2018.</p>
<p>Things are moving fast for Block Renovation, with the company “doubling and tripling” its growth metrics over the past year, Wang said. The latest round comes just four months after the company announced a <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/block-renovation-secures-40-million-140000761.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$40 million Series B round</a>, led by Giant Ventures, added Los Angeles to its list of markets and rolled out its kitchen remodeling feature — it started with bathrooms — as well as ​​free software, services and data for contractors.</p>
<p>Wang said the Series C round was not something the company had actively sought out, but the company was eager to work with Lydia Jett, partner at SoftBank Investment Advisors, who had previously invested in Coupang and Flipkart, and whom Forbes described as having the “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/03/15/rose-park-softbank-big-winners-in-coupang-ipo/?sh=1ac125c64e24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest cash-returning position for a woman startup investor</a>.”</p>
<p>“The rise of working from home has sparked an increased interest in home improvement projects but many customers are put off by the complexity and cost. “Jett said in a written statement. “Block Renovation is reimagining this process with a simplified and transparent digital platform that spans from planning to build. We are delighted to be partnering with Koda and Luke to support them in making home renovations more predictable and accessible.”</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Lyft and Motional, the Aptiv-Hyundai joint venture aimed at commercializing autonomous driving technology, have announced plans to launch their first fully driverless ride-hail service in Las Vegas in 2023. The news follows multiple years of collaboration, both between the two companies and within the City of Sin.</p>
<p>By the second half of next year, Motional and Lyft aim to be transporting public passengers, who will be able to book rides through the Lyft app, in Motional&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/hyundai-ioniq-5-will-be-motional-and-lyfts-first-robotaxi/">electric Hyundai IONIQ 5-based robotaxis</a> before scaling up to a full commercial launch where Lyft is allowed to charge for rides in 2023.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not surprising to see Motional and Lyft choose Las Vegas as the first city in which to launch a driverless service, but it is a major milestone for the companies as they work towards their shared goal of commercializing autonomous ride-hail. The two have had a relationship with each other  since 2018, when Lyft and Aptiv launched a one-week program in Las Vegas to test a robotaxi service during CES. In November last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/motional-gets-approval-to-test-fully-driverless-vehicles-in-las-vegas/">Nevada gave Motional approval to test its autonomous vehicles</a> without a human safety driver, and just two months ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/motional-expands-operations-in-las-vegas-ahead-of-2023-robotaxi-launch/">Motional announced it would expand its operations and employee headcount in Las Vegas</a> and triple the size of its testing facility.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230971" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In other words, all signs had been pointing to Tuesday&#8217;s announcement for some time. Now, the industry will be keeping an eye out for expansion into more cities. Motional had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/motional-and-lyft-target-2023-to-deploy-driverless-robotaxi-services-in-major-u-s-cities/">previously targeted 2023 for commercial launch in major U.S. cities,</a> and this summer, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/motional-to-begin-testing-autonomous-vehicles-in-la-as-part-of-california-expansion-plan/">it announced plans to expand its presence in California</a> with a new Los Angeles operations facility that would support testing on public roads.</p>
<p>Motional isn&#8217;t sharing the exact number of vehicles it will launch with Lyft in Las Vegas at this time, and said it would share additional details on the operational design domain, which would stipulate the conditions under which Motional&#8217;s AVs could safely operate, closer to launch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The beauty of the agreement with Lyft is that it has the potential to scale widely – we could reach millions of Lyft riders,&#8221; a spokesperson for Motional told TechCrunch, also noting that the company would share more information about plans to launch in other cities &#8220;in the future.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>The initial phase of non-commercial driverless deployment, which will begin in 2022, will allow the companies to fine-tune their autonomous offering by collecting rider feedback and improving upon user experience ahead of commercial launch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Other autonomous vehicle companies are getting close to launching commercial driverless operations, as well. Just last week, self-driving GM subsidiary <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/cruise-launches-driverless-robotaxi-service-for-employees-in-san-francisco/">Cruise launched a driverless robotaxi service in San Francisco</a> for employees and certain members of the public. The company also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/05/gm-backed-cruise-seeks-final-approval-for-robotaxis-in-san-francisco.html">applied for a permit from the California Public Utilities Commission</a> for final approval to charge for ride-hail services. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/cruise-lays-out-its-plan-for-how-it-will-make-robotaxis-a-reality/">Cruise has big plans for scaling up its operations</a>, which are all vertically integrated, to the point of having thousands of purpose-built Origin AVs on the road over the next few years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Launch services provider <a href="https://spaceflight.com/">Spaceflight Inc.</a> said Tuesday it will deploy customer spacecraft to two distinct orbits for the first time, as the company seeks to expand the capabilities of its Sherpa line of orbital transfer vehicles.</p>
<p>Orbital transfer vehicles (OTV) have become a popular way for satellites to reach their final destinations in orbit, allowing smaller space companies to forego the cost and mass of having their own propulsion system while also splitting the cost of an OTV – similar to how SpaceX lets companies split the cost of launch under its rideshare mission program.</p>
<p>Seattle-based Spaceflight aims to execute the maneuver using a new type of Sherpa space tug outfitted with a chemical propulsion system. It is calling the new vehicle the Sherpa-LTC1, and it marks the third type of Sherpa OTV that the company has debuted in the last twelve months. Spaceflight also developed a Sherpa tug equipped with an electric propulsion system, which it calls the Sherpa-LTE, that flew on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/spacex-delivers-88-satellites-to-orbit-lands-first-stage-onshore-for-first-time-in-2021/">SpaceX Transporter-2</a> mission in June, and a Sherpa-LT it debuted in 2020.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230818" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Sherpa-LTC1 will head to space next year, aboard the SpaceX Transporter-3 launch that’s scheduled to depart from Florida’s Cape Canaveral in January. The space tug will put a collective 13 customer spacecraft into two separate orbits. First, the Sherpa OTV will deploy nine smallsat payloads before maneuvering to a lower altitude to deploy the remaining four cubesats.</p>
<p>Customers for the mission include Capella Space, Umbra Space, Lynk Global, Inc., Kleos Space, NASA, Czech Aerospace Research Centre in partnership with Spacemanic, Space Products and Innovation (SPiN), and Portland State Aerospace Society.</p>
<p>The new space tug uses a “green” propulsion system developed by Benchmark Space Systems, which the company says will enable rapid orbital transfer for many different sized spacecrafts. According to Grant Bonin, SVP of business development at Spaceflight, &#8220;maneuvers in LEO are just the beginning. These capabilities and services will play a crucial role in accessing other orbits beyond LEO and developing in-space transportation and various mission services.&#8221;</p>
<p>In September, Spaceflight announced it would debut yet another Sherpa vehicle, the Sherpa-ES, on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/spaceflight-will-be-ferrying-payloads-from-orbit-fab-geojump-to-lunar-orbit-next-year/">a lunar flyby mission next year. </a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Qualcomm today launched a new developer platform for building head-worn augmented reality experiences: the Snapdragon Spaces XR Developer Platform. The only supported hardware for the platform is currently Lenovo&#8217;s ThinkReality A3 smart glasses (paired with a Motorola phone), but it will expand to include hardware from Oppo and Xiaomi in the first half of 2022.</p>
<p>To build out the software ecosystem, Qualcomm lined up a wide range of partners, including Epic Games&#8217;s Unreal Engine, Niantic&#8217;s Lightship platform, Unity, Viacom CBS and others. Deutsche Telekom and T-Mobile U.S. are also partnering with Qualcomm to support startups that use Snapdragon Spaces through the <a href="https://www.hubraum.com/">hubraum</a> program.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230185" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qualcomm_spaces.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230185" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2230185" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qualcomm_spaces.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2230185" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Qualcomm</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230182" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For now, only a small number of developers will have access to the program. These currently include the likes of Felix &amp; Paul Studios, holo|one, Overlay, Scope AR, TRIPP, Tiny Rebel Games, NZXR, forwARdgame, Resolution Games and TriggerGlobal. It plans to make the platform generally available in the spring of next year.</p>
<p>The company also today announced that it has acquired &#8220;the team and certain technology assets from HINS SAS and its wholly owned subsidiary, <a href="https://clayair.io/">Clay AIR</a>, Inc.&#8221; for its hand tracking and gesture recognition solutions. This is in addition to Qualcomm&#8217;s acquisition of Wikitude in 2019, another move that helped it jumpstart its AR efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dating back to 2007, we had R&amp;D programs, looking into augmented reality with algorithms like VIO [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_odometry">visual-inertial odometry</a>] on smartphones,&#8221; said Hugo Swart, Qualcomm&#8217;s vice president and GM of XR, in a press briefing ahead of today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;We enabled, through the last decade, devices like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/an-ar-glasses-pioneer-collapses/">ODG</a>. In 2014, we created new chips dedicated to virtual reality and augmented reality &#8212; and we are here for the long run. We know that we&#8217;re not there &#8212; it&#8217;s still going to require investment until we get to the holy grail of AR glasses that can do both fully immersive and augmented experiences.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230220" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qualcomm_spaces_partners.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230220" class="size-full wp-image-2230220" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qualcomm_spaces_partners.jpg" alt="" width="1024" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2230220" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Qualcomm</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today&#8217;s platform is able to support features like local anchors and persistence, hand tracking, object recognition and tracking, plane detection, occlusion spatial mapping and meshing.</p>
<p>With this platform, Qualcomm wants to lower the barriers for developers to build AR experiences. They will get access to documentation, sample code, tutorial and additional tooling to quickly build basic AR applications. To further help companies who want to build for this ecosystem, Qualcomm is also opening up an additional program, dubbed Pathfinder. With this, they will get early access software tools and hardware development kits, additional funding for their projects and co-marketing and promotion from Qualcomm.</p>

Its new valuation makes Socure the highest-valued private company in the identity verification space, according to the company.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.baincapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bain Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.tigerglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiger Global</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> joined the round as new investors. Existing investors</span><a href="https://commerce.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Commerce Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.scalevp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Scale Venture Partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.sorensoncapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sorenson Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also participated. The round brings its total funding raised to $646 million since it was founded in 2012.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230878" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Socure’s identity resolution engine uses predictive analytics to parse over 8 billion records, providing a multi-dimensional picture of a consumer’s identity for fraud detection purposes, even for hard-to-identify populations, including those who are Gen Z, credit-invisible or new to the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Socure’s customer base includes 12 of the top 15 banks and a roster of fintech companies, online gaming providers and crypto exchanges &#8212; Voyager, Public, Stash and DraftKings, to name a few. Socure CEO Johnny Ayers told TechCrunch that about 35% of its customers today are not in the financial services sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use the funds in two ways &#8212; to execute on its mission to “verify 100% of good identities and completely eliminate identity fraud” and to increase its investments “across the entire identity verification lifecycle,” further developing proofing and authentication processes, per Ayers. Ayers anticipates seeing rapid growth in Socure’s online gaming, cryptocurrency and e-commerce marketplace clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that the company is also expanding its partnerships with state and federal government actors to help them invest in digital identity technology </span><a href="https://www.socure.com/about/press-release/socure-names-digital-identity-leader-matt-thompson-as-general-manager-of-public-sector-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">after hiring a new head of its public sector business last month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One such use case for Socure is verifying identities to prevent unemployment fraud, cases of which cost the U.S. a total of </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/06/12/the-most-brazen-400-billion-unemployment-funds-heist-in-history/?sh=7720f3302020" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$400 billion in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fundraise comes on the heels of rapid growth in the identity verification space as companies conduct more and more business online, driving demand for more robust security and fraud prevention solutions. The tailwind of digitization helped Socure grow from approximately 350 customers served in March, mostly concentrated in financial services, to nearly 1,000 today across a wider range of industries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron Webster, chief risk officer of Socure client SoFi, explained his view on what differentiates Socure from its competitors in a written statement to TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most players in the space have created point solutions to solve one aspect of digital identity – name, address, device, email, or phone number – but lack the data science insights of Socure’s Sigma+ score that definitively and reliably answers two questions using their multivariate data: ‘Is the applicant a real person? Is the applicant who they say they are?’” Webster wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Ayers confirmed that Socure is considering going public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to be in a position where in 2023, we have all of our ducks in a row,” Ayers said of the IPO preparation process. “We will certainly come to market here in the not-too-distant future.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Richard Socher, former chief scientist at Salesforce, and his co-founders at <a href="http://you.com">You.com</a> have been on a mission over the last year to build a different type of search engine, and today the company is releasing a public beta, while announcing a hefty $20 million seed investment.</p>
<p>The new search engine doesn&#8217;t use a scrolling vertical set of results as you see on every search engine out there. Socher and team wanted to throw out assumptions and come up with something entirely new.</p>
<p>&#8220;The design actually took a lot of iterations. and we tried to have a beginner&#8217;s mindset and tried to really innovate with search. In some ways it&#8217;s crazy, but the main idea of a vertical list is now getting more and more interspersed and cluttered with other things [like ads] and hasn&#8217;t changed in 20 years,&#8221; Socher told me.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231138" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>They went to work to change that and came up with something completely different. For starters the search results page is linked to different apps such as Medium, Yelp and Reddit. You can customize the importance of those apps, or you can choose to not use a particular one at all, as you wish.</p>
<p>The results appear in categories by app along with a web results category, and you scroll left to right to see results in a particular app or category. What&#8217;s more, you can see the results such as video or a code snippet without actually opening a fresh tab, saving time and keystrokes while reducing tab overload.</p>
<p>If you like a certain set of results better, you can move them up in the results, and You.com will remember that in the future and present you the results you like better next time.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231163" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231163" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2231163" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ThanksgivingSideDishes-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Thanksgiving side dishes search in you.com.

Photo credit: You.com</p></div></p>
<p>Socher says that the founders chose the name because it&#8217;s about what you as a user need from the search engine. &#8220;We are true to our name. It&#8217;s about you. So you actually can choose here and say &#8216;I want to see more Reddit or I want to see less Reddit,'&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>If it doesn&#8217;t make sense to display results from Reddit, like when you&#8217;re looking for a Thai restaurant near you, it will display Yelp results at the top instead. If you don&#8217;t like Yelp results, it can simply display web results, but this ability to customize gives you a lot of flexibility and control over the results you see.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re worried about this level of customization making the results too one dimensional, especially when choosing news sources, the items you don&#8217;t want to see displayed prominently don&#8217;t disappear, they simply move down the list of results. If you don&#8217;t care about the customization features, you can let the search engine display the results for you.</p>
<p>For starters, they are focusing on developers and privacy aware users. They had considered shopping as a primary use case, but in testing they found when they linked to retailer product catalogues, alpha users thought results were ads when they were actually pages from a catalogue. They decided to move onto other use cases.</p>
<p>Developers can search for things like code snippets. They are able to quickly scroll horizontally through the set of snippets, find something, copy and paste it, and be done much faster than in Google or even a privacy-focused search engine like DuckDuckGo.</p>
<p>For people concerned about privacy, you can go into what Socher calls true Incognito mode where everything about you including your IP address is hidden. The search engine is designed to make it simple to move in and out of Incognito mode, so if you need your location turned on to find a restaurant, you can turn off privacy mode, then quickly turn it back on.</p>
<p>In terms of monetization, the company vows never to sell your data to a third party, but for now they are simply trying to get the design down and grow the user base. Socher says the company will concentrate on monetization later. There will probably be ads at some point, he says, but without connecting the query to a user, and without cluttering the results.</p>
<p>As an example, if you search for air purifier you may get an ad for that, but the company displaying that ad won&#8217;t have direct access to data about you, as is the case now with most online ads. The devil will be in the details here, of course, but this is how Socher is describing it.</p>
<p>The company also announced a $20 million Seed investment led by Time Ventures, his former boss, Marc Benioff&#8217;s private venture fund, with participation from Breyer Capital, Sound Ventures, Day One Ventures and a long list of industry angels.</p>
<p>Up until today the search engine has been in private beta with a couple of thousand users, but starting today anyone can try it. If you&#8217;re using Chrome, you can download the extension.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online stock trading platform Robinhood has confirmed it was hacked last week with more than five million customer email addresses and two million customer names were taken, as well as a much smaller set of more specific customer data.</p>
<p>The company said in <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/11/8/data-security-incident">a blog post</a> that a malicious hacker had socially engineered a customer service representative over the phone November 3 to get access to customer support systems. That allowed the hacker to obtain customer names and email addresses, but also the additional full names, dates of birth and ZIP code of 310 customers.</p>
<p>Robinhood said that 10 customers had &#8220;more extensive account details revealed.&#8221; Robinhood did not say what information specifically, though no Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, or debit card numbers were exposed and caused no immediate financial loss to customers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231152" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But it&#8217;s precisely that kind of information that malicious hackers can use to facilitate further attacks against victims, like targeted phishing emails, since names and dates of birth can often be used to verify a person&#8217;s identity.</p>
<p>The company said once it secured its systems the hacker then &#8220;demanded an extortion payment.&#8221; Robinhood instead notified law enforcement and security firm Mandiant to investigate the breach.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a similar breach to how Twitter was hacked in July 2020. A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/decrypted-teenager-twitter-hacker-garmin-ransomware/">then-teenage hacker</a> used social engineering techniques to trick some of Twitter&#8217;s employees into thinking the hacker was an employee, allowing the hacker access to an internal Twitter &#8220;admin&#8221; tool, which he used to hijack high-profile accounts and spread a cryptocurrency scam. The attack netted the hacker just over $100,000 in cryptocurrency. In its aftermath, Twitter rolled out security keys to its staff to toughen its defenses against attacks that prevent these kinds of attacks from working in the future.</p>
<p>Whatever lacking security controls that allowed a hacker to trick a Robinhood customer service representative into granting them access to an internal system is a likely focus for its investigation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.truveta.com/">Truveta</a> wants to collect privacy-safe medical data from around the United States on a regular basis, making it available for researchers to sift and parse. The company is making real progress towards that goal in product terms, and this morning said it raised another $100 million, giving it a capital base of around $200 million in total.</p>
<p>But the financial aspect, and the fact that Truveta has secured more partners in the medical world to supply it with information, are ancillary to the fact that the startup has started to make its platform available to external parties.</p>
<p>Truveta partners with around 20 medical providers, aggregating regular de-identified data from 42 American states and myriad patients into its collection. From there it has built a software service that allows researchers and other users to ask questions of the collected data. TechCrunch was given a tour of the Truveta product, which, as chart nerds, we liked.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231125" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But frankly, your local technology writer is not precisely the Truveta end-user. Instead, the product is aimed at individuals with their hands in the public health domain. To that end, the company&#8217;s product lets researchers include and exclude elements of the population, before dropping the user into a Jupyter Notebook, from where they can build a dashboard with data that updates daily.</p>
<p>Truveta has eyes on 16% of all clinical care in the United States, per CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/tmyerson">Terry Myerson</a>, who formerly worked with Microsoft.</p>
<p>The company shared a grip of COVID-19 related material this morning that it has gleaned from its own product. It turns out that &#8220;adverse events&#8221; happen to fewer than 1% of folks with a full COVID-19 vaccine, with Moderna patients showing 40% more than those who received Pfizer. Given that I am a Moderna Man and my spouse is Team Pfizer, I was amused by that latter stat. Perhaps I&#8217;ll mix-and-match my booster?</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YGP66G0M2v"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/20/can-data-fix-healthcare/">Can data fix healthcare?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Can data fix healthcare?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/20/can-data-fix-healthcare/embed/#?secret=YGP66G0M2v" data-secret="YGP66G0M2v" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Truveta is more interesting for its long-term potential than for what it has managed to learn thus far, in my view. It&#8217;s good news for our country that the company is starting to open up access to external parties, and has a product that can ingest mountains of data and share it in a privacy-safe manner. Our healthcare system is expensive, siloed, antiquated, and rife with inefficiencies. Truveta could make things a bit more open and, if we are lucky, clear.</p>
<p>What will prove interesting from this juncture is how Truveta converts itself from an interesting — and now operating — project into a business. It has a pretty firm anti-advertising stance, saying in its self-description that its service is &#8220;licensed for ethical medical research [and] not to target advertising to patients or physicians.&#8221; Fair enough, but do researchers have the coin to make the project work? Perhaps Truveta will sell its service back to its data providers, each contributing both data and regular fees to the company?</p>
<p>Truveta notes in its self-produced bio that it pays taxes. Hence, it isn&#8217;t a non-profit. That means at least an attempt at future profitability, which will keep our business model questions at the front of our minds. But with $100 million in new capital, Truveta is hardly about to run short on cash.</p>
<p>All told, Truveta has rapidly scaled its partner base and tech stack to the point of market viability. Let&#8217;s see what demand is attracted, and how quickly positive health <em>and</em> business outcomes can be ascertained.</p>
