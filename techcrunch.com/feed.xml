										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today’s the big day! After months of toiling away in roundups, Actuator is finally graduating to your inbox as the latest addition to the TechCrunch newsletter family. I’ve written 40 of these things since our quiet, pre-name test launch back in February (we called ourselves “Robotics Roundup” for a few unfortunate months there). You can check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/actuator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the full backlog here</a>, and if you’re still reading this through TechCrunch.com, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be sure to sign up here</a>.</p>
<p>Seeing as how we’re nearing the end of another very weird year, I plan to spend the next couple of weeks exploring 2021’s biggest robotics trends. Think about it like Spotify Wrapped, only instead of an embarrassing number of Steely Dan songs (<a href="https://twitter.com/bheater/status/1466067473577431042" target="_blank" rel="noopener">definitely not talking about myself here</a>), we’ll take a look at the trends in automation, AI, research and investment that defined the last 12 months. And in doing so, we should get a better picture of the world we&#8217;re heading into.</p>
<p>I’ve been threatening to launch a robotics newsletter at TC for a number of years now &#8212; probably dating back nearly as far as our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/sessions-robotics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first big robotics event in Boston, way back in 2017</a>. It’s been a rich vein for some time, but honestly, I don’t think we could have picked a better moment to launch this thing than right now.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241795" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As we stare down the two-year anniversary of a global pandemic, it’s clear that for many of us there may not be a “normal” to return to &#8212; for better or worse. For those in the robotics industry, this is the first glimpse into something big, bold and exciting. Maybe it&#8217;s overly optimistic to imply that we might emerge from this to something better (and believe me, the last 21 or so months have sucked deeply on a personal level), but it&#8217;s undeniably time to rethink the way we do just about everything. Logistics, healthcare, restaurants, agriculture, retail &#8212; all of these categories are set to be fundamentally transformed by COVID-19. And robotics has an important role in that transformation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been nearly two years, and countless industries are still under tremendous strain to fill positions. Those who have previously considered full automation a distant pipe dream are looking far more aggressively into these solutions, and as a result, we’ve seen a tremendous uptick in investments across a broad range of categories. Concepts that VCs would have traditionally balked at as too far afield have found their way to the tops of term sheets across the world.</p>
<p>I’ve been writing about technology professionally for a long time now, and for the first time, I’m hearing people talk seriously about robotic ubiquity in the present tense. Just before Thanksgiving, I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/cmus-new-robotics-institute-director-on-the-future-of-robot-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke with Matthew Johnson-Roberson</a>, who had just been appointed the head of Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute. He told me:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re really at this inflection point when it comes to big, deployed robotic field systems out there in the world. One day, I want it to be that you look out your window, wherever you are in the U.S. and the world, and you see a robot doing something useful.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We’re not quite there yet, obviously. But I do fundamentally believe that we’re a lot closer to that goal than we were in, say, January 2020. Part of our job here going forward is discussing how we get there. We should also be taking the opportunity to discuss the consequences of getting there. What all of this means for things like jobs, quality of life and the environment, for example. And, not to put too fine a point on it, how to ensure that robotics continues to serve us and not the other way around.</p>
<p>Committing to an indefinitely weekly newsletter is something that felt a bit daunting at first blush. But having done it every week for a while now, one thing’s for certain: We won’t be running out of things to discuss any time soon.</p>

<p>Heck, I may have taken the week off (happy belated Thanksgiving to those who celebrate), but robotics didn’t. My buddy Frederic is in beautiful Las Vegas, Nevada this week for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/aws-reinvent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS’s re:Invent conference</a>. Amazon kicked off the show with the launch of a robotics fleet management program. The problem <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/aws-launches-new-robotics-programs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RoboRunner is attempting</a> to solve is one we’ve seen various startups take on. Specifically, how do companies get different brands of robotics systems to play nicely together?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s AWS CTO Werner Vogels:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, there are only a few successful commercial robotics companies, and there are a few big reasons for this. First, finding a fit in the robotics product market is difficult because real-world environments are dynamic and unpredictable, so pairing the right niche with the right capabilities can be a challenge. Second, building robots with a high degree of autonomy and intelligence requires multidisciplinary skills that are hard to find and recruit for. Third, robotics is capital intensive and requires large up-front investment in sensors, actuators, and mechanical hardware even when they’re already commercially available.</p></blockquote>
<p>Can Amazon gobble up industrial robotics fleet management the way it has…well, everything else, basically? The company certainly has the infrastructure and resources to take the disjointed category on. It also now has a foot in the world of early-stage robotics startups, courtesy of <a href="https://www.massrobotics.org/project/awsroboticsaccelerator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new partnership with MassRobotics</a>. Amazon is teaming up with the Boston-based tech hub to launch a new robotics accelerator specifically focused on AWS applications.</p>

<p>Autonomous delivery company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/nuro-lands-investment-from-google-tiger-global-in-new-600-million-round/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nuro just announced another massive raise</a>. This latest $600 million round was led by Tiger Global Management (because, of course). It brings the company’s valuation to a whopping $8.6 billion. As for where that funding is going, co-founder Dave Ferguson told TechCrunch, &#8220;With the boost of this new funding, we’re turning our focus to commercializing and scaling the production of our third-generation vehicle at our new facility in Southern Nevada.&#8221;</p>

<p>When we talk about the dirty jobs that automation could one day replace, cleaning public toilets is no doubt near the top of the list. Michael Levy, the CEO of Somatic, dropped me a line to note that the company’s robot has reached a new milestone in automatous bathroom scrubbing, as evidenced by the below video:</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z96Qe8xTCZQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The company, which effectively came out of stealth at our robotics event last year, has designed a system capable of riding in an elevator, opening doors and scrubbing down bathrooms.</p>
<p>As Levy told me last year, “The reason bathrooms are such a good application is because everything is bolted down to the floor. Things move in a predictable way. All commercial bathrooms built after 1994 are ADA compliant. What’s good for robotics is that lays a specific design.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2239956" style="width: 833px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2239956" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2239956" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2421637834861_.pic_hd-e1638163752386.jpg" alt="" width="823" height="438" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2421637834861_.pic_hd-e1638163752386.jpg 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2421637834861_.pic_hd-e1638163752386.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2421637834861_.pic_hd-e1638163752386.jpg?resize=300,160 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2421637834861_.pic_hd-e1638163752386.jpg?resize=768,409 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2421637834861_.pic_hd-e1638163752386.jpg?resize=680,362 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2421637834861_.pic_hd-e1638163752386.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 823px) 100vw, 823px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2239956" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>FJDynamics</p></div></p>
<p>Some more big funding for a robotics agtech firm &#8212; this time in China. Founded by former DJI chief scientist Wu Di, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/28/fj-dynamics-70-million-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FJDynamics</a> just announced that it has closed a $70 million Series B for its robotic harvester. Rita had a frank conversation with Wu, who noted, “You can have the most advanced AI algorithms. But if the technology doesn’t work on the production line or the farm, because you don’t have any industry experience, then how does your technology benefit people?”</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>

<p>On the note of broader trends to look out for, anecdotally, it seems there’s raring to be an uptick in crowded capital rounds. Miso Robotics, which produces the hamburger cooking robot, Flippy, <a href="https://invest.misorobotics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just announced a sizable $35 million crowdfunded Series B</a> spread out over 8,200 investors (a list that includes both new and returning names).</p>

<p>It’s a big round, as far as crowdfunding goes &#8212; and a trend worth keeping an eye on. Certainly there’s something to be said for widescale consumer buy-in, but one wonders what going this route means for investor confidence, among other things.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eatstellarpizza.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stellar Pizza announced</a> plans to launch its robotic pizza cooking truck in Los Angeles at some point next spring. Formed by a trio of SpaceX expats, the company says its trucks are capable of cooking a pizza from scratch in less than five minutes and producing a pizza every 45 seconds at max capacity.</p>
<p>Per its press material:</p>
<blockquote><p>With a revolutionary new pizza machine, Stellar Pizza transforms raw pizza dough and fresh toppings into a fully baked pizza in under five minutes. With the maximum capability to produce a pizza every 45 seconds, the food truck can deliver a larger quantity of fresh, gourmet pizzas more consistently than its brick-and-mortar counterparts. The robotic pizza-making process starts with a freshly prepared ball of raw pizza dough, which gets pressed and shaped into a round pizza crust. Then, house-made sauce and fresh toppings are added. Lastly, the raw pizza is inserted into one of four high-temperature custom-designed ovens to bake to perfection.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab finally pulled the cover off its Neutron rocket, a medium-lift vehicle that CEO Peter Beck calls “a rocket of 2050,” as the company looks to take a greater share of the launch market currently dominated by SpaceX.</p>
<p>This is the first major update on the project from the company since Neutron was announced in March. Since then, Rocket Lab’s been busy, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/peter-beck-on-rocket-labs-public-listing-debut-space-spacs-and-the-neutron-rocket/">going public via a merger</a> with a blank-check firm, continuing to develop its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/rocket-labs-electron-booster-splashes-down-in-the-pacific-ocean/">Electron reusability program</a> and expanding its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/rocket-lab-acquires-planetary-systems-corporation-in-cash-and-stock-deal/">space services division</a>. All the while, the company has managed to stay mum about Neutron &#8212; until now.</p>
<h2>Carbon composites</h2>
<p>Neutron features a number of surprising innovations that depart from other rockets of its class in both operation and development. The first is materials: The 131-foot rocket will be made out of a special carbon composite, much like its sibling rocket, Electron.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242328" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s an interesting choice, particularly as SpaceX famously decided to ditch carbon composites for its Starship system in favor of stainless steel. But this is not Rocket Lab’s first rodeo with carbon composites; not only do they make up the bulk of the Electron rocket, Beck has been working with advanced composites and materials since the start of his career at a New Zealand government research facility.</p>
<p>“If you&#8217;re someone who is used to working in metallics, actually moving into composites is really challenging,” Beck told TechCrunch. “But if you&#8217;ve always been in composites and your experience is there, then actually, they&#8217;re pretty simple.”</p>
<p>Metallic structures are heavy and low-performance; while that can be made up for with high-performance engines, this doesn’t lead to high margins or high reliability for reuse, he added. Lighter structures avoid what he called “the rocket spiral of doom”: a never-ending arms race between heavier structures requiring more propellant, which then requires a larger propellant tank, which increases the weight and requires even more propellant — ad infinitum.</p>
<p>“This is the first time in my career ever where the spiral of doom is inversed. The spiral of doom is inversed because of the lightweight structures, and it&#8217;s not just important from a launch perspective, it&#8217;s actually really important from a reentry perspective,&#8221; he said. Why? According to Beck, Neutron’s large diameter at 23 feet and light weight gives it a large ballistic coefficient, a measure of an object’s ability to resist air drag. So the focus on structure means using less propellant on reentry, less air drag (and less heat as a consequence), and a simpler engine.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Neutron will also be finished in a new type of graphite composite for added thermal protection, a new addition that will be coming to future Electron rockets as well.</p>
<h2>The &#8216;Hungry Hippo&#8217;</h2>
<p>Another major departure from conventional rocket design are Neutron’s fairings, a piece of equipment that traditionally sits at the top of the rocket like a nose cone, protecting the payload inside. Historically, fairings separate and fall back to Earth and are generally considered expendable, though SpaceX retrieves them from the ocean for refurbishment and reuse.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab has instead attached the four fairings to the first stage, where they will mechanically open (imagine a strange, robotic flower). This is yet another design decision that has been driven by the use of composite materials, Beck said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2242334" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2242334" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2242334" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Neutron-Stage-2-deploying.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Neutron-Stage-2-deploying.jpg 5692w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Neutron-Stage-2-deploying.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Neutron-Stage-2-deploying.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Neutron-Stage-2-deploying.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Neutron-Stage-2-deploying.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Neutron-Stage-2-deploying.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Neutron-Stage-2-deploying.jpg?resize=2048,1151 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Neutron-Stage-2-deploying.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2242334" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://rocketlabusa.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rocket Lab <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>“Normally you don&#8217;t have the mass margins to be able to hold onto fairings and do things like that. You have to get rid of the fairings as quick as you can, because you can&#8217;t afford that parasitic mass. But when the parasitic mass is really low, then it allows you to be able to do these kinds of things.”</p>
<p>Neutron will be capable of carrying a maximum of 15,000 kilograms of payload to low Earth orbit, putting it right in competition with SpaceX&#8217;s Falcon 9 and Relativity Space&#8217;s in-development Terran R rocket.</p>
<h2>But what about the second stage?</h2>
<p>Not only is there no nose cone payload fairing, Rocket Lab also decided to overhaul the second stage as well. Conventional rocket design integrates the second stage by sandwiching it between the first stage and the payload. But with Neutron, the second stage will hang inside the first stage. When the rocket needs to deploy the payload, the &#8220;Hungry Hippo&#8221; fairing design will open and release both the second stage and payload to orbit.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab intends to use Neutron for different types of missions, including human spaceflight. In the case of a crewed launch, Beck said they could simply remove the fairings and the capsule holding the crew would go on top.</p>
<p>The second stage is designed to be expendable. While other rocket companies are working on full reusability, Beck said the jury was still out on whether second stage reusability makes sense, particularly considering the increased mass requirements of reusability and the associated operational costs of recovery.</p>
<h2>Returning to Earth</h2>
<p>Once the second stage is deployed, the first stage will return to Earth to land right back on its launch pad. That means no touchdown on an ocean barge, another choice that will save on operational costs, Beck said.</p>
<p>Neutron will get to orbit and back using seven new engines Rocket Lab has developed, which it calls Archimedes. These low-pressure engines will run on liquid oxygen (LOX) and methane, rather than LOX and kerosene. Just like the decision to return the first stage to the launch site, the propellant choice was designed to minimize turnaround time between missions.</p>
<p>“Engines have typically in the past required a lot of refurbishment. And they require a lot of refurbishment because the propellants chosen have been LOX and kerosene. Kerosene creates a lot of sooting, a lot of coking,” he said. “So that&#8217;s what drove the decision to use methane, is that you can run an engine on methane and it&#8217;s perfectly clean and still shiny after you&#8217;ve finished burning it.”</p>
<p>Neutron will eventually take off from somewhere in the United States, and Rocket Lab is in the middle of a competitive process to choose a launch and manufacturing site. Much has been made of the auspicious absence of any specific launch date for Neutron &#8212; Rocket Lab had previously said 2024, which was not mentioned in this morning’s update &#8212; but Beck said that omission wasn’t intentional.</p>
<p>“We’re aiming to get one on the pad in ’24 and get a commercial customer up in the sky in ’25,” he confirmed. “But we also acknowledge it&#8217;s a rocket program. So it’s a lot of work to do but we&#8217;re working hard and that&#8217;s the plan.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Almost exactly one year ago, Timnit Gebru, one of the leaders of Google&#8217;s ethics in AI team and one of the foremost experts in that topic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/googles-co-lead-of-ethical-ai-team-says-she-was-fired-for-sending-an-email/">was fired after sending an email of concern to her team</a>. Now she has set up shop herself with a brand new research institute, DAIR, focused on the topics she felt were being sidelined at Google.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dair-institute.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute</a> is &#8220;an independent, community rooted institute set to counter Big Tech’s pervasive influence on the research, development and deployment of AI,&#8221; according to its <a href="https://www.dair-institute.org/press-release" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement press release</a>.</p>
<p>Built from the start to include and emphasize diverse perspectives and question the processes used at companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook/Meta, DAIR will be independently funded. The focus will be on publishing papers in the academic realm but without either the relentless pressure of traditional academia or the paternalistic interference of a global corporation hanging over the researchers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242318" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been frustrated for a long time about the incentive structures that we have in place and how none of them seem to be appropriate for the kind of work I want to do,&#8221; Gebru <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/02/timnit-gebru-dair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told The Washington Post</a>.</p>
<p>So far the institute has raised $3.7 million, from the Ford Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, the Kapor Center and the Open Society Foundation. That ought to be enough to get started — and pay its researchers well, ensuring that this type of work is a realistic alternative to working at one of the deep-pocketed corporations that frequently fund AI research.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve asked Gebru, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/will-ai-diversify-human-thinking-or-replace-it-with-chris-ategeka-ucot-timnit-gebru-google-ai-and-ken-goldberg-uc-berkeley/">whom we have had on stage to talk about these very topics</a>, for further information on DAIR&#8217;s methods and directions for future research and will update this post if I hear back. But two personnel give an idea of what we can expect.</p>
<p>Safiya Noble, author of &#8220;Algorithms of Oppression&#8221; and Macarthur Genius Grant recipient, will be on DAIR&#8217;s advisory committee; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/tackling-deep-seated-bias-in-tech-with-haben-girma-mutale-nkonde-and-safiya-noble/">we recently hosted her for a panel at TC Sessions: Justice</a> where she spoke about the danger of considering technologies neutral or valuable as they become widely used and &#8220;banal,&#8221; when in fact that is exactly the time they should be under greater scrutiny.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>And Raesetje Sefala is DAIR&#8217;s first research fellow; Sefala&#8217;s recent research focuses on <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=WV0waZz9dTF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geographical and economic segregation</a> in South Africa, quantified by satellite imagery.</p>
<p>&#8220;AI needs to be brought back down to earth. It has been elevated to a superhuman level that leads us to believe it is both inevitable and beyond our control,&#8221; said Gebru in the announcement. &#8220;When AI research, development and deployment is rooted in people and communities from the start, we can get in front of these harms and create a future that values equity and humanity.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Each degree Celsius of warming will erase 1.2% of the United States GDP, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/theres-no-cheap-way-to-deal-with-the-climate-crisis">according to Solomon Hsiang</a>, a climate scientist and economist at the University of California, Berkeley, and the co-director of the research group Climate Impact Lab. If U.S. companies do not act now to halt climate emissions, Hsiang predicts a loss of up to 10.5% of annual GDP, which equates to approximately $2.2 trillion per year.</p>
<p>Most organizations do not understand the gravity of the need to address emissions now. Businesses across industries and throughout the world are facing an existential threat that can no longer be ignored. It’s time to address the impact of rapidly accelerating climate change in the corporate sector. The effect of harmful emissions on the bottom line can’t be overstated.</p>
<p>Customers are choosing to purchase products from carbon-conscious companies and investors such as <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/about-us/road-to-net-zero">BlackRock</a>, <a href="https://www.balderton.com/sustainable-future-goals/">Balderton Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.alantecapital.com/">Alante Capital</a> are considering sustainability in their investment processes. The market has moved beyond good intentions. To ensure an organization is successful in its efforts to measure and reduce emissions, it is imperative that they have a plan and tools in place to take on every component of the company ecosystem.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241720" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>How do companies get started?</h2>
<p>The first and most important step is to admit you have a problem and are emitting more than you think. Acknowledge your carbon footprint. Communicate a desire to learn and do better. Begin education at a strategic level first, then distill it throughout the organization to key stakeholders consistently over time.</p>
<p>In the absence of a universal standard, the C-suite must be knowledgeable about and capable of quantifying sustainability risks threatening their business &#8212; and the practices being put into place to ameliorate them.</p>
<p>Assemble a dedicated team and bring in a third-party consultant or software vendor to assess the company’s emissions and make recommendations. Typically, the sustainability team drives the effort. Include the CFO and CTO for data collection and the evaluation of cost and revenue implications. Ensure that your general counsel is also included in the conversation for compliance purposes. Representatives from operations, community relations, HR and communications should take part.</p>
<p>Next, conduct an assessment that provides a deep analysis of the company’s carbon emissions and overall sustainability practices. The assessment should include factors generating direct and indirect emissions, such as vehicle fleets and purchased energy including electricity, heating and cooling.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Host a series of regular meetings between executives, sustainability teams and consultants to discuss the results of the assessment, which actions will be taken, and the timeline for implementation. This will help to enlist missionaries in the efforts, from the top-down and bottom-up.</p>
<p>Once they are organized in their efforts, companies must also look at how they generate carbon emissions beyond their four walls. Start a dialogue with your value chain &#8212; this is where enterprise-grade SaaS emission platforms come in.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-3-inventory-guidance">Scope 3 emissions</a> resulting from assets not owned or controlled by an organization, but that impact their value chain, most often represent the biggest part of a company’s footprint. If you aren’t measuring and reducing scope 3 emissions, then your carbon reduction plan is not credible, even if you have reduced or eliminated scopes 1 and 2. The more you engage your stakeholders, the closer you get to the emissions, the quicker you reduce such emissions.</p>
<h2>How might approaches vary?</h2>
<p>Whether a small startup or a large enterprise, the approach to reduction is the same: Begin with measurement. Set <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/">science-based reduction targets</a> and monitor your footprint on a consistent basis. Leverage fintech-inspired tools to make on-target, granular goals and a climate-positive impact. Map your business by department, brand, business units and geography, while also including the company’s value chain and suppliers.</p>
<p>Data plays an essential role in setting a company’s baseline. Without accurate information that is granular, you cannot determine if the actions you are taking are working, nor whether those you plan to execute in the future will work. In addition to a precise baseline, it’s imperative to be precise with approval workflow to prevent “garbage-in, garbage-out” data. There needs to be a massive amount of trackable and actionable data points &#8212; internally and externally &#8212; through the value chain.</p>
<p>Next, assign actions and establish deadlines to meet the goals. Ensure that your numbers are precise and utilize sustainability management software and carbon consultants to kick off your reduction journey before shifting to automation.</p>
<p>When it comes to reduction, choose your first battle by identifying where your highest emissions are coming from. Typically, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions">these emissions</a> stem from company transportation &#8212; burning fossil fuel for our cars and buses traveling to and from the office, or jetting to other parts of the world for a business meeting. Though they might seem small at the time, they add up to what truly matters.</p>
<p>Investigate each and every component of inside operations and your supply chain and select sustainable partners. You can’t blame your accounting department for not using recycled paper if your company is still doing strategic business with the most important Brazilian soy importer.</p>
<p>Continuously evolve and evaluate your climate progress on a weekly or even daily basis. Ideate, iterate and try again when you stumble. Stay accountable to your company’s emission reduction goals and remain open and transparent with regulators, employees, customers and investors.</p>
<h2>What happens if companies don&#8217;t follow through?</h2>
<p>Companies should begin implementing long-term changes to accommodate eventual green policy. While there may be incentives that companies may benefit from, the cost of energy and fossil fuels has been steadily skyrocketing in recent years.</p>
<p>This, in conjunction with the desire to leave the planet in a better place, should be reason enough to take action. Your company’s low-carbon efforts will pay in the end regardless of how long the wait for subsidies is.</p>
<p>Millennials and Gen Zs evaluate a company’s sustainability practice as part of the decision to accept a job offer. Companies of any size that are driven by climate action goals and efforts and share those transparently and publicly are more likely to attract fresh, intelligent workers who share the same personal philosophies.</p>
<p>Employees that work for organizations focused on net-zero emissions become a company’s biggest ambassadors and advocates in both internal and external conversations, not only helping to attract new hires, but also to maintain longer tenure in the workplace. Companies in industries such as oil and gas are struggling to adapt and having difficulty attracting talent.</p>
<h2>What organizations are demonstrating early success?</h2>
<p>Companies that are transparent and committed to their journey are recognized winners. They’re willing to acknowledge their carbon impact and have invested resources to tackle their emissions. Microsoft, HP, Orange, Beyond Meat and Bpifrance are succeeding in their climate action goals. When transparency is at the forefront, not only can organizations highlight their areas of improvement, but they can also publicly celebrate their successes.</p>
<p>Existing groups such as <a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/about/the-climate-pledge">Amazon’s Climate Pledge</a>, <a href="https://unfccc.int/climate-action/climate-neutral-now">UNFCCC’s Climate Neutral Now</a>, and <a href="https://www.theclimategroup.org/about-ep100">The Climate Group’s EP100</a> allow companies to pledge their climate actions among others in their industry. These established groups allow your executive team to connect with other leaders who share the same climate philosophies as you do. Better yet, companies can form their own climate coalitions to explore emissions measurement solutions and tools with like-minded leaders. Share your progress, including trials and tribulations, regularly and transparently.</p>
<p>After COP26, it’s clear that companies have <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b044fe94-ae00-4363-9362-3906a9b92cf8">a big role to play</a> in our journey to tackle climate change. From financing the green transition to supporting other businesses in their reduction efforts, corporations will have a massive impact on getting us closer to our 1.5-degree C target. And who knows, they might even be responsible for <a href="https://www.sweep.net/academy/161-cop26-businesses-can-tip-the-carbon-balance">tipping the carbon balance</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Religion-based apps, tools and communities aren&#8217;t brand new, including to investors. Pray.com, for example, an LA-based app for daily prayer and bedtime Bible stories that was founded in 2016, has raised at least <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pray/company_financials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$34 million</a> from investors, including Kleiner Perkins. Ministry Brands, a nine-year-old, Knoxville, Tennessee-based outfit that now includes dozens of software and payments brands tailored to faith-based organizations, was acquired by Insight Partners in 2016 for $1.4 billion (which is reportedly now looking to <a href="https://www.pehub.com/insight-partners-explores-sale-of-ministry-brands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flip it</a>).</p>
<p>Still, fueled by a pandemic that drove churches to close, faith-based apps and communities are growing faster than ever &#8212; the most popular, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bible/id282935706" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bible app</a>, is now on more than 400 million devices worldwide &#8212; and getting more notice as a result.</p>
<p>The newest of these is<a href="https://glorify-app.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Glorify</a>, a two-year-old, 60-person, subscription-based &#8220;well-being&#8221; app that offers users guided meditation, along with audio bible passages and Christian music. The London-based outfit &#8212; whose 22-year-old co-founder and co-CEO, Ed Beccle, says he spends up to a third of his time in São Paulo &#8212; just raised $40 million in Series A funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from SoftBank Latin America Fund, K5 Global and a long string of famous individuals, including Kris Jenner, Corey Gamble, Michael Ovitz, Jason Derulo and Michael Bublé.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242213" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We talked yesterday with Beccle about Glorify, which is not his first company despite his young age. In fact, Beccle, who <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://amazingworkplaces.co/hintsa-performance-acquires-grasp-hr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently sold</a> his previous company for what he describes as a &#8220;multimillion-dollar&#8221; exit, dropped out of high school at age 16 to work on his startups.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, during our conversation, he laid out a vision that extends well beyond meditation and Bible readings. He also offered a peek into how wealthy celebrities and startup entrepreneurs are being brought together. Excerpts of that chat follow, edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You say this is your third or fourth startup. With Glorify, did you see an opportunity or are you a religious person or is it a combination of both things?</strong></p>
<p>EB: I think definitely a combination of both. It&#8217;s hard not to get a little bit philosophical when you&#8217;re young, and you&#8217;re doing exciting things, maybe you make more money than regular people your own age. For me, at least, I stopped and thought, &#8216;Well, I can afford all the Ubers and Uber Eats in the world, and I don&#8217;t really spend any other money. I don&#8217;t have a mortgage or dependents. What would I do if I could do anything?&#8217;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>[The answer] has always been working on tech that changes the way people think and feel. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m kind of obsessed with. . . Now I&#8217;ve never been more proud of anything in my life than this company because it is so much more than just a business. I&#8217;ve come at it from from a lot of different angles and one is very much on an emotional level and my own beliefs around faith. Then the other is: It&#8217;s the most incredible commercial opportunity. It&#8217;s going to be, I think, far bigger than people realize.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You have a pretty interesting syndicate of investors. How did that come together?</strong></p>
<p>EB: I think it came together a bit like everything that I&#8217;ve done, which is just, you know, by my continually trying and chatting to as many people as I can and putting myself in a lot of awkward situations sometimes to get in front of the right people. In terms of the celebrity elements, I have to say that that was a shock. [Former Hollywood agent] Michael Kives has been a complete hero on this front; he sent me a message that said, &#8216;Are you free&#8217; on whatever the date was. &#8216;I want you to come to dinner with me and the Kardashians&#8217; and there were probably 25 people on the guest list that he sent over, and I&#8217;m not sure there was a single person aside from myself and one other who wasn&#8217;t an A-lister. Like, it was crazy. I walk through the door, and there was Michael [Bublé] and Jason Derulo, and, I mean, what you see on the press release is literally the tip of the iceberg. We&#8217;ve only released some of the names.</p>
<p>It comes down to: Why have we done it? Why have I tried so hard to get a lot of these people involved? It&#8217;s because we&#8217;re trying to create a cultural movement around faith and making believing in God and something greater, something that&#8217;s more than just okay [and into] something that can really change your life. My goal with all of these people is to get them to make Glorify the medium that they talk about their faith through.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Can you talk about some of the business metrics that made these people decide to commit to the venture?</strong></p>
<p>EB: We&#8217;re averaging at least 250,000 people daily and we&#8217;ve had now 2.5 million downloads over the last year or so. I think things have really kicked off in the last six months to be honest, and what&#8217;s so exciting is that a lot of this growth has been semi organic. It&#8217;s not from viral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-factor_(marketing)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K factor</a> that exists within the app. We always thought it was too early to start introducing stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Is the plan to evolve this into a full-fledged social network?</strong></p>
<p>EB: When we talk about it being a social network, 100%. It&#8217;s just that trying to look at social very differently. We want to optimize for very different things. I want to be building tight-knit engaged communities that are really meaningful and purpose-led, rather than things that are mass, superficially engaged, which is really the trap of social today. We don&#8217;t monetize through ads; the user really isn&#8217;t the product. We want to bring people closer together and not necessarily in huge groups but through amazing micro interactions that can exist and bring you closer to a small group of people who you really care about.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are you close to break-even at this point?</strong></p>
<p>EB: Definitely not, but it&#8217;s very intentional. We&#8217;ve proven paid conversion, which we&#8217;re really happy about . . .  I believe the engaged audience that we will have will probably have a higher propensity to pay for all sorts of other products that we release. That cool daily worship product will [continue to] be in the Glorify app, although far improved, even in over the next few months, but [we think we can] take that audience and direct them to other products that we&#8217;ve created, where they&#8217;ll have high propensity to pay.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are you talking about virtual tithing? Bible study?</strong></p>
<p>EB: An example would be in in Christian dating. It&#8217;s an amazing, huge space, but anyone who really tries to build within it has to become kind of a Christian Tinder, using visuals to be the primary way you match people. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s really the right way to go about it. Instead, you know, if you&#8217;re a user of Glorify, we&#8217;ll be able to match you with people based on shared beliefs [and] your engagement with the Bible [and] all sorts of things where we have almost a competitive advantage over anyone else because of the product that we&#8217;ve begun with.</p>
<p><em>Pictured above: From right to left, Henry Costa and Ed Beccle, co-CEOs of Glorify. The best friends met at a co-working space when Costa was doing angel investing in London. According to Beccle, they instantly hit it off and he asked Costa if he would be his co-founder at Grasp. They later co-founded Glorify. </em></p>

The new service is part of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/">AWS Free Tier.</a> AWS says re:Post is driven by the community of AWS customers, partners, and employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;AWS re:Post is an AWS-managed Q&amp;A service offering crowd-sourced, expert-reviewed answers to your technical questions about AWS that replaces the original AWS Forums,&#8221; the company explained in a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-repost-a-reimagined-qa-experience-for-the-aws-community/">blog post</a> about the announcement. &#8220;Community members can earn reputation points to build up their community expert status by providing accepted answers and reviewing answers from other users, helping to continually expand the availability of public knowledge across all AWS services.&#8221;</p>

<p>The company says customers will find re:Post to be an ideal resource when they are building an application using AWS and have a technical question about an AWS service or best practices. It could also be helpful when customers are learning about AWS or are preparing for an AWS certification. In addition, AWS says re:Post could be useful when customers&#8217; teams are debating issues related to design or operations on AWS. Lastly, the service could be used to share your AWS expertise with the community and also build a reputation as a community expert.</p>
<p>Users don&#8217;t have to sign in to re:Post to browse the content available. Those who do choose to sign in will have the opportunity to create a profile, post questions and answers and interact with others. Creating a profile will allow users to link their AWS certifications through Credly and to indicate interests in specific AWS technology and services. AWS re:Post automatically shares new questions with community experts based on their areas of expertise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meta&#8217;s (formerly, Facebook&#8217;s) experimental app division, the NPE team, is shifting gears. The group, which first <a href="https://tech.fb.com/npe-team-from-facebook/">launched</a> in mid-2019, has been focused on building consumer-facing apps that would allow the company to test out new social features and gauge people&#8217;s reactions.</p>
<p>Over the years, the largely Menlo Park-based team launched and retired a number of experiments, ranging from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/facebook-tests-video-speed-dating-events-with-sparked/">dating</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/facebook-launches-catchup-an-audio-only-group-calling-app-that-shows-whos-ready-to-chat-now/">calling apps</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/facebook-launches-e-gg-an-experimental-collage-making-app/">meme-makers</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/facebook-launches-bars-a-tiktok-like-app-for-creating-and-sharing-raps/">TikTok</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/facebook-takes-on-twitter-with-venue-a-second-screen-companion-for-live-events/">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/facebook-tests-hotline-a-qa-product-thats-a-mashup-of-clubhouse-and-instagram-live/">Clubhouse rivals</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/facebook-ships-an-experimental-app-for-couples/">apps for couples</a> and more. Now, NPE will begin testing out a new thesis: that the next big idea may come from a market outside the U.S.</p>
<p>To capitalize on that potential, the organization <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/facebook-to-target-nigerian-learners-with-educational-app-sabee-created-by-its-rd-team/">recently</a> set up an office in Lagos, Nigeria, and it will soon open another in Asia. It&#8217;s also adjusting its strategy to include making seed-stage investments in small, entrepreneurial teams.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242100" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>One such check has already been written. Meta&#8217;s <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/11/08/who-would-take-venture-dollars-from-facebook-right-now/">recent investment</a> in an A.I.-powered developer platform for building virtual characters, <a href="https://www.inworld.ai/">Inworld AI</a>, was directed by NPE. But future checks may go to non-metaverse companies to include those with more near-term potential &#8212; like startups taking advantage of the mobile internet in new ways.</p>
<p>Meta, of course, understands that many of today&#8217;s universal experiences first emerged from niche communities. WhatsApp, for example, grew in popularity in regions where SMS text messaging wasn&#8217;t free before it was adopted globally. Some mobile money innovations, meanwhile, grew out of the lack of legacy payment systems in East Africa.</p>
<p>To ensure it&#8217;s not missing out on future opportunities like this, Meta&#8217;s NPE team is looking outside Silicon Valley.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2242255" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2242255" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2242255" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Ime-Archibong.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="390" height="312" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Ime-Archibong.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Ime-Archibong.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Ime-Archibong.jpg?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Ime-Archibong.jpg?resize=768,614 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Ime-Archibong.jpg?resize=680,544 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Ime-Archibong.jpg?resize=1536,1229 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Ime-Archibong.jpg?resize=2048,1638 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Ime-Archibong.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2242255" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Meta&#8217;s Ime Archibong</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This new direction is being led by Ime Archibong, head of Meta&#8217;s New Product Experimentation (NPE), an 11-year Meta employee, whose experience prior to NPE included working on Facebook&#8217;s developer platform. That role saw him bouncing around the world to connect with entrepreneurs from both smaller startups and larger companies. After joining NPE two years ago, Archibong is taking the group in a similar direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bit like what I was doing for the prior 10 years, which is going and attracting a bunch of entrepreneurial talent and small teams, and getting them access to the resources &#8212; which is talent, time and technology to build out their ideas,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;And of course, the objective is that some of the seeds of the ideas that we&#8217;re able to build, at some point, could be very big.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team will focus on markets in Asia, Africa and Latin America as it pursues this new direction, though it isn&#8217;t entirely giving up on U.S.-based projects. However, some of those may look different than they have in the past. Instead of launching and quickly shuttering new social apps that don&#8217;t gain traction, NPE&#8217;s current set of experiments include a project that&#8217;s helping citizens in the U.S. re-enter society after being incarcerated and another aimed at helping LGBTQ families on the journey to becoming parents. These are obviously a bit meatier than just another TikTok clone.</p>
<p>But the expanded focus to include the global stage will see NPE often looking for ideas that may start off small &#8212; perhaps even addressing underserved markets &#8212; but have the potential to scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that the future is going to be built in some of these regions around the world that have been historically overlooked and undervalued,&#8221; Archibong noted. &#8220;I have a firm belief that the problems, solutions, the opportunities and the new experiences that are going to be built by people who are most proximate to the communities that they&#8217;re trying to serve.&#8221; And these solutions will be &#8220;more durable, more sustainable, and more viable&#8221; in the long run, he said.</p>
<p>This thesis itself sounds solid enough &#8212; after all, history has already proved it right. However, the question remains as to whether the global entrepreneurship community will welcome checks written by Meta, given its history of &#8220;borrowing&#8221; ideas from smaller companies.</p>
<p>Meta is widely known to have copied Snapchat&#8217;s Stories and grown it into a much<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/13/instagram-stories-bigger-than-snapchat/"> larger product</a>. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/07/facebook-avatars/">launched</a> its own version of Snap&#8217;s Bitmoji. It&#8217;s currently expanding its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebook-officially-launches-live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-in-the-u-s/">Clubhouse</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/facebook-reels-exits-beta-in-the-u-s-with-offers-to-pay-creators-for-well-performing-videos/">TikTok</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/facebook-is-working-on-neighborhoods-a-nextdoor-clone-based-on-local-groups/">Nextdoor</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/facebooks-newsletter-platform-bulletin-is-now-live/">Substack</a> clones. A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/phhhoto-sues-meta-facebook-antitrust/">startup called Phhhoto is even suing Meta</a> for first promising it a partnership opportunity, then ultimately deciding to just build its own version of Phhhoto&#8217;s technology (which became Boomerang from Instagram). What Meta didn&#8217;t copy, it acquired &#8212; whether that was a future rival like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/facebook-to-acquire-instagram-for-1-billion/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/19/crazy-like-a-facebook-fox/">WhatsApp</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/facebook-to-acquire-giphy-in-a-deal-reportedly-worth-400-million/">Giphy</a>, or an up-and-comer like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/16/facebook-acquires-anonymous-teen-compliment-app-tbh-will-let-it-run/">tbh</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/24/facebook-acquires-activity-tracking-app-moves/">Moves</a>.</p>
<p>While Inworld AI may have felt comfortable working with Meta, given how tightly aligned their missions were in VR, other seed-stage startups may not feel the same. But Archibong believes there will be enough out there who will take the chance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that there are going to be more opportunities like that [with Inworld AI]. People who see working with us, a mission-aligned organization with what they&#8217;re trying to do &#8212; an organization that&#8217;s probably pretty excited about similar technology trends, or emergent platforms or user behavior,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company hasn&#8217;t said how much capital it plans to deploy over what period of time, but the checks &#8212; like the teams themselves &#8212; will be &#8220;really, really small,&#8221; Archibong said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Heads up folks, as we shift metaphors (ever-so-briefly) from space to sports. We’ve got a news double-header for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a>, which takes flight (we said it was brief) on December 14-15.</p>
<p>Ready? Here goes part one: If you’re part of the community determined to shape the burgeoning space economy, and you still don’t have your pass, the time is Now O’clock. Prices go up in just two days. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#tickets">Buy your pass</a> <strong>before</strong> <strong>December 4</strong>, and you’ll keep $55 in your wallet.</p>
<p>Here’s part two — and even more incentive to get your pass ASAP. CrunchMatch is now open, which means you have you have 12 full days — before the conference even begins — to search the attendees list and schedule meetings with the people who align with your business goals.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240710" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If you’re not familiar with CrunchMatch, it’s our AI-powered platform that replaces frustrating and unreliable needle-in-a-haystack networking with an efficient, highly effective process.</p>
<p>When you register(ed) for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=email &amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=generaladmission&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=pricesincrease&amp;display=">TC Sessions: Space</a>, you answer a few quick questions about your business preferences, and within minutes you’re automatically registered for CrunchMatch. It’s open as of today, so check your inbox for an email telling you how to access the platform.</p>
<p>CrunchMatch searches for suitable matches based on the info you provided. The algorithm it uses makes fast, precise recommendations, and it gets smarter the more you use it. Check out what other TechCrunch event attendees say about networking the TC way.</p>
<p>“CrunchMatch made it easy to set up short networking sessions, and I used it to meet with founders in adjacent areas like climate or B2B SaaS. I met interesting people I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily have connected with otherwise.” — Ashley Barrington, founder, MarketPearl.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The CrunchMatch networking platform is such a smart, useful tool. It lets you see who’s there, find the right people and reach out for a meeting. I scheduled five or six appointments in one day. The meetings were small, intimate and very informative.” — Felicia Jackson, inventor and founder of CPRWrap.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick calculation: Save $55 + CrunchMatch = more opportunity for less money. That’s one doozy of a double-header and a formula for success.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=email &amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=generaladmission&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=pricesincrease&amp;display=">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> takes place December 14-15, but the price of admission goes up in just two days. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#tickets">Buy your pass</a> <strong>before December 4</strong>, save $55, fire up CrunchMatch and start connecting to the people who can move your business forward.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[At its re:Invent conference, AWS today announced Amplify Studio, a new Figma-connected no-code/low-code service that is meant to help developers quickly build cloud-connected apps. Amplify Studio is an extension of the existing AWS Amplify service, which already focused on building web and mobile apps, but without the easy to use drag-and-drop interface of Amplify Studio.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its re:Invent conference, AWS today <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/aws-amplify-studio-figma-to-fullstack-react-app-with-minimal-programming/">announced</a> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/studio/">Amplify Studio</a>, a new Figma-connected no-code/low-code service that is meant to help developers quickly build cloud-connected apps. Amplify Studio is an extension of the existing AWS Amplify service, which already focused on building web and mobile apps, but without the easy to use drag-and-drop interface of Amplify Studio.</p>
<p>AWS has made an interesting move here by connecting Studio to the popular Figma user interface design tool. Through this, designers can build the interface in Figma and then the developers can connect this to their backend data and build the application logic in Studio. It also frees AWS from having to build its own design tool, of course. Amplify Studio does this by translating Figma designs into React UI component code.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2242243" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ezgif-3-b98b50e3f6a6.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2242243" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2242243" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ezgif-3-b98b50e3f6a6.gif" alt="" width="600" height="375" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2242243" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong></p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242217" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;With Studio’s new &#8216;UI Library (Preview),&#8217; you can sync components from Figma to Amplify Studio,&#8221; AWS&#8217;s Rene Brandel writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;Amplify also provides you a handy Figma file to get started faster. The Amplify Figma file includes both UI primitives and pre-built components. Studio can also sync any new components created in Figma as well!&#8221;</p>

<p>As Amazon CTO Werner Vogels noted, the company still considers this a developer-first service, mostly for front-end engineers. That means there&#8217;s still some code to write here and there, and developers can easily export their apps into their existing DevOps pipeline.</p>
<p>If necessary, developers will also be able to override some of the pre-built components in Amplify Studio, using the AWS Cloud Development Kit. With this, AWS argues, developers won&#8217;t hit a wall, where they won&#8217;t be able to scale their apps as they &#8212; and their needs &#8212; grow.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Companies face all kinds of challenges moving to the cloud. The more complex and spread out you are geographically, the more difficult it becomes to manage your network. In an effort to solve this issue, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/introducing-aws-cloud-wan-preview/">Amazon announced AWS Cloud WAN</a> today to bring software-defined wide area networking to AWS.</p>
<p>Amazon chief technology officer Werner Vogels explained the complexities around managing a worldwide network have grown as the company&#8217;s offerings have grown. &#8220;Now, even with all of these components, building a global network, connecting maybe hundreds of your offices to the cloud, is still a big challenge,&#8221; Vogels explained to the AWS re:Invent audience in Las Vegas this morning.</p>
<p>Vogels says that the company began looking at how it could solve this for AWS customers. &#8220;So we started to think about how can we help these customers really overcome all the heavy lifting that you have to do if you have a very widespread network that you need to connect to the cloud. So today, I&#8217;m happy to announce AWS Cloud WAN, which gives you the ability to build, manage and monitor global traffic across a wide area networks using AWS.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242221" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>You can select the regions you want to use, then select the offices and facilities you want to connect. &#8220;Then automatically once you actually define this, all the remote users and sites and data centers will connect to the geographically closest location using a VPN or direct connect , and actually builds it for you in minutes using the big AWS backbone for you to give you a highly reliable and highly available software-defined, wide area network running over the AWS infrastructure,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This new capability is available in preview starting today across multiple regions around the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its annual re:Invent conference, AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/locations/">announced</a> that it will be launching over 30 new AWS Local Zones in major cities around the world. These new AWS Local Zones will be made available starting in 2022 in over 21 countries, including Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, India, Kenya, Netherlands, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Portugal and South Africa.</p>
<p>For context, AWS Local Zones are a type of AWS infrastructure deployment that places compute, storage, and other select services closer to customers, giving them the ability to run applications on AWS that require single-digit millisecond latencies to their end-users or on-premise installations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Commission has given its clearest signal yet that it&#8217;s prepared to intervene over weak enforcement of the EU&#8217;s data protection rules against big tech.</p>
<p>Today the bloc&#8217;s executive also had a warning for adtech giants Google and Facebook &#8212; accusing them of choosing &#8220;legal tricks&#8221; over true compliance with the EU&#8217;s standard of &#8220;privacy by design&#8221; &#8212; and emphasizing the imperative for them to take data protection &#8220;seriously&#8221;.</p>
<p>Speaking at a privacy conference this morning, Vera Jourová, the EU&#8217;s commissioner for values and transparency, said enforcement of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) at a national level must buck up &#8212; and become &#8220;effective&#8221; &#8212; or else it &#8220;will have to change&#8221;, warning specifying that any &#8220;potential changes&#8221; will move toward centralized enforcement.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242073" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p class="m_9153046325992127683Briefinglist1"><span lang="EN-GB">&#8220;When I was looking at existing enforcement decisions and pending cases, I also came to another conclusion,&#8221; she also said.  &#8220;<u></u><u></u></span><u></u><span lang="EN-GB">So, we have penalties or decisions against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/19/french-court-slaps-down-googles-appeal-against-57m-gdpr-fine/">Google</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/irelands-draft-gdpr-decision-against-facebook-branded-a-joke/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/whatsapp-faces-267m-fine-for-breaching-europes-gdpr/">WhatsApp</a>.</span></p>
<p class="m_9153046325992127683Briefinglist1"><u></u><u></u><u></u><span lang="EN-GB">&#8220;To me this means that clearly there is a problem with compliance culture among those companies that live off our personal data. D<u></u><u></u></span><u></u><span lang="EN-GB">espite the fact that they have the best legal teams, presence in Brussels and spent countless hours discussing with us the GDPR. <u></u><u></u></span><u></u><span lang="EN-GB">Sadly, I fear this is not privacy by design.<u></u><u></u></span></p>
<p><u></u><span lang="EN-GB">&#8220;</span><u></u><span lang="EN-GB">I think it is high time for those companies to take protection of personal data seriously. I want to see full compliance, not legal tricks. It’s time not to hide behind small print, but tackle the challenges head on.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>In parallel, an influential advisor to the bloc&#8217;s top court has <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2021-12/cp210216en.pdf">today</a> published an opinion which states that EU law does not preclude consumer protection agencies from bringing representative actions at a national level &#8212; following a referral by a German court in a case against Facebook Ireland &#8212; which, if the CJEU&#8217;s judges agree, could open up a fresh wave of challenges to tech giants&#8217; misuse of people&#8217;s data without the need to funnel complaints through the single point of failure of gatekeeper regulators like Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook&#8217;s lead EU privacy supervisor hit with corruption complaint&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/facebooks-lead-eu-privacy-supervisor-hit-with-corruption-complaint/embed/#?secret=Ga438rGsSB" data-secret="Ga438rGsSB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>Towards centralized privacy oversight?</h2>
<p>On paper, EU law provides people in the region with a suite of rights and protections attached to their data. And while the regulation has attracted huge international attention, as other regions grapple with how to protect people in an age of data-mining giants, the problem for many GDPR critics, as it stands, is that the law decentralizes oversight of these rules and rights to a patchwork of supervisory agencies at the EU Member State level.</p>
<p>While this can work well for cases involving locally bounded services, major problems arise where complaints span borders within the EU &#8212; as is always the case with tech giants&#8217; (global) services. This is because a one-stop-shop (OSS) mechanism kicks in, ostensibly to reduce the administrative burden for businesses.</p>
<p>But it also enables a huge get-out clause for tech giants, allowing them to forum shop for a &#8216;friendly&#8217; regulator through their choice of where to locate their regional HQ. And working from a local EU base, corporate giants can use investment and job creation in that Member State as a lever to work against and erode national political will to press for vigorous oversight of their European business at the local authority level.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my view, it does take too long to address the key questions around processing of personal data for big tech,&#8221; said Jourová giving a keynote speech to the Forum Europe data protection &amp; privacy conference. &#8220;Yes, I understand the lack of resources. I understand there is no pan-European procedural law to help the cross-border cases. I understand that the first cases need to be rock-solid because they will be challenged in court.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I want to be honest &#8212; we are in the crunch time now. Either we will all collectively show that GDPR enforcement is effective or it will have to change. And there is no way back to decentralised model that was there before the GDPR. Any potential changes will go towards more centralisation, bigger role of the EDPB [European Data Protection Board] or Commission.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jourová added that the &#8220;pressure&#8221; to make enforcement effective &#8220;is already here&#8221; &#8212; pointing to debate around incoming legislation that will update the EU&#8217;s rules around ecommerce, and emphasizing that, on the Digital Services Act, Member States have been advocating for enforcement change &#8212; and &#8220;want to see more central role of the European Commission&#8221;.</p>
<p>Point being that if there&#8217;s political will for structural changes to centralize EU enforcement among Member States, the Commission has the powers to propose the necessary amendments &#8212; and will hardly turn its nose up at being asked to take on more responsibility itself.</p>
<p>Jourová&#8217;s remarks are a notable step up on her approach to the thorny issue of GDPR enforcement back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">summer 2020</a> &#8212; when, at the two year review mark of the regulation entering into application, she was still talking about the need to properly resource DPAs &#8212; in order that they could &#8220;step up their work&#8221; and deliver &#8220;vigorous but uniform enforcement&#8221;, as she put it then.</p>
<p>Now, in the dying days of 2021 &#8212; with a still massive backlog of decisions yet to be issued around cross-border cases, some of which are highly strategic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">targeting adtech platforms&#8217; core surveillance business model</a> (Jourová&#8217;s speech, for example, noted that 809 procedures related to the OSS have been triggered but only 290 Final Decisions have been issued) &#8212; the Commission appears to be signalling that it&#8217;s finally running out of patience on enforcement.</p>
<p>And that it is already eyeing a Plan B to make the GDPR truly effective.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="tlg1RBmPlH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/irelands-draft-gdpr-decision-against-facebook-branded-a-joke/">Ireland&#8217;s draft GDPR decision against Facebook branded a joke</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Criticism of weak enforcement against tech giants has been a rising chorus in Europe for years. Most recently frustration with regulatory inaction led privacy campaigner Max Schrems&#8217; not-for-profit, noyb, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/facebooks-lead-eu-privacy-supervisor-hit-with-corruption-complaint/">file a complaint of criminal corruption</a> against the GDPR&#8217;s most infamous bottleneck: Ireland&#8217;s DPC, accusing the regulator of engaging in &#8220;procedural blackmail&#8221; which it suggested would help Facebook by keeping key developments out of the public eye, among other eye-raising charges.</p>
<p>The Irish regulator has faced the strongest criticism of all the EU DPAs over its role in hampering effective GDPR enforcement.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s not the only authority to be accused of creating a bottleneck by letting major complaints pile up on its desk and taking a painstaking ice-age to investigate complaints and issue decisions (assuming it opens an investigation at all).</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s ICO &#8212; when the country was still in the EU &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/privacy-experts-slam-uks-disastrous-failure-to-tackle-unlawful-adtech/">did nothing</a> about complaints against real-time-bidding&#8217;s abuse of people&#8217;s data, for example, despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/">sounding a public warning over behavioral ads&#8217; unlawfulness as early as 2019</a>. While Belgium&#8217;s DPA has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/iab-europes-ad-tracking-consent-framework-found-to-fail-gdpr-standard/">taking a painstaking amount of time</a> to issue a final decision on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/iab-europe-tcf-gdpr-breach-belgium/">IAB Europe&#8217;s TCF&#8217;s failure to comply with the GDPR</a>. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But Ireland&#8217;s central role in regulating most of big tech means it attracts the most flak. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="O3CeWN3oNv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/iab-europe-tcf-gdpr-breach-belgium/">IAB Europe says it&#8217;s expecting to be found in breach of GDPR</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;IAB Europe says it&#8217;s expecting to be found in breach of GDPR&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/iab-europe-tcf-gdpr-breach-belgium/embed/#?secret=O3CeWN3oNv" data-secret="O3CeWN3oNv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The sheer number of tech giants that have converged on Ireland &#8212; wooed by low corporate tax rates (likely with the added cherry of business-friendly data oversight) &#8212; gives it an outsized role in overseeing what&#8217;s done with European&#8217;s data.</p>
<p>Hence Ireland has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/googles-lead-eu-regulator-opens-formal-privacy-probe-of-its-adtech/">open investigations</a> into Apple, Google, Facebook and many others &#8212; yet has only issued two final decisions on cross-border cases so far (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/twitter-fined-550k-over-a-data-breach-in-irelands-first-major-gdpr-decision/">Twitter</a> last year; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/whatsapp-faces-267m-fine-for-breaching-europes-gdpr/">WhatsApp</a> this year).</p>
<p>Both of those decisions went through a dispute mechanism that&#8217;s also baked into the GDPR &#8212; which kicks in when other EU DPAs don&#8217;t agree with a draft decision by the lead authority.</p>
<p>That mechanism further slowed down the DPC&#8217;s enforcement in those cases &#8212; but substantially cranked up the intervention the two companies ultimately faced. Ireland had wanted to be a lot more lenient vs the collective verdict once all of the bloc&#8217;s oversight bodies had had their say.</p>
<p>That too, critics say, demonstrates the DPC&#8217;s regulatory capture by platform power.</p>
<p>An opinion piece in yesterday&#8217;s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/irelands-the-wrong-privacy-watchdog-for-europe/2021/12/01/6a8d7b64-5274-11ec-83d2-d9dab0e23b7e_story.html">Washington Post</a> skewered the DPC as &#8220;the wrong privacy watchdog for Europe&#8221; &#8212; citing a study by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties that found it had only published decisions on about 2% of the 164 cross border cases it has taken on.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The number of complaints the DPC has chosen to entirely ignore &#8212; i.e. by not opening a formal investigation &#8212; or else to quietly shutter (&#8220;resolve&#8221;) without issuing a decision or taking any enforcement action is likely considerably higher. </span></p>
<p>The agency is shielded by a very narrow application of Freedom of Information law, which applies only in relation to DPC records pertaining to the &#8220;general administration&#8221; of its office. So when TechCrunch asked the DPC, last December, how many times it had used GDPR powers such as the ability to order a ban on processing it declined to respond to our FOIs &#8212; arguing the information did not fall under Ireland&#8217;s implementation of the law.</p>
<p>Silence and stonewalling only go so far, though.</p>
<p>Calls for root and branch reform of the DPC specifically, and enforcement of the GDPR more generally, can now be heard from Ireland&#8217;s own parliament all the way up to the European Commission. And big tech&#8217;s game of tying EU regulators in knots looks as if it&#8217;s &#8212; gradually, gradually &#8212; getting toward the end of its rope.</p>
<p>What comes next is an interesting question. Last month the European Data Protection Superviso (EDPS) <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/publications/brochures/future-data-protection-effective-enforcement_en">announced</a> a conference on the future of &#8220;effective&#8221; digital enforcement &#8212; which will take place in June 2022 &#8212; and which he said would discuss best practice and also &#8220;explore alternative models of enforcement for the digital future&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are ambitious,&#8221; said Wojciech Wiewiorowski as he announced the conference. &#8220;There is much scope for discussion and much potential improvement on the way current governance models are implemented in practice. We envisage a dialogue across different fields of regulation &#8212; from data protection to competition, digital markets and services, and artificial intelligence as well &#8212; both in the EU, and Europe as a continent, but also on the global level.&#8221;</p>
<p>Discussion of &#8220;different&#8221; and &#8220;alternative&#8221; models of enforcement will be a focus of the event, per Wiewiorowski &#8212; who further specified that this will include discussion of &#8220;a more centralized approach&#8221;. So the EDPS and the Commission appear to be singing a similar tune on reforming GDPR enforcement.</p>
<p>As well as the Commission itself (potentially) taking on an enforcement role in the future &#8212; perhaps specifically on major, cross border cases related to big tech, in order to beef up GDPR&#8217;s application against the most powerful offenders (as is already proposed in the case of the DSA and enforcing those rules against &#8216;very large online platforms&#8217;; aka vLOPs) &#8212; the GDPR steering and advisory body, the EDPB, also looks set to play an increasingly strategic and important role.</p>
<p>Indeed, it already has a &#8216;last resort&#8217; decision making power to resolve disputes over cross border GDPR enforcement &#8212; and Ireland&#8217;s intransigence has led to it exercising this power for the first time.</p>
<p>In the future, the Board&#8217;s role could expand further if EU lawmakers decide that more centralization is the only way to deliver effective enforcement against tech giants that have become experts in exhausting regulators with bad faith arguments and whack-a-mole procedures, in order to delay, defer and deny compliance with European law.</p>
<p>The EDPB&#8217;s chair, Andrea Jelinek, was also speaking at the Forum Europe conference today. Asked for her thoughts on how GDPR enforcement could improve, including problematic elements like the OSS, she cautioned that change will be a &#8220;long term project&#8221;, while simultaneously agreeing there are notable &#8220;challenges&#8221; at the point where national oversight intersects with the needs of cross border enforcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enforcing at a national level and at the same time resolving cross border cases is time and resource intensive,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Supervisory authorities need to carry out investigations, observe procedural rules, coordinate and share information with other supervisory authorities. For the current system to work properly it is of vital important that supervisory authorities have enough resources and staff.</p>
<p>&#8220;The differences in national administrative procedures and the fact that in some Member States no deadlines are foreseen for handling a case also creates an obstacle to the efficient functioning of the OSS.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jelinek made a point of emphasizing that EDPB has been taking action to try to remedy some of issues identified &#8212; implementing what she described as &#8220;a series of practical solutions&#8221; to tackle problems around enforcement.</p>
<p>She said this has included developing (last year) a co-ordinated enforcement framework to facilitate joint actions (&#8220;in a flexible and coordinated manner&#8221;) &#8212; such as launching enforcement sweeps and joint investigations.</p>
<p>The EPBD is also establishing a pilot project to provide a pool of experts to support investigations and enforcement activities &#8220;of significant common interest&#8221;, she noted, predicting: &#8220;This will enhance the cooperation and solidarity between all the supervisory authorities by addressing their operational needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Finally we should not forget that the GDPR is a long term project and so is strengthening cooperation between supervisory authorities,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Any transformation of the GDPR will take years. I think the best solution is therefore to deploy the GDPR fully &#8212; it is likely that most of the issues identified by Member States and stakeholders will benefit from more experience in the application of the regulation in the coming years.&#8221;</p>
<p>However it is already well over three years since GDPR came into application. So many EU citizens may query the logic of waiting <em>years</em> <em>more</em> for regulators to figure out how to jointly work together to get the job of upholding people&#8217;s rights done. Not least because this enforcement impasse leaves data-mining tech giants free to direct their vast data-enabled wealth and engineering resource at developing new &#8216;innovations&#8217; &#8212; to better evade legal restrictions on what they can do with people&#8217;s data.</p>
<p>One thing is clear: The next wave of big tech regulatory evasion will come dressed up in claims of privacy &#8220;innovation&#8221; from the get-go.</p>
<p>Indeed, that is already how adtech giants like Google are trying to re-channel regulators&#8217; attention from enforcing against their core attention-manipulation, surveillance-based business model.</p>
<p>Google SVP Kent Walker also took to the (virtual) conference stage this morning for a keynote slot in which he argued that the novel ad targeting technologies Google is developing under its &#8220;Privacy Sandbox&#8221; badge (such as FloCs; aka <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/google-isnt-testing-flocs-in-europe-yet/">federated learning of cohorts</a>) will provide the answer to what big (ad)tech likes to claim is an inherent tension between European fundamental rights like privacy and economic growth.</p>
<p>The truth, as ever, is a lot more nuanced than that. For one thing, there are plenty of ways to target ads that don&#8217;t require processing people&#8217;s data. But as most of Europe&#8217;s regulators remain bogged down in a mire of corporate capture, under-resourcing, culture cowardice/risk aversion, internecine squabbles and, at times, a sheer lack of national political will to enforce the law against the world&#8217;s wealthiest companies, the adtech duopoly is sounding cockily confident that it will be allowed to carry on and reset the terms of the game in its own interests once again.</p>
<p>(The added irony here is that Google is currently working under the oversight of the UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority and ICO on shaping behavioral remedies attached to its Sandbox proposals &#8212; and has said that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">these commitments will be applied globally</a> if the UK is minded to accept them; which does risk tarnishing the GDPR&#8217;s geopolitical shine, given the UK is no longer a member of the EU&#8230; )</p>
<p>For EU citizens, it could well mean that &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">once again</a> &#8212; it&#8217;s up to the CJEU to come to the rescue of their fundamental rights &#8212; assuming the court ends up concurring with advocate general Richard de la Tour&#8217;s opinion today that the GDPR:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8221; &#8230; does not preclude national legislation which allows consumer protection associations to bring legal proceedings against the person alleged to be responsible for an infringement of the protection of personal data, on the basis of the prohibition of unfair commercial practices, the infringement of a law relating to consumer protection or the prohibition of the use of invalid general terms and conditions, provided that the objective of the representative action in question is to ensure observance of the rights which the persons affected by the contested processing derive directly from that regulation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Consumer protection agencies being able to pursue representative legal actions to defend fundamental rights against tech giants&#8217; self interest &#8212; at the Member State level, and therefore, all across the EU &#8212; could actually unblock GDPR enforcement via a genuinely decentralized wave of enforcement that&#8217;s able to route around the damage of captured gatekeepers and call out big adtech&#8217;s manipulative tricks in court.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At today&#8217;s AWS re:Invent keynote, Amazon CTO Werner Vogels <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/use-amazon-ec2-m1-mac-instances-to-build-test-macos-ios-ipados-tvos-and-watchos-apps/">announced</a> that AWS will now offer M1 Mac minis as part of its EC2 compute service.</p>
<p>It was only last year, that AWS first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/aws-brings-the-mac-mini-to-its-cloud/">brought Mac minis to its cloud</a>. Using the Thunderbolt port, these minis connect to the AWS Nitro System, which helps make them available in the EC2 cloud, just like any other instance. The minis used here are the standard M1 8 core machines with 16 GiB of memory.</p>
<p>The new instances will be available in two regions (US West &#8211; Oregon and US East &#8211; North Virginia) for $0.6498 per hour, with support for discounts through AWS&#8217; Savings Plans, too. AWS promises that these new machines offer a &#8220;60% better price performance over the x86-based EC2 Mac instances for iPhone and Mac app build workloads.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242200" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2242211" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mac2-GUI-via-VNC-1024x761-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2242211" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2242211" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mac2-GUI-via-VNC-1024x761-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="761" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mac2-GUI-via-VNC-1024x761-1.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mac2-GUI-via-VNC-1024x761-1.png?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mac2-GUI-via-VNC-1024x761-1.png?resize=300,223 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mac2-GUI-via-VNC-1024x761-1.png?resize=768,571 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mac2-GUI-via-VNC-1024x761-1.png?resize=680,505 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mac2-GUI-via-VNC-1024x761-1.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2242211" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> AWS</p></div></p>
<p>The use case for these machines hasn&#8217;t changed with this launch. Just like with the original Mac instances, the idea here is to provide developers with the hardware to build and test their applications for Mac OS and iOS apps.</p>
<p>This launch is probably no surprise to most, given that the M1 Mac minis were already rolling out when the first Mac instances launched. At the time, AWS said M1 machines will arrive &#8220;early next year.&#8221; It looks like it took a bit longer to roll these out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://mendel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mendel</a>, a corporate spend management solution for enterprises in Latin America, announced today that it has secured $35 million in debt and equity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mexico-based startup closed the $15 million Series A round and $20 million debt financing after participating in Y Combinator’s Winter 2021 cohort. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ALLVP and </span><a href="https://www.infinityvc.capital/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infinity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ventures, a firm founded by a trio of ex-PayPal execs, co-led the equity raise. A number of angel investors also participated including Airbase Founder and CEO Thejo Kote, Auth0 co-founder and CTO Matias Woloski, Mercado Libre CFO Pedro Arnt, Kavak COO  and Bain Capital’s Keri Gohman, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better Tomorrow Ventures, Lee Fixel’s Addition, Broadhaven and Magma Partners are also backers of the company.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242159" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mendel’s mission is straightforward: to reinvent corporate spend management by automating most of the operations for an enterprise CFO that are currently done manually. Or put even more simply, it wants to be a one-stop shop for all B2B spend. Alan Karpovsky &amp; Alejandro Zecler (who both previously founded and sold other startups) started the company late last year and Helena Polyblank (CPO) and Gonzalo Castiglione (CTO) later joined as co-founders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you look at all the different areas of any enterprise company in LatAm, the CFO function is clearly the one that has had the least innovation,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karpovsky. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike CMOs who have all sorts of media optimization platforms, content creation tools and social listening software, and CTOs who have countless frameworks, repositories, CI and code-enhancement collaboration tools, CFOs still rely mostly on spreadsheets and ERPs &#8211; and in some companies even fax machines.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/as-corporate-cards-are-subsumed-into-software-airbase-posts-rapid-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">corporate spend space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an increasingly crowded one. Ramp and Brex have both raised large rounds this year, and TripActions pivoted last year beyond travel to general expense management. Divvy got acquired by Bill.com. Mendel, however, likens its model to being more similar to that of Airbase, a U.S.-based corporate spend startup that in June closed </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/airbase-raises-60m-as-the-corporate-spend-market-segments-matures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $60 million Series B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Menlo Ventures and whose CEO is an investor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our current solution is like ‘Ramp for Latin America for enterprises,’ ” Karpovsky told TechCrunch. “In the U.S., all these companies are targeting the startups/SMB sector. We are deeply focused on providing enterprise solutions for big companies where the CFO doesn&#8217;t wake up every morning thinking ‘How can I get more cash back’?” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As corporate cards are subsumed into software, Airbase posts rapid growth&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/as-corporate-cards-are-subsumed-into-software-airbase-posts-rapid-growth/embed/#?secret=KKwBSRjArJ" data-secret="KKwBSRjArJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mendel says its software gives finance teams a way to manage card transactions in real time, set</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> granular spend rules and track spending from a central dashboard. Its roadmap will go beyond expense management to include accounts payable automation, employee cash advance and factoring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of Mendel’s strategy is to attract customers with high payment volume and low credit risk, while at the same time charging a SaaS fee for the usage of their platform. The startup, which is focused on the Mexican market for now, has started strong &#8212; onboarding more than 150 clients (such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercado Libre, PetCo and Telcel) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the first months since it launched earlier this year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mendel says its payment volume (GTV) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has increased by 100x in the last three months. Currently, its  payment volume is growing 2x week over week, according to Karpovsky. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The B2B payment market in Mexico is a massive opportunity, the company believes, especially considering how few payments are made by cards.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presently, Mendel </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has 70 employees and it expects to end 2022 with 200. It also plans to use its new capital to “invest heavily” in product development, including expansion into broader B2B payments, as well as toward marketing and awareness. Money will also go toward developing new business verticals and partnerships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its investors are naturally bullish on the company’s potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ALLVP’s Federico Antoni said his firm has been looking at the corporate spend and financial services space for years, viewing it as a “huge opportunity” in LatAm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it came across Mendel, he was impressed by the team’s vision to “build the next Nubank for corporates.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The mission and vision for Mendel resonated with us immediately,” he told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infinity&#8217;s Mario Ruiz agrees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Latin America, larger enterprises are underserved by incumbents, and Mendel is democratizing access to best-in-class software and payments,&#8221; he wrote via email. &#8220;As we have seen with the success of other corporate card and expense management startups globally, we believe that Mendel has the team, technology, and tenacity to become the leader in Latin America.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better Tomorrow Ventures’ Sheel Mohnot said his firm was drawn to invest in Mendel because its “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">product really needs to exist” in LatAm where “no one else is going after” the problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve seen a lot of success with this model in the states and there is more of a need in LatAm &#8212; companies don’t just give cards to everyone, the spend controls are important,” he said. “These guys have previously built a successful business in a similar business and had already signed on Mercado Libre as a customer before we led the seed round.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you bring up bad news about the <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1466145468937912323">price of technology stocks on Twitter</a>, very helpful people will send you multi-year charts that put recent declines into historical context. Yes, thank you; I was not aware you could zoom out.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The instinctual need to proclaim that selloffs of tech stocks don&#8217;t matter is either a bad-faith argument or poorly disguised fear. More on that in a moment. Regardless, the recent negative price movement of tech stocks &#8212; and software shares in particular &#8212; matters.</p>
<p>Why? Because we are not only seeing software stocks flirt with bear-market territory in technical terms, but also a pretty notable pullback in the value of even the <em>fastest-growing</em> technology companies. This means that public valuation multiples &#8212; key indicators for yet-private unicorns and younger startups &#8212; are shrinking.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2229732 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Have valuations shifted enough to slow the current venture capital bonanza? Probably not. But we could be closer to that tipping point than you&#8217;d think.</p>
<h2>Declines</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://cloudindex.bvp.com/companies">Bessemer Cloud Index</a> is trackable on the public markets thanks to the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WCLD?p=WCLD&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch">WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund</a>, which is essentially a trading version of the company set.</p>
<p>After reaching a 52-week high of $65.51 last month, the market value of the basket of software companies slipped to $53.00 as of this morning. That&#8217;s a decline of 19.1%, or 90 basis points under the 20% required for a particular asset, or asset collection, to reach technical bear-market territory.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re close, in other words.</p>

<p>That status quo in cross-strait relations dates back to 1979, when the U.S. switched diplomatic recognition from the Republic of China, based in Taiwan, to the People’s Republic of China that had taken over the mainland. China has long wanted to reunite with the island, which it views as a “rogue province,” but while Beijing has never ruled out the possibility of achieving this goal by force, it has been deterred from doing so by Washington’s strategic ambiguity as to whether it would come to the island’s defense. In recent years, the situation has become even more complex because of Taiwan’s essential role in the semiconductor industry.</p>
<h2>Taiwan’s importance to the global semiconductor industry</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20210305-10693.html">According</a> to TrendForce, a Taipei-based research firm, Taiwan’s semiconductor contract manufacturers accounted for 63% of total global foundry market share in 2020. A detailed breakdown shows that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s largest contract chipmaker, alone contributed 54% of the global foundry market share. More recent <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20210831-10914.html">data</a> shows that even with its Fab 14 (P7) experiencing manufacturing disruptions, TSMC still made up almost 53% of global foundry market share for the second quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>In addition to producing the <em>most</em> chips, Taiwan’s foundries (including TSMC) produce the world’s <em>most advanced</em> chips, which can be found in all the highest-tech machinery — everything from cellphones to fighter jets. In fact, TSMC is responsible for an astonishing <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/10/16/secretive-giant-tsmcs-100-billion-plan-to-fix-the-chip-shortage.html">92%</a> of the world’s <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/The-Semiconductor-Supply-Chain-Issue-Brief.pdf">advanced</a> chips production, making Taiwan’s semiconductor industry arguably the world’s most important.</p>
<p>And this means both the U.S. and China are dependent on it. According to a Nikkei <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Exclusive-Washington-pressures-TSMC-to-make-chips-in-US">report</a>, TSMC produces computer chips used in F-35 fighter jets, high-performance chips for U.S. military suppliers such as Xilinx, and DoD-approved “military grade” chips. While the exact scale at which the U.S. military is dependent on Taiwanese chips is not known, it is significant enough that the U.S. government has pressured TSMC to shift its production of military-use chips to U.S. soil.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>American industry, too, depends on Taiwanese semiconductors. It is believed that TSMC is the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/10/16/secretive-giant-tsmcs-100-billion-plan-to-fix-the-chip-shortage.html">sole provider</a> for Apple’s 5-nanometer processors, used in <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/apple-arm-using-80-of-tsmc-capacity-for-most-advanced-5nm-chips-61864034">various</a> Apple products including the iPhone 12, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. TSMC also <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-is-reportedly-amassing-a15-chips-for-the-iphone-13-launch/">manufactures</a> the A15 Bionic chips found inside Apple’s newest gadgets: the iPhone 13 and iPad mini. Of course, it’s not only Apple; TSMC’s customers also include major American companies, such as Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD and Intel.</p>
<p>China is also dependent on foreign chips; in 2020, it <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/technology/china-stockpiles-chips-and-chip-making-machines-to-resist-u-s">imported</a> around $300 billion worth. Unsurprisingly, Taiwan was the leading source. Despite a major effort to reduce its dependence on foreign chips, Chinese chip independence is a <a href="https://rhg.com/research/china-chips/">long way</a> off; its most advanced homegrown semiconductor manufacturer, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), is several generations behind TSMC. As SMIC tests a 7-nanometer chip, its Taiwanese rival has already moved on to the 3-nanometer process.</p>
<p>As a result, Chinese firms have no choice but to go to Taiwan. For example, Huawei, one of China’s leading tech firms, is <a href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2021/03/09/2003753477">believed</a> to have been TSMC’s second-largest customer in 2020, <a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_7018934">relying</a> almost totally on TSMC’s supplies for its 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer processors. For a sense of scale, Huawei accounted for 12% of the foundry’s total revenue last year.</p>
<h2>War by other means</h2>
<p>One need only look to earlier this year to understand just how vulnerable the semiconductor industry is. A “relatively muted” quarter, caused in part by a power outage, lost TSMC 1.6% of its global market share and contributed to the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/03/semiconductor-chip-shortage-could-extend-through-2022-marvell-ceo.html">ongoing semiconductor shortage</a>. Active interference by geopolitical actors in the industry could have much greater consequences.</p>
<p>The worst-case scenario, of course, is a cross-strait military confrontation, which would likely sever the chip supply chain altogether. But this isn’t the only possibility. As Taiwan is well aware, by exporting chips en masse to China, it is bolstering China’s technological development along with growing its own economy. If Taiwan were to take steps to reduce its reliance on China, for example by signing a free trade deal with the U.S., Taiwan might decide to cut off its chip trade with China entirely.</p>
<p>This would be an unaffordable situation for Beijing. Consider this: Since TSMC <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Huawei-crackdown/TSMC-halts-new-Huawei-orders-after-US-tightens-restrictions">halted</a> new orders from Huawei in response to the Trump administration’s tighter U.S. export controls, Huawei has had to <a href="https://asiatimes.com/2020/08/huawei-to-stop-smartphone-chip-production/">stop</a> the production of its high-end Kirin 9000 chipset using the 5-nanometer process. Moreover, the shortage of high-end chips will soon make Huawei unable to continue providing 5G-enabled cellphones, <a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_14646642">according</a> to one company official.</p>
<p>A <em>total</em> loss of chips from Taiwan would call into question the ongoing development of China’s entire tech industry. This would not only infuriate China but pose a threat to its domestic stability, giving the Chinese government more incentive to take the island by force.</p>
<p>If some scenarios cut China off from Taiwanese chips, others would cut off the U.S. In a “peaceful reunification” scenario (where Taiwan is reunited with China without the use of force), Taiwanese foundries would likely find themselves under control of the Chinese government, posing a strategic problem for the U.S. The Chinese government could ask the foundries to stop exporting chips or put restrictions on how many chips they can export — chips the U.S. government needs to mobilize America’s most advanced military equipment.</p>
<p>And if TSMC stopped or limited providing chips to American companies, these companies could well find themselves in a situation similar to that of Huawei now (无芯可用 or “no chips to use,” as the new phrase goes in Chinese). While it is unlikely this would spur the U.S. to invade Taiwan to “de-unify” it, it may seek other means such as imposing sanctions on China to retaliate, further escalating tensions.</p>
<p>Needless to say, any of these scenarios would cause disruptions in global supply chains, leading to serious consequences for the entire world.</p>
<h2>Taiwan’s semiconductor industry — shield or Achilles’ heel?</h2>
<p>While Taiwan undoubtedly enjoys its current semiconductor dominance and the leverage that gives it over both China and the U.S., neither feel comfortable with the status quo — and both have taken measures to make the situation more favorable to themselves. The U.S. has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/technology/trump-tsmc-us-chip-facility.html?_ga=2.133746764.397787180.1635895752-14954339.1635895752">persuaded</a> TSMC to build chip factories in the country while China has <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/China-hires-over-100-TSMC-engineers-in-push-for-chip-leadership">hired</a> more than 100 veteran engineers and managers from TSMC to boost its own pursuit of cutting-edge chip manufacturing.</p>
<p>This leaves an uncomfortable future for Taiwan. If Taiwan produced more of its semiconductors offshore, the island itself might attract less international attention. However, this could also give the U.S. less incentive to support Taiwan’s defense. A more widely distributed supply chain might also lessen a major barrier for China to take the island by force. For Taiwan, these are difficult but existential questions to answer.</p>
<p>Amid all this uncertainty, at least Taiwan’s position seems secure in the short term: Its nearest competitors in both China and the U.S. are still years behind, and even if they did catch up, fabs famously take years of planning and investment to get running. Absent any change in the status quo, it is unlikely either will be able to shift away from the island’s chip supply in the near term. But what is certain now more than ever, is that Chinese and American strategies on Taiwan will have to factor in the role of the island’s semiconductor industry.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Grab, the Southeast Asian super app, <a href="https://investors.grab.com/news-releases/news-release-details/grab-trade-nasdaq-following-successful-business-combination">announced</a> last night that it completed its business combination with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Altimeter Growth. The result? Grab will begin trading today on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol &#8220;GRAB.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it raised a pile of money in the process. Billions, in fact.</p>

<p>The Grab SPAC failed to, ahem, grab our attention during the recent IPO rush, so it&#8217;s the right time to sit back and catch up. This morning, we&#8217;re going to refresh our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/grab-to-go-public-in-the-us-following-40-billion-spac-deal/">memory of the Grab-SPAC deal</a>, check in on the company&#8217;s Q3 2021 performance, and yammer about the company&#8217;s early trading. Which, spoiler, is looking good.</p>
<h2><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220368 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Grab&#8217;s SPAC deal</h2>
<p>One issue that many SPAC-led deals endured lately is redemptions. In essence, SPAC backers can opt to get their money back ahead of a business combination (<a href="https://www.gtlaw.com/en/insights/2021/6/published-articles/redemption-rights-bij-spacs">more here</a>). This has led to some blank-check deals not bringing as much capital to bear as initially expected.</p>
<p>In the case of Grab, redemptions were not a problem. As the company <a href="https://investors.grab.com/news-releases/news-release-details/altimeter-growth-corp-shareholders-approve-business-combination">recently reported</a>: &#8220;Shareholder redemptions were effectively 0%, at 0.02%.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, we should expect that the Grab SPAC deal did in fact raise the money we anticipated for the super app. Indeed, as Grab wrote last night, the &#8220;transaction raised gross proceeds of US$4.5 billion in the largest-ever U.S. public market debut by a Southeast Asian company.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s about half the reason we care about the blank-check-led debut of Grab; it&#8217;s not just a big deal for a big company, it&#8217;s the <em>biggest</em> deal for its region, and it&#8217;s heading into its first trading session having received a huge vote of confidence from its SPAC backers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank-based digital creation platform <a href="https://picsart.com/">Picsart</a>, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/picsart-raises-130m-from-softbank-becomes-unicorn-on-the-back-of-its-visual-creator-tools/">hit uniciorn status</a>, announced today it&#8217;s acquiring the research and development company <a href="https://deepcraft.io/">DeepCraft</a>. The deal is a combination of both cash and stock and is in the seven-figure range, but the exact terms aren&#8217;t being disclosed.</p>
<p>Picsart today offers a range of digital creation and editing tools aimed at both consumers and professionals alike that make photo and video editing more fun and approachable. The company believes DeepCraft&#8217;s A.I. technical talent and its breakthroughs in computer vision and machine learning will enhance Picsart&#8217;s own A.I. technology and help the company better support the recent growth of video creation on its service. The team will also help to complement Picsart&#8217;s A.I. research and development arm, PAIR (Picsart AI Research) with additional senior resources, the company says.</p>
<p>Founded in 2017, Armenia-based DeepCraft specialized in video and image processing, while Picsart was the country&#8217;s first unicorn. Its co-founders, Armen Abroyan (CEO) and Vardges Hovhannisyan (CTO) have spent more than 20 years in A.I. and machine learning, and are well-known in their local community for their expertise. Abroyan previously held positions as the Deputy Minister for the Ministry of High Tech Industry Republic of Armenia, Lead AI Architect at RedKite, and Senior Software Developer at Synopsys. Meanwhile, Hovhannisyan spent 13 years as a senior R&amp;D engineer at Synopsys.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242123" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At DeepCraft, the team worked with a number of clients on a contract basis, including Krisp, PatriotOne, and even the Armenian Government. This work has wrapped up and the team will now begin working from Picsart&#8217;s offices in Yerevan. In total, the full DeepCraft team of eight senior machine learning and video engineers will be joining Picsart as full-time employees, as a result of the deal.</p>
<p>Picsart had first entered the video market in 2018 with the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200722005090/en/PicsArt-Acquires-Motion-Based-Video-Effects-Company-D%E2%80%99efekt">acquisition</a> of EFEKT (previously D&#8217;efekt), and has seen usage surge in recent years &#8212; particularly as its app has been adopted by social media creators and e-commerce shops which use video. So far in 2021, Picsart has seen more than 180 million videos edited in its app &#8212; a 70% increase year-over-year. It now offers thousands of effects and dozens of video editing tools, and plans to grow this lineup as A.I. and cloud technology evolves, it says.</p>
<p>With DeepCraft, Picsart is particularly interested in how the team&#8217;s skillset and technology expertise can help it move forward with its support of video, which the company says will be a significant focus in 2022.</p>
<p>However, Picsart is not acquiring specific IP from DeepCraft as part of this deal, the company told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Picsart already had a relationship with DeepCraft ahead of the deal as the two had been collaborating on various technology developments.</p>
<p>&#8220;DeepCraft is a unique team of deep technology engineers, and we’ve already been working with them to build our core technologies for over a year,&#8221; said Picsart co-founder and CTO Artavazd Mehrabyan. &#8220;As we invest even further into advancing our video capabilities, we are confident the DeepCraft team will play a significant role in building the future of video,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The DeepCraft deal is the first acquisition from Picsart since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/picsart-raises-130m-from-softbank-becomes-unicorn-on-the-back-of-its-visual-creator-tools/">raising</a> its $130 million Series C round in August led by SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2. The round lifted the company to unicorn status, up from its prior valuation of around $600 million in 2019.</p>
<p><em>Correction, 12/2/21 1pm et: The original version of the article implied DeepCraft was the country&#8217;s first unicorn; it is Picsart. We apologize for the error. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">IRL, the SoftBank-backed social app and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/messaging-social-network-irl-hits-unicorn-status-with-softbank-led-170m-series-c/">recent unicorn</a>, is today announcing its first acquisition. The company is purchasing, for an undisclosed sum, the &#8220;digital nutrition&#8221; company <a href="https://aebeze.com/">AaBeZe Labs</a> and its portfolio of IP with the goal of making IRL a healthier and more ethically designed social networking app.</p>
<p>AaBeZe&#8217;s founders Michael Phillips Moskowitz, the former &#8220;Global Chief Curator&#8221; of eBay, and former Medium Product Lead Brad Artizinega, along with other members of the AeBeZe team, will also now join <a href="https://www.irl.com/">IRL</a>, where they&#8217;ll focus on building its discovery systems and other product features.</p>
<p>Used primarily by younger people under the age of 25 who aren&#8217;t active on Facebook, IRL combines social calendaring, group messaging, and events. While the company had originally focused on helping users discover real-world events, it shifted its focus to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/streaming-events-calendar/">virtual events</a> amid the pandemic. Today, it offers both, and has also grown to become a more full-fledged social networking app thanks to more recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/now-with-over-10m-monthly-users-irl-turns-its-events-website-into-a-social-network/">introductions</a> of features like group chat, user profiles, group calendars, and cross-platform support, among other things.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241695" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Before the acquisition, IRL had plotted a course to monetization that wouldn&#8217;t include advertising, which it sees as problematic to building a healthier social app. Advertising-driven revenue requires companies to design experiences that addict users in order to increase the time spent in their apps. IRL instead aims to make money by connecting users to their interests &#8212; like a paid subscription to a community or the purchase of event tickets, for example, where it can take a cut of the revenue generated by that sale.</p>
<p>It now sees the potential in using AaBeZe&#8217;s technology to make even smarter recommendations around the sorts of events and communities its users are interested in, while also being more transparent with users about why those recommendations are being made. This would set it apart from today&#8217;s social networks, where it&#8217;s not always clear why users are seeing the content that appears in their feeds.</p>

<p>AaBeZe Labs had developed a portfolio of IP, including solutions that were aimed at consumers, U.S. military personnel, and enterprise partners. This included digital products like the consumer-facing app <a href="https://aebeze.com/mobile-app">Moodrise</a>, for mood-tracking, a mobile tool called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/daybreak-by-aebeze-labs/id1484622225">Daybreak</a> <a href="https://moodrise.co/airforce">built</a> for the U.S. Air Force, and MoodTube, which analyzed YouTube content, and other things. The company had also has filed for 16 patents, three of which have been granted and 13 of which are in various stages of approval. And it owns the trademark, &#8220;Certified Digital Nutrition.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Much of its work involved learning how its understanding of being aware of users&#8217; &#8220;digital nutrition&#8221; and how that impacted our brain psychology. This knowledge, in turn, could be used to address and even prevent habits that led to problematic internet use and other riskier behavior.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2241762" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241762" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2241762" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-11-30-at-13.54.38.png?w=320" alt="" width="320" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-11-30-at-13.54.38.png 490w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-11-30-at-13.54.38.png?resize=71,150 71w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-11-30-at-13.54.38.png?resize=141,300 141w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-11-30-at-13.54.38.png?resize=320,680 320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-11-30-at-13.54.38.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241762" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> AaBeZe Labs/IRL</p></div></p>
<p>This is in contrast to how modern social networks, had been built to capitalize on the psychology of addictiveness &#8212; for example, a pull-to-refresh gesture or that delivers fresh content also delivers an addictive dose of dopamine. (The documentary &#8220;<a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/">The Social Dilemma</a>,&#8221; you may recall, detailed many of the ways big tech had designed products to manipulate their users.)</p>
<p>IRL was particularly interested in AaBeZee&#8217;s Daybreak, a mobile calendar where users tracked their mood over time. They could then choose daily sessions designed to elevate their mode by watching, listening, or tapping through specific doses of content.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2241768" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241768" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2241768" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-01-at-3.37.17-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="341" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-01-at-3.37.17-PM.jpg 2020w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-01-at-3.37.17-PM.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-01-at-3.37.17-PM.jpg?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-01-at-3.37.17-PM.jpg?resize=768,386 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-01-at-3.37.17-PM.jpg?resize=680,341 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-01-at-3.37.17-PM.jpg?resize=1536,771 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-01-at-3.37.17-PM.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241768" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Daybreak by AaBeZe Labs</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We are focusing on bringing intimacy to the internet, and essentially learning from our predecessors. Right now, social media uses these tactics of understanding dopamine release [and] serotonin release to essentially build habits and habitual patterns around things that are unhealthy for us,&#8221; explains IRL founder and CEO Abraham Shafi. &#8220;We&#8217;re very interested in <em>not</em> participating in that, but in fact, doing the literal opposite &#8212; which is helping you build healthy habits, helping you build meaningful habits not just with yourself, but with your friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shafi says IRL plans to integrate Daybeak&#8217;s technology into its app, so that one day, users could launch the app and then be matched to content based on how they&#8217;re feeling that day. Users might launch the app and be asked to report their mood, for instance, much like Daybreak&#8217;s users did.</p>
<p>&#8220;It actually only truly functions with direct input &#8212; that&#8217;ll be the way that we&#8217;re doing it. So there&#8217;s a clear understanding between the user and the content that they&#8217;re receiving,&#8221; Shafi says.</p>
<p>The company plans to roll out the first integrations of AaBeZe&#8217;s technology sometime in the first half of next year.</p>
<p>AaBeZe Labs was just over two years old at the time of acquisition and had raised a little over a million dollars from investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Launching today in beta, <a href="https://playgroundapp.com/">Playground</a> is a social platform that seeks to help people discover and develop community while empowering creators to monetize their audience. Already, the website has a wide variety of users like the <a href="https://playgroundapp.com/profile/mo-ma">Museum of Modern Art</a>, comedy host <a href="https://playgroundapp.com/profile/alexis">Alexis Gay</a>, the <a href="https://playgroundapp.com/profile/abolitionist-teaching-network">Abolitionist Teaching Network</a>, activist <a href="https://playgroundapp.com/profile/nupol-2">Nupol Kiazolu</a>, and a Malaysian <a href="https://playgroundapp.com/profile/no-black-tie">virtual dance club</a>. For now, the beta is open to select creators in the cultural space (art, music, wellness, gaming, and more), and for community members, there&#8217;s a waitlist.</p>
<p>As a Taiwanese American daughter of immigrants who grew up in a culturally diverse Santa Fe neighborhood, founder Jia Ling Yang understands the value of bringing people together. But while working as a freelance creative director for brands like Facebook, Google Play and E! Entertainment, she decided that she wanted to help build community online in a new way. Of course, social media already creates communities, from neighborhood book exchange groups to One Direction stan Twitter. But life online can be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/24/where-did-social-media-go-wrong/">isolating</a>, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of scrolling and looking at each other&#8217;s lives, I&#8217;m saying, hey, let&#8217;s go put-put together. Let&#8217;s make Filipino food together, Let&#8217;s work out together,&#8221; said Yang.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240741" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2240819" style="width: 652px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240819" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2240819" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Dashboard.png?w=642" alt="" width="642" height="359" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Dashboard.png 642w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Dashboard.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Dashboard.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Dashboard.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240819" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Playground</p></div></p>
<p>In its current state, Playground helps users find both online and in-person events to attend with cultural institutions and creators. Eventually, Yang wants Playground to become an all-in-one, end-to-end platform for creators to run their business &#8212; they will be able to manage fan subscriptions, send newsletters, post their events, articles, and podcasts, view analytics, sell merch and more. Yang and her nine-person team are currently developing social tools to help community members connect with one another.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to create forums for discussion between members,&#8221; Yang told TechCrunch. &#8220;The difference between having an audience where you&#8217;re just pushing content at them and having a community is that the members can actually interact with each other outside of the organizer.&#8221;</p>
<p>All-in-one platforms are valuable for creators, since it&#8217;s easier to manage one account than to juggle a Discord, Patreon, Eventbrite, Mailchimp and more. But there&#8217;s also inherent risk in entrusting the totality of your business with a startup. Still, Playground provides its creators with complete control over their list of subscribers and their contact info, so they&#8217;re not dependent on the Playground platform to reach their fans.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really frustrating when you don&#8217;t own your community,&#8221; Yang said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s say you built up an audience on Clubhouse or something, and that platform just goes away. Then your audience is just whoever messaged you in your Instagram DMs.&#8221;</p>
<p>There will be a free tier for creators on the platform, but to access monetization features, like paid ticketing and membership programs, they&#8217;ll have to pay $15 or $30 per month, depending on what level of customization they seek.<img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2240802" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Creators.png?w=642" alt="" width="642" height="360" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Creators.png 642w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Creators.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Creators.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Creators.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" /></p>

<p>Yang is also considering how web3 plays into the future of Playground. Since its founding, her company has raised $2.3 million in seed funding from Animoca, Sogal, Gaingels and Anomaly. One investor, Animoca, is known for investing in blockchain-based projects, but among the cultural creators that Playground targets, there&#8217;s a visible anti-crypto sentiment. While some artists embrace the possibilities of NFTs for example, others worry about environmental costs and the proliferation of scams in an unregulated market. But Yang thinks that the crypto world has a communications problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;That world does not speak culture,&#8221; she told TechCrunch. &#8220;Cultural creators like the concept of being able to own your own art, monetize your community, decide the way your community is governed&#8230; These are all principles that creators are really into, and I feel like we&#8217;re just bridging the conversation a little bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yang is interested in a blockchain-based future for Playground, but for now, the platform is focused on onboarding creators and community members after its beta launch.</p>
