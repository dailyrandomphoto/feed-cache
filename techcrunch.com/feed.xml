You’ll also find <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2020&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_source=&amp;promo=1weekleftpost&amp;display=true">discounts for groups</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2020&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_source=&amp;promo=1weekleftpost&amp;display=true">students</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2020&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_source=&amp;promo=1weekleftpost&amp;display=true">active military/government employees</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Not all virtual conferences are created equal. Michael McCarthy, the CEO of Repositax, found unexpected benefits.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The online experience was far more efficient than I anticipated, and the video on demand was a huge benefit. I could attend without disrupting my customer work by moving between the main stage and breakout presentations knowing I could catch anything I missed later.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The two-day <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2020&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_source=&amp;promo=1weekleftpost&amp;display=#2f65e915-5963-4a04-be6a-667c01da1e6d">event agenda</a> practically vibrates with opportunity.

<blockquote><p>“TC Sessions isn&#8217;t just an educational opportunity, it&#8217;s a real networking opportunity. Everyone was passionate and open to creating pilot programs or other partnerships. That was the most exciting part. And now — thanks to a conference connection — we’re talking with Goodyear&#8217;s Innovation Lab.”</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Nutanix.com">Nutanix</a> announced today that it was bringing in former VMware executive Rajiv Ramaswami as president and CEO. Ramaswami replaces co-founderr Dheeraj Pandey, who previously announced his plans to retire in August.</p>
<p>The new CEO brings 30 years of industry experience to the position including stints with Broadcom, Cisco, Nortel and IBM &#8212; in addition to his most recent gig at VMware as Chief Operating Officer of Products and Cloud Services at VMware.</p>
<p>At his position at VMware, Ramaswami had the opportunity to see <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nutanix" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nutanix">Nutanix <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> up close as a key competitor, and he now has the opportunity to lead the company into its next phase. &#8220;I have long admired Nutanix as a formidable competitor, a pioneer in hyperconverged infrastructure solutions and a leader in cloud software,&#8221; he said in a statement. He hopes to build on his industry knowledge to continue growing the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nutanix up 131% on first day of trading&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/30/nutanix-up-131-on-first-day-of-trading/embed/#?secret=fOsHgRWVEf" data-secret="fOsHgRWVEf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Sohaib Abbasi, lead independent director of Nutanix says that as a candidate, Ramaswami&#8217;s experience really stood out. &#8220;Rajiv distinguished himself among the CEO candidates with his rare combination of operational discipline, business acumen, technology vision and inclusive leadership skills,&#8221; he said in statement.</p>
<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research says the hiring makes a lot of sense as VMware is quickly becoming the company&#8217;s primary competitor. &#8220;Nutanix and VMware want to be the same in the future &#8212; the virtualization and workload portability Switzerland across cloud and on premise compute infrastructures,&#8221; he told me.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, it allows Nutanix to grab a talented executive. &#8220;So hiring Ramaswami brings both an expert for multi-cloud to the Nutanix helm, as well as weakening a key competitor from a talent perspective,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Nutanix was founded in 2009. It raised over $600 million from firms like Khosla Ventures, Lightspeed Ventures, Sapphire Ventures, Fidelity and Wellington Management, according to Crunchbase data. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/30/nutanix-up-131-on-first-day-of-trading/">company went public in 2016</a>. Investors seem pleased by the announcement with the company stock price up 1.29% as of publication.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sweden’s <a href="https://www.mtg.com">MTG</a> is making a significant acquisition in the mobile gaming industry. The company is acquiring <a href="https://www.hutch.io">Hutch Games</a>, the London-based game studio behind popular mobile racing games, such as Rebel Racing, F1 Manager and Top Drives.</p>
<p>The acquisition is an important one for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/mtg-4de8" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="mtg-4de8">MTG <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as the company is spending $275 million right away and setting aside another $100 million for performance-based payments.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with MTG, you probably know its portfolio companies. Over the past few years, MTG has acquired ESL and DreamHack to become an esports leader.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>MTG has also acquired InnoGames and Kongregate for their popular web-based and mobile games. And it sounds like MTG isn’t done just yet as the company plans to acquire more companies in the near future.</p>
<p>MTG explains why the acquisition makes sense in its <a href="https://www.mtg.com/press-releases/mtg-acquires-hutch-a-leading-developer-and-publisher-of-mobile-racing-games/">announcement</a>. Hutch Games isn’t focused on a single game. It has built a portfolio of successful games, which is always a good sign for future growth.</p>
<p>The game studio has also licensed some well-known brands, such as F1. And MTG believes that F1 Manager, Top Drives and Rebel Racing still have a lot of growth potential. Free-to-play mobile games have become games as a service, so you want to keep them popular over the long run.</p>
<p>When it comes to long-term potential, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hutch" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hutch">Hutch <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Games also has more games in the pipeline for 2021 and 2022. Finally, it’s a cost-effective studio as most employees are developers.</p>
<p>During the first nine months of 2020, Hutch Games generated $56.3 million in revenue and $13.3 million in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). Hutch Games investors included Backed VC, Index Ventures, Initial Capital and angel investor Chris Lee.</p>
<p>As you can see, free-to-play games can be lucrative. That’s why there will be some consolidation in the future. Some companies will use their deep pockets or take advantage of debt to build out big portfolios and the real estate of your home screen, one game at a time.</p>

Only a few months ago, the team launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/microsoft-brings-new-robotic-process-automation-features-to-its-power-platform/">Power Automate Desktop</a>, based on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/microsoft-acquires-robotic-process-automation-platform-softomotive/">acquisition of Softomotive</a>, which helps users automate workflows in legacy desktop-based applications, for example. After a short time in preview Power Automate Desktop is now generally available.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/powerplatform/2020/12/09/automating-automation-with-rpa-and-process-mining-available-for-power-automate/">real news</a> today, though, is that the team is also launching a new tool, the Process Advisor, which is now in preview as part of the Power Automate platform. This new process mining tool provides users with a new collaborative environment where developers and business users can work together to create new automations.</p>
<p>The idea here is that business users are the ones who know exactly how a certain process works. With Process Advisor, they can now submit recordings of how they process a refund, for example, and then submit that to the developers, who are typically not experts in how these processes usually work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What&#8217;s maybe just as important is that a system like this can identify bottlenecks in existing processes where automation can help speed up existing workflows.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2084822" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-3.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084822" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2084822" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-3.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-3.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-3.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-3.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-3.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-3.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-3.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-3.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2084822" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;This goes back to one of the things that we always talk about for Power Platform, which, it&#8217;s a corny thing, but it&#8217;s that development is a team sport,&#8221; Charles Lamanna, Microsoft&#8217;s corporate VP for its Low Code Application Platform, told me. &#8220;That&#8217;s one of our big focuses: how do bring people to collaborate and work together who normally don&#8217;t. This is great because it actually brings together the business users who live the process each and every day with a specialist who can build the robot and do the automation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The way this works in the backend is that Power Automate&#8217;s tools capture exactly what the users do and click on. All this information is then uploaded to the cloud and &#8212; with just five or six recordings &#8212; Power Automate&#8217;s systems can map how the process works. For more complex workflows, or those that have a lot of branches for different edge cases, you likely want more recordings to build out these processes, though.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2084823" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084823" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2084823" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2084823" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>As Lamanna noted, building out these workflows and process maps can also help businesses better understand the ROI of these automations. &#8220;This kind of map is great to go build an automation on top of it, but it&#8217;s also great because it helps you capture the ROI of each automation you do because you&#8217;ll know for each step, how long it took you,&#8221; Lamanna said. &#8220;We think that this concept of Process Advisor is probably going to be one of the most important engines of adoption for all these low-code/no-code technologies that are coming out. Basically, it can help guide you to where it&#8217;s worth spending the energy, where it&#8217;s worth training people, where it&#8217;s worth building an app, or using AI, or building a robot with our RPA like Power Automate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lamanna likened this to the advent of digital advertising, which for the first time helped marketers quantify the ROI of advertising.</p>
<p>The new process mining capabilities in Power Automate are now available in preview.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The coronavirus outbreak, elections, and Zoom meetings were on U.S. consumers minds&#8217; this year, according to Google&#8217;s list of the <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2020/US/">U.S. top trending searches in 2020</a>, released this morning. These search trends don&#8217;t reflect the most-searched for words and phrases across Google, but rather those that saw high spikes in traffic over a sustained period of time during the year, as compared with 2019. This paints a more accurate picture of consumers&#8217; changing interests during the year, than Google&#8217;s top searches would.</p>
<p>The lists of <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2020/GLOBAL/">top Global search trends</a> had a similar set of results.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Election Results was the No. 1 top trending search, followed by Coronavirus.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The PlayStation 5, Zoom and the names of several celebrities we tragically lost in 2020 also made the list.</p>
<p>In order, the top trending searches of 2020 were: Election results, Coronavirus, Kobe Bryant, Coronavirus update, Coronavirus symptoms, Zoom, who is winning the election, Chadwick Boseman, and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>The top trending News searches reflected similar trends, with Elections, the pandemic, and other related impacts making the list. There was a lot of bad news in 2020, including natural disasters and the largest stock market crash since 1929 (the Coronavirus Crash), which made the list, too.</p>
<p>In order, the top trending News searches were: Election results, Coronavirus, Stimulus checks, Unemployment, Iran, Hurricane Laura, Super Tuesday, Stock Market, Murder hornet, and Australia fires.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s year-end search trends also highlighted top people, actors, politicians, athletes, musicians and losses of the year, with the U.S. No. 1&#8217;s going to Joe Biden (top people search trend and politician search trend), Tom Hanks (who got COVID in 2020), Ryan Newman, Shakira, and Kobe Bryant.</p>
<p>The year-end review also broke out other topics, <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/sweet-streams-2020s-top-trending-tv-shows-and-movies/">like top trending</a> TV shows, sports teams, songs, movies, games, and more.</p>
<p>The No.1&#8217;s across these lists, in order, included the Netflix viral hit, &#8220;Tiger King,&#8221; the Boston Celtics, &#8220;WAP,&#8221; &#8220;Parasite,&#8221; and Among Us.</p>
<p><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2020/GLOBAL/">Globally</a>, many of the top trends remained the same, with Coronavirus, Election results, Kobe Bryant, Zoom and IPL as top search trends. Meanwhile, the Coronavirus, Election results, Iran, Beirut, and Hantavirus were top trending News searches.</p>
<p>There were other similarities across subtopics, too, like No. 1&#8217;s which included Tom Hanks, Ryan Newman, Among Us, WAP, Parasite, Joe Biden, &#8220;Tiger King,&#8221; and more.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/rokGy0huYEA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Beyond the terms themselves, Google says there were <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/2020-year-in-search/?">other apparent trends</a> that emerged from its data. This year, people continued to use Google to ask &#8220;why&#8221; to learn about the world. Although, this year, many of our &#8220;why&#8217;s&#8221; were related to COVID &#8212; like where to buy toilet paper, face masks, and hand sanitizer and top &#8220;where to buy&#8221; search trends. We also looked for nearby places like covid testing and early voting centers, as well as protests in our &#8220;Near Me&#8221; searches.</p>
<p>And, despite everything, people remained optimistic as Google users searched for ways to spend time in coronavirus lockdowns. Searches for &#8220;sourdough bread recipe&#8221; hit an all-time high, for example. Other popular food searches included whipped coffee (thanks TikTok!), Disney churro, Dole whip and others. Top trends in &#8220;how to&#8221; searches reflected a world <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/2020-lifestyle-trends">where we learned to stay at home, doing things for ourselves</a> &#8212; like how to cut hair, or cut bangs, or color hair at home, as well as work from home, take virtual field trips, go on virtual dates, and more.</p>
<p>Searches for Black Lives Matter increased five-fold over 2019, as well.</p>
<p>These searches and those for other supported markets can be <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2020/GLOBAL/">viewed on Google Trends</a>.</p>

<p>But while the new, higher valuations and strong cash hauls from their respective IPOs are great news, they each have a higher bar to cross when they begin to trade later today and over the next few weeks as the market settles on their real value.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start by calculating new valuations and revenue multiples. This will be fun!</p>
<h2>How to keep winning</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s kick off with DoorDash, the larger of the two IPOs.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/doordash-amps-its-ipo-range-ahead-of-blockbuster-ipo/">raising its IPO range from $75 to $85 per share</a>, a price point that already appraised the company far above its final private valuation, DoorDash raised its range to $90 to $95 per share. Then <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/73879/DoorDash-prices-IPO-at-$102-well-above-the-upwardly-revised-range">it priced at $102</a>.</p>
<p>The company has a non-diluted valuation of $32.4 billion at that price, a figure that <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/73879/DoorDash-prices-IPO-at-$102-well-above-the-upwardly-revised-range">rises as high as $38.4 billion</a> if you include shares that currently exist as unexercised options and the like. For a company worth just $16 billion earlier this summer, its IPO price is a coup.</p>
<p>And given DoorDash&#8217;s huge consumer brand, the recent IPO climate, a possibly limited first-day float and the impact of a retail-investing boom, its shares may soar today.</p>
<p>But to defend its new valuation, pop or not, DoorDash has a steep road ahead of it. Investors have valued the firm as if it will not only defend its 2020 growth, but that it will continue to accrete new revenues even as the pandemic subsides as vaccines roll out in 2021.</p>
<p>Recall that COVID-19 took an already-growing DoorDash, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/how-covid-19-accelerated-doordashs-business/">accelerated its revenue growth</a> and helping it drive operating leverage against its new scale; the company&#8217;s economics seem to improve with scale, a good thing, but one that might worry the more ursine amongst us if one expects consumers to order less food when it&#8217;s safer to go outside.</p>
<p>DoorDash is not the only COVID-accelerated company to receive a shiny, new, larger valuation during the pandemic. Robinhood and Instacart are further examples of the trend.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At a time when more companies are building machine learning models, <a href="http://Arthur.ai">Arthur.ai</a> wants to help by ensuring the model accuracy doesn&#8217;t begin slipping over time, thereby losing its ability to precisely measure what it was supposed to. As demand for this type of tool has increased this year, in spite of the pandemic, the startup announced a $15 million Series A today.</p>
<p>The investment was led by Index Ventures with help from new comers Acrew and Plexo Capital along with previous investors Homebrew, AME Ventures and Work-Bench.The round comes almost exactly a year after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/11/arthur-announces-3-3m-seed-to-monitor-machine-learning-model-performance/">$3.3 million seed round</a>.</p>
<p>As CEO and co-founder Adam Wenchel explains, data scientists build and test machine learning models in the lab under ideal conditions, but as these models are put into production, the performance can begin to deteriorate under real world scrutiny. Arthur.AI is designed to root out when that happens.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even as COVID has wreaked havoc throughout much of this year, the company has grown revenue 300% in the last six months smack dab in the middle of all that. &#8220;Over the course of 2020, we have begun to open up more and talk to [more] customers. And so we are starting to get some really nice initial customer traction, both in traditional enterprises as well as digital tech companies,&#8221; Wenchel told me. With 15 customers, the company is finding that the solution is resonating with companies.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to note that AWS announced a similar tool yesterday at re:Invent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/aws-announces-sagemaker-clarify-to-help-reduce-bias-in-machine-learning-models/">called SageMaker Clarify</a>, but Wenchel sees this as more of a validation of what his startup has been trying to do, rather than an existential threat. &#8220;I think it helps create awareness, and because this is our 100% focus, our tools go well beyond what the major cloud providers provide,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Investor Mike Volpi from Index certainly sees the value proposition of this company. &#8220;One of the most critical aspects of the AI stack is in the area of performance monitoring and risk mitigation. Simply put, is the AI system behaving like it’s supposed to?,&#8221; he wrote in a blog post announcing the funding.</p>

<p>When we spoke a year ago, the company had 8 employees. Today it has 17 and it expects to double again by the end of next year. Wenchel says that as a company whose products looks for different types of bias, it&#8217;s especially important to have a diverse workforce. He says that starts with having a diverse investment team and board makeup, which he has been able to achieve, and goes from there.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve sponsored and work with groups that focus on both general sort of coding for different underrepresented groups as well as specifically AI, and that&#8217;s something that we&#8217;ll continue to do. And actually I think when we can get together for in person events again, we will really go out there and support great organizations like AI for All and Black Girls Code,&#8221; he said. He believes that by working with these groups, it will give the startup a pipeline to underrepresented groups, which they can draw upon for hiring as the needs arise.</p>
<p>Wenchel says that when he can go back to the office, he wants to bring employees back, at least for part of the week for certain kinds of work that will benefit from being in the same space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://stufstorage.com/">Stuf</a>, a new startup transforming basements and other unused spaces into self-storage locations, is announcing that it has raised $1.8 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Katharine Lau previously led the real estate team at co-working company <a href="https://www.industriousoffice.com">Industrious</a>. She told me that she became interested in the self-storage industry during the early months of the pandemic, after a period of spring cleaning prompted her to put some of her belongings into storage.</p>
<p>Lau lives in New York City, where she said most self-storage locations are &#8220;way out in the West Side Highway or the East River, pretty far from where most people live.&#8221; She added that &#8220;at some of these traditional operations, it felt really sterile, with these fluorescent lights.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;They were designed like morgues,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You really don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s behind these doors.&#8221;</p>
<p>These may not be big issues for people who put their things into storage and then forget about them for months or years, but Lau said that it&#8217;s a bad fit for the modern customer, particularly millennial women living in cities.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="lyR6kfJxB9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/on-demand-storage-startup-makespace-picks-up-another-55m/">On-demand storage startup MakeSpace picks up another $55M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;On-demand storage startup MakeSpace picks up another $55M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/on-demand-storage-startup-makespace-picks-up-another-55m/embed/#?secret=lyR6kfJxB9" data-secret="lyR6kfJxB9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Millennials tend to live more transient lifestyles and visit on a more frequent basis,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The storage facility becomes an extension of their home. It’s about much more than having a place to leave your stuff. It becomes a useful extension of your life.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Stuf looks for what Lau described as &#8220;the forgotten spaces that weren&#8217;t generating cashflow,&#8221; signing revenue-sharing deals with landlords and then converting the space. The startup can go from touring a site to opening up for storage in four to six weeks, she said.</p>
<p>The result is a self-storage location closer to where customers actually live. And Lao said the company pays close attention to interior design, aiming to create a &#8220;warm and inviting&#8221; environment that people enjoy visiting.</p>
<p>Other startups are trying to reinvent self-storage with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/on-demand-storage-startup-makespace-picks-up-another-55m/">a more on-demand approach</a>, where the company picks up your belongings for you. Lau said that&#8217;s a nice consumer experience, but it creates unit economics that are &#8220;quite challenging.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2084831" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084831" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2084831" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Stuf-CEO-headshot-Katharine-Lau.jpg?w=680" alt="Stuf - CEO headshot - Katharine Lau" width="680" height="607" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Stuf-CEO-headshot-Katharine-Lau.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Stuf-CEO-headshot-Katharine-Lau.jpg?resize=150,134 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Stuf-CEO-headshot-Katharine-Lau.jpg?resize=300,268 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Stuf-CEO-headshot-Katharine-Lau.jpg?resize=768,686 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Stuf-CEO-headshot-Katharine-Lau.jpg?resize=680,607 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Stuf-CEO-headshot-Katharine-Lau.jpg?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2084831" class="wp-caption-text">Stuf CEO Katharine Lau</p></div></p>
<p>Stuf&#8217;s pricing is currently &#8220;on par&#8221; with traditional self-storage, she said, and because &#8220;we don’t buy the buildings or sign [a traditional lease], there are some savings we plan to pass on to customers as we grow.&#8221; (When I looked at listings for Stuf&#8217;s Brooklyn location this morning, pricing ranged from $172.51 per month for a 10&#215;6 foot space to $43 for a 5&#215;3 space.)</p>
<p>The startup already has three locations in San Francisco and New York. And it&#8217;s seeing real consumer demand, with its initial spaces filled to 90% capacity within three months.</p>
<p>The seed funding was led by Wilshire Lane Partners and Harlem Capital, allowing Stuf to continue opening new locations nationwide. Lau&#8217;s goal is to launch more than 100,000 square feet of storage space in 2021.</p>
<p>“Stuf is truly special because, business opportunity aside, two Black-led VC funds came together to invest in a business founded and run by a woman,“ said Harlem Capital Managing Partner Henri Pierre-Jacques in a statement. “Katharine stood out given her industry expertise, leadership and vision. We couldn’t be more excited to be on the journey with her as she looks to alter the storage industry.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/09/xbox-expands-cloud-gaming-to-more-devices-2021/">shared some details</a> about the roadmap for its cloud gaming service. In addition to Android devices, the company confirms that it plans to add support for more platforms. In Spring 2021, Microsoft will launch its cloud gaming service on iOS and on computers.</p>
<p>Originally called Project xCloud, Microsoft’s cloud gaming service lets you play Xbox games on non-Xbox devices. The games run on a server in a data center near you. The video is streamed to your device, and your interactions are relayed to the server in real time.</p>
<p>Xbox cloud gaming isn’t a separate subscription. People who subscribe to the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $14.99 per month can access cloud gaming as part of their subscription. The plan also includes access to a library of games, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscribers-will-get-ea-play-on-november-10th/">EA Play</a> and Xbox Live Gold.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When it comes to new devices, you’ll soon be able to launch a game on Xbox cloud gaming from a PC. The service will be available in the Xbox app and using a web browser.</p>
<p>While you can download games to your PC if you’re an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, cloud gaming is going to be particularly useful for people who don’t have a powerful GPU in their computer. It’s going to be interesting to see whether Microsoft limits its service to web browsers running on Windows computers. I’m sure many people would like to access the service from a Mac as well.</p>
<p>As for iOS, Microsoft will launch cloud gaming through web browsers exclusively due to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/apple-lays-out-its-messy-vision-for-how-xcloud-and-stadia-will-work-with-its-app-store-rules/">restrictive App Store rules</a>. Nvidia already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/google-stadia-and-geforce-now-are-both-coming-to-ios-as-web-apps/">launched</a> a beta version GeForce Now for iOS web browsers. I tried Nvidia’s service from an iPhone and an iPad, and the web browser workaround works really well.</p>
<p>If you have an Android phone or tablet, Xbox cloud gaming is already accessible from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamepass">Xbox Game Pass app</a>. Your experience will greatly vary depending on your internet connection and the quality of your Wi-Fi network.</p>
<p>You also need to be located near a data center to minimize latency. That’s why Xbox cloud gaming is only accessible in a <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/regions">handful of countries</a> — mostly the U.S., Canada, South Korea and part of Europe.</p>
<p>In its blog post, Microsoft says that the company is opening more data centers and expanding to new markets. You can expect Xbox cloud gaming in Australia, Brazil, Japan and Mexico soon.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["I used Coinbase as a vehicle because a lot of the early stuff in crypto is hard to understand."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">No industry better epitomizes elite tech opinion as blockchain. Ignored for years in its infancy, the industry received intense interest from investors, engineers and the public five years ago, generating some of the most deeply devout evangelists that have emanated from startups since the advent of the World Wide Web and the dot-com boom. Then, it all burned down, but a few companies made it through the flames, among them <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="coinbase">Coinbase <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Coinbase today is still valued at a 2018 price of $8 billion, and is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/coinbase-reported-to-consider-late-2020-early-2021-public-debut/">expected to go public in the coming months</a>. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/technology/coinbase-cryptocurrency-black-employees.html">Despite major controversies around its mission-focused policy and diversity</a>, the company continues to lead the pack of consumer-oriented blockchain and crypto companies.</p>
<p>That makes its origin story and rise all the more enticing. Jeff John Roberts, a staff writer at Fortune, has put together precisely that narrative in his new book <a href="https://hbsp.harvard.edu/product/10436-HBK-ENG">&#8220;Kings of Crypto&#8221;</a>, published by Harvard Business School Press. It’s the story of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong and the dream of a crypto economy. Given all the recent discussions and controversies swirling the company and Bitcoin’s recent record-beating price increase, provides a deeper, more analytical perspective on a complicated subject.</p>
<p>I sat down with Roberts last month to talk more about the company, the crypto industry at large and what’s next as we head into 2021.</p>
<p><i>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</i></p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			I think the most interesting story right now is that there is this tension because Wall Street and Silicon Valley don’t like each other.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: How did you get into this project and decide to write the book?</strong></p>
<p><b>Jeff John Roberts</b>: There’s a lot of crypto books out there, some of them not very good, but I think there’s kind of a first-generation series of books on the subject. Nate Popper’s &#8220;Digital Gold&#8221; is very good, and then the Wall Street Journal guys with &#8220;Age of Cryptocurrency<i>&#8220;</i> is a really good explainer, so I was looking for a new way to tell the story. Focusing on a company is just sort of a narrative mechanism, since companies can be a good way to tell the story of a broader industry.</p>
<p>I used Coinbase as a vehicle because a lot of the early stuff in crypto is hard to understand. I think it’s still true, but crypto can’t decide if it wants to be a subculture or sort of a mainstream technology and a lot of the early writings on it celebrated the quirky angles. So I tried to tell it as more of a general interest, &#8220;Hatching Twitter&#8221;-style business story and fortunately there’s a lot of gossip and things in there to recount.</p>
<p><strong>How did you get interested in crypto originally?</strong></p>
<p>My own interest came about when I was at GigaOm. Back in 2013, there was a meeting in New York City in Union Square, an event called Satoshi Square every Monday at the little corner of the park. I went down to check it out, and what it emerged to be was a bunch of crypto anarchists selling bitcoin. Some of the other people there though were Wall Street traders in $5,000 suits, which left an indelible image for me. It was really funny watching that collision of cultures, with the mix of greed and counterculture.</p>
<p>So it was during Bitcoin’s first splash into something close to the mainstream that I covered, and then that kind of dried up and went away, as it does, and then it came roaring back in 2015, 2016 and I covered the bubble. And now there’s again been an uptick in interest. So my timing for the book wasn’t good in the sense of the pandemic (I got cheated out of my canapé launch parties) but my timing was good in that a lot of the prices are soaring today.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve seen a lot in the crypto industry over the years, what’s the most interesting storyline today?</strong></p>
<p>I think the most interesting story right now is that there is this tension because Wall Street and Silicon Valley don’t like each other, but for crypto, they need each other, and it’s been interesting watching them kind of dance and find a way to kind of bridge the two worlds.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is forever promising it’s going to change our financial world, but realistically it hasn’t, but I think in the coming decade, blockchain really is going to start doing some needed stuff and so that kind of convergence of Wall Street and the Valley [is inevitable].</p>
<p>Then there are also the big corporates coming in. Obviously Facebook with Libra, but Square and PayPal and I’m sure that Apple’s going to get in this game soon because they’re good at privacy, they’ve got all the wallets and they presumably pay a shit ton in transaction fees, so I think that’s the coming story and what’s interesting to me. And then Coinbase sort of sits right kind of at the center of all that, so they’re a good vehicle to tell that story.</p>
<p><strong>You chose Coinbase as one of the focus companies for the book. Why them?</strong></p>
<p>I mean, there’s a lot of recent cultural stuff we can talk about, but it was interesting to me because going back to what we talked about earlier: Do you want to be a rebel in a subculture or do you want to actually make a difference?</p>
<p>I think Coinbase was the first and the best at the latter, and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/brian-armstrong" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="brian-armstrong">Brian Armstrong, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> who even among many Valley CEOs is a weird dude, he saw early the need to make this mainstream. That tension goes on to this day in the crypto world — and also within Coinbase — between the purest sort of libertarian vision of holding your own wallet versus the practicality. I think Coinbase is very astute in seeing that’s where things are going and building it out that way, building sort of the crypto version of online banking.</p>
<p>So I think that they’re always telling you, “We’re the white knight of crypto” and so on, and then of course Andreessen Horowitz and Fred Wilson had a big role in shepherding it that way, but it was the right call and they’ve largely executed, which I think is really interesting.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like building Coinbase early on? Were there some fun stories from that time?</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Six years after the launch of the Mexico-based crypotcurrency exchange and financial services platform<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://bitso.com/"> Bitso</a> the company revealed it has closed on $62 million in financing to capitalize on the cryptocurrency boom investors expect to hit Latin America. </span></p>
<p>The three major cryptocurrencies are all trading up in the waning months of 2020, with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bitcoin-llc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bitcoin-llc">Bitcoin <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> prices nearing (or exceeding) record highs. The global growth of these digital currencies and their applications in emerging markets have savvy financial services investors like the firm <a href="https://qedinvestors.com/">QED Investors</a> (founded by the masterminds behind Capital One) intrigued. Which is why the firm joined the Latin American heavyweight investor Kaszek Ventures in financing Bitso&#8217;s $62 million round.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bitso" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bitso">Bitso <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> may already be the dominant cryptocurrency platform in Latin America boasting 1 million users (primarily in Mexico and Argentina) and is one of the only platforms to be licensed under the <a href="https://www.fsc.gi/FSC/distributed-ledger-technology-providers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) license</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the</span><a href="https://www.fsc.gi/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Founded by Ben Peters, Daniel Vogel and Pablo Gonzalez, the company has been dominant in the Latin America crypto market, but it has also not been able to avoid some of the controversies that surround the crypto industry.</p>
<p>A report from Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/mexico-bitcoin-idUSL1N2IJ01D">flagged Bitso as one of the platforms that criminals like the human trafficker Ignacio Santoyo were using to launder money</a>.</p>
<p>The founders of Bitso and their investors focus on the ability for cryptocurrencies to reduce friction and cost in markets where financial services often ignore the middle class and low income consumers that often need them the most.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crypto as an asset class was not going away and was clearly coming of age,&#8221; said Nigel Morris, the QED co-founder who previously led Capital One. &#8220;It&#8217;s not going away. And with that there are various financial services that are enabled by this asset class. You can lend against it. You can use it to move money cross-border. This thing is now palpable and real and has come of age.&#8221;</p>
<p>For all of those reasons, Latin America represented a big opportunity for QED Investors to make its first bet in the cryptocurrency space, and for Bitso to be that initial investment.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a terrific business model and a great team and a geography that we know,&#8221; said Morris. The firm has invested in startups like Coru and Confio already and is a big believer in the opportunity for financial services startups in Mexico broadly. </span></p>
<p>For Bitso, the big opportunities are presenting Latin American investors with an opportunity to invest in foreign currencies like the US dollar through stablecoin offerings alongside a slew of lending and cross-border remittance services &#8212; in addition to the peer to peer transaction services the company already offers.</p>
<p>Bitso already employs 200 people and intends to use the capital to expand aggressively across Latin America. The company&#8217;s first port of call will be Brazil. The largest market in the region, Brazil represents a huge untapped opportunity for Bitso&#8217;s growth, according to co-founder Daniel Vogel.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We have really good traction building products where the central product is not exposure to bitcoin or crypto but fulfilling this vision of making crypto useful,&#8221; Vogel said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">These two investors have a lot fo knowledge in the fintech space int he traditional financial services space and we’re excited to continue developing projects. We have been building some of these things out … utilizing technology for things that are useful to the end customer and developing products along those lines.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>For instance, Bitso is already processing $1 billion in remittances for customers, enabling transactions for financial services partners like crypto-currency enabled money transmitters.</p>
<p>Vogel first met QED and Kaszek when he was just getting Bitso off the ground, living and working in a hacker house that was shared with five other companies. &#8220;I had to kick my team out of the meeting from my only room,&#8221; Vogel recalled.</p>
<p>Now the company boasts a customer base of 1 million and with the new cash, hopes to add another 1 million Brazilian customers to the platform.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">He thinks that access to stablecoins will lead the way. &#8220;There was so much uncertainty that people flocked to the dollar as a store of value,&#8221; Vogel said. &#8220;Access to dollars is something that has grown quite a bit in the last year.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the healthtech landscape rapidly evolves another startup is making its presence known. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/healnow" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="healnow">HealNow <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has closed a $1.3 million round of funding from SoftBank Opportunity Fund and Redhawk VC.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Halston Prox and Joshua Smith. Prox has worked in healthcare for more than a decade with major organizations such as Providence Health, Mount Sinai and Baylor Scott &amp; White, mostly focused on digitizing health records and designing and implementing software for doctors, nurses, etc. Smith, CTO at the company, has been a developer since 2012.</p>
<p>The duo founded <a href="https://www.healnow.co/">HealNow</a> to become the central nervous system for order and delivery of prescriptions, according to Prox. Your average payments processing system isn&#8217;t necessarily applicable to pharmacies large and small because of the complexities of health insurance and the regulatory landscape.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Not only is it costly to facilitate online payments for pharmacies, but they also have their own pharmacy management systems and workflows that can be easily disrupted by moving to a new payments system.</p>
<p>HealNow has built a system that&#8217;s specifically tailored to pharmacies of any shape or size, from grocery stores to mom and pop pharmacies and everything in between. It&#8217;s a white label solution, meaning that any pharmacy can put their brand language on the product.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re embedded in their current workflows and pharmacies don&#8217;t have to do anything manual, even if they&#8217;re using a pharmacy management system,&#8221; said Prox.</p>
<p>When a user looks to get a prescription from their pharmacy, they are sent a link that allows them to securely answer any questions that may be necessary for the pick-up, enter insurance info, make a payment, and schedule a curbside pick-up or a delivery. The tech also integrates with third-party delivery services for pharmacies that offer deliveries.</p>
<p>This technology has been particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic, giving smaller pharmacies the chance to compete with bigger chains who have digital solutions already set up that allow for curbside pick up. This is especially true now that Amazon has gotten into the space with the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/amazon-launches-amazon-pharmacy-its-delivery-service-for-prescription-medications/">Amazon Pharmacy</a>.</p>
<p>HealNow is a SaaS company, charging a monthly subscription fee for use of the platform as well as a service fee for prescriptions purchased on the platform. However, that service fee is a flat rate that never changes based on the cost of the prescription.</p>
<p>The space is crowded and growing more crowded, with competitors like NimbleRX and Capsule offering their own spin on simplifying and digitizing the pharmacy. One big difference for HealNow, says Prox, is that the startup has no intention of ever being a pharmacy, but rather serving pharmacies in a way that doesn&#8217;t disrupt their current workflow or system.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not a pharmacy, and we want to enable all these pharmacies to be online,&#8221; said Prox. &#8220;To do that we have to do that in an unbiased way by focusing on being a complete tech company.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding is going primarily toward building out the sales and marketing arms of the company to continue fueling growth. HealNow has a foothold in the West, Southwest and Middle America, and is opening an office in Birmingham to sprint across the East Coast. Prox says the company is processing thousands of orders a day and tens of thousands of orders each month.</p>
<p>HealNow launched in 2018 after graduating from the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/er-accelerator" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="er-accelerator">Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/blue-origin" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="blue-origin">Blue Origin <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-led &#8220;National Team&#8221; has <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/national-team-submits-moon-proposal-to-nasa">submitted a proposal</a> to NASA for its Human Landing System (HLS), which would be used to transport the next lunar astronauts to the surface of the Moon during <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nasa" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nasa">NASA&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> forthcoming Artermis mission series. Blue Origin is one of three companies selected by NASA to bid on contracts for its human Moon landing missions, leading its team comprised of itself, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/spacex-blue-origin-and-dynetics-will-build-human-lunar-landers-for-nasas-next-trip-back-to-the-moon/">Blue Origin and Dynetics were the other companies</a> with proposals strong enough to impress the U.S. space agency.</p>
<p>Blue Origin&#8217;s submitted proposal is for the so-called Option A portion of the NASA HLS proposal ask, which is set intentionally to provide the right timing for the current 2024 target for the first human landing to take place during the Artemis series. There&#8217;s also an Option B ask, which would be for later stage missions including a 2026 flight demonstration. NASA is seeking to find a private partner to build the human landing system, which will be wholly owned by the commercial entity that ends up producing the vehicle, with NASA acting as a customer – similar to what the agency did with its Commercial <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/crew-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="crew-3">Crew <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> program for transportation from Earth to the International Space Station.</p>

<p>The HLS is designed to dock with NASA&#8217;s lunar Gateway space station, which will orbit the Moon and provide a staging base for reaching the lunar surface. NASA astronauts will make the trip to the Moon using the in-development Orion spacecraft, which will launch atop the Space Launch System rocket, both of which are NASA-owned, and built by contractors (<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lockheed-martin" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lockheed-martin">Lockheed Martin/Airbus <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Boeing respectively).</p>
<p>NASA envisions a future in which the Gateway and Moon act as hubs for commercial activity as well as science and research, and so the HLS was designed to foster the creation of landing systems that can also serve private company customers in addition to the agency.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumers will have downloaded 130 billion apps in 2020 across iOS and Google Play, up 10% year-over-year, according to mobile data and analytics firm <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/2020-mobile-recap-how-to-succeed-in-2021/">App Annie&#8217;s year-end forecast</a>. Consumer spending across the two app stores will also grow by 25% year-over-year to reach $112 billion by year end, the firm also predicts.</p>
<p>Typically, much of the download growth is led by emerging markets, but this year things were different.</p>
<p>Due the COVID-19 pandemic, mobile adoption <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/covid19-consumer-behavior-mobile/">accelerated</a> by 2 to 3 years. As a result, consumers increasingly turned to apps as digital solutions for work, education, entertainment, shopping, and more. This resulted in the rise in downloads, time spent on mobile, and consumer spending &#8212; despite there being more maturity in the mobile market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2084800" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084800" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2084800" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020f-downloads.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020f-downloads.png 936w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020f-downloads.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020f-downloads.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020f-downloads.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020f-downloads.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020f-downloads.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2084800" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie</p></div></p>
<p>Google Play downloads in 2020 outnumbered iOS downloads by 160%, but both stores saw 10% growth. Games, meanwhile, increased their share of the downloads to 40%. On Google Play, they accounted for 45% of all downloads, up 5% year-over-year, but they maintained a 30% share on iOS. Games additionally accounted for $0.71 of every dollar spent across both app stores.</p>
<p>Also due to COVID-19, consumers spent more time on devices &#8212; a metric that saw a significant 25% jump from 2019 to top 3.3 trillion hours on Android. (App Annie cannot measure the figure on iOS).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2084801" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084801" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2084801" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020f-consumer-spend.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020f-consumer-spend.png 936w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020f-consumer-spend.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020f-consumer-spend.png?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020f-consumer-spend.png?resize=768,451 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020f-consumer-spend.png?resize=680,400 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020f-consumer-spend.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2084801" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie</p></div></p>
<p>This increased time spent helped contribute to the growth in consumer spending, which hit a new annual record ($112B) in 2020. In 2020, 65 cents of every dollar of that spend went to iOS but spend on Google Play continues to grow. This year, it will reach close to 30%, the firm predicts.</p>
<p>Top markets for consumer spend on iOS included the U.S., Japan, and the U.K., which is a different list than in 2018 and 2019, when the list included U.S., China, and Japan. Top markets for Google Play were the U.S., South Korea and Germany &#8212; with South Korea and Germany bumping out Japan and the U.K.&#8217;s place in terms of growth, compared with the past 2 years.</p>
<p>The report also looked at the top apps of the year, which saw TikTok No.1 by downloads and No. 2 by consumer spend, but still beat out by Facebook on monthly active users. Despite a lockdown, dating app Tinder made it to No. 2 in terms of consumer spend.</p>
<p>Other Facebook apps, including Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp maintained top positions across download and active users charts. Thanks to COVID, Zoom made it on 2020&#8217;s list of top downloads, in the No. 4 position.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As financial troubles escalate at Danke, China&#8217;s authorities are stepping in to hold the once-promising apartment rental and sharing company accountable.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, landlords who did not receive payments from Danke, which functions as a sublessor, began to evict tenants. After a flurry of local reports exposing the firm&#8217;s massive debt, which is reported to be as high as<a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-12-07/cover-story-how-chinese-apartment-rental-giants-business-fell-apart-101636345.html"> $520 million</a>, a district court in Shanghai <a href="http://zxgk.court.gov.cn/shixin/">placed</a> Ziwutong Beijing Asset Management, the parent organization behind Danke, on the country&#8217;s &#8220;social credit&#8221; blacklist.</p>
<p>The Chinese government&#8217;s social credit system is a <a href="https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/china-social-credit-score/">set of mechanisms</a> aimed at improving the enforcement of existing laws and offenders can face restrictions in their daily activity. In Danke&#8217;s case, founder and chief executive officer Gao Jing has been barred from &#8220;heavy spending,&#8221; which includes everything from flying first-class, taking a high-speed train, buying property, going on vacation, to enrolling children in &#8220;expensive&#8221; private schools, according to a <a href="https://www.tianyancha.com/restrict/detail/vmz777e1b5c68354b0d3fd1d6la97f28?cgid=80725858&amp;type=zhixinginfo_restrict">court notice</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The move came after a senior judge from China&#8217;s Supreme People&#8217;s Court <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/2020-12/04/c_1126823099.htm">told the press</a> that Danke was under investigation by relevant authorities over its cash-flow problems.</p>
<p>Danke, founded in 2015 and backed by high-profile investors like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/danke-raise-500-million/">Ant Financial, Tiger Global</a>, and LinkedIn&#8217;s former China head Derek Shen, pledged to make urban housing affordable and pleasant for China&#8217;s white-collar workers. The catch is it&#8217;s advancing through aggressive debt-fueled expansion.</p>
<p>Instead of the traditional rental model, Danke relies on an elaborate financing scheme to maintain cash flows. Tenants are offered price incentives to pay upfront for a year and induced to cover the sums by taking out loans, which are provided by Danke&#8217;s partner banks. Renters who refuse to sign up for the loans are asked to pay more.</p>
<p>With capital funded by the loans, Danke then pays the homeowners &#8212; but only on a monthly or quarterly basis. This gives the startup much financial flexibility to rent from landlords and spend on renovating apartments, which are then sublet to tenants at a markup.</p>
<p>Danke&#8217;s model epitomizes the promises of internet platforms or so-called sharing economy &#8212; light asset, rapid scaling, but it also creates enormous risks for the suppliers and consumers it vows to serve. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, China&#8217;s rental market cooled, putting stress on Danke&#8217;s funding vehicle.</p>
<p>When TechCrunch spoke to Danke&#8217;s angel investor and chairman Derek Shen last year about the firm&#8217;s financial risks, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/danke-raise-500-million/">he had this to say</a>: &#8220;There’s nothing wrong with the financial instrument itself. The real issue is when the housing operator struggles to repay, so the key is to make sure the business is well-functioning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is needed is stricter market supervision to prevent such cases from recurring,&#8221; said an <a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202011/25/WS5fbd9096a31024ad0ba9632a.html">opinion piece</a> published in state-backed paper China Daily. &#8220;The involvement of banks and loans have made the risks even higher. Given how unsustainable Danke&#8217;s business model is, it is time financial supervision departments consider making stricter financial rules forbidding such risky practices.&#8221;</p>
<p>Listed in New York, Danke saw its shares plunge to $2 last month from a high of $13.5 when it went public in January. Year to date the company has only released its Q1 earnings report, which recorded a net loss of $174.3 million.</p>
<p>The financial turmoil also puts <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/webank" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="webank">WeBank, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Danke&#8217;s major partner bank, under the spotlight for its participation in a highly leveraged rental business in return for handsome interests. The Tencent-backed internet bank <a href="https://weibo.com/5476981955/JwU885TA5?from=page_1006065476981955_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime&amp;type=comment#_rnd1607516313259">announced</a> on social media that it would transfer loan obligations from tenants to Danke, which has been subsidizing renters&#8217; loan interests to WeBank already. In the <a href="file:///Users/ritaliao/Downloads/DNK%201Q20%20Earnings%20Release_20200610_vFinal.pdf">three months ended March</a>, Danke paid a total of $7.9 million in interests related to &#8220;rent financing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danke cannot be immediately reached for comment on the story.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">EU lawmakers have just unveiled a wide-ranging <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2326">counter terrorism agenda</a> as they set out plans to beef up regional security.</p>
<p>The plan touches on some key tech topics &#8212; the most keenly watched of which is encryption.</p>
<p>Here, concerns have been mounting that the bloc could be moving toward legislating against end-to-end encryption &#8212; in response to pressure from some Member States over law enforcement and security services&#8217; access to encrypted data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the same time such pressure isn&#8217;t <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/24/encryption-under-fire-in-europe-as-france-and-germany-call-for-decrypt-law/">exactly new</a>. Albeit, the rule of crypto wars history is the access issue must roll around afresh again and again. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/whats-all-this-about-europe-wanting-crypto-backdoors/">last month</a> a <a href="https://files.orf.at/vietnam2/files/fm4/202045/783284_fh_st12143-re01en20_783284.pdf">draft resolution</a> from the Council of the European Union triggered a fresh wave of anxiety that an EU ban on e2e encryption might be in the works.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s Commission agenda is unlikely to lay such fears to rest entirely.</p>
<p>Perhaps mostly for its tortured language &#8212; with <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_2325">oxymoronical talk</a> of &#8216;improved access&#8217; to encrypted information in a text that&#8217;s simultaneously peppered with caveats about &#8220;respecting the right to privacy&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the Commission answers its own impossible question [emphasis its]:</p>
<blockquote><p>Encryption technology is one of the main building blocks in setting up and maintaining the Digital Single Market and in safeguarding fundamental rights, privacy and data protection of citizens. However, when used for criminal purposes, it masks the identity of criminals and hides the content of their communications. Today, a substantial part of investigations against all forms of crime and terrorism involve encrypted information. The Commission will work with Member States to <strong>identify possible legal, operational, and technical solutions for lawful access</strong> and promote an approach which both maintains the effectiveness of encryption in protecting privacy and security of communications, while providing an effective response to crime and terrorism.</p></blockquote>
<p>Talk of EU lawmakers helping in a search for possible &#8220;technical solutions&#8221; for &#8220;lawful access&#8221; to encrypted data probably won&#8217;t reassure those worried the EU is headed on a dangerous path toward mandatory backdoors.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s worth emphasizing that &#8216;lawful access&#8217; under EU law has been shown time and again to mean <em>targeted</em> access. (To wit: In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/europes-top-court-confirms-no-mass-surveillance-without-legal-limits/">October</a> the CJEU made it clear that national security concerns do not exclude EU Member States from the need to comply with general legal principles &#8212; such as proportionality and respect for fundamental rights to privacy, data protection and freedom of expression.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="txHmBL6Cez"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/europes-top-court-confirms-no-mass-surveillance-without-legal-limits/">Europe&#8217;s top court confirms no mass surveillance without limits</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe&#8217;s top court confirms no mass surveillance without limits&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/europes-top-court-confirms-no-mass-surveillance-without-legal-limits/embed/#?secret=txHmBL6Cez" data-secret="txHmBL6Cez" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Simply put: There&#8217;s no such thing as a targeted backdoor.</p>
<p>A backdoor is naturally a bulk intervention. It&#8217;s inherently disproportionate. There&#8217;s no one-time, single-user &#8216;backdoor&#8217;*. At that point you&#8217;re basically talking about legally sanctioned hacking of a target suspect. Which is a whole other kettle of security fish.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting the Commission agenda commits EU lawmakers to maintaining &#8220;the effectiveness of encryption in protecting privacy and security of communications&#8221;.</p>
<p>Though, again, their tortuous need to display balance over seemingly opposing objectives, by giving a simultaneously pledge of &#8220;providing an effective response to crime and terrorism&#8221;, might slightly haze the quality of the reassurance. Except of course an effective response to crime and terrorism can be achieved in myriad ways &#8212; proper resourcing and training of agents, say, better knowledge sharing across EU borders and so on &#8212; all of which have nothing at all to do with breaking encryption.</p>
<p>And, indeed, the Commission&#8217;s agenda offers plenty such (non-encryption breaking) ideas for beefing up the bloc&#8217;s counter terrorism response &#8212; such as an &#8220;EU police cooperation code&#8221; to enhance cooperation between law enforcement authorities; strengthening Europol; and stepping up engagement with international organizations, to name a few.</p>
<p>Encryption is often a handy scapegoat for governments&#8217; security failures. The Commission&#8217;s agenda looks alive to that risk &#8212; just without wanting to give a too-direct slap-down to any culpable Member States. Ergo &#8216;we&#8217;ll work to identify possibilities&#8217; looks like a diplomatically way of saying &#8216;we won&#8217;t achieve the impossible&#8217;.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the tech front, the Commission agenda is very keen that its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/12/europe-to-push-for-one-hour-takedown-law-for-terrorist-content/">2018 legislative proposal</a> to accelerate terrorism content takedowns is swiftly taken up by the other EU institutions so it can start being applied to platforms.</p>
<p>The proposal has attracted some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/one-hour-terrorist-takedowns-backed-by-eu-parliaments-civil-liberties-committee/">controversy and concern</a> &#8212; such as over its impact on smaller websites, and how terrorism content will be defined.</p>
<p>&#8220;To counter the spread of extremist ideologies online, it is important that the European Parliament and the Council adopt the rules on removing terrorist content online as a matter of urgency,&#8221; the Commission writes on this.</p>
<p>The EU Internet Forum will be tasked with developing &#8220;guidance on moderation for publicly available content for extremist material online&#8221;, it adds.</p>
<p>*Setting aside theoretical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOBUS">NOBUS</a> security vulnerabilities</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Quantum computing startup <a href="https://ionq.com/">IonQ</a> today announced its road map for the next few years &#8212; following a similar <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/ibm-publishes-its-quantum-roadmap-says-it-will-have-a-1000-qubit-machine-in-2023/">move from IBM in September</a> &#8212; and it&#8217;s quite ambitious, to say the least.</p>
<p>At our Disrupt event earlier this year, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ionq-inc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ionq-inc">IonQ <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO and president Peter Chapman <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/quantum-startup-ceo-suggests-we-are-only-five-years-away-from-a-quantum-desktop-computer/">suggested</a> that we were only five years away from having desktop quantum computers. That&#8217;s not something you&#8217;ll likely hear from the company&#8217;s competitors &#8212; who also often use a very different kind of quantum technology &#8212; but IonQ now says that it will be able to sell modular, rack-mounted quantum computers for the data center in 2023 and that by 2025, its systems will be powerful enough to achieve broad quantum advantage across a wide variety of use cases.</p>
<p>In an interview ahead of today&#8217;s announcement, Chapman showed me a prototype of the hardware the company is working on for 2021, which fits on a workbench. The actual quantum chip is currently the size of a half-dollar and the company is now working on essentially putting the core of its technology on a single chip, with all of the optics that make its system work integrated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2084610" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IonQ-roadmap-graph.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084610" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2084610" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IonQ-roadmap-graph.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="462" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IonQ-roadmap-graph.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IonQ-roadmap-graph.jpg?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IonQ-roadmap-graph.jpg?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IonQ-roadmap-graph.jpg?resize=768,346 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IonQ-roadmap-graph.jpg?resize=680,307 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IonQ-roadmap-graph.jpg?resize=1536,693 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IonQ-roadmap-graph.jpg?resize=2048,924 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IonQ-roadmap-graph.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2084610" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> IonQ</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the goal,&#8221; he said about the chip. &#8220;As soon as you get to 2023, then you get to go to scale in a different way, which is, I just tell somebody in Taiwan to start and give me 10,000 of those things. And you get to scale through manufacturing, as well. There&#8217;s nothing quantum in any of the things that in any of the hardware we&#8217;re doing,&#8221; he said, though IonQ co-founder and chief scientist Chris Monroe quickly jumped in and noted that that&#8217;s true, &#8220;except for the atoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s an important point, because thanks to betting on trapped ion quantum computing as the core technology for its machines, IonQ doesn&#8217;t have to contend with the low-temperatures that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ibm" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ibm">IBM <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and others need to run their machines. Some sceptics have argued that IonQ&#8217;s technology will be hard to scale, but that&#8217;s something Chapman and Monroe easily dismiss, and IonQ&#8217;s new road map points at systems with thousands of algorithmic qubits (which are made out of a factor of 10 or 20 more physical qubits for handling error corrections) by 2028.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as you hit about 40 qubits &#8212; algorithmic qubits &#8212; in the beginning of 2024, then you&#8217;ll start to see quantum advantage probably in machine learning,&#8221; Chapman explained. &#8220;And then, I think it&#8217;s pretty well accepted that at 72 qubits is roughly when you start to do quantum advantage fairly broadly. So that would be in 2025. When you start to get into 2027, you&#8217;re now getting into hundreds of qubits if not early 1000s of qubits in [2028]. And now you&#8217;re starting to get into full-scale fault tolerance.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;IBM publishes its quantum roadmap, says it will have a 1,000-qubit machine in 2023&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/ibm-publishes-its-quantum-roadmap-says-it-will-have-a-1000-qubit-machine-in-2023/embed/#?secret=9JDp09OsbH" data-secret="9JDp09OsbH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>We&#8217;ll see slow growth in the number of additional algorithmic qubits &#8212; which is what IonQ calls a qubit that can be used in running a quantum algorithm. Others in the industry tend to talk about &#8220;logical qubits,&#8221; but IonQ&#8217;s definition is slightly different.</p>
<p>Talking about how to compare different quantum systems, Chapman noted that &#8220;fidelity is not good enough.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t matter if you have 72 or 72 million qubits, he said, if only three of those are usable. &#8220;When you see a road map that says, &#8216;I&#8217;m going to have umpteen 1000 qubits, it&#8217;s kind of like, &#8216;I don&#8217;t care, right?&#8217; On our side, since we&#8217;re using individual atoms, I could show you a little vial of gas and say, &#8216;look, I&#8217;ve got a trillion qubits, all ready to be do computation!&#8217; But they&#8217;re not particularly useful. So what we tried to do in the road map, was to talk about useful qubits.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also argued that quantum volume, a measurement championed by IBM and others in the quantum ecosystem, isn&#8217;t particularly useful because at some point, the numbers just get far too high.&#8221; But essentially, IonQ is still using quantum volume, but it defines its algorithmic qubits as the <img class="_3vyrn" src="https://www4f.wolframalpha.com/Calculate/MSP/MSP44471960683cb1a1gid6000035gfa03i8480a62b?MSPStoreType=image/gif&amp;s=12" alt="log(2, x)" /> of the quantum volume of a given system.</p>
<p>Once IonQ is able to get to 32 of these algorithmic qubits &#8212; its current systems have 22 &#8212; it&#8217;ll be able to achieve a quantum volume of 4.2 billion instead of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/ionq-claims-it-has-built-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-yet/">4 million it claims for its current system</a>.</p>
<p>As Monroe noted, the company&#8217;s definition of algorithmic qubits also takes variable error correction into account. Error correction remains a major research area in quantum computing, but for the time being, IonQ argues that its ability to keep gate fidelity high means it doesn&#8217;t yet have to worry about it and it has already demonstrated the first fault-tolerant error-corrected operations with an overhead of 13:1.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because our native errors are so low, we don&#8217;t need to do error correction today, with these 22 algorithmic qubits. But to get that [99.99%] of fidelity, we&#8217;re going to leak in a little bit of error correction &#8212; and we can sort of do it on the fly. It&#8217;s almost like a little bit of an adjustment. How much error correction do you want? It&#8217;s not all or nothing,&#8221; Monroe explained.</p>
<p>IonQ isn&#8217;t afraid to say that it believes that &#8220;other technologies, because of their poor gate fidelity and qubit connectivity, might need 1,000, 10,000 or even 1,000,000 qubits to create a single error-corrected qubit.&#8221;</p>
<p>To put all of this into practice, IonQ today launched an Algorithmic <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/qubit" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="qubit">Qubit <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Calculator that it argues will make it easier to compare system.</p>
<p>For the near future, IonQ expects to use a 16:1 overhead for error correction &#8212; that is, it expects to use 16 physical qubits to create a high-fidelity algorithmic qubit. Once it hits about 1,000 logical qubits, it expects to use a 32:1 overhead. &#8220;As you add qubits, you need to increase your fidelity,&#8221; Chapman explained, and so for its 1,000-qubit machine in 2028, IonQ will need to control 32,000 physical qubits.</p>
<p>IonQ has long argued that scaling its technology doesn&#8217;t necessitate any technological breakthroughs. And indeed, the company argues that by packing a lot of its technology on a single chip, its system will become more stable by default (noise, after all, is the archenemy of qubits), in part because the laser beams won&#8217;t have to travel very far.</p>
<p>Chapman, who has never been afraid to push for a bit of publicity, even noted that the company wants to fly one of its quantum computers in a small plane one of these days to show how stable it is. It&#8217;s worth noting, though, that IonQ is far more bullish about scaling up its systems in the short term than any of its competitors. Monroe acknowledged as much, but argues that it&#8217;s basic physics at this point.</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially in the solid-state platforms, they&#8217;re doing wonderful physics,&#8221; Monroe said. &#8220;They&#8217;re making a little bit of progress every year, but a roadmap in 10 years, based on a solid-state qubit, relies on breakthroughs in material science. And maybe they&#8217;ll get there, it&#8217;s not clear. But, you know, the physics of the atom is all sewn up and we&#8217;re very confident on the engineering path forward because it&#8217;s engineering based on proven protocols and proven devices.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have a manufacturing problem. You want a million qubits? No problem. That&#8217;s easy,&#8221; Chapman quipped.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Creating a resume is one of the most frustrating parts of job hunting. Though ubiquitous on social media, videos are still rare on job platforms, even though it&#8217;s difficult to capture your personality in a resume. Sydney, Australia-based <a href="https://www.myinterview.com/">myInterview</a> wants to turn videos into an integral part of recruitment, with a platform that allows candidates to upload video responses to questions. Recruiters also have the option of using myInterview Intelligence, or machine learning-based tools that create shortlists for competitive openings.</p>
<p>The startup announced today that it has raised a $5 million seed round led by Israeli early-stage venture firm Aleph, with participation from returning investors Entrée Capital and SeedIL Ventures. MyInterview previously raised $1.6 million in pre-seed funding, including from Cliff Rosenberg, the former managing director of LinkedIn’s Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand operations.</p>
<p>MyInterview has been used by more than 2,000 companies, mostly in the United States and United Kingdom. Some of its best-known clients include online supermarket Ocado, retailer B&amp;M and P&amp;O Ferries. It has also worked with Facebook Career Connections and has a strategic partnership with reed.co.uk, the largest job search site in the U.K. So far, more than two million candidates have used myInterview, and the company’s goal is to reach tens of millions of job seekers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funding will be used to expand its sales, product and research and development teams.</p>
<p>MyInterview was founded in 2016 by Guy Abelsohn and Ben Gillman, after they became frustrated by how difficult it was to make their resumes stand out while job hunting. MyInterview started out by offering products for companies to integrate into their existing recruitment systems, but launched a standalone platform at the beginning of 2019, well before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We already had very nice traction over 2019 and into the beginning of 2020,&#8221; Gillman told TechCrunch. &#8220;I like to say that the success we’ve been seeing is independent of COVID, but there’s definitely been an impact in people who are still hiring needing to adopt technology such as myInterview in order to do that more effectively and efficiently with social distancing and the number of applicants coming through because of the market, and the more general adoption of video across the space.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CmJbQZjHEw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/what-recruiters-are-saying-about-the-tech-job-market-right-now/">What recruiters are saying about the tech job market right now</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What recruiters are saying about the tech job market right now&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/what-recruiters-are-saying-about-the-tech-job-market-right-now/embed/#?secret=CmJbQZjHEw" data-secret="CmJbQZjHEw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Gillman said myInterview’s platform can be used to fill almost any kind of job, but it’s generally used for roles, like entry-level positions, that can get hundreds to thousands of applications.</p>
<p>To use myInterview, companies set up a portal with a list of questions and prompts for applicants to answer on video. Applicants have the option of playing back and re-recording their responses several times before they hit submit. Once submitted, myInterview generates a transcript with tags for recruiters to sort through.</p>
<p>Other startups that have recently raised funding to integrate video into the recruitment process <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/23/the-robot-recruiter-is-coming-vcvs-ai-will-read-your-face-in-a-job-interview/">include VCV.AI</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/jobufo/">JobUFO</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/willo-a-freemium-video-interview-saas-scores-320k-during-the-remote-work-boom/">Willo</a>.</p>
<p>One of the main ways myInterview competes with its rival is myInterview Intelligence. If a recruiter uses myInterview Intelligence, the platform analyzes responses for key words, phrases and tone.</p>

<p>MyInterview’s AI tools are based on the Big Five Personality Model, one of the main frameworks used by personality researchers. Personality tests, especially ones based on the &#8220;Big 5,&#8221; have <a href="https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/pages/0615-personality-tests.aspx">been used by recruiters for years</a>; what myInterview does is automate the process based on video transcripts instead of making candidates to fill out traditional assessments.</p>
<p>By automatically creating candidate shortlists focused on workplace culture compatibility, myInterview’s founders say its machine learning-based tools can help recruiters surface applicants who might otherwise be overlooked. Gillman said the platform also tries to mitigate bias in the hiring process by using a diverse set of data to train its algorithms and working with behavioral psychologists to audit videos. (Other startups using AI to help overcome bias in hiring include RippleMatch, which also recently received funding).</p>
<p>Of course, what makes a group of coworkers click can be hard to define, as with any other kind of relationship. Gillman said myInterview’s team includes behavioral psychologists, machine learning engineers and general engineers, working together to crack the code of building a good team.</p>
<p>For example, some candidates might flourish in a large corporation, where there is a lot of hierarchy and structure, while others might work better in small companies with a family-like environment, he said. &#8220;These things are quite tangible, and these are the elements we help to identify, both to the candidate and the employer.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remote learning and training have become a large priority this year for organizations looking to keep employees engaged and up to date on work practices at a time when many of them are not working in an office &#8212; and, in the case of those who have joined in 2020, may have never met any of their work colleagues in person, ever. Today one of the startups that&#8217;s built a new, more user-friendly approach to creating and provisioning those learning materials is announcing some funding as it experiences a boost in its growth.</p>
<p><a href="http://workramp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WorkRamp</a>, which has built a platform that helps organizations build their own training materials, and then distribute them both to their workforce and to partners, has raised $17 million, a Series B round of funding that&#8217;s being led by Omers Ventures with Bow Capital also participating.</p>
<p>Its big pitch is that it has built the tools to make it easy for companies to build their own training and learning materials, incorporating tests, videos, slide shows and more, and by making it easier for companies to build these themselves, the materials themselves become more engaging and less stiff.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We’re disrupting the legacy <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lms" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lms">LMS <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> [learning management system] providers, the Cornerstones of the world, with our bite-size training platform,&#8221; said CEO and founder Ted Blosser in an interview. &#8220;We want to do what Peloton did for the exercise market, but with corporate training. We are aiming for a consumer-grade experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company, originally incubated in Y Combinator, has now raised $27 million.</p>
<p>The funding comes on the back of strong growth for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/workramp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="workramp">WorkRamp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. Blosser said that it now has around 250 customers, with 1 million courses collectively created on its platform. That list includes fast-growing tech companies like Zoom, Box, Reddit and Intercom, as well as Disney, GlobalData and PayPal. As it continues to expand, it will be interesting to see how and if it can also snag more legacy, late adopters who are not as focused on tech in their own DNA.</p>
<p>WorkRamp estimates that there is some $20 billion spent annually by organizations on corporate training. Unsurprisingly, that has meant the proliferation of a number of companies building tools to address that market.</p>
<p>Just Google WorkRamp and you&#8217;re likely to encounter a number of its competitors who have bought its name as a keyword to snag a little more attention, . There are both big and small players in the space, including Leapsome, Capterra, Lessonly, LearnUpon (which itself recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/dublins-learnupon-raises-56m-for-its-online-learning-management-system-for-enterprises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised a big round</a>), SuccessFactors and TalentLMS.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about what WorkRamp has built is that it plays on the idea of the &#8220;creator&#8221; which really has been a huge development in our digital world. YouTube may have kicked things off with the concept of &#8220;user-generated content&#8221; but today we have TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, and so many more platforms &#8212; not to mention smartphones themselves, with their easy facilities to shoot videos and photos of others, or of yourself, and then share with others &#8212; which have made the idea of building your own work, and looking at that of others, extremely accessible.</p>
<p>That has effectively laid the groundwork for a new way of conceiving of even more prosaic things, like corporate training. (Can there really be anything more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkIuRa-6b4U" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comedically</a> prosaic than that?) Other startups like Kahoot have also played on this idea, by making it easy for enterprises to build their own games to help train their staff.</p>
<p>This is what WorkRamp has aimed to tap into with its own take on the learning market, to help its customers eschew the idea of hiring outside production companies to make training materials, or expect WorkRamp to build those materials for them: instead, the people who are going to use the training now have the control.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it’s critical to be able to build your own customer education,&#8221; Blosser said. &#8220;That’s a big trend for clients that want both to rapidly onboard people but also reduce costs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s platform includes user-friendly drag-and-drop functionality, which also lets people build slide shows, flip cards and questions that viewers can answer. The plan is to bring on more &#8220;Accenture&#8221; style consultants, Blosser said, for bigger customers who may not be as tech savvy to help them take better advantage of the tools. It also integrates with third-party packages like Salesforce.com, Workday, and Zoom both to build out training as well as to distribute it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since 2000, we have seen three major technology shifts in the enterprise: the transition from on-premise to SaaS, the growth of mobile, and the most recent &#8211; sweeping digital transformation across almost every part of every business,” said Eugene Lee of OMERS Ventures, in a statement. “The pandemic has forced adoption of a digital-first approach towards customers and employees across virtually all industries. WorkRamp’s platform is foundational to empowering both of these important audiences today and in the future. We are bullish on the massive opportunity in front of the company and are excited to get involved.&#8221; Lee is joining the board with this round.</p>
