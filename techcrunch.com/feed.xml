</div><p id="speakable-summary">Businesses that don’t invest in their future may not have a future to look forward to.</p>
<p>Whether you’re investing in your human resources or in critical tech, some outlay in the short term is always needed for long-term success. That&#8217;s true when it comes to marketing as well — you can’t market your product or service without investing in advertising. But if that investment isn’t turning into leads and conversions, you’re in trouble.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			A “good” ROAS score is different for each company and campaign. If your figure isn’t where you’d like it to be, you can leverage ROAS data to create targeted campaigns and personalized experiences.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>It’s vital to identify and apply the most suitable metrics based on business goals, and there&#8217;s no one best practice or one-size-fits-all method.</p>
<p>However, smart use of the return on advertising spend (ROAS) data can triple lead generation, as I discovered when I joined Brightpearl to restructure the marketing campaigns. Let’s take a look at some of the ways Brightpearl used ROAS to improve campaigns and increase lead generation. The key is to work out what represents a healthy ROAS for your business so that you can optimize accordingly.</p>
<h2>Use the right return metric</h2>
<p>It is paramount to choose the right return metric to calculate your ROAS. This will depend partly on your sales cycle.</p>
<p>Brightpearl has a lengthy sales cycle. On average it’s two to three months, and sometimes up to six months, meaning we don’t have tons of data on a monthly basis if we want to use new customer’s revenue data as the return metric. A company with a shorter sales cycle could use revenue, but that doesn’t help us to optimize our campaigns.</p>
<p>We chose to use the sales accepted opportunity (SAO) value instead. It usually takes us about a month to measure, so we can get more ROAS data at the same time. It’s the last sales stage before a win, and it’s more in line with our company goal (to grow our recurring annual revenue), but takes less time to gather the data.</p>
<p>By the SAO stage, we know which leads are good quality­ — they have the budget, are a good fit, and our software can meet their requirements. We can use them to measure our campaign performance.</p>
<p>When you choose a return metric, you need to make sure it matches your company goal without taking ages to get the data. It also has to be measurable at the campaign level, because the aim of using ROAS or other metrics is to optimize your campaigns.</p>
<h2>Accept that less is more</h2>
<p>I’ve noticed that many companies harbor a fear of missing out on opportunities, which leads them to advertise on all available channels instead of concentrating resources on the most profitable areas.</p>
<p>Prospects usually do their research on multiple channels, so you might try to cover all the possible touch points. In theory, this could generate more leads, but only if you had an unlimited marketing budget and human resources.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://mirantis.com">Mirantis</a> has been around the block, starting way back as an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/openstack/">OpenStack</a> startup, but a few years ago the company began to embrace cloud-native development technologies like containers, microservices and Kubernetes. Today, <a href="https://www.mirantis.com/blog/data-center-change-you-get-benefits/">it announced</a> Mirantis Flow, a fully managed open source set of services designed to help companies manage a cloud-native data center environment, whether your infrastructure lives on-prem or in a public cloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re about delivering to customers an open source-based cloud-to-cloud experience in the data center, on the edge, and interoperable with public clouds,&#8221; Adrian Ionel, CEO and co-founder at Mirantis explained.</p>
<p>He points out that the biggest companies in the world, the hyperscalers like Facebook, Netflix and Apple, have all figured out how to manage in a hybrid cloud-native world, but most companies lack the resources of these large organizations. Mirantis Flow is aimed at putting these same types of capabilities that the big companies have inside these more modest organizations.</p>
<p>While the large infrastructure cloud vendors like Amazon, Microsoft and Google have been designed to help with this very problem, Ionel says that these tend to be less open and more proprietary. That can lead to lock-in, which today&#8217;s large organizations are looking desperately to avoid.</p>
<p>&#8220;[The large infrastructure vendors] will lock you into their stack and their APIs. They&#8217;re not based on open source standards or technology, so you are locked in your single source, and most large enterprises today are pursuing a multi-cloud strategy. They want infrastructure flexibility,&#8221; he said. He added, &#8220;The idea here is to provide a completely open and flexible zero lock-in alternative to the [big infrastructure providers, but with the] same cloud experience and same pace of innovation.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0Sne8sDLwI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/05/on-balance-the-cloud-has-been-a-huge-boon-to-startups/">On balance, the cloud has been a huge boon to startups</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;On balance, the cloud has been a huge boon to startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/05/on-balance-the-cloud-has-been-a-huge-boon-to-startups/embed/#?secret=0Sne8sDLwI" data-secret="0Sne8sDLwI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>They do this by putting together a stack of open source solutions in a single service. &#8220;We provide virtualization on top as part of the same fabric. We also provide software-defined networking, software-defined storage and CI/CD technology with DevOps as a service on top of it, which enables companies to automate the entire software development pipeline,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As the company describes the service <a href="https://www.mirantis.com/blog/data-center-change-you-get-benefits/">in a blog post</a> published today, it includes &#8220;Mirantis Container Cloud, Mirantis OpenStack and Mirantis Kubernetes Engine, all workloads are available for migration to cloud native infrastructure, whether they are traditional virtual machine workloads or containerized workloads.&#8221;</p>
<p>For companies worried about migrating their VMware virtual machines to this solution, Ionel says they have been able to move these VMs to the Mirantis solution in early customers. &#8220;This is a very, very simple conversion of the virtual machine from VMware standard to an open standard, and there is no reason why any application and any workload should not run on this infrastructure &#8212; and we&#8217;ve seen it over and over again in many many customers. So we don&#8217;t see any bottlenecks whatsoever for people to move right away,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that this solution does not include hardware. It&#8217;s about bringing your own hardware infrastructure, either physical or as a service, or using a Mirantis partner like Equinix. The service is available now for $15,000 per month or $180,000 annually, which includes: 1,000 core/vCPU licenses for access to all products in the Mirantis software suite plus support for 20 virtual machine (VM) migrations or application onboarding and unlimited 24&#215;7 support. The company does not charge any additional fees for control plane and management software licenses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter&#8217;s creator platform <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-super-follows">Super Follows</a> is off to an inauspicious start, having contributed to somewhere around $6,000 in U.S. iOS revenue in the first two weeks the feature has been live, according to app intelligence data provided by <a href="https://sensortower.com/">Sensor Tower</a>. And it&#8217;s made only around $600 or so in Canada. A small portion of that revenue may be attributed to <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces">Ticketed Spaces</a>, Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces-ticketed#how-do-i-purchase">other in-app purchase</a> offered in the U.S. &#8212; but there&#8217;s no way for this portion to be calculated by an outside firm.</p>
<p>Twitter first announced its plans to launch Super Follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">during its Analyst Day event </a>in February, where the company detailed many of its upcoming initiatives to generate new revenue streams.</p>
<p>Today, Twitter&#8217;s business is highly dependent on advertising, and Super Follows is one of the few ways it&#8217;s aiming to diversify. The company is also now offering a way for creators to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/twitter-super-follows-and-ticketed-spaces/">charge for access </a>to their live events with Ticketed Spaces and, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/twitter-launches-its-premium-subscription-twitter-blue-initially-in-canada-and-australia/">outside the U.S., Twitter has begun testing </a>a premium product for power users, called <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-twitter-blue.html">Twitter Blue</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203950" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203950" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2203950" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/creator_posting_superfollows_content.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="525" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/creator_posting_superfollows_content.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png 4916w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/creator_posting_superfollows_content.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/creator_posting_superfollows_content.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=300,231 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/creator_posting_superfollows_content.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=768,592 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/creator_posting_superfollows_content.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=680,525 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/creator_posting_superfollows_content.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=1536,1185 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/creator_posting_superfollows_content.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=2048,1580 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/creator_posting_superfollows_content.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203950" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>But Super Follows, which targets creators, is the effort with the most potential appeal to mainstream users.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also one that is working to capitalize on the growing creator economy, where content creators build a following, then generate revenue directly through subscriptions &#8212; decreasing their own dependence on ads or brand deals, as a result. The platforms they use for this business skim a little off the top to help them fund the development of the creator tools. (In Twitter&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s taking only a 3% cut.)</p>
<p>The feature would seem to make sense for Twitter, a platform that already allows high-profile figures and regular folks to hobnob in the same timeline and have conversations. Super Follows ups that access by letting fans get even closer to their favorite creators &#8212; whether those are musicians, artists, comedians, influencers, writers, gamers or other experts, for example. These creators can set a monthly subscription price of $2.99, $4.99 or $9.99 to provide fans with access to bonus, &#8220;behind-the-scenes&#8221; content of their choosing. These generally come in the form of extra tweets, Q&amp;As and other interactions with subscribers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>At launch, Twitter opened up Super Follows to <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-super-follows">a handful of creators</a>, including the beauty and skincare-focused account <a href="https://twitter.com/MakeupForWOC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@MakeupforWOC</a>; astrology account <a href="https://twitter.com/TarotByBronx">@TarotByBronx</a>; sports-focused <a href="https://twitter.com/KingJosiah54">@KingJosiah54</a>; writer <a href="https://twitter.com/myeshachou">@myeshachou</a>; internet personality and podcaster <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelaOkla">@MichaelaOkla</a>; spiritual healer <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/kemimarie?lang=en">@kemimarie</a>; music charts tweeter <a href="https://twitter.com/chartdata">@chartdata</a>; Twitch streamers <a href="https://twitter.com/FaZeMew">@FaZeMew</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/VelvetIsCake">@VelvetIsCake</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MackWood1x">@MackWood1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/GabeJRuiz">@GabeJRuiz</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/saulsrevenge?lang=en">@Saulsrevenge</a>; YouTubers <a href="https://twitter.com/DoubleH_YT">@DoubleH_YT</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/LxckTV">@LxckTV</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/PowerGotNow">@PowerGotNow</a>; and crypto traders <a href="https://twitter.com/itsALLrisky">@itsALLrisky</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/moon_shine15">@moon_shine15</a>; among others. Twitter says there are fewer than 100 creators in total who have access to Super Follows.</p>
<p>While access on the creation side is limited, the ability to subscribe to creators is not. Any Twitter iOS user in the U.S. or Canada can &#8220;Super Follow&#8221; any number of the supported creator accounts. In the U.S., Twitter has 169 million average monetizable daily active users <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2'21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">as of Q2 2021</a>. Of course, only some subset of those will be iOS users.</p>
<p>Still, Twitter could easily count millions upon millions of &#8220;potential&#8221; customers for its Super Follow platform at launch. Its current revenue indicates that, possibly, only thousands of consumers have done so, given many of the top in-app purchases are for creators offering content at lower price points.</p>

<p>Sensor Tower notes the $6,000 in U.S. consumer spending on iOS was calculated during the first two weeks of September (September 1-14). Before this period, U.S. iOS users spent only $100 from August 25 through 31 &#8212; a figure that would indicate user spending on Ticketed Spaces during that time. In other words, the contribution of Tickets Spaces revenue to this total of $6,000 in iOS consumer spending is likely quite small.</p>
<p>In Canada, the other market where Super Follow is now available to subscribers, Twitter&#8217;s iOS in-app purchase revenue from September 1 through September 14, was a negligible $600. (This would also include Twitter Blue subscription revenue, which is <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-twitter-blue">being tested</a> in Canada and Australia.)</p>
<p>Worldwide, Twitter users on iOS spent $9,000 during that same time, which would include other Ticketed Spaces revenues and tests of its premium service, Twitter Blue. (Twitter&#8217;s Tip Jar, a way to pay creators directly, does not work through in-app purchases).</p>
<p>Unlike other Twitter products that developed by watching what users were already doing anyway &#8212; like using hashtags or retweeting content &#8212; many of Twitter&#8217;s newer features are attempts at redefining the use cases for its platform. In a massive rush of product pushes, Twitter has recently launched tools not just for creators, but also for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/twitter-tests-new-e-commerce-features-for-tweets/">e-commerce</a>, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-twitter-blue">organizing reading materials</a>, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/making-twitter-a-better-home-for-writers">subscribing to newsletters</a>, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/testing-communities">socializing in communities</a>, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/spaces-is-here">chatting through audio</a>,<a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-birdwatch-a-community-based-approach-to-misinformation"> fact-checking content,</a> <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/adding-more-context-to-trends">keeping up with trends</a>, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/new-conversation-settings-coming-to-a-tweet-near-you">conversing more privately</a> and more.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s position on the slower start to Super Follows is that it&#8217;s still too early to make any determinations. While that’s fair, it’s also worth tracking adoption to see if the new product had seen any rapid, out-of-the-gate traction.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is just the start for Super Follows,” a Twitter spokesperson said, reached for comment about Sensor Tower’s figures. “Our main goal is focused on ensuring creators are set up for success and so we’re working closely with a small group of creators in this first iteration to ensure they have the best experience using Super Follows before we roll out more widely.”</p>
<p>The spokesperson also noted Twitter Super Follows had been set up to help creators make more money as it scales.</p>
<p>“With Super Follows, people are eligible to earn up to 97% of revenue after in-app purchase fees until they make $50,000 in lifetime earnings. After $50,000 in lifetime earnings, they can earn up to 80% of revenue after in-app purchase fees,&#8221; they said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Building an orbital launch business from scratch is no simple matter, but what if that business is just a stepping stone to a vertically integrated, interplanetary space company? Rocket Lab founder Peter Beck will be joining us next week at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> (Sept 21-23) to talk about the challenge and exhilaration of pursuing his passion for space, all the way to orbit, the moon and beyond.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab started over a decade ago as Beck tested increasingly large rockets, with the (supposedly) ultimate goal of building a small, reliable and relatively inexpensive launch vehicle that could deliver payloads to orbit at a weekly cadence &#8212; or even faster.</p>
<p>Since then the company and its Electron launch vehicle have become not just a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/rocket-labs-order-backlog-tops-141m-as-the-company-inks-five-launch-deal-with-kineis/"> sought-after ride to orbit</a>, but it has begun expanding into spacecraft design and manufacturing with Photon, and announced a much larger vehicle called Neutron. Now they&#8217;ve even been tapped for an Artemis-related lunar mission and are planning a privately funded mission to Venus. (And of course they&#8217;ve raised a boatload of money and are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-ceo-peter-beck-explains-why-the-company-needs-a-bigger-rocket-and-why-its-going-public-to-build-it/">going public</a>.)</p>
<p>The always forthcoming, Beck will join us virtually from his home country HQ in New Zealand to discuss Rocket Lab&#8217;s success and future endeavors, and the challenge of adapting a company from underdog launch provider to sprawling space services company with competition nipping at its heels.</p>
<p>We hope you&#8217;ll join us next week at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">Disrupt</a>. You can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">get your passes now</a> for under $100 until Monday, September 20.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The speed at which gaming has proliferated is matched only by the pace of new buzzwords inundating the ecosystem. Marketers and decision-makers, already suffering from FOMO about opportunities within gaming, have latched onto buzzy trends like the applications of blockchain in gaming and the “metaverse” in an effort to get ahead of the trend rather than constantly play catch-up.</p>
<p>The allure is obvious, as the relationship between the blockchain, metaverse and gaming makes sense. Gaming has always been on the forefront of digital ownership (one can credit gaming platform Steam for normalizing the concept for games, and arguably other media such as movies), and most agreed upon visions of the metaverse rely upon virtual environments common in games with decentralized digital ownership.</p>
<p>Whatever your opinion of either, I believe they both have an interrelated future in gaming. However, the success or relevance of either of these buzzy topics is dependent upon a crucial step that is being skipped at this point.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the example of blockchain and, more specifically, NFTs. Collecting items of varying rarities and often random distribution form some of the core “loops” in many games (e.g., kill monster, get better weapon, kill tougher monster, get even better weapon, etc.), and collecting “skins” (i.e., different outfits/permutation of game character) is one of the most embraced paradigms of microtransactions in games.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The way NFTs are currently being discussed in relation to gaming are very much in danger of falling into this very trap: Killing the core gameplay loop via a financial fast track.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Now, NFTs are positioned to be a natural fit with various rare items having permanent, trackable and open value. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/loot-games-the-crypto-world/">Recent releases</a> such as <a href="https://decrypt.co/80108/what-is-loot-ethereum-nft-role-playing-phenonemon">“Loot (for Adventurers)”</a> have introduced a novel approach wherein the NFTs are simply descriptions of fantasy-inspired gear and offered in a way that <a href="https://www.lootproject.com/resources">other creators can use them as tools to build worlds around</a>. It’s not hard to imagine a game built around NFT items, à la Loot.</p>
<p>But that’s been done before … kind of. Developers of games with a “loot loop” like the one described above have long had a problem with “farmers,” who acquire game currencies and items to sell to players for real money, against the terms of service of the game. The solution was to implement in-game “auction houses” where players could instead use real money to purchase items from one another.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unfortunately, this had an unwanted side effect. As noted by renowned game psychologist Jamie Madigan, our brains are evolved to pay special attention to rewards that are both unexpected and beneficial. When much of the joy in some games comes from an unexpected or randomized reward, being able to easily acquire a known reward with real money robbed the game of what made it fun.</p>
<p>The way NFTs are currently being discussed in relation to gaming are very much in danger of falling into this very trap: Killing the core gameplay loop via a financial fast track. The most extreme examples of this phenomena commit the biggest cardinal sin in gaming — a game that is “pay to win,” where a player with a big bankroll can acquire a material advantage in a competitive game.</p>
<p>Blockchain games such as <a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie Infinity</a> have rapidly increased enthusiasm around the concept of &#8220;play to earn,&#8221; where players can potentially earn money by selling tokenized resources or characters earned within a blockchain game environment. If this sounds like a scenario that can come dangerously close to &#8220;pay to win,&#8221; that&#8217;s because it is.</p>
<p>What is less clear is whether it matters in this context. Does anyone care enough about the core game itself rather than the potential market value of NFTs or earning potential through playing? More fundamentally, if real-world earnings are the point, is it truly a game or just a gamified micro-economy, where “farming” as described above is not an illicit activity, but rather the core game mechanic?</p>
<p>The technology culture around blockchain has elevated solving for very hard problems that very few people care about. The solution (like many problems in tech) involves reevaluation from a more humanist approach. In the case of gaming, there are some fundamental gameplay and game psychology issues to be tackled before these technologies can gain mainstream traction.</p>
<p>We can turn to the metaverse for a related example. Even if you aren’t particularly interested in gaming, you’ve almost certainly heard of the concept after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview">Mark Zuckerberg staked the future of Facebook upon it</a>. For all the excitement, the fundamental issue is that it simply doesn’t exist, and the closest analogs are massive digital game spaces (such as Fortnite) or sandboxes (such as Roblox). Yet, many brands and marketers who haven’t really done the work to understand gaming are trying to fast-track to an opportunity that isn’t likely to materialize for a long time.</p>
<p>Gaming can be seen as the training wheels for the metaverse — the ways we communicate within, navigate and think about virtual spaces are all based upon mechanics and systems with foundations in gaming. I’d go so far as to predict the first adopters of any “metaverse” will indeed be gamers who have honed these skills and find themselves comfortable within virtual environments.</p>
<p>By now, you might be seeing a pattern: We’re far more interested in the “future” applications of gaming without having much of a perspective on the “now” of gaming. Game scholarship has proliferated since the early aughts due to a recognition of how games were influencing thought in fields ranging from sociology to medicine, and yet the business world hasn’t paid it much attention until recently.</p>
<p>The result is that marketers and decision-makers are doing what they do best (chasing the next big thing) without the usual history of why said thing should be big, or what to do with it when they get there. The growth of gaming has yielded an immense opportunity, but the sophistication of the conversations around these possibilities remains stunted, due in part to our misdirected attention.</p>
<p>There is no “pay to win” fast track out of this blind spot. We have to put in the work to win.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Web 1.0 was the static web, and Web 2.0 is the social web, but Web 3.0 will be the decentralized web. It will move us from a world in which communities contribute but don’t own or profit, to one where they can through collaboration.</p>
<p>By breaking away from traditional business models centered around benefiting large corporations, Web3 brings the possibility of community-centered economies of scale. This collaborative spirit and its associated incentive mechanisms are attracting some of the most talented and ambitious developers today, unlocking projects that were previously not possible.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Web3 might not be the final answer, but it&#8217;s the current iteration, and innovation isn&#8217;t always obvious in the beginning.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Web3, as <a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-web-3">Ki Chong Tran</a> once said, is &#8220;The next major iteration of the internet, which promises to wrest control from the centralized corporations that today dominate the web.&#8221; Web3-enabled collaboration is made possible by decentralized networks that no single entity controls.</p>
<p>In closed-source business models, users trust a business to manage funds and execute services. With open source projects, users trust the technology to perform these tasks. In Web2, the bigger network wins. In Web3, whoever builds the biggest network together wins.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">web2: we work in a zero-sum environment where everything is a competition (who can build the biggest network)</p>
<p>web3: we work in a positive-sum environment where collaboration wins (how can we build the biggest network together)</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In a decentralized world, not only is participation open to all, the incentive structure is designed so that the greater the number of participants, the more everybody succeeds.</p>
<h2>Learning from Linux</h2>
<p>Linux, which is behind a majority of Web2&#8217;s websites, changed the paradigm for how the internet was developed and provides a clear example of how collaborative processes can drive the future of technology. Linux wasn&#8217;t developed by an incumbent tech giant, but by a group of volunteer programmers who used networked collaboration, which is when people freely share information without central control.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cathedral-Bazaar-Musings-Accidental-Revolutionary/dp/0596001088">&#8220;The Cathedral &amp; The Bazaar,&#8221;</a> author Eric S. Raymond shares his observations of the Linux kernel development process and his experiences managing open source projects. Raymond depicts a time when the popular mindset was to develop complex operating systems carefully coordinated by a small, exclusionary group of people — “cathedrals,” which are corporations and financial institutions.</p>
<p>Linux evolved in a completely different way. Raymond explains, &#8220;Quality was maintained not by rigid standards or autocracy, but by the naively simple strategy of releasing every week and getting feedback from hundreds of users within days, creating a sort of Darwinian selection on the mutations introduced by developers. To the amazement of almost everyone, this worked quite well.&#8221; This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#Development_model">Linux development model</a>, or “bazaar” model as Raymond puts it, assumes that &#8220;bugs are generally shallow phenomena&#8221; when exposed to an army of hackers without significant coordination.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies process ever-increasing amounts of data, moving it in real time is a huge challenge for organizations. <a href="https://www.confluent.io/">Confluent</a> is a streaming data platform built on top of the open source <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a> project that&#8217;s been designed to process massive numbers of events. To discuss this, and more, Confluent CEO and co-founder Jay Kreps will be joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=jaycrepspost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=jaycrepspost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS on Oct 27th</a> for a fireside chat.</p>
<p>Data is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/datarobot-ceo-dan-wright-coming-to-tc-sessions-saas-to-discuss-role-of-data-in-machine-learning/">a big part of the story</a> we are telling at the SaaS event, as it has such a critical role in every business. Kreps has said in the past the data streams are at the core of every business, from sales to orders to customer experiences. As he wrote in <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/series-e-round-metamorphosis/">a company blog post</a> announcing the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/confluent-lands-another-big-round-with-250m-series-e-on-4-2b-valuation/">$250 million Series E</a> in April 2020, Confluent is working to process all of this data in real time &#8212; and that was a big reason why investors were willing to pour so much money into the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason is simple: though new data technologies come and go, event streaming is emerging as a major new category that is on a path to be as important and foundational in the architecture of a modern digital company as databases have been,&#8221; Kreps wrote at the time.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s streaming data platform takes a multi-faceted approach to streaming and builds on the open source Kafka project. While anyone can download and use Kafka, as with many open source projects, companies may lack the resources or expertise to deal with the raw open source code. Many a startup have been built on open source to help simplify whatever the project does, and Confluent and Kafka are no different.</p>
<p>Kreps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/confluent-raises-50m-to-continue-growing-commercial-arm-of-apache-kafka/">told us in 2017</a> that companies using Kafka as a core technology include Netflix, Uber, Cisco and Goldman Sachs. But those companies have the resources to manage complex software like this. Mere mortal companies can pay Confluent to access a managed cloud version or they can manage it themselves and install it in the cloud infrastructure provider of choice.</p>
<p>The project was actually born at LinkedIn in 2011 when their engineers were tasked with building a tool to process the enormous number of events flowing through the platform. The company eventually open sourced the technology it had created and Apache Kafka was born.</p>
<p>Confluent launched in 2014 and raised over $450 million along the way. In its last private round in April 2020, the company scored a $4.5 billion valuation on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/confluent-lands-another-big-round-with-250m-series-e-on-4-2b-valuation/">a $250 million investment</a>. As of today, it has a market cap of over $17 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to our discussion with Kreps, the conference will also include Google&#8217;s Javier Soltero, Amplitude’s Olivia Rose, as well as investors Kobie Fuller and Casey Aylward, among others. We hope you’ll join us. It’s going to be a thought-provoking lineup.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.whatnot.com">Whatnot</a>, a livestreaming shopping platform for collectors to buy and sell things like rare Pokémon cards and Funko Pops, has closed a $150 million Series C — its third round of fundraising in 2021 alone. This round pins Whatnot&#8217;s valuation at $1.5 billion, earning it a spot on the ever-growing list of unicorns.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s a Whatnot? The app captures a trend that had been growing popular on platforms like Instagram in the U.S. (and was already hugely popular in China): live shopping. Verified sellers can go on the air at any time, hosting on-the-fly video auctions for their goods. Sometimes buyers know exactly what they&#8217;re getting. Other times it&#8217;s more of a mystery bag; with the popular &#8220;card break&#8221; concept, for example, users buy assigned portions of an unopened (and often itself rare) box of Pokémon or sports cards and watch its contents revealed live.</p>
<p>This round was funded by return investors a16z and Y Combinator&#8217;s Continuity Fund, along with one new firm joining them: CapitalG (which was known as Google Capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/04/google-capital-changes-its-name-to-capitalg/">before the Google/Alphabet name change</a>.) They&#8217;ve also added a few well-known names to their list of angel investors, including Andre Iguodala of the Golden State Warriors, Zion Williamson of the New Orleans Pelicans and Logan Paul of the YouTube. Initial word of this round broke last week, via <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/live-shopping-startup-whatnot-raising-at-1-5-billion-valuation">The Information.</a></p>
<p>Whatnot originally started as a more standard (less live) resale platform, at first focused on authenticating just one kind of collectable: Funko Pops. As the pandemic took over and everyone was suddenly stuck at home, they leaned hard into live shopping — and grew rapidly as a result.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GVdEe3JryL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/whatnot-wants-to-be-the-goat-of-collectible-toys-starting-with-funko-pop-figurines/">Whatnot wants to be the GOAT of collectible toys, starting with Funko Pops</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Whatnot wants to be the GOAT of collectible toys, starting with Funko Pops&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/whatnot-wants-to-be-the-goat-of-collectible-toys-starting-with-funko-pop-figurines/embed/#?secret=GVdEe3JryL" data-secret="GVdEe3JryL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Meanwhile, the company has been quickly expanding its scope; it grew from just Funko Pops to all sorts of other collectables, including Pokémon cards, pins, vintage clothing, sneakers and more. Whatnot co-founder Grant Lafontaine tells me that its biggest driver is sports cards, followed by Pokémon and Funko Pops. With each category it dives into, Whatnot focuses on onboarding sellers that are already known and trusted in their respective community; each streamer on the platform is currently vetted by the company before they can go live, helping them keep fraud to a minimum. Doing anything sketchy just means getting booted off the platform and burning your own reputation in the process.</p>
<p>A few other key bits from my conversation with Lafontaine:</p>
<ul>
<li>He sees &#8220;thousands&#8221; of potential categories they can expand into. One they&#8217;re working on right now: NFTs. Streamers would be able to import their NFTs into Whatnot, displaying them on screen and bringing them in as (static or animated) overlays in the livestream. Users could tap an onscreen NFT to reveal its metadata and learn more about it.</li>
<li>He says there are &#8220;a couple thousand active livestream sellers&#8221; on the platform right now.</li>
<li>The company&#8217;s GMV (the total value of everything sold on the platform) is up 30x since its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/whatnot-raises-20m-for-its-live-streaming-platform-built-for-selling-pokemon-cards-and-other-collectibles/">Series A back in the beginning of this year</a>. Whatnot takes an 8% cut on each sale.</li>
<li>They&#8217;re in the middle of rolling out a &#8220;pre-bidding&#8221; feature, which will allow users to bid on items they know they want ahead of a livestream — if, for example, the user knows they want a certain thing and want a shot at it, but won&#8217;t be able to watch live. Others could still out-bid them, of course.</li>
<li>The company is soon rolling out a complete rebuild of both its iOS and Android apps, with a new UI meant to make the entire process smoother and easier for both buyers and sellers. Lafontaine expects it to ship to everyone in &#8220;the next week or two.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>This round brings the company&#8217;s total funds raised to $225 million — pretty much all of that in the last year. Meanwhile, competition in the space is heating up; competitors like <a href="https://popshop.live/discovery">Popshop</a> have<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/popshop-live-raises-around-20m-at-a-100m-valuation-for-its-livestream-shopping-platform-for-hipsters/"> been raising millions</a> for their platforms, and Miami&#8217;s <a href="https://loupetheapp.com">Loupe</a> raised $12 million back in June (and is opening a physical retail space soon) with its focus laser-locked on sports cards live sales. Existing giants want in on it too: YouTube is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/youtube-to-pilot-test-shopping-from-livestreams-with-select-creators/">playing with the live shopping concept</a>, and Amazon has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/livestream-e-commerce-why-companies-and-brands-need-to-tune-in/">bringing in influencers to host live sessions</a>. In other words: watch this space. Maybe watch it via livestream.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook today is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/introducing-products-for-the-next-era-of-personalized-experiences">announcing</a> the launch of new products and features for business owners, following the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-facebook-clash-over-ads-small-businesses-fear-theyll-be-impacted-11618009627">threat</a> to its ad targeting business driven by <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency">Apple&#8217;s new privacy features</a>, which now allow mobile users to opt out of being tracked across their iOS apps. The social networking giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-small-business/">has repeatedly argued that Apple&#8217;s changes</a> would impact small businesses that relied on Facebook ads to reach their customers. But it was not successful in getting any of Apple&#8217;s changes halted. Instead, the market is shifting to a new era focused more on user privacy, where personalization and targeting are more of an opt-in experience. That&#8217;s required Facebook to address its business advertiser base in new ways.</p>
<p>As the ability to track consumers declines &#8212; very few consumers are opting into tracking, <a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-att-restricted-app-tracking-transparency-worldwide-us-daily-latest-update/">studies find</a> &#8212; Facebook is rolling out new features that will allow businesses to better position themselves in front of relevant audiences. This includes updates that will let them reach customers, advertise to customers, chat with customers across Facebook apps, generate leads, acquire customers and more.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/new-facebook-tools-for-online-marketing">earlier this year began testing a way</a> for customers to explore businesses from underneath News Feed posts by tapping on topics they were interested in &#8212; like beauty, fitness and clothing, and explore content from other related businesses. The feature <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/facebook-to-test-new-business-discovery-features-in-u-s-news-feed/">allows people to come across new businesses</a> they may also like, and would allow Facebook to create its own data set of users who like certain types of content. Over time, it could possibly even turn the feature into an ad unit, where businesses could pay for higher placement.</p>
<p>But for the time being, Facebook will expand this feature to more users across the U.S., and launch it in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa and the U.K.</p>

<p>Facebook is also making it easier for businesses to chat with customers. They&#8217;re already able to buy ads that encourage people to message them on Facebook&#8217;s various chat platforms &#8212; Messenger, Instagram Direct or WhatsApp. Now, they&#8217;ll be able to choose all the messaging platforms where they&#8217;re available, and Facebook will default the chat app showcased in the ad based on where the conversation is most likely to happen.</p>

<p>The company will tie WhatsApp to Instagram, as well, as part of this effort. Facebook explains that many businesses market themselves or run shops across Instagram, but rely on WhatsApp to communicate with customers and answer questions. So, Facebook will now allow businesses to add a WhatsApp click-to-chat button to their Instagram profiles.</p>
<p>This change, in particular, represents another move that ties Facebook&#8217;s separate apps more closely together, at a time when <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/19/tech/ftc-facebook-antitrust/index.html">regulators are considering</a> breaking up Facebook over antitrust concerns. Already, Facebook interconnected Facebook&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/facebook-introduces-cross-app-communication-between-messenger-and-instagram-plus-other-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/facebook-introduces-cross-app-communication-between-messenger-and-instagram-plus-other-features/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631832022380000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEwiqhJ8za71NRnQ9rygzO2Td7FYQ"> Messenger and Instagram messaging services,</a> which would make such a disassembly more complicated. And more recently, it&#8217;s begun <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-23/facebook-retools-messaging-again-by-adding-calling-to-main-app?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-23/facebook-retools-messaging-again-by-adding-calling-to-main-app?sref%3Dgni836kR&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631832022380000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEMQrrClPG5e5iUh2nwYDsCtUpE2w">integrating</a> Messenger directly into Facebook&#8217;s platform itself.</p>

<p>In a related change, soon businesses will be able to create ads that send users directly to WhatsApp from the Instagram app. (Facebook also already offers ads like this.)</p>
<p>Separately from this news, Facebook<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/whatsapp-business/whatsapp-launches-test-of-in-app-business-directory-idUKL1N2QH0U1"> announced the launch of a new business directory on WhatsApp</a>, allowing consumers to find shops and services on the chat platform, as well.</p>
<p>Another set of changes being introduced involve an update to <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/a-faster-and-easier-way-to-manage-your-business-on-facebook-and-instagram/">Facebook Business Suite</a>. Businesses will be able to manage emails through Inbox and send remarketing emails; use a new File Manager for creating, managing and posting content; and access a feature that will allow businesses to test different versions of a post to see which one is most effective.</p>

<p>Other new products include tests of paid and organic lead generation tools on Instagram; quote requests on Messenger, where customers answer a few questions prior to their conversations; and a way for small businesses to access a bundle of tools to get started with Facebook ads, which includes a Facebook ad coupon along with free access to QuickBooks for three months or free access to Canva Pro for three months.</p>

<p>Facebook will also begin testing something called &#8220;Work Accounts,&#8221; which will allow business owners to access their business products, like Business Manager, separately from their personal Facebook account. They&#8217;ll be able to manage these accounts on behalf of employees and use single sign-on integrations.</p>
<p>Work Accounts will be tested through the remainder of the year with a small group of businesses, and Facebook says it expects to expand availability in 2022.</p>
<p>Other efforts it has in store include plans to incorporate more content from creators and local businesses and new features that let users control the content they see, but these changes were not detailed at this time.</p>
<p>Most of the products being announced are either rolling out today or will begin to show up soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford said Thursday it will invest another $250 million and add 450 jobs to increase production capacity of its upcoming F-150 Lightning to 80,000 all-electric trucks annually. The announcement comes after receiving more than 150,000 pre-orders for the all-electric pickup truck.</p>
<p>The additional funds and jobs will be spread out across its new Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan, Van Dyke Electric Powertrain Center and Rawsonville Components Plant, Ford said.</p>
<p>The announcement was made during an event at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, a 500,000-square-foot facility expansion that was part of Ford&#8217;s $700 million investment in its Rouge Complex. Gas-powered F-Series trucks are also assembled at the Rouge Complex.</p>

<p>Ford also announced that it has started pre-production of the Lightning trucks. These prototypes will be used for real-world testing. The truck will be available to customers in spring 2022.</p>
<p>The all-electric pickup truck is a critical piece of the company&#8217;s $30 billion investment into electrification and one of a trifecta of Ford EV debuts and launches in the next 18 months, including the Mustang Mach-E. The Lightning may be the most meaningful in terms of the bottom line. The Ford F-150 Lightning follows the introduction of the all-electric Mustang Mach-E and the E-Transit, a configurable all-electric cargo van focused on commercial customers.</p>
<p>The F-150 Lightning will be offered in four trims, which includes the base, XLT, Lariat and Platinum series, and two battery options. The truck, which has an aluminum alloy body, is powered by two in-board electric motors, comes standard with four-wheel drive and has an independent rear suspension.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The art of pitching is perhaps the most important art that a founder learns on their journey to unicorn status and beyond. And like any art, it helps to get some critical feedback along the way from the judges on the other side of the table.</p>
<p>That’s why at every Disrupt, we host Pitch Deck Teardown, a panel of VCs who read and critique several pitch decks in a row to offer feedback on everything from the overarching narrative and story to the mundane details of format, typography and colors.</p>
<p>At TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 next week, I’m excited to be hosting Maren Bannon of January Ventures, Bling Capital’s Ben Ling and Vanessa Larco of NEA for our next iteration of this popular workshopping panel.</p>
<p>If you’re a founder and want to submit your deck for consideration, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6unxbSjKe2dVQxoDyNs95En1R3mzPc6I5D5Gdi7YhgDJPnA/viewform"><strong>head on over to this trusty Google Form</strong></a> and upload a copy of your pitch deck in PDF format. Remember that this will be presented publicly, so make sure it’s appropriate for a live studio audience. We’ll be selecting roughly six of them for inclusion in the event, and we’ll notify by email the founders selected.</p>
<p>Come join us next week! And if you need tickets to Disrupt, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?promo=rightrail">we still have some available</a> for all the virtual excitement across two stages and dozens of fireside chats and panels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://fiberplane.dev">Fiberplane</a>, an Amsterdam-based early-stage startup that is building collaborative notebooks for SREs (site reliability engineers) to collaborate around an incident in a similar manner to group editing in a Google Doc, announced a ​​€7.5 million (approximately $8.8 million USD) seed round today.</p>
<p>The round was co-led by Crane Venture Partners and Notion Capital, with participation from Northzone, System.One and Basecase Capital.</p>
<p>Micha Hernandez van Leuffen (known as Mies) is founder and CEO at Fiberplane. When his previous startup, Werker, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/17/developer-tools-startup-wrecker-has-been-acquired-by-oracle/">was sold to Oracle</a> in 2017, Hernandez van Leuffen became part of a much larger company where he saw people struggling to deal with outages (which happen at every company).</p>
<p>&#8220;We were always going back and forth between metrics, logs and traces, what I always call this sort of treasure hunt, and figuring out what was the underlying root cause of an outage or downtime,&#8221; Hernandez van Leuffen told me.</p>
<p>He said that this experience led to a couple of key insights about incident response: First, you needed a centralized place to pull all the incident data together, and secondly that as a distributed team managing a distributed system you needed to collaborate in real time, often across different time zones.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2j6uuBnH6n"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/31/how-you-react-when-your-systems-fail-may-define-your-business/">How you react when your systems fail may define your business</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How you react when your systems fail may define your business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/31/how-you-react-when-your-systems-fail-may-define-your-business/embed/#?secret=2j6uuBnH6n" data-secret="2j6uuBnH6n" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>When he left Oracle in August 2020, he began thinking about the idea of giving DevOps teams and SREs the same kind of group editing capabilities that other teams inside an organization have with tools like Google Docs or Notion and an idea for his new company began to take shape.</p>
<p>What he created with Fiberplane is a collaborative notebook for SRE&#8217;s to pull in the various data types and begin to work together to resolve the incident, while having a natural audit trail of what happened and how they resolved the issue. Different people can participate in this notebook, just as multiple people can edit a Google Doc, fulfilling that original vision.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203799" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203799" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2203799" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Fiberplane incident response notebook with various types of data about the incident." width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203799" class="wp-caption-text">Fiberplane collaborative notebook example with multiple people involved. <strong>Image Credit:</strong> Fiberplane</p></div></p>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t plan to stop there though. The longer-term vision is an operational platform for SREs and DevOps teams to deal with every aspect of an outage. &#8220;This is our starting point, but we are planning to expand from there as more I would say an SRE workbench, where you&#8217;re also able to command and control your infrastructure,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Today the company has 13 employees and is growing, and as they do, they are exploring ways to make sure they are building a diverse company, looking at concrete strategies to find more diverse candidates.</p>
<p>&#8220;To hire diversely, we’re re-examining our top of the funnel processes. Our efforts include posting our jobs in communities of underrepresented people, running our job descriptions through a gender decoder and facilitating a larger time frame for jobs to remain open,&#8221; Elena Boroda, marketing manager at Fiberplane said.</p>
<p>While Hernandez van Leuffen is based in Amsterdam, the company has been hiring people in the U.K., Berlin, Copenhagen and the U.S., he said. The plan is to have Amsterdam as a central hub when offices reopen as the majority of employees are located there.</p>

More than 10,000 people will attend to learn about the latest tech and investment trends from iconic leaders, founders and VCs. They’ll network and connect to build game-changing startups.</p>
<p><strong>Time to get on board:</strong> It costs less than $100 to attend TechCrunch Disrupt until this Monday. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">Purchase your pass</a> now to save yourself some money. You can check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">the Disrupt agenda</a> here and then go grab your ticket.</p>
<p>The heart of every Disrupt — even our virtual incarnations — is Startup Alley. It’s where hundreds of innovative startups exhibit their products, platforms and services. It’s where investors look for portfolio potential, founders find new customers, tech journalists hunt for stories and everyone finds inspiration.</p>
<p>We’ve created a special series of events to focus on the wide range of talent in Startup Alley. It’s the Startup Alley Crawl — think pub crawl without the remorse. We group exhibitors in Startup Alley by business category, and each business category will have its own dedicated, hour-long crawl.</p>
<p>You might even see some of these exhibitors interviewed live during a Disrupt Desk segment. Sit back in the comfort of your secure, undisclosed location and tune in to learn more about what these companies have to offer.</p>
<p>All Startup Alley exhibitors have their own virtual booth where you can check out their pitch deck, strike up a conversation, schedule a product demo or connect with them via CrunchMatch to set up 1:1 video meetings.</p>
<p>Here’s what Jessica McLean, the director of marketing and communications for Infinite-Compute, a Startup Alley exhibitor at Disrupt 2020, had to say about networking during a virtual conference:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>The virtual platform made networking easy. We sent quick introductions, scheduled meetings with investors and other smart people who could add value to our company. A person we connected with at Disrupt is currently helping us with marketing, which is fantastic.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">APIs are the grease turning the gears and wheels for many organizations&#8217; IT systems today, but as APIs grow in number and use, tracking how they work (or don&#8217;t work) together can become complex and potentially critical if something goes awry. Now, a startup that has built an innovative way to help with this is announcing some funding after getting traction with big enterprises adopting its approach.</p>
<p><a href="https://tyk.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyk</a>, which has built a way for users to access and manage multiple internal enterprise APIs through a universal interface by way of GraphQL, has picked up $35 million, an investment that it will be using both for hiring and to continue enhancing and expanding the tools that it provides to users. Tyk has coined a term describing its approach to managing APIs and the data they produce &#8212; &#8220;<a href="https://tyk.io/docs/universal-data-graph/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">universal data graph</a>&#8221; &#8212; and today its tools are being used to manage APIs by some 10,000 businesses, including large enterprises like Starbucks, Societe Generale and Domino’s.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sep.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s4">Scottish Equity Partners</span></a> led the round, with participation also from <a href="https://mmc.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MMC Ventures</a> &#8212; its sole previous investor from a round in 2019 after boostrapping for its first five years. The startup is based out of London but works in a very distributed way &#8212; one of the co-founders is living in New Zealand currently &#8212; and it will be hiring and growing based on that principle, too. It has raised just over $40 million to date.</p>
<p>Tyk (pronounced like &#8220;tyke&#8221;, meaning small/lively child) got its start as an open source side project first for co-founder Martin Buhr, who is now the company&#8217;s CEO, while he was working elsewhere, as a &#8220;load testing thing,&#8221; in his words.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="sVbrCUOB4i"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/corporate-venture-capital-follows-the-same-trend-as-other-vc-markets-up/">Corporate venture capital follows the same trend as other VC markets: Up</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Corporate venture capital follows the same trend as other VC markets: Up&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/corporate-venture-capital-follows-the-same-trend-as-other-vc-markets-up/embed/#?secret=sVbrCUOB4i" data-secret="sVbrCUOB4i" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The shifts in IT toward service-oriented architectures, and building and using APIs to connect internal apps, led him to rethink the code and consider how it could be used to control APIs. Added to that was the fact that as far as Buhr could see, the API management platforms that were in the market at the time &#8212; some of the big names today include Kong, Apigee (now a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/08/google-will-acquire-apigee-for-625-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part of Google</a>), 3scale (now a <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-acquire-api-management-leader-3scale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part of RedHat</a> and thus IBM), MuleSoft (now a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/salesforce-is-buying-mulesoft-at-enterprise-value-of-6-5-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part of Salesforce</a>) &#8212; were not as flexible as his needs were. &#8220;So I built my own,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It was built as an open source tool, and some engineers at other companies started to use it. As it got more attention, some of the bigger companies interested in using it started to ask why he wasn&#8217;t charging for anything &#8212; a sure sign as any that there was probably a business to be built here, and more credibility to come if he charged for it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;So we made the gateway open source, and the management part went into a licensing model,&#8221; he said. And Tyk was born as a startup co-founded with James Hirst, who is now the COO, who worked with Buhr at a digital agency some years before.</p>
<p>The key motivation behind building Tyk has stayed as its unique selling point for customers working in increasingly complex environments.</p>
<p>&#8220;What sparked interest in Tyk was that companies were unhappy with API management as it exists today,&#8221; Buhr noted, citing architectures using multiple clouds and multiple containers, creating more complexity that needed better management. &#8220;It was just the right time when containerization, Kubernetes and microservices were on the rise&#8230; The way we approach the multi-data and multi-vendor cloud model is super flexible and resilient to partitions, in a way that others have not been able to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You engage developers and deliver real value and it’s up to them to make the choice,&#8221; added Hirst. &#8220;We are responding to a clear shift in the market.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the next frontiers that Tyk will tackle will be what happens within the management layer, specifically when there are potential conflicts with APIs.</p>
<p class="p9">&#8220;When a team using a microservice makes a breaking change, we want to bring that up and report that to the system,&#8221; Buhr said. &#8220;The plan is to flag the issue and test against it, and be able to say that a schema won&#8217;t work, and to identify why.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even before that is rolled out, though, Tyk&#8217;s customer list and its growth speak to a business on the cusp of a lot more.</p>
<p>“Martin and James have built a world-class team and the addition of this new capital will enable Tyk to accelerate the growth of its API management platform, particularly around the GraphQL focused Universal Data Graph product that launched earlier this year,&#8221; said Martin Brennan, a director at SEP, in a statement. &#8220;We are pleased to be supporting the team to achieve their global ambitions.”</p>
<p>Keith Davidson, a partner at SEP, is joining the Tyk board as a non-executive director with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On Tuesday, Tiger Global led not one but two big funding rounds, announcing its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/logistics-robotics-startup-ambi-raises-26m/">role in a $26 million Series A for Ambi</a> and an additional <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/locus-robotics-just-raised-another-50m/">$50 million for Locus Robotics</a>. The firm has been so active in investing of late, that neither one of these companies cracked Alex’s coveted “Today’s Tiger round” in our daily newsletter (that honor went to a $150 million round for Indonesian fintech company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/indonesian-fintech-xendit-is-now-a-unicorn-with-150m-in-fresh-funding-led-by-tiger-global/">Xendit</a>).</p>
<p>It’s fair to say that Tiger is bullish about robotics as a category. Other rounds in recent months include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/rapid-robotics-raises-another-36-7m/">$36.7 million for Rapid Robotics</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/path-robotics-raises-another-100m/">$100 million for Path</a> &#8212; both Series B. All of the rounds are head-turning in the robotics world, and they represent a broad scope under the larger robotics umbrella. Ambi and Locus both operate (though address different problems) in the logistics/fulfillment spaces, while Path and Rapid deal with construction and manufacturing, respectively.</p>

<p>Certainly that last bit speaks to how diversified interest has been in the category. All of the above industries no doubt saw enough impact during the pandemic to significantly accelerate interest in automation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114223" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114223" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2114223" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114223" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Locus Robotics</p></div></p>
<p>It’s also telling that the warehouse/fulfillment side of things gets a bit of extra love. In addition to the general strains of the pandemic, there’s the fact that everyone is looking for a way to compete with Amazon. The retailer already has a massive stranglehold on these categories and gave itself a big head start in terms of automation through a series of acquisitions. It’s an industry where any competitive advantage means a lot, and companies like Locus are hoping to crack that code.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In February, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/locus-robotics-has-raised-a-150m-series-e/">company raised a hefty $150 million</a>, with Tiger on as co-lead. And this week, the firm returned with another $50 million. Locus’ approach to the category offers more flexibility than those companies that require a kind of ground-up rebuild. It’s an appealing option in terms of pricing and time frame, and makes a lot more sense for organizations looking for seasonable robotic help &#8212; ditto for the company’s robotics-as-a-service pricing model.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Way back in 2015 we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/16/atmotube-is-a-tiny-pollution-sensor-that-clears-up-whats-in-the-air-you-breathe/">covered</a> the launch of the Atmotube, a small, innovative, portable air quality monitor which went on to receive a number of awards after its CES debut.</p>
<p>Since rebranding as <a href="https://atmotube.com">ATMO</a>, the company, co-founded by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/vera-kozyr">Vera Kozyr</a>, is now launching the <a href="https://atmotube.com/pages/atmocube">Atmocube</a>, an indoor air quality monitoring system for businesses and enterprises. This new product is positioned far more for the post-COVID era, where air quality inside offices is going to be vital, and this time, instead of being small and portable (although that earlier product is still sold), the Atmocube will be prominent and visible in order to give office workers peace of mind that their air quality is good.</p>
<p>The key to this is measuring CO2 levels, which the Atmocube displays on its screen along with other metrics.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Atmotube Is A Tiny Pollution Sensor That Clears Up What&#8217;s In The Air You Breathe&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/16/atmotube-is-a-tiny-pollution-sensor-that-clears-up-whats-in-the-air-you-breathe/embed/#?secret=KP1R2cWlin" data-secret="KP1R2cWlin" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The device has up to 14 sensors measuring various environmental parameters such as CO2, formaldehyde, PM1 (small airborne particles), PM2.5, ozone, and others, and other environmental parameters such as relative humidity, temperature, atmospheric pressure, ambient noise, and light levels.</p>
<p>The company says this new device also calculates the Airborne Virus Transmission Score — based on the levels of particulate matter, humidity and CO2, and says it comes up with a “score” that estimates the probability of transferring virus diseases in closed spaces. Obviously, that’s probably something that would need independent testing to verify, but it is the case that the WHO <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-how-is-it-transmitted">advises</a> that COVID-19 can be transmitted in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings.</p>
<p>Kozyr said: “Air pollution is dangerous because it can affect you and your health even if you don’t notice it. We aim to help people know what they’re breathing and make changes as a result. As businesses return to the office, they need a tool to make information about indoor air quality transparent and accessible to their employees. Most air quality monitors are designed to be hidden away, so we set out to create a device with a more transparent interface that would highlight HVAC performance safety and create trust between occupants and building owners”.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>ATMO is by no means the only player in the space of course, as it’s joined by <a href="https://www.airthings.com/en/">AirThings</a>, <a href="https://uk.getawair.com/">Awair Omni</a> and <a href="https://www.kaiterra.com/en/index/">Kaiterra</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in 2018 we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/19/open-mineral-plans-to-disrupt-commodities-trading-with-blockchain/">covered</a> how <a href="https://openmineral.com/">Open Mineral</a> (OM), a startup aiming to leverage greater transparency in commodities trading, had raised $2.25 million. Well, they’ve come a long way, and now the Zug, Switzerland-based, company has raised a $33 million Series C funding round led by <a href="https://www.mubadala.com/">Mubadala Investment Company</a>. Existing investors Xploration Capital and Emerald Technology Ventures were joined by new investors Statkraft and Lingfeng Capital.</p>
<p>The company says it will use the capital to solidify its physical supply chain merchant activities. The commodities trading market is worth $200 billion and even today there’s still a lot of paper flying around, so digitization is continuing apace.</p>
<p>Open Mineral says its platform has registered more than 900 metals and mining companies across the world, using its pricing algorithms across the commodity supply chain.</p>
<p>As well as digitizing aspects of the industry, OM says it’s also working with third-party providers to incorporate &#8220;green&#8221; ESG metrics across the sell-side and buy-side.</p>

<p>It also claims to have developed automated blending/smelter material optimization solutions “enabling more efficient, informed, and profitable trade of physical metal raw commodities.” These have an impact on transitioning to a lower carbon footprint, says the company.</p>
<p>Boris Eykher, CEO and co-founder of Open Mineral, said in a statement: “The metal trading industry’s future is in digital data and analytics, enabling market participants to communicate faster and make quicker, and more data-driven decisions. Just as eBay revolutionized retail purchasing by bringing more choices to buyers and sellers, we aim to do the same for physical commodity producers in a curated, trusted environment of the Open Mineral platform.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Faris Al Mazrui, head of Russia and CIS Investments at Mubadala, said: “Open Mineral is disrupting the commodity trading business by leveraging data analytics technology. Buyers and sellers of base metal commodities can tap into a unique and proprietary data hub to trade more efficiently and capture upside.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’ve spent so long staring at record venture capital results around the world from Q2 that it’s nearly Q3.</p>
<p>We’ve seen record results from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/bostons-startup-market-is-more-than-setting-records-in-scorching-start-to-year/">cities</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/india-poised-for-record-vc-year-as-unicorns-head-for-decisive-ipos/">countries</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/the-european-vc-market-is-so-hot-it-may-skip-its-summer-holiday/">regions</a>. There’s so much money sloshing around the venture capital and startup worlds that it’s hard to recall what they were like in leaner times. We’ve been in a bull market for tech upstarts for so long that it feels like the only possible state of affairs.</p>
<p>It’s not.</p>
<p>Digging back through our notes from the last few months from data sources, investors and founders, it’s clear that there are macroeconomic factors bolstering the startup economy. And there are changes to the economy that are providing additional lift. Secular tailwinds, if you will.</p>

<hr />
<p>But as the market giveth, it can also taketh away.</p>
<p>What might slow the startup boom? Similar to how certain macroeconomic conditions have provided a long-term boost, a reversal of those conditions could do the opposite. The secular trends powering startups — often on the demand side due to more rapid digitalization of global business — may be unconnected to the larger economy, a view underscored by software’s outsized performance during COVID-19 induced economic mess of mid-2020.</p>

Because no bull market lasts forever.</p>
<h2>Driving forces</h2>
<p>Prominent among the macroeconomic conditions that have helped startups’ fundraising totals rise are globally low interest rates. Money is cheap around the world at the moment.</p>
<p>It doesn’t cost much to borrow money today, compared to historical norms. The result of that dynamic is that lending money doesn’t earn as much either. Bank yields are negative in real terms, and bond yields aren’t impressive.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.readmargins.com/p/zirp-explains-the-world">Money always skates towards yield</a>, so the low interest rate environment has led to lots of capital moving toward more lucrative investing options. This dynamic is partially responsible for the seemingly ever-rising stock market, for example. It’s also a partial explanation of why there is so much capital flowing into venture capital funds and other vehicles that push money into high-growth private companies. The money is looking for yield.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.avax.network">Avalanche</a>, a relatively new blockchain with a focus on speed and low transactions costs, has completed a $230 million private sale of AVAX tokens to some well-known crypto funds. Polychain and Three Arrows Capital are leading the investment.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.avalabs.org">Avalanche Foundation</a> completed the private sale back in June 2021 and is disclosing it today. Other participants in the private sale include R/Crypto Fund, Dragonfly, CMS Holdings, Collab+Currency and Lvna Capital.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the private sale will be used to support the Avalanche ecosystem, which is relatively nascent when you compare it to the Ethereum blockchain, for instance. Among other things, the foundation plans to support DeFi (decentralized finance) projects as well as enterprise applications through grants, token purchases and other forms of investments.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://solana.com">Solana</a> and other newer blockchains, Avalanche wants to solve the scalability issues that older blockchains face. For instance, if you’ve recently tried to buy an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain, you probably paid $50 or $100 in transaction fees, or gas fees.</p>
<p>The Avalanche Foundation positions its blockchain as a solid alternative to Ethereum. You can run Dapps (decentralized apps) for a fraction of the costs with a much faster time-to-finality. Avalanche supports smart contracts, which is a key feature to enable DeFi projects.</p>
<p>Here’s what Avalanche’s official website says about its blockchain performance:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203737" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203737" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2203737" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-16-at-3.46.47-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="668" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-16-at-3.46.47-PM.png 2434w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-16-at-3.46.47-PM.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-16-at-3.46.47-PM.png?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-16-at-3.46.47-PM.png?resize=768,501 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-16-at-3.46.47-PM.png?resize=680,444 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-16-at-3.46.47-PM.png?resize=1536,1002 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-16-at-3.46.47-PM.png?resize=2048,1336 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-16-at-3.46.47-PM.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203737" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Avalanche</p></div></p>
<p>Having better performance is just part of the problem when you’re competing with Ethereum and other blockchains. Avalanche also needs to attract developers and build a strong developer community so that it becomes the infrastructure of other crypto projects.</p>
<p>That’s why Avalanche wants to make it as easy as possible to port your Ethereum Dapp to Avalanche. Avalanche’s smart contract chain executes Ethereum Virtual Machine contracts, which means that you can reuse part of your codebase if you’re already active on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Similarly, applications that query the Ethereum network can be adapted to support Avalanche by changing API endpoints and adding support for a new network. The Avalanche team has also been working on <a href="https://medium.com/avalancheavax/new-avalanche-bridge-builds-on-intel-sgx-technology-in-breakthrough-for-cross-chain-8f854e0e72e0">a bridge</a> to transfer Ethereum assets to the Avalanche blockchain. The equivalent of $1.3 billion in crypto assets have been transferred using this bridge.</p>
<p>Those are technical incentives. As for financial incentives, private sales and grants could help bootstrap developer interest. The Avalanche Foundation says that 225 projects currently support the platform, including popular crypto projects that already run on other blockchains, such as Tether, SushiSwap, Chainlink, Circle and The Graph. <a href="https://toppsnfts.com">Topps</a>, an NFT-based game with partnerships with the MLB and Bundesliga, is also using Avalanche.</p>
<p>Avalanche and its underlying token AVAX is currently the 14th cryptocurrency by total market capitalization according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com">CoinMarketCap</a>. With a current market cap of $13 billion, Avalanche is ahead of Algorand or Polygon, but behind Polkadot and Solana. Solana also suffered from a <a href="https://decrypt.co/80917/solana-down-for-hours-resource-exhaustion">major outage</a> earlier this week, raising questions about Solana&#8217;s ability to scale. It’s going to be interesting to see whether one of these blockchains can catch up with Ethereum or even surpass Ethereum in usage and value.</p>
