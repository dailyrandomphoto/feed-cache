										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As developers look for ways to simplify how they create software, serverless solutions, which enable them to write code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure required to run their applications, is becoming increasingly popular. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> announced today that it is enhancing its existing offering in this area with the acquisition of serverless startup <a href="https://nimbella.com/">Nimbella</a>. The companies did not share the terms of the deal.</p>
<p>With Nimbella, the company is getting a platform for building serverless applications that is built on the open source container orchestration platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/04/how-kubernetes-came-to-rule-the-world/">Kubernetes</a> and <a href="https://openwhisk.apache.org/">Apache OpenWhisk</a>, which is itself an open source serverless development platform.</p>
<p>DigitalOcean CEO Yancey Spruill, who took over two years ago, refers to Nimbella&#8217;s capabilities as Function as a Service with the goal being to simplify serverless development in an open source context for its target customers.&#8221;Serverless kinds of capabilities are taking a whole level of the infrastructure burden away from developers and businesses and we absorb that. We&#8217;ll allow our customers to have more configurability around the tools, which just removes burdens for them and allows them to go faster,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In practical terms, Nimbella CEO Anshu Agarwal says that means they are providing a specific set of tools to build sophisticated serverless applications and connect to other DigitalOcean services. &#8220;The capabilities that we will be adding to DigitalOcean portfolio are a fast solution, a function as a service solution that also integrates with the underlying DigitalOcean services [like] managed databases, storage and other services that make it make it easier for a developer to develop full applications, not just addressing events, but doing things which are completely stateless,&#8221; Agarwal explained.</p>
<p>Spruill said that this wasn&#8217;t the company&#8217;s first foray into serverless. That began last year when it offered its initial serverless tooling, but it wanted to build on its current offering and Nimbella fit the bill.</p>
<p>DigitalOcean is a cloud Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service provider, aiming at individual developers, startups and SMBs. While DigitalOcean&#8217;s $318 million 2020 revenue was a fraction of the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/the-cloud-infrastructure-market-hit-129b-in-2020/"> $129 billion cloud market</a>, it is proof that there is still money to be made even with a small slice of that market.</p>
<p>The companies did not discuss the terms of the deal, the number of employees involved or even the title that Agarwal would have when the deal closed, but the plan is to fully integrate Nimbella into the DigitalOcean portfolio and eventually make it a DigitalOcean-branded product some time in the first half of next year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Spanish on-demand delivery platform Glovo today announced plans to double its investment in Africa and expand its operations on the continent.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The Barcelona-based company has invested up to €25M ($30M) by bringing its food delivery service to six African countries &#8212; Morocco, Uganda, Kenya, Ghana, Côte d&#8217;Ivoire, and Nigeria.</p>
<p>Glovo is available in more than 40 cities with more than 300,000 users, 8,000 restaurants and 12,000 couriers in these countries. Earlier this year, it launched operations in Lagos, Nigeria and Accra, Ghana before expanding to Tema, another Ghanaian city last month.</p>
<p>Over the next 12 months, Glovo says it will invest an additional €50M ($60M) to drive expansion into more cities on the continent and move into new markets like Tunisia, where it plans to launch in Tunis next month.</p>
<p>According to a statement released by the company, the expansion will make Glovo&#8217;s services available to 6.5 million people. Co-founder Sacha Michaud believes these markets are currently underserved, and Glovo has found the right opportunity to work with local restaurants, bringing them online to reach new customers in a bid to &#8220;make everything, within all towns and cities, available to everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The attention on Africa follows a series of regional moves Glovo has pulled this year. After its mammoth <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/">$528 million Series F raise</a>, it acquired several <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/glovo-delivery-hero-brands-consolidation-chicken/">Delivery Hero&#8217;s businesses</a> in Central and Eastern Europe for $208 million.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spain&#8217;s Glovo picks up $528M as Europe&#8217;s food delivery market continues to heat up&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/embed/#?secret=g4nQQ4IsMT" data-secret="g4nQQ4IsMT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Now present in 23 countries, Africa represents 30% of the company&#8217;s geographical footprint. And the Spanish company plans to be live in 30 countries before the end of next year, a decision in part due to an IPO target in three years.</p>
<p>Glovo says it is a market leader in 80% of the countries where it has operations. The company&#8217;s grocery service arm has grown the fastest and revenue has been increasing significantly after a steady rise in orders. To meet the growing needs of customers, Glovo has had to invest heavily in dark stores and launched virtual brands for restaurants in July.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear if Glovo will extend these add-on services to Africa where it has its largest market in terms of population size: Nigeria. Yet, the West African nation does not come without its own fair share of troubles like poor logistics infrastructure and an unpredictable regulatory environment.</p>
<p>Despite that, a couple of food delivery platforms like Gokada and Jumia Food, a subsidiary of e-commerce giant Jumia have tried to scale, finding varying degrees of success doing so.</p>
<p>While Glovo will have to compete for market share with these players, it is bullish because of its multi-category strategy, for which grocery sales account for half of its business in some African markets.</p>
<p>That said, Glovo&#8217;s performance in emerging markets is questionable. Last year, the company pulled out of all the Latin American countries &#8212; Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic. It sold operations in these markets to Delivery Hero for $272 million.</p>
<p>The company also exited the Middle East and North Africa (Egypt and Turkey) and Uruguay and Puerto Rico in January 2020.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, Glovo has said it wanted to achieve profitability in a short amount of time. The delivery space is a thin-margin business and it is thinner in emerging markets. This played a part in why Glovo exited both Middle East and Latin America. The market isn&#8217;t any different in Africa, and time will tell if the Spanish delivery will stay put, exit, or close shop.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, Glovo says it is &#8220;committed to continuing its policy to hire top local talent&#8221; on the continent and plans to double its number of staff and add an extra 200 employees before the end of next year.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Our expansion in Nigeria, Ghana, and our upcoming launch in Tunisia is something we’ve been looking at for some time now, so it’s great to be able to make it official. There’s been an unprecedented spike in the on-demand delivery business in Africa and the expansion of our services to new countries and cities is both a reflection of that trend and a testament to our commitment to the continent. We’re looking forward to making food, groceries, pharmaceuticals, and retail products available to our new users at the touch of a button,” William Benthall, Glovo&#8217;s general manager of sub-Saharan Africa, said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After living through the global upheaval of the COVID-19 pandemic, many workers are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/08/16/us-workers-want-career-change/">re-evaluating</a> their career path. Stefan Heinrich Henriquez, a former Head of Global Marketing at TikTok and Chief Marketing Officer at Cameo, is one of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been thinking about music since my time at TikTok, and I was really thinking about building something on my own, but then it took me another year to finally have the guts to do it,&#8221; said Henriquez. &#8220;Then when the pandemic started, I think so many people were thinking about like, ‘What am I doing with my life?&#8221;</p>
<p>Along with his co-founder Akiva Bamberger, who was a software engineer on Snap&#8217;s Spectacles, Henriquez began work on <a href="http://mayk.it">mayk.it</a> last summer. Today, the social music app launches on iOS and announces its $4 million seed round from investors including Greycroft, Chicago Ventures, Slow Ventures, firstminute, Steven Galanis, Randi Zuckerberg, YouTuber Mr. Beasts’ Night media, Spotify’s first CMO Sophia Bendz, Cyan Banister, artist T-Pain and music industry veteran Zach Katz, among others.</p>
<p>Mayk.it wants to help people easily produce, own, and share music that they can create using just their phone. Users can upload their own beat or select an existing beat from another user, then add vocals (voice effects and somewhat corny lyric generators are available if you&#8217;re shy), and then add a visual from Giphy. Once you make (or, &#8220;mayk&#8221;) something, you can post it on the app, where other users can see it via a discovery page, which categorizes music by feeling or theme, rather than genre.</p>
<p>Mayk.it also poses &#8220;ideas,&#8221; or prompts to spur creativity, like &#8220;What is your pet thinking about right now?&#8221; or &#8220;Make a song about your first crush.&#8221; There&#8217;s also a Tinder-like tab that lets you swipe left or right on songs &#8212; if you really like it, you can leave a comment (called an &#8220;encouragement&#8221; in an attempt to keep things supportive) or remix it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2197713" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8030-copy.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="366" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8030-copy.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8030-copy.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8030-copy.jpg?resize=300,161 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8030-copy.jpg?resize=768,413 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8030-copy.jpg?resize=680,366 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8030-copy.jpg?resize=1536,826 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8030-copy.jpg?resize=2048,1102 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8030-copy.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Of course, for creators who might want to get a bit more serious about their creations, remixing and collaborating poses a question of ownership &#8212; if someone writes a beat and another user sings over it, who owns it? While you can&#8217;t monetize music on mayk.it, you have the right to export it and sell it elsewhere. Henriquez said that anyone involved in the creation of an audio clip or song on the app gets an equal cut, so the beat-maker would get 50% of any profit, and the singer would get 50%. Mayk.it doesn&#8217;t take a cut.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Right now, the mayk.it doesn&#8217;t have in-app purchases, but Henriquez said that down the road, it could be possible to profit from working with brands or establishing an in-app marketplace. For now, mayk.it is focused on using its seed funding to add new features, improve the product and build a tool that inspires creativity &#8212; Henriquez added that, as an LGBTQ+ founder, it&#8217;s important to him that users can find community on the app through its social features.</p>
<p class="p1">“When I worked at YouTube, you really needed to know Adobe Premiere and After Effects,” said Henriquez. “And what I learned since <span class="s1">Musical.ly</span> and TikTok is that you could be a video creator or an actor without having to go through all these things. I think Roblox is doing that now with games, and Canva is doing that with design tools.”</p>
<p>Mayk.it wants to be like a Roblox or Canva for music composition and sharing. You can&#8217;t currently create something on mayk.it that sounds like it came from an artist who&#8217;s mastered Ableton, but something from mayk.it could easily make the rounds on TikTok.</p>
<p>Though mayk.it is now in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mayk-it/id1527850965">App Store</a>, there&#8217;s a waitlist to gain access &#8212; but you can also test your skills with a &#8220;vibe check,&#8221; which invites you to make a song and see if existing users will right-swipe you in. Not to brag, but we passed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bringing order and understanding to unstructured information located across disparate silos has been one of more significant breakthroughs of the big data era, and today a European startup that has built a platform to help with this challenge specifically in the area of life sciences &#8212; and has, notably, been used by labs to sequence and so far identify two major Covid-19 variants &#8212; is announcing some funding to continue building out its tools to a wider set of use cases, and to expand into North America.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.seqera.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seqera Labs</a>, a Barcelona-based data orchestration and workflow platform tailored to help scientists and engineers order and gain insights from cloud-based genomic data troves, as well as to tackle other life science applications that involve harnessing complex data from multiple locations, has raised $5.5 million in seed funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.taliscapital.com/"><span class="s2">Talis Capital</span></a> and <a href="https://www.speedinvest.com/"><span class="s2">Speedinvest</span></a> co-led this round, with participation also from previous backer <a href="https://www.boxoneventures.com/"><span class="s2">BoxOne Ventures</span></a> and a grant from the <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/"><span class="s2">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,</span></a> Mark Zuckerberg and Dr. Priscilla Chan&#8217;s effort to back open source software projects for science applications.</p>
<p>Seqera &#8212; a portmanteau of &#8220;sequence&#8221; and &#8220;era&#8221;, the age of sequencing data, basically &#8212; had previously raised less than $1 million, and quietly, it is already generating revenues, with five of the world&#8217;s biggest pharmaceutical companies part of its customer base, alongside biotech and other life sciences customers.</p>
<p>Seqera was spun out of the Centre for Genomic Regulation, a biomedical research center based out of Barcelona, where it was built as the commercial application of <a href="https://www.nextflow.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nextflow</a>, open-source workflow and data orchestration software originally created by the founders of Seqera, Evan Floden and Paolo Di Tommaso, at the CGR.</p>
<p>Floden, Seqera&#8217;s CEO, told TechCrunch that he and Di Tommaso were motivated to create Seqera in 2018 after seeing Nextflow gain a lot of traction in the life science community, and subsequently getting a lot of repeat requests for further customization and features. Both Nextflow and Seqera have seen a lot of usage: the Nextflow runtime has been downloaded over 2 million times, the company said, while Seqera&#8217;s commercial cloud offering has now processed more than 5 billion tasks.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic is a classic example of the acute challenge that Seqera (and by association Nextflow) aims to address in the scientific community. With Covid-19 outbreaks happening globally, each time a test for Covid-19 is processed in a lab, live genetic samples of the virus get collected. Taken together, these millions of tests represent a goldmine of information about the coronavirus and how it is mutating, and when and where it is doing so. For a new virus about which so little is understood and that is still persisting, that&#8217;s invaluable data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So the problem is not if the data exists for better insights (it does); it is that it&#8217;s nearly impossible to use more legacy tools to view that data as a holistic body. It&#8217;s in too many places, and there is just too much of it, and it&#8217;s growing every day (and changing every day), which means that traditional approaches of porting data to a centralized location to run analytics on it just wouldn&#8217;t be efficient, and would cost a fortune to execute.</p>
<p>That is where Segera comes in. The company&#8217;s technology treats each source of data across different clouds as a salient pipeline which can be merged and analyzed as a single body, without that data ever leaving the boundaries of the infrastructure where it already exists. Customised to focus on genomic troves, scientists can then query that information for more insights. Seqera was central to the discovery of both the alpha and delta variants of the virus, and work is still ongoing as Covid-19 continues to hammer the globe.</p>
<p>Seqera is being used in other kinds of medical applications, such as in the realm of so-called &#8220;precision medicine.&#8221; This is emerging as a very big opportunity in complex fields like oncology: cancer mutates and behaves differently depending on many factors, including genetic differences of the patients themselves, which means that treatments are less effective if they are &#8220;one size fits all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Increasingly, we are seeing approaches that leverage machine learning and big data analytics to better understand individual cancers and how they develop for different populations, to subsequently create more personalized treatments, and Seqera comes into play as a way to sequence that kind of data.</p>
<p class="p2">This also highlights something else notable about the Seqera platform: it is used directly by the people who are analyzing the data &#8212; that is, the researchers and scientists themselves, without data specialists necessarily needing to get involved. This was a practical priority for the company, Floden told me, but nonetheless, it&#8217;s an interesting detail of how the platform is inadvertently part of that bigger trend of &#8220;no-code/low-code&#8221; software, designed to make highly technical processes usable by non-technical people.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s both the existing opportunity, and how Seqera might be applied in the future across other kinds of data that lives in the cloud, that makes it an interesting company, and it seems an interesting investment, too.</p>
<p class="p2"><b></b>&#8220;Advancements in machine learning, and the proliferation of volumes and types of data, are leading to increasingly more applications of computer science in life sciences and biology,&#8221; said Kirill Tasilov, principal at Talis Capital, in a statement. “While this is incredibly exciting from a humanity perspective, it’s also skyrocketing the cost of experiments to sometimes millions of dollars per project as they become computer-heavy and complex to run. Nextflow is already a ubiquitous solution in this space and Seqera is driving those capabilities at an enterprise level – and in doing so, is bringing the entire life sciences industry into the modern age. We’re thrilled to be a part of Seqera’s journey.”</p>
<p>“With the explosion of biological data from cheap, commercial DNA sequencing, there is a pressing need to analyse increasingly growing and complex quantities of data,&#8221; added Arnaud Bakker, principal at Speedinvest. &#8220;Seqera’s open and cloud-first framework provides an advanced tooling kit allowing organisations to scale complex deployments of data analysis and enable data-driven life sciences solutions.”</p>
<p class="p2">Although medicine and life sciences are perhaps Seqera&#8217;s most obvious and timely applications today, the framework originally designed for genetics and biology can be applied to are a number of other areas: AI training, image analysis and astronomy are three early use cases, Floden said. Astronomy is perhaps very apt, since it seems that the sky is the limit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think we are in the century of biology,&#8221; Floden said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the center of activity and it’s becoming data-centric, and we are here to build services around that.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/elvie/">Elvie</a>, the women&#8217;s health tech pioneer behind a connected breast pump and smart pelvic floor exerciser, has topped up a Series C which it announced earlier this summer (July) &#8212; adding a further £12.7m to bring the total raised to £70 million ($97m).</p>
<p>The 2013-founded, UK-based startup previously raised a $42M Series B<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/02/elvie-raises-42m-to-become-the-go-to-destination-for-womens-health/"> in 2019</a>, and a $6M Series A in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/elvie-pulls-in-6m-series-a-to-build-a-global-female-health-tech-brand/">2017</a> &#8212; when femtech startups were a lot rarer than they are now. Products designed for (and often by) women have gained a lot of momentum over this period as female-led startups have blazed a trail and shown there&#8217;s a sizeable market for femtech &#8212; leading <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/03/femtechs-billion-dollar-year/">investors to slow clock on to the opportunity too</a>.</p>
<p>Analysts now project the femtech industry will become a $50 billion market by 2025.</p>
<p>Elvie says the Series C extension includes funds sponsored by the co-founders of Blume Equity – a PE firm that focuses on the food and health sectors – plus further capital from existing investors IPGL, Hiro Capital and Westerly Winds.</p>
<p>In July, when it announced the earlier ($80M) tranche of the raise, Elvie said the Series C was led by BGF and BlackRock alongside existing investors including Octopus Ventures.</p>
<p>The Series C will be used to drive for more growth through geographical expansion (including entering new markets) and diversifying its product portfolio to target other &#8220;key stages&#8221; in women&#8217;s lives, it said.</p>
<p>That means it&#8217;ll be splashing out on R&amp;D to support product development &#8212; connected hardware that blends physical gadgetry with software still looks to be a strong focus &#8212; and also on strengthening its ops and infrastructure to prep for further scale.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Elvie sells four products at this stage: Its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/12/elvie-early-impressions/">connected kegel trainer</a>, and a wearable <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/14/kegel-trainer-startup-elvie-is-launching-a-smaller-smarter-breast-pump/">breast pump</a> (plus two <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/elvie-adds-a-non-electric-breast-pump-and-cups-to-its-growing-femtech-portfolio/">non-electric pumps</a>).</p>
<p>Where the company goes next in terms of product will be an interesting one to watch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Commenting in a statement, Tania Boler, CEO and founder, said: “Elvie is ready for the next phase of our growth. We have already revolutionized the categories we operate in, but we know that there is vast untapped potential to create better technology products and services for women in new areas.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">She added that Elvie&#8217;s goal is to create &#8220;the go-to destination for women’s health at all life stages&#8221; &#8212; selling &#8220;sophisticated, accurate and personalised solutions&#8221; to its target female consumer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Elvie doesn&#8217;t break out product sales but it told us its pump business has doubled in the US over the last 12 months &#8212; adding that they are the highest single breast pump SKU revenue driver on Amazon in the US.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company also touts &#8220;strong&#8221; growth for its European business &#8212; at 139% YoY. While, in the UK market, it says it&#8217;s seen a further +31% growth YoY over the last 12 months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hyundai Motor Group is backing hydrogen as a top energy solution for sustainability. With its new fuel cell system that it plans to launch in the next few years, the South Korean automaker said it will provide hydrogen fuel cell versions for all its commercial vehicles by 2028.</p>
<p>Hyundai announced its strategy for the future of hydrogen on Tuesday during a live stream of the automaker&#8217;s Hydrogen Wave conference. Saehoon Kim, executive vice president and head of the fuel cell center at Hyundai Motor Group, said Hyundai&#8217;s goal is to also achieve cost competitiveness comparable to that of EV batteries by 2030.</p>
<p>The company also shared details about its high-performance, rear-wheel drive hydrogen sports car, the Vision FK, with a 500kW fuel cell system that can push it from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour in under four seconds and has 600 kilometers (373 miles) of range. Hyundai did not share when the vehicle would go into production.</p>
<p>As most automakers begin to roll out electric vehicles for both passenger and commercial use, hydrogen is still a bit of a niche market, but one that is growing as Europe, China and the United States set ambitious emissions reductions goals. Toyota Motor Corp, BMW and Daimler have all begun embracing hydrogen fuel cell technology to varying degree, even as they continue to develop exclusively electric vehicles. For its part, Hyundai&#8217;s commitment to hydrogen doesn&#8217;t deter from its commitment to electric. With the climate situation as it is, we&#8217;re facing an all hands on deck situation. May the best fuel win.</p>
<p>At the event, Kim also announced Hyundai&#8217;s plans to launch two new hydrogen fuel cell powertrains in 2023, which the company hopes will help make hydrogen mainstream by 2040. The third generation of Hyundai&#8217;s hydrogen fuel stack will come in either 100 kW or 200kW outputs for either passenger cars or commercial vehicles, respectively.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Hyundai Motor Group, which includes Hyundai, Kia and Genesis, has one fuel cell bus on the market today, the Elec City Fuel Cell bus, with 115 buses live on the road in South Korea. The automaker also has one fuel cell truck, the Xcient Hyundai, on the market, 45 of which were launched in Switzerland last year.</span></p>
<p>Hyundai boasts a fuel-cell SUV, the NEXO, with plans to introduce the next model in 2023, alongside a hydrogen-powered multi-purpose vehicle model. The company announced at the IAA Mobility conference in Munich that it would also launch a large fuel cell-powered SUV after 2025, as well as four more commercial vehicles by the end of the decade. The company aims to provide fuel cell technology for different use cases, including emergency vehicles, ships, freights, trams, forklifts and other vehicles for industrial processes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Fuel cell is a proven technology that can deliver the benefits of hydrogen to people around the world in various fields,&#8221; said Kim. &#8220;Basically, a fuel cell is a power generator like an engine. It differs from a battery which stores electricity. A fuel cell system consists of a fuel cell stack that generates electricity, a hydrogen supply system, an air supply system and a thermal management system. It generates power by combining hydrogen and oxygen, similar to the engine of an internal combustion vehicle, but without the carbon emissions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kim went onto explain that fuel cell systems produce energy through chemical reactions and operate as long as hydrogen fuel is supplied, unlike a battery which just passively stores energy. He said Hyundai is working on building up the necessary ecosystem to create success in the hydrogen space, including production, storage, fuel cell technology and infrastructure. Much of the infrastructure would be solar and wind sources that would produce the renewable energy needed to create clean power to split water into oxygen and &#8216;green&#8217; hydrogen.</p>
<p>Alongside its own research and development, Hyundai Motor has also already invested in hydrogen startups like H2Pro and has announced plans to establish green hydrogen infrastructures in countries with supportive governments and abundant renewable energy resources.</p>
<p>Much of the movement in this space comes after the group announced its commitment to become carbon neutral by 2045 and to reduce its emissions by 75% below 2019 levels by 2040. By 2030, Hyundai expects 30% of all vehicle sales to be zero emission, with battery electric and fuel cell electric vehicles taking up 80% of total fleet sales by 2040.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Francophone Africa has its first unicorn, and if you&#8217;ve been following tech on the continent, you will be very unsurprised to hear that it&#8217;s coming from the world of fintech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.wave.com/en/">Wave</a>, a U.S. and Senegal-based mobile money provider, has raised $200 million in Series A round of funding. The investment is the largest-ever Series A round for the region, and it values Wave at $1.7 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four big-name backers jointly led the round &#8212; Sequoia Heritage, a private investment fund and a subsidiary of Sequoia; Founders Fund; payments giant Stripe; and Ribbit Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Others in the round include existing investors Partech Africa and Sam Altman, the former CEO of Y Combinator and current CEO of OpenAI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mobile money market in sub-Saharan Africa is growing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exponentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This past year, up to $500 billion has moved through the accounts of 300 million active mobile money users in the region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite being one of the largest alternative financial infrastructures known globally, this represents only a fraction of the overall market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The International Monetary Fund says that as of 2017, only 43% of adults in sub-Saharan Africa were &#8220;banked&#8221; by way of a traditional bank or mobile money account. When it comes to growing that proportion, however, m</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obile money &#8212; based on simpler technology and with an easier onboarding process &#8212; wins out, and it is set to capture more market share faster than traditional banking in the region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And this has investors, especially foreign ones, excited and looking to get on board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Neobanking, based on mobile technology too, falls somewhere in the middle of the two).</span></p>
<h2>From Sendwave to Wave</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re wondering why you haven&#8217;t heard of Wave, the reason might be because you don&#8217;t know it&#8217;s a spinoff from Africa-focused remittance provider Sendwave</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drew Durbin and Lincoln Quirk founded Sendwave in 2014 to offer little or no fee remittances from North America and Europe to select African and Asian countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The YC-backed company became a WorldRemit subsidiary last year when the global fintech paid up to $500 million in cash and stock for Sendwave.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2198507" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2198507" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2198507" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg?w=680" alt="Wave" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg 5479w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2198507" class="wp-caption-text">L-R: Drew Durbin and Lincoln Quirk</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But before that, the team </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stealthily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worked on a mobile money product described as having no account fees and &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">instantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available and accepted everywhere</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, the product was piloted as Wave in Senegal but it was still within the Sendwave ecosystem. When WorldRemit acquired Sendwave, Durbin and his team turned their focus to Wave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We saw an opportunity to make a bigger impact by trying to build a better, much more affordable mobile money service than the telcos are building throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa,&#8221; Durbin told TechCrunch in an interview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t see any companies besides the telcos trying to solve that problem.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Going up against incumbents</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telecom operators and banks have been the early entrants in the mobile money space, not least because they control much of the infrastructure in the process, from having mobile subscribers using handsets on their networks through to building the financial services to manage money and payments at the back end, and everything in between. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third-party providers, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mostly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fintechs, have tried to capture some market share from these incumbents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Wave, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, wants to disrupt it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Durbin tells TechCrunch that unlike M-Pesa, the mobile payment provider led by Safaricom, and other products of telecom operators like Orange and Tigo, Wave is building a mobile money service that is &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">radically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> affordable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dakar-based platform is akin to PayPal (with mobile money accounts, not bank accounts) and runs an agent network that uses their cash on hand to service Wave users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the company, users can make free deposits and withdrawals and charge a 1% fee whenever they send money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Durbin says this is 70% cheaper than telecom-led mobile money and whenever there is a transfer problem, refunds </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are made</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">instantly,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unlike with incumbents where users might need to wait for some days</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wave&#8217;s technology also differs from telecom-led mobile money. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas the incumbents mostly focus</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on USSD (although there are provisions to use applications), Wave is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">solely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> app-based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For users without a smartphone, Wave also provides a free QR-card to transact with an agent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By building its own infrastructure full-stack &#8212; agent network, agent and consumer applications, QR cards, business collections, and disbursements &#8212; Wave has been able to fuel its growth to several million monthly active users and billions of dollars in annual volume</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two-year-old startup claims to be the largest mobile money player in Senegal and that over half of the country&#8217;s adults are active users. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That pegs the number of users between 4 million and 5 million, and Wave wants to replicate this growth in Ivory Coast, the second market it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">officially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expanded to last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This sort of growth puts pressure on telecom operators. That has indeed been the case for the leading telecom operator in both regions, Orange. In </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">June, the telecom operator stopped users in Senegal from purchasing Orange airtime via Wave&#8217;s mobile application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per this <a href="https://www.theafricareport.com/97171/senegal-cote-divoire-wave-the-fintech-thats-shaking-up-the-mobile-money-industry/">report</a>, Wave argued that Orange was applying anti-competitive tactics by restricting it from selling </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or via an approved wholesaler</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Orange, on the other hand, said it had made proposals &#8220;in line with those offered to its other providers&#8221; and that Wave wanted special treatment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reach a fair decision, both parties are working with the regulatory body in charge, Regulatory Authority for Telecommunications and Posts (RATP)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And if the regulator isn&#8217;t capable of settling the issue, BCEAO, the regional bank of Francophone countries, is next in line to resolve the dispute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Wave&#8217;s CEO, the bank&#8217;s regulatory approach is one reason why Wave has been able to take on the telecom operators in the first place. But among all the West African countries where mobile money is prevalent, why start with Senegal, an emerging market?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Senegal is a big enough market that we would have to work </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hard to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">potentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> win the market. But also a small enough market that if we were doing well, we could win the market quicker than if we were in a giant country. And so that combination of those two things made it seem like a good place to start,&#8221; Durbin remarked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following this fundraise, Wave will deepen its presence in Senegal and Ivory Coast and grow its already 800-strong team across product, engineering, and business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Wave will expand into other markets it feels are regulatory-friendly like Uganda</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there&#8217;s a pretty broad array of countries that have strong central banks and clear regulations are open to new players, or even want new players to come in and try to compete with the telcos</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so we have a lot of licenses that are in progress, and we&#8217;ll </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">try to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">prioritize</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the countries where we&#8217;re able to get started sooner over the ones that it takes longer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>A unicorn after two rounds</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some <a href="https://www.theafricareport.com/97171/senegal-cote-divoire-wave-the-fintech-thats-shaking-up-the-mobile-money-industry/">reports</a> say Wave had raised $13.8 million prior to this, Durbin declined to comment on the figure when asked. However, he did mention</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Partech, the French outfit with an African fund, invested in a seed round alongside other investors like Founders Fund and Stripe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Sequoia, Ribbit, and Sam Altman, the same crop of investors also participated in this monster Series A round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a market that has typically lacked innovation, Partech general partner Tidjane Deme says the investment will help Wave improve its service</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since 2018, we&#8217;ve supported Wave because we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were convinced</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mobile money is still an unsolved problem in Africa,&#8221; he said in a statement. &#8220;Wave has great product design, stellar execution, and a strong financial trajectory. We are proud to see it become the first unicorn from Senegal.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, Sequoia Capital invested in Egyptian fintech Telda, its first big deal on the continent. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wave investment, meanwhile, is coming via subsidiary Sequoia Heritage and is the latter&#8217;s first investment in an Africa-focused startup. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a call with TechCrunch, Altman said that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wave ticked the boxes he considers before an investment &#8212; strong founders, an important problem in a large market, working product, and traction</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve known these founders for a long time, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they&#8217;re like off the charts good. I&#8217;ve been super impressed with their ability to figure out what users want and how to grow,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the company is solving the most important problem around money transfer in Africa and fixing the inefficient agent networks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The largest venture rounds for any venture in Africa remain OPay&#8217;s recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/african-fintech-opay-valued-at-2b-in-softbank-vision-fund-2-led-400m-funding/">$400 million fundraise</a> and Jumia&#8217;s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/03/rocket-internets-africa-internet-group-raises-326m-from-goldman-sachs-and-others/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">equivalent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2016</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Both were Series C rounds. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next biggest rounds include Interswitch&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/nigerias-interswitch-confirms-1b-valuation-after-visa-investment/">$200 million investment</a> from Visa and Flutterwave&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">$170 million Series C</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">these</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> companies attained unicorn status following their respective rounds. The same goes for Wave but more spectacularly, considering the company bagged it in a Series A round, it&#8217;s transcending the region and is one of the largest A-rounds globally this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wave joins OPay and Flutterwave as the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">newly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> minted unicorns in Africa this year &#8212; that is, startups valued above $1 billion &#8212; and the fourth African unicorn after Interswitch. Other billion-dollar companies include publicly traded Jumia and Egyptian fintech Fawry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding rounds in Africa keep getting bigger and the continent has reached an inflection point. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, some skeptics have questioned the valuations of previous unicorns; Wave wouldn&#8217;t be an exception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The argument would be around why Wave commands such a high valuation when for instance, two prominent telecom operators, Airtel and MTN, are looking to list their mobile money businesses between $2 to $6 billion despite being in the operations for several years across </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> African countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet like any investor optimistic about a portfolio company, Altman doesn&#8217;t believe Wave </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is overvalued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In fact, he thinks the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is undervalued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The opportunity in front of the company is massive. But plenty of times, I&#8217;ve gotten it wrong, so </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you never know. However, I have been fortunate to make </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a number of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> great investments and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wave has as good of a shot as you can ask for,&#8221; he said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Africa is going to be the fastest growing and most important market over the next coming decades for many companies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people are realizing how big the market opportunity is and how much value is going to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be created</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and we&#8217;ll see a lot more things like this happen.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">BP Ventures, the investing arm of oil and gas giant BP, has announced a €10 million (~$11.9 million) investment in Ryd, a German in-car digital payments provider. The fresh funds will help Ryd expand its service into international markets and build out its offering, according to a statement.</p>
<p>Ryd&#8217;s service allows users to lump together online payments for services like fuel purchases, EV charging and car washing via the startup&#8217;s app or integration with smart car systems. BP already offers digital payment options in the UK and the Netherlands through its BPme app. As part of its investment and partnership with Ryd, the legacy company hopes to expand its digital offerings as it learns from the startup&#8217;s secure and flexible digital payment options. Ryd will get the benefit of scaling its technology to BP customers across Europe.</p>
<p>“In-car digital payments are an integral part of the seamless and convenient experience that customers increasingly expect at our retail sites,&#8221; Alex Jensen, bp’s senior vice president mobility and convenience, Europe and Southern Africa, said in a statement. &#8220;Ryd’s technology can help deliver just that, and for an increasing range of services.&#8221;</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first bet BP is taking in the smart vehicle space, and it likely won&#8217;t be the last. In June,<a href="https://www.bp.com/en/global/bp-ventures/news/press-releases/bp-makes-seven-million-dollar-investment-in-electric-vehicle-charging-firm-iotecha.html"> the firm also invested $7 million in IoTecha</a>, a smart EV charging company that connects chargers with the electricity grid using IoT and automates charging payments. Strategic investments like these ultimately add to<a href="https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-strategy-update-2018-lamar-mckay-presentation.pdf"> BP Ventures&#8217;s ecosystem</a> which is designed to help BP reinvent itself as an integrated energy company, as well as help it reduce its carbon footprint.</p>
<p>Ryd is already accepted today at 3,000 partner service stations across seven countries, according to the company. It has 1.4 million direct customers, as well as access to up to 100 million additional customers through its partnerships with Mastercard and several car manufacturers. With the connected car data market expected to reach $19 billion globally by 2030, and the non-fuel retail sales market expected to reach <a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/ie/pdf/2020/06/fuel-forecourt-retail-market.pdf">$285 billion globally by the same year,</a> the startup is now homing in on its strategy to integrate its tech into more vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Ryd we want to enable hassle-free and secure interactions with cars,&#8221; said Oliver Goetz, founder and chairman of Ryd, in a statement. &#8220;BP is the final piece to our puzzle and completes our ecosystem with strong strategic partners in all of our business areas: finance, automotive and energy. BP expects tens of millions of car drivers to move to direct digital payment systems, which are both connected to car data and to payment systems at gas stations and beyond. This new payment form is much faster, easier and more comfortable. Ryd is on its way to lead this movement in Europe.”</p>
<p>Ryd expects to go live at the first BP filling stations in the fourth quarter of 2021, according to Ryd&#8217;s CEO Sandra Dax.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian crypto exchange CoinSwitch Kuber is in advanced stages of talks to raise a new financing round at up to $2 billion in valuation, several sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>If the talks materialize in a deal, CoinSwitch Kuber will become the second crypto startup in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market to attain the unicorn status.</p>
<p>The four-year-old startup, which counts Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, and Ribbit Capital among its existing investors, was valued at over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/tiger-global-backs-indian-crypto-startup-coinswitch-kuber-at-over-500m-valuation/">$500 million valuation in its Series B</a> financing round in April this year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear who is positioning to lead the round. The firm has engaged closely with Andreessen Horowitz and Coinbase in recent weeks, several people aware of those discussions told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>A deal may finalize within this month, sources said. The size of the deal, according to one source, is over $100 million. Usual caveats apply: terms of the proposed deal may change or the talks may not result in a deal.</p>
<p>The startup declined to comment. Coinbase and A16z, which has yet to back any Indian startup, did not respond to a request for comment Monday. Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital India did not respond to a request for comment last week.</p>
<p>The investment talks come at a time when CoinSwitch Kuber has almost doubled its userbase in recent months &#8212; even as local authorities push back against crypto assets. Its eponymous app had over 7 million monthly active users in India last month, up from about 4 million in April this year, according to mobile insight platform App Annie (data of which an industry exec shared with TechCrunch).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>B Capital backed CoinDCX, a rival of CoinSwitch Kuber that has amassed 3.5 million users, last month in a $90 million round that valued CoinDCX at about $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Policymakers in India have been debating on the status of digital currencies in the South Asian market for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/30/india-plans-to-introduce-law-to-ban-bitcoin-other-private-cryptocurrencies/">several years</a>. India&#8217;s central bank, Reserve Bank of India, has expressed concerns about private virtual currencies though it is planning to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/india-considering-phased-roll-out-of-central-bank-digital-currency/">run trial programs of its first digital currency</a> as soon as December.</p>
<p>More than two dozen Indian startups have become a unicorn this year, up from 11 last year, as several high-profile investors, including Tiger Global, SoftBank and Falcon Edge, have increased the pace of their investments in the South Asian market. TechCrunch reported last week that Tiger Global is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/tiger-global-in-talks-to-make-apna-indias-fastest-unicorn/">engaging with Apna</a> to fund a new round that values the 21-month-old Indian firm at over $1 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Financial services, especially those for people who don’t have access to traditional bank accounts or lines of credit, <a href="https://finovate.com/southeast-asias-fintech-boom-all-you-need-to-know/">are proliferating in Southeast Asia</a>. Jeff App wants to give consumers a “super app” where they can compare many financial products and apply for them using the startup’s proprietary data-scoring models. For service providers, Jeff serves as a distribution channel, helping them find and retain customers. The startup announced today it has raised a seed extension of $1.5 million, led by J12 Ventures. Other participants included iSeed Ventures and Toy Ventures, and returning investors EstBAN, Startup Wise Guys and other angels.</p>
<p>The funding brings Jeff’s total raised to about $2.5 million. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/jeff-raises-1m-to-build-alternative-credit-scoring-and-other-fintech-products-for-southeast-asia/">announced a $1 million seed round back in March</a>. Founder and chief executive officer Tom Niparts told TechCrunch that Jeff had a net profitable second quarter and wasn&#8217;t planning on raising again, but investors were interested because of its strong growth since the beginning of the year. The startup claims that since the end of January, its users have tripled to 700,000, who compared a total of four million products over the past six months.</p>

<p>Founded in 2019, the startup is operational in Vietnam and has applied for a license to launch in Indonesia. It also plans to enter the Philippines in the third quarter. Part of the funding will be used to increase Jeff’s team from about 15 people now to more than 40 employees for its offices in Latvia and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Before launching Jeff, Niparts was CEO of Spain for Digital Finance International, a fintech company that is part of the Finstar Financial Group. During that time, Niparts saw that in many Southeast Asian countries, people struggled to get loans not because of their credit history or income, but because they simply didn’t have enough personal financial data. Jeff was created to develop alternative data scoring models for financial services.</p>
<p>Niparts said Jeff’s goal is to become a main distribution channel for financial services in Southeast Asia and the top place for consumers to compare products and apply for them.</p>
<p>One of the reasons Jeff enjoyed strong growth during the first half of this year was by honing its user acquisition strategy in Vietnam. At first, it relied on global channels for user acquisition, like Google and Facebook ads, but now its top acquisition channel is through partnering with local affiliates, including bloggers and social media influencers who have grown considerable followings with educational content about finances.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“What we were surprised about is that in Europe, for instance, TikTok would never work for financial services, but in Vietnam we saw that it is a pretty amazing channel,” said Niparts.</p>
<p>While one of Jeff’s main features is loan comparison, the company has started expanding its offerings because most people only borrow money once in a while.</p>
<p>To create incentives to return to Jeff, instead of offloading the app once they secure a loan, Jeff is also offering coupons, like Shopee discounts and planning to launch telecom top-ups with cashback offers and a user referral functionality. It is also working on neobank and mobile wallet comparisons, payment functionalities, installment financing, services for micro-to small-sized merchants and a data science model to increase conversions for providers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every startup founder faces the same issue — how do you manage your cap table and equity plans in a transparent and lightweight manner? If you’re based in the U.S., chances are you’re using an equity management solution like <a href="https://carta.com">Carta</a>. But if you’re not based in the U.S., you don’t have a ton of options.</p>
<p><a href="https://ledgy.com">Ledgy</a> wants to become the ownership management tool for the rest of the world. Based in Switzerland, several well-known European startups are already using Ledgy, such as Wefox, Kry, Bitpanda, Gorillas and Trade Republic.</p>
<p>The company recently closed a $10 million Series A funding round led by Sequoia Capital. Other investors in the round include Xavier Niel, Harry Stebbings, Visionaries Club, UiPath&#39;s Daniel Dines and Front&#39;s Mathilde Collin. Some of Ledgy’s existing investors also invested once again, such as Myke Näf, Paul Sevinç, btov Partners, Creathor Ventures and VI Partners.</p>
<p>A few years ago, when Ledgy co-founder and CEO Yoko Spirig talked with an entrepreneur, the founder showed her how he managed ownership. He opened an Excel spreadsheet and scrolled, scrolled, scrolled… “Each line represented a share. You can imagine how error-prone it is,” she told me.</p>
<p>While the implementation was odd, most companies in Europe are still using Excel spreadsheets to manage ownership. And Ledgy wants to convince those companies that switching to a software solution that has been specifically designed to solve this issue could be beneficial.</p>
<p>“The key has really been to focus on the software infrastructure. What we do is that we have implemented automation workflows that are adaptable depending on countries,” Spirig said. “We’re not focusing on one regulation and we’re really offering the infrastructure layer,” she added.</p>
<p>That’s why Ledgy already supports 32 countries. It has tweaked its product even more specifically for Germany, Austria and Switzerland. There will be more country-specific releases in the near future for startups based in the U.K. and France. 1,500 companies are using Ledgy right now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When you switch to Ledgy, there are three main advantages. First, like other software-as-a-service products, Ledgy acts as a single source of truth for all stakeholders — the HR team, the finance team, investors, lawyers and employees.</p>
<p>The second selling point is that you can automate some of the most tedious tasks. For instance, Ledgy can automatically generate documents based on templates and different variables. Signed documents are stored on Ledgy. You can export data every quarter or every year for compliance reasons.</p>
<p>Third, it fosters transparency across the company. Employees can check the value of their options. They can see how much their options could be worth if the leadership team is in the process of raising a new round of funding.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, Ledgy plans to expand into new markets. The company also plans to roll out support for public companies so that some of its existing customers can go public and keep using Ledgy.</p>

<p>For many manufacturers and freight forwarders, managing logistics is still a very manual process: tracking shipments with a call or online lookup, and entering that data into an Excel spreadsheet. <a href="https://portcast.io/">Portcast</a>, which describes itself as a “next-generation logistics operating system,” makes the process more efficient by gathering data from myriad sources and not only track shipments in real-time, but also predicts what might affect its progress, like major weather events, the tide and pandemic-related issues.</p>
<p>The company announced today it has raised $3.2 million in pre-Series A funding, led by Newtown Partners, through the Imperial Venture Fund, with participation from Wavemaker Partners, TMV, Innoport and SGInnovate. Based in Singapore, Portcast serves clients in Asia and Europe, and will use part of its funding to expand into more markets.</p>
<p>Co-founders Nidhi Gupta and Dr. Lingxiao Xia met at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/entrepreneur-first-eyes-further-asia-growth/">Entrepreneur First in Singapore</a>. Before launching Portcast, Gupta, its chief executive officer, served in leadership roles across Asia at DHL. During that time, she realized the logistic sector’s “inefficiencies are actually an opportunity in this space to create something.” Dr. Xia, who holds a PhD in machine learning and has a background in product development and cloud computing, “was a great complementary fit” and is now Portcast’s chief technology officer.</p>
<p>Portcast says it tracks more than 90% of world trade volume that travels by ocean carriers, and 35% of air cargo, and can forecast demand for 30,000 trade routes. Sources include geospatial data, like satellite data about where ships are, what speed and direction they’re moving in, what ports they are headed for, wind speed and wave height. Portcast also looks at economic patterns (for example, Brexit’s impact on ports around the United Kingdom, and how vaccine rollouts around the world changes airline and ship capacity), weather events like typhoon and disruptions like the Suez Canal blockage.</p>

<p>Other data sources include proprietary transactional data from customers including large shipping companies and freight forwarders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The challenge for us is how do we let all of this data speak the same language,” Gupta told TechCrunch. “This data is coming in at different frequencies, different granularities, so how do you consolidate that and make sure the machine can start understanding it and interpreting it.”</p>
<p>Portcast’s two main solutions are currentlu Intelligent Container Visibility for real-time tracking of shipment containers, and Forecasting and Demand Management, which tracks booking patterns. Portcast doesn’t use IoT to track containers since it is cost-prohibitive to place a device in every one, but is working with IoT providers on hybrid solutions—for example, putting a tracking device in one container and then using that data to help manage the rest of the shipment.</p>
<p>The startup’s goal is to make predictions that help companies improve the efficiency of their operations, and reduce their reliance on manual processes. “There are logistics operators with hundreds of cargo coming in every single week, they’re going and checking this manually every day. That goes into an Excel sheet and that’s what the planning of downstream operations is based off of,” said Gupta.</p>
<p>But the COVID-19 pandemic created an “urgent need to digitize, and it’s transformed supply chains from being a cost function to the core of getting products on time, so we work with some of the largest manufacturers as well as freight forwarders,” she added. For example, a food and beverage company in Europe sent a shipment to Taipei, a trip that usually takes about 70 days. But it took more than three months to arrive. Portcast was able to track the shipment as it moved across different ports and ships, helping its customers understand what caused the delay.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">“Besides just predicting when there will be a likely disruption, we’re able to pinpoint and say there’s a delay of X days because there will likely be a typhoon or a transshipment, and that empowers them because they can tell their trucking and warehousing teams how many containers are going to come in,” said Gupta. “This reduces port fees, detention charges and the number of hours spent on manually checking different company’s websites and trying to figure out what happened to their supply chain.”</span></p>
<p>One of Portcast’s advantages over other logistics tech startups that want to fix supply chain visibility is that it launched out of the Asia-Pacific region, where ships usually go through multiple ports and have to work around frequent weather events like tropical storms and typhoons. The technology Portcast developed to create shorter voyages between Singapore and Malaysia (for example) is also applicable to intercontinental routes like Asia and Europe, or Asia and the United States.</p>
<p>“Our technology is global in scale and that allows us to compete against other players in this market,” said Gupta. “The other thing that differentiates us is that we work not just with manufacturers, but also with shipping companies, logistics companies and cargo airlines, and that allows us to create network effects. There is a really strong synergy between what’s happening in ocean freight and air freight, and that allows us to understand patterns in the industry and creates leverage for any other company that comes onto our platform.</p>
<p>Portcast’s future plans include moving from predictive AI to include prescriptive AI within the next two quarters. Right now, the platform can tell companies what is causing delays, but prescriptive AI will also enable it to make automated suggestions. For example, it can tell clients what ports are faster, other ships and modes of transport that can help them get around a disruption and how to optimize their capacity.</p>
<p>The company is also planning to launch Order Visiblity by the end of this year, a feature that will track containers filled with a specific item. Consumer prices for many different kinds of products are <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/consumer-prices-rising-cpi-heres-whats-increasing-the-most-and-why/">rising, due in part to overwhelmed supply chains</a>. By enabling companies to track specific SKUs in real-time, Portcast can not only help items arrive more quickly, but also show how much CO2 emissions each shipment creates.</p>
<p>“Carbon offsetting or carbon trading can only happen once you have visibility into how much you are actually spending, and that’s the piece we can get involved in,” said Gupta. “By allowing predictions like, for example, if you will arrive early, that’s an opportunity for a shipping company to slow down and save fuel like bunker fuel, which not only brings an immense amount of savings, but also reduces CO2 emissions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the latest quasi-throwback toward &#8216;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">do not track</a>&#8216;, the UK&#8217;s data protection chief has come out in favor of a browser- and/or device-level setting to allow Internet users to set &#8220;lasting&#8221; cookie preferences &#8212; suggesting this as a fix for the barrage of consent pop-ups that continues to infest websites in the region.</p>
<p>European web users digesting this development in an otherwise monotonously unchanging regulatory saga, should be forgiven &#8212; not only for any sense of déjà vu they may experience &#8212; but also for wondering if they haven&#8217;t been mocked/gaslit quite enough already where cookie consent is concerned.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Last month, UK digital minister Oliver Dowden took aim at what he dubbed an &#8220;</span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/08/25/oliver-dowden-creating-data-laws-one-biggest-prizes-brexit/">endless</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8221; parade of cookie pop-ups &#8212; suggesting the government is eyeing watering down consent requirements around web tracking as ministers consider how to diverge from European Union data protection standards, post-Brexit. (He&#8217;</span>s slated to present the full sweep of the government&#8217;s data &#8216;reform&#8217; plans later this month so watch this space.)</p>
<p>Today the UK&#8217;s outgoing information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, stepped into the fray to urge her counterparts in G7 countries to knock heads together and coalesce around the idea of letting web users express generic privacy preferences at the browser/app/device level, rather than having to do it through pop-ups every time they visit a website.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2021/09/ico-to-call-on-g7-countries-to-tackle-cookie-pop-ups-challenge/">statement</a> announcing &#8220;an idea&#8221; she will present this week during a virtual meeting of fellow G7 data protection and privacy authorities &#8212; less pithily described in the press release as being &#8220;on how to improve the current cookie consent mechanism, making web browsing smoother and more business friendly while better protecting personal data&#8221; &#8212; Denham said: “I often hear people say they are tired of having to engage with so many cookie pop-ups. That fatigue is leading to people giving more personal data than they would like.</p>
<p>“The cookie mechanism is also far from ideal for businesses and other organisations running websites, as it is costly and it can lead to poor user experience. While I expect businesses to comply with current laws, my office is encouraging international collaboration to bring practical solutions in this area.&#8221;</p>
<p>“There are nearly two billion websites out there taking account of the world’s privacy preferences. No single country can tackle this issue alone. That is why I am calling on my G7 colleagues to use our convening power. Together we can engage with technology firms and standards organisations to develop a coordinated approach to this challenge,” she added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Contacted for more on this &#8220;idea&#8221;, an ICO spokeswoman reshuffled the words thusly: &#8220;Instead of trying to effect change through nearly 2 billion websites, the idea is that legislators and regulators could shift their attention to the browsers, applications and devices through which users access the web.</p>
<p>&#8220;In place of click-through consent at a website level, users could express lasting, generic privacy preferences through browsers, software applications and device settings – enabling them to set and update preferences at a frequency of their choosing rather than on each website they visit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course a browser-baked &#8216;Do not track&#8217; (DNT) signal is not a new idea. It&#8217;s around a decade old at this point. Indeed, it could be called the idea that can&#8217;t die because it&#8217;s never truly lived &#8212; as earlier attempts at embedding user privacy preferences into browser settings were scuppered by lack of industry support.</p>
<p>However the approach Denham is advocating, vis-a-vis &#8220;lasting&#8221; preferences, may in fact be rather different to DNT &#8212; given her call for fellow regulators to engage with the tech industry, and its &#8220;standards organizations&#8221;, and come up with &#8220;practical&#8221; and &#8220;business friendly&#8221; solutions to the regional Internet&#8217;s cookie pop-up problem.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear what consensus &#8212; practical or, er, simply pro-industry &#8212; might result from this call. If anything.</p>
<p>Indeed, today&#8217;s press release may be nothing more than Denham trying to raise her own profile since she&#8217;s on the cusp of stepping out of the information commissioner&#8217;s chair. (Never waste a good international networking opportunity and all that &#8212; her counterparts in the US, Canada, Japan, France, Germany and Italy are scheduled for a virtual natter today and tomorrow where she implies she&#8217;ll try to engage them with her big idea).</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/uk-names-john-edwards-as-its-choice-for-next-data-protection-chief-as-govt-eyes-watering-down-privacy-standards/">Her UK replacement, meanwhile, is already lined up</a>. So anything Denham personally champions right now, at the end of her ICO chapter, may have a very brief shelf life &#8212; unless she&#8217;s set to parachute into a comparable role at another G7 caliber data protection authority.</p>

<p>Nor is Denham the first person to make a revived pitch for a rethink on cookie consent mechanisms &#8212; even in recent years.</p>
<p>Last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/tech-publisher-coalition-backs-new-push-for-browser-level-privacy-controls/">October</a>, for example, a US-centric tech-publisher coalition came out with what they called a <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/press-release/20201007.html">Global Privacy Standard</a> (GPC) &#8212; aiming to build momentum for a browser-level pro-privacy signal to stop the sale of personal data, geared toward California&#8217;s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), though pitched as something that could have wider utility for Internet users.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">By January this year they </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/press-release/20210128">announced</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> 40M+ users were making use of a browser or extension that supports GPC &#8212; along with a clutch of big name publishers signed up to honor it. But it&#8217;s fair to say its global impact so far remains limited. </span></p>
<p>More recently, European privacy group <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/europe-needs-to-back-browser-level-controls-to-fix-cookie-consent-nightmares-says-privacy-group/">noyb</a> published a technical proposal for a European-centric automated browser-level signal that would let regional users configure advanced consent choices &#8212; enabling the more granular controls it said would be needed to fully mesh with the EU’s more comprehensive (vs CCPA) legal framework around data protection.</p>
<p>The proposal, for which noyb worked with the Sustainable Computing Lab at the Vienna University of Economics and Business, is called Advanced Data Protection Control (ADPC). And noyb has called on the EU to legislate for such a mechanism &#8212; suggesting there&#8217;s a window of opportunity as lawmakers there are also keen to find ways to reduce cookie fatigue (a stated aim for the still-in-train reform of the ePrivacy rules, for example).</p>
<p>So there are some concrete examples of what practical, less fatiguing yet still pro-privacy consent mechanisms might look like to lend a little more color to Denham&#8217;s &#8216;idea&#8217; &#8212; although her remarks today don&#8217;t reference any such existing mechanisms or proposals.</p>
<p>(When we asked the ICO for more details on what she&#8217;s advocating for, its spokeswoman didn&#8217;t cite any specific technical proposals or implementations, historical or contemporary, either, saying only: &#8220;By working together, the G7 data protection authorities could have an outsized impact in stimulating the development of technological solutions to the cookie consent problem.&#8221;)</p>
<p>So Denham&#8217;s call to the G7 does seem rather low on substance vs profile-raising noise.</p>
<p>In any case, the really big elephant in the room here is the lack of enforcement around cookie consent breaches &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/privacy-experts-slam-uks-disastrous-failure-to-tackle-unlawful-adtech/">including by the ICO</a>.</p>

<p>Add to that, there&#8217;s the now very pressing question of how exactly the UK will &#8216;reform&#8217; domestic law in this area (post-Brexit) &#8212; which makes the timing of Denham&#8217;s call look, well, interestingly opportune. (And difficult to interpret as anything other than opportunistically opaque at this point.)</p>
<p>The adtech industry will of course be watching developments in the UK with interest &#8212; and would surely be cheering from the rooftops if domestic data protection &#8216;reform&#8217; results in amendments to UK rules that allow the vast majority of websites to avoid having to ask Brits for permission to process their personal data, say by opting them into tracking by default (under the guise of &#8216;fixing&#8217; cookie friction and cookie fatigue for them).</p>
<p>That would certainly be mission accomplished after all these years of cookie-fatigue-generating-cookie-consent-non-compliance by surveillance capitalism&#8217;s industrial data complex.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear which way the UK government will jump &#8212; but eyebrows should raise to read the ICO writing today that it expects compliance with (current) UK law when it has so roundly failed to tackle the adtech industry&#8217;s role in cynically sicking up said cookie fatigue by failing to take any action against such systemic breaches.</p>
<p>The bald fact is that the ICO has &#8212; for years &#8212; avoided tackling adtech abuse of data protection, despite acknowledging publicly that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/">the sector is wildly out of control</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, it has opted for a cringing &#8216;process of engagement&#8217; (read: appeasement) that has condemned UK Internet users to cookie pop-up hell.</p>
<p>This is why the regulator is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/uks-ico-faces-legal-action-after-closing-adtech-complaint-with-nothing-to-show-for-it/">being sued for inaction</a> &#8212; after it closed a long-standing complaint against the security abuse of people&#8217;s data in real-time bidding ad auctions with nothing to show for it&#8230; So, yes, you can be forgiven for feeling gaslit by Denham&#8217;s call for action on cookie fatigue following the ICO&#8217;s repeat inaction on the causes of cookie fatigue&#8230;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Behavioural advertising is out of control, warns UK watchdog&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/embed/#?secret=IJl9akLlEz" data-secret="IJl9akLlEz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Not that the ICO is alone on that front, however.</p>
<p>There has been a fairly widespread failure by EU regulators to tackle systematic abuse of the bloc&#8217;s data protection rules by the adtech sector &#8212; with a number of complaints (such as this one <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/iab-europes-ad-tracking-consent-framework-found-to-fail-gdpr-standard/">against the IAB Europe&#8217;s self-styled &#8216;transparency and consent framework&#8217;</a>) still working, painstakingly, through the various labyrinthine regulatory processes.</p>
<p>France&#8217;s CNIL has probably been the most active in this area &#8212; last year slapping <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/">Amazon and Google with fines of $42M and $120M </a>for dropping tracking cookies without consent, for example. (And before you accuse CNIL of being &#8216;anti-American&#8217;, it has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/20/how-a-small-french-privacy-ruling-could-remake-adtech-for-good/">gone after domestic adtech</a>.)</p>
<p>But elsewhere &#8212; notably Ireland, where many adtech giants are regionally headquartered &#8212; the lack of enforcement against the sector has allowed for cynical, manipulative and/or meaningless consent pop-ups to proliferate as the dysfunctional &#8216;norm&#8217;, while investigations have failed to progress and EU citizens have been forced to become accustomed, not to regulatory closure (or indeed rapture), but to an existentially endless consent experience that&#8217;s now being (re)branded as &#8216;cookie fatigue&#8217;.</p>
<p>Yes, even with <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) coming into application in 2018 and beefing up (in theory) consent standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This is why the privacy campaign group noyb is now lodging <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/europes-cookie-consent-reckoning-is-coming/">scores of complaints against cookie consent breaches</a> &#8212; to try to force EU regulators to actually enforce the law in this area, even as it also finds time to put up a practical technical proposal that could help shrink cookie fatigue without undermining data protection standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It&#8217;s a shining example of action that has yet to inspire the lion&#8217;s share of the EU&#8217;s actual regulators to act on cookies. The tl;dr is that EU citizens are still waiting for the cookie consent reckoning &#8212; even if there is now a bit of high level talk about the need for &#8216;something to be done&#8217; about all these tedious pop-ups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The problem is that while GDPR certainly cranked up the legal risk on paper, without proper enforcement it&#8217;s just a paper tiger. And the pushing around of lots of paper is very tedious, clearly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">M</span>ost cookie pop-ups you&#8217;ll see in the EU are thus essentially privacy theatre; at the very least they&#8217;re unnecessarily irritating because they create ongoing friction for web users who must constantly respond to nags for their data (typically to repeatedly try to deny access if they can actually find a &#8216;reject all&#8217; setting).</p>
<p>But &#8212; even worse &#8212; many of these pervasive pop-ups are actively undermining the law (as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/10/cookie-consent-tools-are-being-used-to-undermine-eu-privacy-rules-study-suggests/">a number of studies</a> have<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/10/most-eu-cookie-consent-notices-are-meaningless-or-manipulative-study-finds/"> shown</a>) because the vast majority do not meet the legal standard for consent.</p>
<p>So the cookie consent/fatigue narrative is actually a story of faux compliance <em>enabled</em> by an enforcement vacuum that&#8217;s now also encouraging the watering down of privacy standards as a result of such much unpunished flouting of the law.</p>
<p>There is a lesson here, surely.</p>
<p>&#8216;Faux consent&#8217; pop-ups that you can easily stumble across when surfing the &#8216;ad-supported&#8217; Internet in Europe include those failing to provide users with clear information about how their data will be used; or not offering people a free choice to reject tracking without being penalized (such as with no/limited access to the content they&#8217;re trying to access), or at least giving the impression that accepting is a requirement to access said content (dark pattern!); and/or otherwise manipulating a person&#8217;s choice by making it super simple to accept tracking and far, far, <em>far</em> more tedious to deny.</p>
<p>You can also still sometimes find cookie notices that don&#8217;t offer users any choice at all &#8212; and just pop up to inform that &#8216;by continuing to browse you consent to your data being processed&#8217; &#8212; which, unless the cookies in question are literally essential for provision of the webpage, is basically illegal. (Europe&#8217;s top court made it abundantly clear in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/europes-top-court-says-active-consent-is-needed-for-tracking-cookies/">2019</a> that active consent is a requirement for non-essential cookies.)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe&#8217;s top court says active consent is needed for tracking cookies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/europes-top-court-says-active-consent-is-needed-for-tracking-cookies/embed/#?secret=t3gYFHUags" data-secret="t3gYFHUags" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Nonetheless, to the untrained eye &#8212; and sadly there are a lot of them where cookie consent notices are concerned &#8212; it can look like it&#8217;s Europe&#8217;s data protection law that&#8217;s the ass because it seemingly demands all these meaningless &#8216;consent&#8217; pop-ups, which just gloss over an ongoing background data grab anyway.</p>
<p>The truth is regulators should have slapped down these manipulative dark patterns years ago.</p>
<p>The problem now is that regulatory failure is encouraging political posturing &#8212; and, in a twisting double-back throw by the ICO! &#8212; regulatory thrusting around the idea that some newfangled mechanism is what&#8217;s really needed to remove all this universally inconvenient &#8216;friction&#8217;.</p>
<p>An idea like noyb&#8217;s ADPC does indeed look very useful in ironing out the widespread operational wrinkles wrapping the EU&#8217;s cookie consent rules. But when it&#8217;s the ICO suggesting a quick fix after the regulatory authority has failed so spectacularly over the long duration of complaints around this issue you&#8217;ll have to forgive us for being sceptical.</p>
<p>In such a context the notion of &#8216;cookie fatigue&#8217; looks like it&#8217;s being suspiciously trumped up; fixed on as a convenient scapegoat to rechannel consumer frustration with hated online tracking toward high privacy standards &#8212; and away from the commercial data-pipes that demand all these intrusive, tedious cookie pop-ups in the first place &#8212; whilst neatly aligning with the UK government&#8217;s post-Brexit political priorities on &#8216;data&#8217;.</p>
<p>Worse still: The whole farcical consent pantomime &#8212; which the adtech industry has aggressively engaged in to try to sustain a privacy-hostile business model in spite of beefed up European privacy laws &#8212; could be set to end in genuine tragedy for user rights if standards end up being slashed to appease the law mockers.</p>
<p>The target of regulatory ire and political anger should really be the systematic law-breaking that&#8217;s held back privacy-respecting innovation and non-tracking business models &#8212; by making it harder for businesses that don&#8217;t abuse people&#8217;s data to compete.</p>
<p>Governments and regulators should not be trying to dismantle the principle of consent itself. Yet &#8212; at least in the UK &#8212; that does now look horribly possible.</p>
<p>Laws like GDPR set high standards for consent which &#8212; if they were but robustly enforced &#8212; could lead to reform of highly problematic practices like behavorial advertising combined with the out-of-control scale of programmatic advertising.</p>
<p>Indeed, we should already be seeing privacy-respecting forms of advertising being the norm, not the alternative &#8212; free to scale.</p>
<p>Instead, thanks to widespread inaction against systematic adtech breaches, there has been little incentive for publishers to reform bad practices and end the irritating &#8216;consent charade&#8217; &#8212; which keeps cookie pop-ups mushrooming forth, oftentimes with ridiculously lengthy lists of data-sharing &#8216;partners&#8217; (i.e. if you do actually click through the dark patterns to try to understand what is this claimed &#8216;choice&#8217; you&#8217;re being offered).</p>
<p>As well as being a criminal waste of web users&#8217; time, we now have the prospect of attention-seeking, politically charged regulators deciding that all this &#8216;friction&#8217; justifies giving data-mining giants carte blanche to torch user rights &#8212; if the intention is to fire up the G7 to send a collect invite to the tech industry to come up with &#8220;practical&#8221; alternatives to asking people for their consent to track them &#8212; and all because authorities like the ICO have been too risk averse to actually defend users&#8217; rights in the first place.</p>
<p>Dowden&#8217;s remarks last month suggest the UK government may be preparing to use cookie consent fatigue as convenient cover for watering down domestic data protection standards &#8212; at least if it can get away with the switcheroo.</p>
<p>Nothing in the ICO&#8217;s statement today suggests it would stand in the way of such a move.</p>
<p>Now that the UK is outside the EU, the UK government has said it believes it has an opportunity to deregulate domestic data protection &#8212; although it may find there are legal consequences for domestic businesses if it diverges too far from EU standards.</p>
<p>Denham&#8217;s call to the G7 naturally includes a few EU countries (the biggest economies in the bloc) but by targeting this group she&#8217;s also seeking to engage regulators further afield &#8212; in jurisdictions that currently lack a comprehensive data protection framework. So if the UK moves, cloaked in rhetoric of &#8216;Global Britain&#8217;, to water down its (EU-based) high domestic data protection standards it will be placing downward pressure on international aspirations in this area &#8212; as a counterweight to the EU&#8217;s geopolitical ambitions to drive global standards up to its level.</p>
<p>The risk, then, is a race to the bottom on privacy standards among Western democracies &#8212; at a time when awareness about the importance of online privacy, data protection and information security has actually never been higher.</p>
<p>Furthermore, any UK move to weaken data protection also risks putting pressure on the EU&#8217;s own high standards in this area &#8212; as the regional trajectory would be down not up. And that could, ultimately, give succour to forces inside the EU that lobby against its commitment to a charter of fundamental rights &#8212; by arguing such standards undermine the global competitiveness of European businesses.</p>
<p>So while cookies themselves &#8212; or indeed &#8216;cookie fatigue&#8217; &#8212; may seem an irritatingly small concern, the stakes attached to this tug of war around people&#8217;s rights over what can happen to their personal data are very high indeed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ShopUp, a startup that is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/shopup-raises-22-5-million-to-digitize-millions-of-mom-and-pop-shops-in-bangladesh/">digitizing neighborhood stores in Bangladesh</a>, has raised $75 million in a new financing round that is also the largest in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures led <a href="https://shopup.com.bd/">ShopUp</a>’s $75 million Series B round. Prosus Ventures as well as existing investors Flourish Ventures, Sequoia Capital India, and VEON Ventures also invested in the round. The new investment, which brings the startup’s all-time raise to over $100 million, is also Valar&#8217;s and Prosus’ first deals in Bangladesh, home to over 100 million internet users.</p>
<p>Like its neighboring nation, India, more than 95% of all retail in Bangladesh goes through neighborhood stores. There are about 4.5 million such mom-and-pop stores in the country and the vast majority of them have no digital presence.</p>
<p>As is the case in India, Pakistan and several other Asian countries, these small shops face a number of challenges in Bangladesh. They don&#8217;t have access to a large catalog for inventory selection and they can&#8217;t negotiate good pricing and faster delivery. And for these small retailers, more than two-thirds of all their sales are still processed on credit instead of cash or digital payments, creating a massive liquidity crunch.</p>
<p>ShopUp is attempting to address these challenges. It has built what it calls a full-stack business-to-business commerce platform. The startup provides a number of core services to these stores including a wholesale marketplace to secure inventory, logistics (including last-mile delivery to customers) and working capital. (Like many startups in India, ShopUp has banking and other partners to provide working capital.)</p>
<p>In the past year, the startup has expanded its offerings and deepened its footprints within Bangladesh, said Afeef Zaman, co-founder and chief executive of ShopUp​, in an interview with TechCrunch. For instance, it has partnered with country&#8217;s largest manufacturers, producers and distributors to secure and supply inventories to small shops, he said. And its logistics offerings is already the largest in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The startup, like several others, was hit by the pandemic, but as the country begins to open up, ShopUp is beginning to see recovery, he said. Overall, business has grown over 13 times in the last one year, he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The leadership team at ShopUp has shown strong execution capabilities over the last twelve months. They became clear market leaders with double digit growth across three products built for the underserved small businesses in Bangladesh. In fast-growing frontier economies like Bangladesh, small businesses are the primary driver of the economy. We are excited to partner with Afeef’s vision of building a connected ecosystem of products to fast-track their transition to the online economy,&#8221; said James Fitzgerald, founding partner of Valar Ventures, in a statement.</p>
<p>Zaman said the past one year has accelerated the adoption of technology among these small shops in Bangladesh. &#8220;They are using several internet-based services now. Not just ShopUp, but also messaging, and virtual payments,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We expect this to continue going forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Dhaka-headquartered startup, which has an office in Bangalore, where the large portion of its tech and engineering talent is based, plans to deploy the fresh funds in part to expand its team. As part of the new round, Zaman said the startup has expanded its employee stock option pool by three times.</p>
<p>“This investment marks our entry into Bangladesh – among the fastest-growing economies in the past decade. ShopUp has demonstrated strong execution focus in solving for a cross-section of needs for small businesses in a fragmented market. We are thrilled to support their efforts to empower millions of retailers and enable them to participate in the country’s economic growth,&#8221; said Ashutosh Sharma, Head of Investments for India at Prosus Ventures, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic has triggered more demand for contactless and staff-less operations in the hospitality sector, and now <a href="https://www.h2ohospitality.io/">H2O Hospitality</a>, the unmanned hotel management company, has closed a $30 million round on the back of that boost. The South Korea and Japan-based startup automates front and backend processes including accommodation reservation, room management and front desk duties, and it will be using the funds to continue expanding its business.</p>
<p>The Series C round (equivalent to about 34 billion won) is being led by <a href="https://www.kakaoinvestment.com/eng/">Kakao Investment</a> and Korea Development Bank (KDB), Gorilla Private Equity, Intervest and NICE Investment also participated. With Southeast Asia’s joint fund, Kejora-Intervest Growth Fund also joined in the round, it is a sign that H2O Hospitality will be focusing specifically on the Southeast Asian Market. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/03/japanese-vacation-rental-management-startup-h2o-raises-7-million-series-b-from-investors-including-samsung-ventures/">H2O Hospitality has raised $7 million Series B round from Samsung Ventures, Stonebridge Ventures, IMM Investment and Shinhan Capital in February 2020.</a></p>
<p>H2O Hospitality will expand its business further by adding various types of accommodations in South Korea and Japan in 2021 and 2022 and plans to enter Singapore and Indonesia in 4Q in 2022 in line with its Southeast Asia penetration strategy, according to H2O Hospitality co-founder and CEO John Lee.</p>
<p>“H2O Hospitality is currently speaking with several global hotel chain companies to partner with their digital transformation and operation outside of Korea and Japan,” Lee told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>H2O will invest in R&amp;D to advance its customer channel solutions and contactless check-in systems depending on customer needs of each country in Asia, Lee continued.</p>
<p>“We need optimal system development and customization for each accommodation and situation to lead successful hotel digital transformation even after COVID-19,” Lee said in an email interview.</p>
<p>H2O Hospitality was founded in South Korea 2015 by CEO John Lee, and it has been on something of an acquisition-expansion spree. It entered Japan in 2017, for example, by acquiring several Japanese hospitality management companies. In 2021, H2O acquired two South Korean companies such as the contactless hotel solution company, ImGATE, and a local creator startup, Replace, in order to enhance its technology and ESG competence.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These days, the company operates approximately 7,500 accommodations including hotels, ryokans and guest houses, in Tokyo, Osaka, Seoul, Busan, and Bangkok.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>H2O Hospitality’s Information and Communications Technology (ICT)-based hotel management system, which enables hotel management to automate and digitize, includes the Channel Management System (CMS), Property Management System (PMS), Room Management System (RMS), and Facility Management System (FMS).</p>
<p>Its integrated hotel management system can reduce hotel management’s fixed operating costs by 50%, while increasing revenue by as much as 20%, according to its statement.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 hit the hospitality industry the most and most of the hotels wanted to decrease their fixed cost level, but it was impossible with their current operational flow,” Lee continued, “They had to go through digital transformation”.</p>
<p>When asked how the pandemic affected H2O as COVID-19 still freezes most of the tourism industry, Lee said H2O’s revenue has been increased by as much as 30% before the pandemic, but that percentage has been dropped to 5-15% post COVID-19. Revenue drivers these days are based around tools it&#8217;s built to improve the efficiency of its customers. They include its automated dynamic pricing (ADR) tool and diverse sales channels like online and offline travel agencies in domestic and overseas, he said.</p>
<p>Lee also pointed out that H2O has been onboarding a lot of properties and that has also contributed to H2O&#8217;s revenue growth in the last 18 months. H2O was the only company in Asia, he claims, and many property owners have started to get onboard since August 2020, he explained.</p>
<p>“Every single hotel that we onboarded during the pandemic turned around their profits &amp; losses statements and started to recover their financial loss,&#8221; Lee said.</p>
<p>There are currently about 16.4 million hotel rooms in the world that generate $570 billion a year, according to Lee. H2O believes that it can digitize all the lodging accommodations in the world as the company’s main goal is not building a hotel brand but allowing hotel owners to operate their properties with better operation, he said.</p>
<p>Lee explained that the current hotel operation process looks a lot like that of “2G phones”, that was at a stage before turning to smartphones, and H2O is turning the overall hotel operation into a “smartphone”.</p>
<p>“This is a very natural transition for the (hospitality) industry as it was also natural for the cellphone users to transit from 2G phone to smartphone,” Lee said.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the cross-border inbound tourism market has still been stopped for both Korea and Japan even though each domestic market is still pumping demand for the market, Lee mentioned.</p>
<p>“We believe the inbound tourism market will recover within a year as the vaccinations grow for both countries (Korea and Japan),” Lee said.</p>
<p>Managing Director at Kejora-Intervest Growth Fund Jun-seok Kang told TechCrunch: “We knew this new wave for hotel digital transformation trend was coming even before the pandemic; however, COVID-19 definitely expedited the transition period, and we believe H2O will thrive in the transforming hotel market.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://a-id.co">A.ID</a>, an identity and compliance platform with a focus on high-risk clients, has closed a pre-seed investment round of $500,000 from angel investors including former employees of RobinHood, Square and Snap.</p>
<p>The startup says it is addressing a market that traditional Fintech companies and banking instutions can’t seem to deal with: namely the rise of apparently ‘risky’ customers who are simply dealing in products deemed problematic. A case in point is that the legal cannabis industry grows by 67% every year, and crypto by over 46%. Meanwhile, the unbanked and underbanked population grows every day, but existing financial institutions seem unable to cater to these exploding markets.</p>
<p>Founded by Ekaterina Romanovskaya, a third-time entrepreneur with experience in both finance and consumer tech, and Justinas Kaminskas, who has launched compliance products in Europe, A.ID is a B2B2C platform.</p>
<p>Romanovskaya said: “Our end-game is to build trust: end-users trust companies with their sensitive data, while companies trust users not to engage in unlawful activity. We strongly believe that this kind of trust is essential, and we see it being eagerly anticipated everywhere.”</p>
<p>A.ID says its solution allows clients to verify their customers’ identities and onboard them, perform standard and enhanced due diligence, screen individuals and businesses against watchlists, monitor their payments, create and solve compliance cases, and report suspicious activities to regulators. The client can integrate it via API (application programming interface) or use it as a web application, or SDK.</p>
<p>So far it counts Arival, a digital bank for emerging industries, and Clos, a social network for creators for user verification.</p>
<p>“I permanently moved to the US in 2017. But I struggled to get the proper attention from VCs: I fell into several categories that were unpopular with venture investors at the same time, such as being a female founder, an immigrant founder, and a founder without technical expertise. The company that I bootstrapped grew organically until the COVID-19 pandemic killed it. I used the 2020 lockdown to study data science and learn to code, and became a data engineer. In September 2020 I founded A.ID,” Romanovskaya told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Romanovskaya became a Twitter celebrity Russia when she co-founded a satirical political account criticizing the Kremlin which had 2M followers at its peak. In 2016 she co-founded Nimb, a fashionable smart ring with an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/13/the-nimb-aims-to-be-a-smart-personal-security-platform-not-just-a-cool-ring/">in-built panic button</a> aimed at women.</p>
<p>A.ID is headquartered in Los Angeles, California, the US. The European branch operates in EU with an office in Lithuania.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Financial automation platform, <a href="https://aurelia.ltd/">Aurelia</a> has raised $3 million in seed funding, led by Blossom Capital.</p>
<p>Billing itself as a sort of “IFTTT for finance” aimed at small businesses that want to integrate their bank accounts with financial tools, Aurelia says this then gives them greater control over cash flow, taxes etc to automate normally manual tasks, with no knowledge of code needed.</p>
<p>Angel investors include Guillaume Pousaz (Founder &amp; CEO at Checkout.com) through his Zinal Growth investment vehicle and Erez Mathan (ex-COO and CRO at GoCardless).</p>
<p>Aurelia was founded by Sebastian Trif, one of the first engineers at Transferwise and Jasper August Toes.</p>
<p>Trif said: “We see lots of fintech apps and banks that try to capture everything a business has but many small businesses aren’t keen on moving their company’s financial life into a new product.”</p>
<p>Ophelia Brown, founder of Blossom Capital, said: “As a small business owner ourselves, we know first-hand how painful and broken it is for SMEs to manage their finances and accounts. After searching for years for the right solution, we committed to Aurelia on the spot.”</p>
<p>Trif added: “On a feature-by-feature basis, we’re competing with established packs of plugins you must have on top of your accounting software like Xero and Quickbooks. We’re also competing with smart SME banking solutions, such as Tide, Revolut for Business and Wise for Business, which have more limited features.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Aurelia’s beta platform is now going live in Estonia, Romania, Germany and the UK.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The manufacturing industry took a <a href="https://www.makeuk.org/-/media/files/coronavirus/make-uk-manufacturing-monitor-080221.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hard hit from the Covid-19 pandemic</a>, but there are <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Impact_of_Covid-19_crisis_on_industrial_production#Comparison_with_2008" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signs</a> of how it is slowly starting to come back into shape &#8212; helped in part by new efforts to make factories more responsive to the fluctuations in demand that come with the ups and downs of grappling with the shifting economy, virus outbreaks and more. Today, a businesses that is positioning itself as part of that new guard of flexible custom manufacturing &#8212; a startup called <a href="https://fractory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fractory</a> &#8212; is announcing a Series A of $9 million (€7.7 million) that underscores the trend.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by <a href="https://www.otb.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">OTB Ventures</span></a>, a leading European investor focussed on early growth, post-product, high-tech start-ups, with existing investors <a href="https://trind.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Trind Ventures</span></a><span class="s3">, <a href="https://superherocapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Superhero Capital</span></a>, <a href="https://unitedangels.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">United Angels VC</span></a>, <a href="https://startupwiseguys.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Startup Wise Guys</span></a> and <a href="https://www.verve.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Verve Ventures</span></a> also participating</span>.</p>
<p>Founded in Estonia but now based in Manchester, England &#8212; historically a strong hub for manufacturing in the country, and close to Fractory&#8217;s customers &#8212; Fractory has built a platform to make it easier for those that need to get custom metalwork to upload and order it, and for factories to pick up new customers and jobs based on those requests.</p>
<p>Fractory&#8217;s Series A will be used to continue expanding its technology, and to bring more partners into its ecosystem.</p>
<p>To date, the company has worked with more than 24,000 customers and hundreds of manufacturers and metal companies, and altogether it has helped crank out more than 2.5 million metal parts.</p>
<p>To be clear, Fractory isn&#8217;t a manufacturer itself, nor does it have no plans to get involved in that part of the process. Rather, it is in the business of enterprise software, with a marketplace for those who are able to carry out manufacturing jobs &#8212; currently in the area of metalwork &#8212; to engage with companies that need metal parts made for them, using intelligent tools to identify what needs to be made and connecting that potential job to the specialist manufacturers that can make it.</p>
<p>The challenge that Fractory is solving is not unlike that faced in a lot of industries that have variable supply and demand, a lot of fragmentation, and generally an inefficient way of sourcing work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As Martin Vares, Fractory&#8217;s founder and MD, described it to me, companies who need metal parts made might have one factory they regularly work with. But if there are any circumstances that might mean that this factory cannot carry out a job, then the customer needs to shop around and find others to do it instead. This can be a time-consuming, and costly process.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very fragmented market and there are so many ways to manufacture products, and the connection between those two is complicated,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In the past, if you wanted to outsource something, it would mean multiple emails to multiple places. But you can&#8217;t go to 30 different suppliers like that individually. We make it into a one-stop shop.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other side, factories are always looking for better ways to fill out their roster of work so there is little downtime &#8212; factories want to avoid having people paid to work with no work coming in, or machinery that is not being used.</p>
<p>&#8220;The average uptime capacity is 50%,&#8221; Vares said of the metalwork plants on Fractory&#8217;s platform (and in the industry in general). &#8220;We have a lot more machines out there than are being used. We really want to solve the issue of leftover capacity and make the market function better and reduce waste. We want to make their factories more efficient and thus sustainable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Fractory approach involves customers &#8212; today those customers are typically in construction, or other heavy machinery industries like ship building, aerospace and automotive &#8212; uploading CAD files specifying what they need made. These then get sent out to a network of manufacturers to bid for and take on as jobs &#8212; a little like a freelance marketplace, but for manufacturing jobs. About 30% of those jobs are then fully automated, while the other 70% might include some involvement from Fractory to help advise customers on their approach, including in the quoting of the work, manufacturing, delivery and more. The plan is to build in more technology to improve the proportion that can be automated, Vares said. That would include further investment in RPA, but also computer vision to better understand what a customer is looking to do, and how best to execute it.</p>
<p>Currently Fractory&#8217;s platform can help fill orders for laser cutting and metal folding services, including work like CNC machining, and it&#8217;s next looking at industrial additive 3D printing. It will also be looking at other materials like stonework and chip making.</p>
<p>Manufacturing is one of those industries that has in some ways been very slow to modernize, which in a way is not a huge surprise: equipment is heavy and expensive, and generally the maxim of &#8220;if it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it&#8221; applies in this world. That&#8217;s why companies that are building more intelligent software to at least run that legacy equipment more efficiently are finding some footing. <a href="https://www.xometry.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xometry</a>, a bigger company out of the U.S. that also has built a bridge between manufacturers and companies that need things custom made, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/xometry-is-taking-its-excess-manufacturing-capacity-business-public/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went public earlier this year</a> and now has a market cap of over $3 billion. Others in the same space include <a href="https://www.hubs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubs</a> (which is now part of Protolabs) and <a href="https://www.qimtek.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qimtek</a>, among others.</p>
<p class="p1">One selling point that Fractory has been pushing is that it generally aims to keep manufacturing local to the customer to reduce the logistics component of the work to reduce carbon emissions, although as the company grows it will be interesting to see how and if it adheres to that commitment.</p>
<p>In the meantime, investors believe that Fractory&#8217;s approach and fast growth are strong signs that it&#8217;s here to stay and make an impact in the industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fractory has created an enterprise software platform like no other in the manufacturing setting. Its rapid customer adoption is clear demonstrable feedback of the value that Fractory brings to manufacturing supply chains with technology to automate and digitise an ecosystem poised for innovation,&#8221; said Marcin Hejka in a statement. &#8220;We have invested in a great product and a talented group of software engineers, committed to developing a product and continuing with their formidable track record of rapid international growth</p>

<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Before you jump into the transportation news of the week, a bit of TechCrunch company news!</p>
<p>Private equity firm <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong> completed its acquisition of Yahoo (formerly known as Verizon Media Group, itself formerly known as Oath) from Verizon. The deal is worth $5 billion, with $4.25 billion in cash, plus preferred interests of $750 million. Verizon will be retaining 10% of the newly rebranded company. The group, aside from Yahoo properties like Mail, Sports and Finance, includes <strong>TechCrunch</strong>, AOL, Engadget and interactive media brand, RYOT. All told, the umbrella brand encompasses around 900 million monthly active users globally and is currently the third-largest internet property, per Apollo&#8217;s figures.</p>
<p><strong>Looking ahead</strong>: be on the lookout for automotive and tech news coming out of IAA Mobility in Munich this week. A bit of news that broke Sunday included <strong>Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles</strong> and autonomous vehicle technology company <strong>Argo AI</strong> unveiling the first version of the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/05/volkswagen-and-argo-ai-reveal-first-id-buzz-test-vehicle-for-autonomous-driving/"> ID Buzz AD</a>. <strong>Mercedes</strong> also had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/05/mercedes-benz-throws-down-the-ev-gauntlet-at-iaa-mobility/">busy day in the world of EVs</a>.</p>

<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1999054 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You might have noticed that the micromobbin&#8217; section wasn&#8217;t featured in last week&#8217;s newsletter. Well, Rebecca Bellan is making up for that with an extra long write up this week. <em>Take it away Rebecca.</em></p>
<p>Since Auckland, New Zealand is back in a massive lockdown, the highlight of my week has been getting to write about and, and thus relive, my <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/ubco-2x2-adventure-bike-review-utility-that-shreds/">test of the electric utility bike</a> built by Kiwi company <strong>Ubco</strong>. If any other electric micro-vehicle companies want to send me a tester and brighten my day, I&#8217;m always open.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: the Ubco bike looks like a dirt bike and rides like a moped and absolutely shreds. Pros: Smooth ride, good battery life and can carry a lot of weight and accessories. Cons: A bit on the pricey side, regenerative brakes think they know what&#8217;s best for me when I&#8217;m speeding downhill and a touchy keyfob.</p>
<h3>Last-mile deliveries</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re one of those smart lazy people who orders meal kits through the likes of HelloFresh or Blue Apron, you&#8217;ve probably interacted with <strong>AxleHire</strong> without knowing it. That&#8217;s about to change.</p>
<p>The last-mile logistics provider announced this week that it would be expanding two pilot programs to bring cool tech to the delivery scene. Over the past year or so, the company&#8217;s been partnering with URB-E and using its network of collapsible containers strapped onto e-bikes to make deliveries in NYC, as well as Tortoise&#8217;s remotely controlled adorable delivery bots in LA. Now, those programs, which helped AxleHire reduce emissions and beat traffic,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/axlehire-to-scale-tortoise-and-urb-e-zero-emissions-delivery-solutions-nationally/"> are going national</a>.</p>
<h3>An Indian empire arises</h3>
<p><strong>Ola Electric</strong>, the electric scooter manufacturing arm of ride-hailing giant Ola, is in talks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/ola-electric-in-talks-to-raise-at-over-2-5-billion-valuation/">raise between $250 million to $500 million</a> in new financing as it looks to scale its business in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>Falcon Edge Capital, which is potentially leading the round, values the company between $2.75 billion and $3.5 billion, which is up $1 billion from its previous 2019 raise. Side note: Ola, the initial parent firm of Ola Electric, is currently looking to file for an initial public offering.</p>
<h3>Big box bike sales</h3>
<p><strong>Best Buy</strong> has a <a href="https://corporate.bestbuy.com/best-buy-rides-into-electric-transportation-with-e-bikes-scooters-mopeds-and-more/">fresh lineup of electric vehicles</a> that are available online now and coming to select stores in October, including many we&#8217;ve written about here, like the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/unagi-scooter/"><strong>Unagi</strong> scooter</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/shared-micromobility-company-bird-launches-a-consumer-electric-bike-for-2299/">new <strong>Bird </strong>bike</a>. Other top names include <strong>Segway-Ninebot</strong>, <strong>SUPER73</strong> and <strong>SWFT</strong>.</p>
<p>Speaking of new swag, <strong>VAAST Bikes</strong> has just revealed the E/1, the latest in the company&#8217;s sustainable bike range. The urban e-bike boasts a top notch suspension system that separates pedaling from suspension movement for a more comfortable ride, no matter how much cargo you&#8217;re packing. A step-through frame provides a low center of gravity, making it an easy enough bike to mount for riders of all ages and shapes and sizes. The E/1 will be available to purchase in the U.S., U.K. and European markets starting October, and it costs anywhere from $7,499 to $9,999.</p>
<p>Foldable e-bike maker <strong>Fiido</strong> has raised over $1 million on Indiegogo to fund the production and delivery of its new Fiido X. It&#8217;s got a sweet-looking minimalist design with a light and sturdy body, as well as improved pedal-assist and cycling control. Fiido says this bike is the world&#8217;s first folding e-bike with a built-in seat pole that transmits battery power. It&#8217;s got a 417.6Wh ternary lithium battery, which means when it&#8217;s in &#8220;moped mode&#8221; the range is over 130 kilometers, or around 81 miles. Not bad at all. Price is anywhere from $1,098 to $1,601 at the moment.</p>
<p>Swedish electric motorbike manufacturer <strong>Cake</strong> also recently released a new super lightweight e-moped that&#8217;s built for city utility riding, but can probably handle some off-road fun. The Makka weighs about 132 pounds and comes in two forms: The Makka Range, at $3,500, which is available only in Europe, has a lower maximum speed of 15 miles per hour and a range of up to 35 miles. The Makka Flex, which is available in Europe and the U.S., costs $3,800 and can hit top speeds of 28 miles per hour. The range of this vehicle is slightly less, at 30 miles.</p>
<h3>National Drive Electric Week (sans cars)</h3>
<p>This is the first National Drive Electric Week that has nothing to do with cars! Fabulous. At this free, two-part expert webinar, a range of experts will talk about how to get moving on two e-wheels and discuss whether or not cars are overrated (they are). Find out how policymakers and advocates are thinking about how we can get electric micromobility and public transit to dominate the roads, rather than cars, even electric ones. The event takes place Saturday, September 25 from 11am to 1pm PST on Zoom. You can register here.</p>
<h3>Van Moof&#8217;s big raise</h3>
<p><strong>VanMoof</strong>, the Amsterdam-based startup, raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/vanmoof-raises-128-million-to-become-the-worlds-leading-e-bike-brand/">$128 million Series C funding round</a>, fund it plans to use in its bid to become the world&#8217;s leading e-bike brand. It&#8217;s tactic, scale faster than the rest.</p>
<p>Asia-based private equity firm Hillhouse Investment led the round, with Gillian Tans, the former CEO of Booking.com, also participating. Some existing investors also put some more money on the table, such as Norwest Venture Partners, Felix Capital, Balderton Capital and TriplePoint Capital.</p>
<p>The Series C represents a big jump compared to the company&#8217;s Series B. Last year, VanMoof raised a $40 million Series B. The startup has raised $182 million in total.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>This week, I want to focus on one deal that appears to be at risk.</p>
<p>Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., an influential shareholder adviser, issued a report this week recommending that investors in Ken Moelis&#8217;s Atlas Crest Investment Corp. should vote against a merger with Archer Aviation. The adviser said it would be better for investors if they redeemed their holdings in the blank-check company for cash.</p>
<p>If investors take that advice, it could derail the proposed merger between Atlas Crest and Archer, a startup that is developing vertical take-off and landing electric aircraft. ISS argues that Archer&#8217;s legal battle with Wisk Aero puts the company at risk. The firm also points to the falling valuation of the combined company.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-01/moelis-spac-shareholders-advised-by-iss-to-vote-down-archer-deal?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg noted this week</a>, ISS has targeted other SPAC deals involving eVTOL companies. ISS opposed the merger between Reinvent Technology Partners and Joby Aviation. Shareholders ignored ISS and vote to approve the merger. ISS also advised against investing in Qell Acquisition Corp.&#8217;s merger with Lililum GmbH. That deal is still pending.</p>
<p>While ISS seems to have a general distaste for eVTOL SPACs, the Archer deal is particularly sticky due to its current legal wrangling with Wisk Aero. For those who haven&#8217;t been following: Wisk Aero, the air mobility company born out of a joint venture between Kitty Hawk and Boeing, filed a lawsuit in April against Archer Aviation alleging patent infringement and trade secret misappropriation.</p>
<p>Archer didn&#8217;t scuttle into a corner. The company countersued in a lawsuit seeking $1 billion in damages from Wisk Aero.</p>
<p>Investors won&#8217;t be able to take the wait-and-see approach. The vote to approve the SPAC merger will be held long before this legal fight is resolved.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Carsome Group</strong>, the Malaysian-based online marketplace for buying and selling used cars, raised $170 million from investors, including from semiconductor maker MediaTek, investment company Catcha Group and Malaysian government fund Penjana Kapital, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zinnialee/2021/09/01/malaysias-carsome-reaches-13-billion-valuation-in-funding-round-from-mediatek-and-others/?sh=1b0f23677a3c">Forbes reported</a>. The company&#8217;s post-funding valuation is $1.3 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Cox Automotive</strong> acquired Oklahoma City-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/cox-automotive-acquires-battery-health-company-spiers-as-evs-take-center-stage/">Spiers New Technologies</a> (SNT), a business that provides repair, remanufacturing, refurbishing and repurposing services for EV battery packs. The two companies did not disclose the terms of the deal.</p>
<p><strong>Foretellix</strong>, a company that has developed a platform to verify and validate automated driving systems, raised $32 million in a Series B funding round led by MoreTech Ventures, with participation from several strategic investors, including Volvo Group, Nationwide, NI and Japan-Israel Ventures. Previous investors 83North Ventures, Jump Capital, OurCrowd and NextGear also participated. The company, founded in 2018, has raised more than $50 million to date.</p>
<p><strong>Gatik AI</strong>, an autonomous vehicle startup focused on middle-mile logistics, announced it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/gatik-expands-autonomous-box-truck-operations-to-texas-with-85-million-in-new-funds/">expanding into Texas</a> &#8212; its fourth market &#8212; with a fresh bundle of capital. Gatik said it has raised $85 million in a Series B round led by new investor Koch Disruptive Technologies, the venture arm of Koch Industries. Existing investors Innovation Endeavours, Wittington Ventures, FM Capital, Dynamo Ventures, Trucks VC, Intact Ventures and others also participated. Gatik has raised $114.5 million to date.</p>
<p><strong>HAAS Alert</strong>, a SaaS company that provides real-time automotive collision prevention for public safety and roadway fleets, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/haas-alert-raises-5m-seed-round-to-scale-its-automotive-collision-prevention-system/">raised $5 million</a> in a seed funding round led by R^2 and Blu Ventures and joined by TechNexus, Stacked Capital, Urban Us, Techstars, Ride Ventures and Gramercy Fund. The company says it will use the funds to scale sales and outreach efforts and prioritize R&amp;D with vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2X) technology partnerships.</p>
<p><strong>Ideanomics</strong>, a fintech and electric mobility firm based in New York, acquired commercial electric vehicle manufacturer Via Motors in an all-stock deal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/ideanomics-to-buy-ev-fleet-maker-via-motors-in-450m-all-stock-deal/">valued at $450 million</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Iconiq Motors</strong>, a Chinese electric vehicle firm, is considering going public in the U.S. through a merger with a blank-check company, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-03/chinese-ev-startup-iconiq-said-to-mull-4-billion-u-s-spac-deal?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a>. The startup is working with an adviser on a potential deal that could value the combined company at about $4 billion, according to one source cited by the media outlet.</p>
<p><strong>Kevala</strong>, the startup that collects and analyzes energy grid infrastructure data for utility companies, renewable energy providers, EV charging companies, regulators and other energy industry stakeholders, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/kevala-raises-21m-to-improve-tools-for-managing-energy-grid-infrastructure/">raised $21 million in a Series A round</a>. The company says it will use the funds to grow its team from 60 employees to around 100 by the end of 2021 and increase the deployment of its grid analytics tools.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong>, an insurtech startup based in Bangkok, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/bangkok-based-insurtech-sunday-banks-45m-series-b-from-investors-like-tencent/">raised a $45 million</a> in a Series B round that included investment from Tencent, SCB 10X, Vertex Growth, Vertex Ventures Southeast Asia &amp; India, Quona Capital, Aflac Ventures and Z Venture Capital. The company says the round was oversubscribed, and that it doubled its revenue growth in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Yandex</strong>, the Russian internet giant that also operates a ride-haling company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/yandex-buys-out-ubers-stake-in-yandex-self-driving-group-eats-lavka-and-delivery-for-1b/">acquired Uber&#8217;s stake</a> in its Self-Driving Group (SDG), as well as Uber&#8217;s indirect interest in Yandex.Eats, Yandex.Lavka and Yandex.Delivery. The total cost of the deal came to $1 billion, giving the Russian company 100% ownership over all four businesses.</p>
<p><strong>Zeekr</strong>, the electric vehicle brand by Geely, raised $500 million in its first external funding from a list of investors, including Intel Capital, battery maker CATL and online entertainment firm Bilibili. The round puts Zeekr&#8217;s valuation at aboout $9 billion, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/geelys-ev-brand-zeekr-raises-500-mln-first-external-funding-2021-08-27/">Reuters reported</a>.</p>

<p>Welcome back to policy corner! Let&#8217;s talk safety. ​​Traffic deaths spiked in the<a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2021-09/Early-Estimate-Motor-Vehicle-Traffic-Fatalities-Q1-2021.pdf"> first quarter of this year</a>, according to preliminary data from the <strong>National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration</strong>. The agency estimated that there was a 10 percent increase in fatalities from previous projections, finding that 8,730 people died in motor traffic accidents, up from the 7,900 projected. Oddly, deaths spiked even though there was an overall decrease in the number of people on the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must address the tragic loss of life we saw on the roads in 2020 by taking a transformational and collaborative approach to safety,&#8221; NHTSA&#8217;s acting administrator, Steven Cliff, said in a statement. &#8220;Everyone &#8212; including those who design, operate, build and use the road system &#8212; shares responsibility for road safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>NHTSA is arguably starting to come up against some of the greatest challenges in the agency&#8217;s history, as technological development has brought about a greater degree of driving autonomy and driver assistance systems.</p>
<p>The forthcoming investigation into Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot could be a watershed moment for ADAS safety standards. If you aren&#8217;t caught up: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/">NHTSA opened an investigation</a> into 11 instances of a Tesla crashing into a parked emergency vehicle, and just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/tesla-ordered-to-share-autopilot-data-with-the-us-traffic-safety-agency/">added another crash to its investigation</a> earlier this week. In an <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2021/INIM-PE21020-84913P.pdf">11-page letter</a> to the electric vehicle maker, NHTSA gave the company until October 22 to provide extensive data on any hardware and software related to Tesla&#8217;s Level 2 capabilities (including Autopilot).</p>
<p>The probe comes as more and more groups &#8212; including the Insurance <strong>Institute for Highway Safety</strong> and <strong>Advocates for Highway &amp; Auto Safety</strong>, as well as the <strong>National Traffic Safety Board</strong> &#8212; call on NHTSA to exercise greater authority over regulating ADAS systems. We&#8217;ll certainly be keeping an eye on this investigation as it unfolds in the coming months.</p>

<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Motional</strong> revealed the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/motional-reveals-its-hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-robotaxi/">first images of its planned robotaxi</a>, a Hyundai all-electric Ioniq 5 SUV that will be the centerpiece of a driverless ride-hailing service the company wants customers to be able to access starting in 2023 through the Lyft app.</p>
<p>The purpose-built vehicle, which will be assembled by Hyundai, is integrated with Motional&#8217;s autonomous vehicle technology, including a suite of more than 30 sensors including lidar, radar and cameras that can be seen throughout the interior and exterior. That sensing system provides 360 degrees of vision, and the ability to see up to 300 meters away, according to Motional.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>ElectraMeccanica Vehicles Corp</strong>. unveiled a &#8220;cargo&#8221; version of its flagship three-wheeled, single-occupant, all-electric SOLO at the Advanced Clean Transportation Expo in California.</p>
<p><strong>Power Global</strong>, a two-year-old startup, wants to disrupt the auto rickshaw market by offering a retrofit kit for diesel-powered vehicles and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/power-global-wants-to-disrupt-indias-auto-rickshaw-industry-with-a-swappable-battery-and-retrofit-kit/">swappable battery pack</a> to transition the more common lead-acid batteries to lithium-ion.</p>
<p><strong>Rivian</strong> announced that the first edition version of its all-electric R1T pickup truck has an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/rivians-electric-r1t-pickup-truck-r1s-suv-get-their-official-epa-ranges/">official EPA range of 314 miles</a>, while its R1T SUV comes in a skosh higher at 316 miles.</p>
<p><strong>Siemens</strong> said it will expand its U.S. manufacturing operations to support electric vehicle infrastructure. Specifically, the company plans to open a third facility to its VersiCharge Level 2 AC series product line of commercial and residential EV chargers. The additional facility, which is expected to come online in early 2022, will allow Siemens to manufacture more than 1 million electric vehicle chargers for the United States over the next four years.</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch editor Mike Butcher</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/acquired-by-mercedes-benz-yasas-revolutionary-electric-motor-is-set-for-big-things/">digs into YASA</a>, the British electric motor startup that Mercedes-Benz acquired back in July The company, founded in 2009 after spinning out of Oxford University, developed an &#8216;axial-flux&#8217; motor. YASA will now develop ultra-high-performance electric motors for Mercedes-Benz&#8217;s AMG.EA electric-only platform.</p>
<p><strong>Wallbox</strong>, an electric vehicle charging company, has selected Arlington, Texas as the location of its first U.S. manufacturing facility. Production at the 130,000-square-foot plant is expected to start as early as June 2022. Production lines for its AC chargers lines, DC bidirectional charger, and DC fast charger for public use, are anticipated to follow in the first half of 2023. Wallbox said it expects to manufacture a total of 290,000 units annually in this facility by 2027 and reach its full capacity of 500,000 units by 2030.</p>
<h3>Gig economy</h3>
<p><strong>DoorDash</strong> workers in California <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/doordash-workers-protest-outside-ceo-tony-xus-home-demanding-better-pay-tip-transparency-and-ppe/">protested outside of the home</a> of DoorDash CEO Tony Xu in response to a recent California superior court judge ruling calling 2020&#8217;s Proposition 22 unconstitutional. Prop 22, which was passed last November in California, would allow app-based companies like DoorDash, Uber and Lyft to continue classifying workers as independent contractors rather than employees.</p>
<p>The group of about 50 DoorDash workers who are affiliated with advocacy groups We Drive Progress and Gig Workers Rising  demanded that DoorDash provide transparency for tips and 120% of minimum wage or around $17 per hour, stop unfair deactivations and provide free personal protective equipment, as well as adequate pay for car and equipment sanitizing.</p>
<p><strong>Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey</strong> gave a coalition of app-based service providers that includes Uber and Lyft the go-ahead to start collecting signatures needed to put a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/massachussetts-ag-greenlights-uber-lyft-backed-gig-worker-ballot-initiative/">proposed ballot measure</a> before voters that would define drivers as independent contractors rather than employees. Backers of the initiative, which is essentially a MA version of Proposition 22, would need to gather tens of thousands of signatures for the measure to make it to the November 2022 ballot.</p>
<p><strong>Uber</strong> and <strong>Lyft</strong> separately announced plans to cover the legal fees of drivers using their ride-hailing apps who are sued under Texas&#8217;s new abortion law.</p>
<p>The new law bans abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which is typically around six weeks, and gives any individual the right to sue anyone who aids or abets an abortion. That means ride-hailing app drivers, who might transport a woman to a clinic, can be sued.</p>
<p>Uber CEO <strong>Dara Khoswarshari</strong> and Lyft CEO <strong>Logan Green</strong> both took to Twitter express their opposition to the new law and announce their support to drivers.</p>
<p>&#8220;TX SB8 threatens to punish drivers for getting people where they need to go&#8211; especially women exercising their right to choose,&#8221; Green wrote on Twitter. &#8220;@Lyft has created a Driver Legal Defense Fund to cover 100% of legal fees for drivers sued under SB8 while driving on our platform.</p>
<p>Khosrowshahi retweeted Green&#8217;s tweet and made the same commitment. &#8220;Right on @logangreen &#8211; drivers shouldn&#8217;t be put at risk for getting people where they want to go. Team @Uber is in too and will cover legal fees in the same way. Thanks for the push.&#8221;</p>
<p>Green and Khosrowshahi are among the few CEOs (a list that includes Austin-based Bumble and Dallas-based Match Group) with operations in Texas that have come out in strong opposition to law.</p>
<h3>In-car tech</h3>
<p><strong>GM</strong> announced it will idle nearly all its assembly plants in North America due to the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage. The automaker is making a few strategic exceptions. Production of its profitable full-size SUVs will continue this week at its Arlington Assembly plant in Texas. The <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/company_info/facilities/assembly/flint.html">Flint Assembly facility</a>, where it makes heavy-duty GMC and Chevy pickup trucks and <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/company_info/facilities/assembly/bowlinggreen.html">Bowling Green Assembly</a> in Kentucky, where it makes the Corvette, will also continue.</p>
<h3>Misc. stuff</h3>
<p><strong>BMW Group</strong> has committed to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/bmw-groups-neue-klasse-lineup-to-focus-on-circular-economy-to-achieve-reduction-in-co2-emissions/">50% reduction</a> from 2019 levels in global carbon dioxide emissions during the use-phase of its vehicles by 2030, as well as a 40% reduction in emissions during the life cycle of the vehicle. These goals, including a plan to focus on the principles of a circular economy to achieve a more sustainable vehicle life cycle, will manifest in the company&#8217;s Neue Klasse platform, which should be available by 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg</strong> and husband, Chasten, announced they are parents to twins.</p>
<p>Buttigieg tweeted: &#8220;Chasten and I are beyond thankful for all the kind wishes since first sharing the news that we’re becoming parents. We are delighted to welcome Penelope Rose and Joseph August Buttigieg to our family.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Nikola Corp.</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/nikola-and-bosch-ink-deal-for-hydrogen-fuel-cell-modules/">reached a new agreement</a> with Bosch for its hydrogen fuel cell modules. The modules will be used to power two of Nikola&#8217;s hydrogen-fueled semi-trucks, the short-haul Nikola Tre and Nikola Two sleeper. Bosch invested at least $100 million in the hydrogen truck startup in 2019 but reduced its shares in the company the following year. Bosch also said last year it would supply fuel cells for Nikola&#8217;s European operations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based <a href="https://www.mobiuslabs.com">Mobius Labs</a> has closed a €5.2 million (~$6.1M) funding round off the back of increased demand for its computer vision training platform. The Series A investment is led by Ventech VC, along with Atlantic Labs, APEX Ventures, Space Capital, Lunar Ventures plus some additional angel investors.</p>
<p>The startup offers an SDK that lets the user create custom computer vision models fed with a little of their own training data &#8212; as an alternative to off-the-shelf tools which may not have the required specificity for a particular use-case.</p>
<p>It also flags a &#8216;no code&#8217; focus, saying its tech has been designed with a non-technical user in mind.</p>
<p>As it&#8217;s an SDK, Mobius Labs&#8217; platform can also be deployed on premise and/or on device &#8212; rather than the customer needing to connect to a cloud service to tap into the AI tool&#8217;s utility.</p>
<p><span class="s2">&#8220;Our custom training user interface is very simple to work with, and requires no prior technical knowledge on any level,&#8221; claims </span>Appu Shaji, CEO and chief scientist.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="s2">&#8220;Over the years, a trend we have observed is that often the people who get the maximum value from AI are non technical personas like a content manager in a press and creative agency, or an application manager in the space sector. Our no-code AI allows anyone to build their own applications, thus enabling these users to get close to their vision without having to wait for AI experts or developer teams to help them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Mobius Labs &#8212; which was founded back in 2018 &#8212; now has 30 customers using its tools for a range of use cases.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Uses include c<span class="s1">ategorisation, recommendation, prediction, reducing operational expense, and/or &#8220;generally connecting users and audiences to visual content that is most relevant to their needs&#8221;. (Press and broadcasting and the stock photography sector have unsurprisingly been big focuses to date.)</span></p>
<p>But it reckons there&#8217;s wider utility for its tech and is gearing up for growth.</p>
<p>It caters to businesses of various sizes, from startups to SMEs, but says it mainly targets global enterprises with major content challenges &#8212; hence its historical focus on the media sector and video use cases.</p>
<p>Now, though, it&#8217;s also targeting geospatial and earth observation applications as it seeks to expand its customer base.</p>
<p>The 30-strong startup has more than doubled in size over the last 18 months. With the new funding it&#8217;s planning to double its headcount again over the next 12 months as it looks to expand its geographical footprint &#8212; focusing on Europe and the US.</p>
<p>Year-on-year growth has also been 2x but it believes it can dial that up by tapping into other sectors.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We are working with industries that are rich in visual data,&#8221; says Shaji. &#8220;The geospatial sector is something that we are focussing on currently as we have a strong belief that vast amounts of visual data is being produced by them. However, these huge archives of raw pixel data are useless on their own. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;For instance, if we want to track how river fronts are expanding, we have to look at data collected by satellites, sort and tag them in order to analyse them. Currently this is being done manually. The technology we are creating comes in a lightweight SDK, and can be deployed directly into these satellites so that the raw data can be detected and then analysed by machine learning algorithms. We are currently working with satellite companies in this sector.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>On the competitive front, <span class="s1">Shaji names </span><span class="s1"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/25/clarifai-raises-30m-to-give-developers-visual-search-capabilities/">Clarifai</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/18/google-opens-its-cloud-vision-api-to-all-developers/">Google Cloud Vision</a> as the main rivals it has in its sights.  </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">&#8220;We realise these are the big players but at the same time believe that we have something unique to offer, which these players cannot: Unlike their solutions, our platform users can be outside the field of computer vision. By democratising the training of machine learning models beyond simply the technical crowd, we are making computer vision accessible and understandable by anyone, regardless of their job titles,&#8221; he argues. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">&#8220;Another core value that differentiates us is the way we treat client data. Our solutions are delivered in the form of a Software Development Kit (SDK), which runs on-premise, completely locally on clients’ systems. No data is ever sent back to us. Our role is to empower people to build applications, and make them their own.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Computer vision startups have been a hot acquisition target in recent years and some earlier startups offering &#8216;computer vision as a service&#8217; got acquired by IT services firms to beef up their existing offerings, while tech giants like Amazon and (the aforementioned) Google offer their own computer vision services too.</p>
<p>But <span class="s1">Shaji suggests the tech is now at a different stage of development &#8212; and primed for &#8220;mass adoption&#8221;. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We’re talking about providing solutions that empower clients to build their own applications,&#8221; he says, summing up the competitive play. &#8220;And that [do that] with complete data privacy, where our solutions run on-premise, and we don’t see our clients data. Coupled with that is the ease of use that our technology offers: It is a lightweight solution that can be deployed on many ‘edge’ devices like smartphones, laptops, and even on satellites.&#8221; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p>Commenting on the funding in a statement, Stephan Wirries, partner at Ventech VC, added: “Appu and the team at Mobius Labs have developed an unparalleled offering in the computer vision space. Superhuman Vision is impressively innovative with its high degree of accuracy despite very limited required training to recognise new objects at excellent computational efficiency. We believe industries will be transformed through AI, and Mobius Labs is the European Deep Tech innovator teaching machines to see.”</p>
