										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following several reports of a toxic workplace and abuse this year, Twitch today <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2020/12/09/introducing-our-new-hateful-conduct-harassment-policy/">announced</a> the introduction of a new hateful content and harassment <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/harassment/20210122/">policy</a> for its streamer community that will go into effect on Jan. 22, 2021. Under the updated guidelines, Twitch&#8217;s Safety team will change the way it evaluates potentially violating content. The company says it will now focus less on the perceived intent of a streamer&#8217;s statements or actions, and more on the content itself as well as its impact. Twitch also expanded, clarified, and toughened the guidelines around hateful conduct and harassment, including sexual harassment, which now has its own section.</p>
<p>As Twitch notes in a <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2020/12/09/introducing-our-new-hateful-conduct-harassment-policy/">blog post detailing</a> the new policy, &#8220;words and actions have meaning and impact, even if your intent is not meant to be hurtful or cause harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company explains that even if the streamer and the target of the harassment isn&#8217;t bothered by what took place, others in the Twitch community may be. So Twitch will evaluate streamer&#8217;s behavior based on whether it&#8217;s abusive and in violation of the company&#8217;s guidelines, rather than only on the intent.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Twitch says it may also take into consideration other factors when making determinations of punitive actions, including the reports from the targeted user or a mod team as well as other indications a behavior was unwanted, like a channel time-out or ban, as needed.</p>
<p>The new policy additionally makes clearer that certain behaviors are considered harassment and are prohibited. This includes claiming that the victim of a well-documented violent tragedy is a crisis actor or lying; encouraging others to DDoS, hack, doxx or swat another person; and inciting malicious raids of another person&#8217;s social media accounts. This means that even off-platform behavior is being wrapped into these new guidelines.</p>
<p>Twitch is also adding &#8220;caste,&#8221; &#8220;color&#8221; and &#8220;immigration status&#8221; to its list of identity characteristics it uses to determine what&#8217;s considered hateful content. The list already includes protected characteristics like race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, serious medical condition, and veteran status.</p>
<p>And while hate speech and symbols were already banned on Twitch, the guidelines now explicitly ban hate groups, membership in hate groups, and the sharing of hate group propaganda. It&#8217;s also banning black/brown/yellow/redface, unless being shown in an &#8220;explicitly educational context.&#8221; (This is not meant to be a new change, but rather the language here has been made clearer, Twitch says.)</p>
<p>In another notable change, displaying the Confederate flag is now prohibited given its &#8220;historic and symbolic association with slavery and white supremacist groups in the U.S.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sometimes, harassment may not be as obvious, so the new policy looks for ways users try to get away with abuse by using emotes instead of text. Under the updated policy, the way combinations of emotes are used will also be considered when the Safety team is reviewing malicious content &#8212; even if no text was involved.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, following complaints from the community about being too lax on sexual harassment, the new policy will now also break out sexual harassment under its own section and lower the bar as to what&#8217;s considered objectifying or harassing behavior.</p>
<p>New changes of note here include repeatedly commenting on someone&#8217;s perceived attractiveness &#8212; even if this is intended as a compliment &#8212; if the commenter has been given an indication that it&#8217;s unwelcome. This could mean the commenter has already been asked to stop, timed-out or channel-banned. Twitch will also prohibit making lewd or explicit comments about anyone&#8217;s sexuality or physical appearance &#8212; with no exception for public figures. Sending unwanted or unsolicited links to nude images and videos is also prohibited.</p>
<p>Twitch says it will soon offer three live sessions on different dates before the policy goes into effect, where it will walk creators through the various changes and give them a chance to ask questions. These will be later available on demand, too. The first is at 10 AM on 12/11 on  <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/creatorcamp">/CreatorCamp</a>, followed by a 10 AM session on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/twitch">/twitch</a> on 12/16, then a 12 PM session on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/creatorcamp">/CreatorCamp</a> on Jan. 1, 2021.</p>
<p>The company is not necessarily changing the penalties associated with various behaviors. But, because the policy is more detailed, Twitch believes it will be able to better tailor a punitive action to the appropriate level with regard to the severity of the violation. For instance, lower severity violations may receive a warning or a lighter suspension, while the most severe actions will result in indefinite suspensions, even on a first offense.</p>
<p>The blog post answers other questions about the rollout of the policy, like how older content is handled or how Twitch will handle harassment when reports aren&#8217;t filed, for example, among other things. (The policy will only apply to new content created on or after Jan. 22; reports from someone are needed for Twitch to take action, as it wants to avoid punishing users win situations where banter or trash talk was welcome).</p>
<p>Of course, many may wonder how well Twitch will be able to properly enforce its new guidelines, given that its own corporate culture has been called out in the recent past as being toxic and abusive.</p>
<p><a href="https://gamedaily.biz/article/1782/a-wave-of-abuse-allegations-sweeps-the-games-industry">Several</a> <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-10-08-twitch-staff-call-the-company-out-on-sexual-assault-racism-more">reports</a> <a href="https://gamedaily.biz/article/1899/twitch-hit-with-a-new-wave-of-abuse-allegations">from</a> former and current Twitch employees have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303185/twitch-sexual-harassment-assault-permanent-bans-streamers">documented</a> Twitch executives and staff engaging in or ignoring issues like sexism, racism, harassment and other abuse both in the workplace and in the broader Twitch community. That raises the question as to how well can a company &#8212; a place where men allegedly referred to women streamers as &#8220;boob streamers,&#8221; for example, or assaulted their coworkers &#8212;  properly enforce a sexual harassment policy? At Twitch, when a coworker called a colleague the c-word and spat on her, a manager asked what she did to deserve it, one report claimed. Many women <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-10-08-twitch-staff-call-the-company-out-on-sexual-assault-racism-more">also described sexual assault</a> in the workplace, including groping, forced kisses and unwanted massages.</p>
<p>Twitch has a history of making bad choices in other areas, too &#8212; like featuring a Black Lives Matter support video where only one line was spoken by a Black streamer; a Pride celebration video where Twitch said the &#8220;G&#8221; also stood for &#8220;gamer;&#8221; and the release of Hispanic Heritage Month emotes that allowed users to add sombreros or maracas to their emotes, as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-10-08-twitch-staff-call-the-company-out-on-sexual-assault-racism-more">reported</a> by Gamesindustry.biz.</p>
<p>The company says the policy rewrite had been underway since the beginning of the year, but the recent conversations with the community, including those about the sexual misconduct allegations, &#8220;absolutely informed&#8221; the changes.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Twitch CEO Emmett Shear <a href="https://twitter.com/eshear/status/1275234049070526464">publicly posted a memo to staff</a> that promised people&#8217;s voices had been heard on these matters, and that the company aimed to make changes. This policy is one step in that direction but Twitch still has a lot more to prove.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cruise" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cruise">Cruise <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Automation, the autonomous vehicle subsidiary of GM that also has backing from SoftBank Vision Fund, Honda and T. Rowe Price &amp; Associates, has started testing what it describes as fully driverless vehicles on public roads in San Francisco, the first milestone required to secure a permit to launch a shared, commercial service that can charge for rides.</p>
<p>Cruise CEO Dan Ammann, who took one of the company&#8217;s first driverless ride on public streets in San Francisco&#8217;s Sunset neighborhood, called it &#8220;wildly boring&#8221; and &#8220;a humble step&#8221; towards a commercial service.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ride itself was extremely natural and predictable, so it was kind of boring, but in all the right ways,&#8221; Ammann said in a call with reporters Wednesday. &#8220;And our goal is to make that same experience available to as many people as possible as soon and as safely as we can; and that could either be by taking a ride, or by getting say a self-driving delivery.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company released Wednesday a video of its first ride — with no human safety driver behind the wheel — in the Sunset neighborhood in San Francisco. There was a human safety operator in the vehicle, sitting in the passenger seat, the video shows.</p>
<p>Cruise&#8217;s testing of fully autonomous vehicles is in limited geographic area and in arguably one of San Francisco&#8217;s simpler environments; the video below shows the testing was conducted at night in a less congested part of San Francisco. However, it still marks progress by the company that had once aimed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/cruise-will-launch-a-commercial-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco-but-not-in-2019/">launch a commercial service by the end of 2019</a>.</p>
<p>For some in the industry, the caveats of having a safety operator in the passenger seat and launching in an &#8220;easier&#8221; and small geofenced area matter. Cruise says this is just the beginning and that it will eventually expand its driverless testing area, adding in more complicated environments over time, as well as removing the safety operator from the vehicle.</p>
<p>&#8220;We recognize this is both a trust race as well as a tech race,&#8221; Cruise spokesperson Milin Mehta said in an email. &#8220;Given that, during the beginning of our use of this permit, we will maintain a safety operator in the passenger seat. The safety operator has the ability to bring the vehicle to a stop in the event of an emergency, but does not have access to standard driver controls. Eventually, this safety operator will be fully removed.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pa7xU7PW-oM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Cruise started driverless testing in November with a dedicated fleet of five autonomous vehicles. The rest of Cruise&#8217;s fleet will be used to perform its regular testing with a human safety driver, some of which are used to deliver goods to area food banks.</p>
<p>The California DMV, the agency that regulates autonomous vehicle testing in the state, issued Cruise a permit in October that allows the company to test five autonomous vehicles without a driver behind the wheel on specified streets within San Francisco. Cruise has had a permit to test autonomous vehicles with safety drivers behind the wheel since 2015.</p>
<p>In February, Cruise received a permit from the California Public Utilities Commission allowing it to transport passengers in its autonomous vehicles in the state. However, it wasn&#8217;t until November that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/robotaxi-companies-get-the-green-light-to-charge-for-rides-in-california/">CPUC modified its regulations</a> to allow properly permitted companies the ability to charge for shared driverless rides. The bar to secure the permit is higher than it was before and includes a new government approval process that some in the industry have argued adds unnecessary bureaucracy that could delay deployments by more than two years.</p>
<p>Government process aside, Cruise has to show data that it tested driverless rides for a <a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/General.aspx?id=6442457808">30-day period</a> before it can qualify for the CPUC permit, according to information <a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/General.aspx?id=6442457808">on the CPUC website</a>.</p>
<p>AutoX, Nuro, Waymo and Zoox also have driverless testing permits. Waymo has tested what it describes as fully autonomous mode on public roads without a human safety driver behind the wheel, but it has yet to remove the operator from the vehicle altogether.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Does the United States have a startup visa? If not, what are the best visas for startup founders? </strong></p>
<p><strong>If my friend is a Dreamer in the U.S. who is undocumented but wants to found a startup, is it possible?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—Cheerful in Chile</strong></p>
<p>Hello Cheerful!</p>
<p>Much to be cheerful about for your friend today as DACA is back! DACA is “Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals” and it provides work permits for people who were brought to the U.S. as children. Some of the basics to see if your friend might qualify for DACA are if they were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012; if they came to the U.S. before they turned 16; and if they have lived in the U.S. since June 15, 2007. <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/news/alerts/deferred-action-for-childhood-arrivals-response-to-december-4-2020-order-in-batalla-vidal-et-al-v">USCIS announced</a> that it is accepting first-time DACA applications, renewals and advance parole documents to travel in two-year increments. This is great news for many folks for whom the U.S. is truly home, who have been educated here or served in the armed forces, and who want to further contribute to the tech ecosystem and economy.</p>
<p>Besides DACA, what other options are there for founders to move to the U.S. in 2021?</p>
<p>To be clear: The U.S. does not currently have a startup visa (you can read more about it in <a href="https://timesofsandiego.com/opinion/2020/12/04/bring-in-entrepreneurial-immigrants-to-create-more-jobs-for-americans/">my op-ed in the Times of San Diego</a>). According to the <a href="https://nfap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/International-Experience-of-Startup-Visas.NFAP-Policy-Brief.July-2020.pdf">National Foundation for American Policy</a>, if the U.S. had established a startup visa in 2016, it would have created 1 million to 3.2 million jobs over 10 years. I’m doing all I personally can to contribute to the creation of the U.S. Startup Visa or possibly the resurrection of <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/international-entrepreneur-rule/hope-for-founders-even-without-international-entrepreneur-rule/">International Entrepreneur Parole</a> as we look ahead to the Biden/Harris administration.</p>
<p>That being said, we have solutions, advanced information and creative options, some of which I can share here with you. Check out <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/044-7-of-the-most-startup-friendly-visas-explained/">7 of the Most Startup-Friendly Visas Explained</a>. Coming out of COVID in 2021, here are the most common visas and green cards that work for many founders. As immigration law is very nuanced, often people contact me to find specific alternative strategies that better suit their long-term goals.</p>
<h2>B-1 visa for business visitors</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/b-1-visa-visitors-business/">B-1</a> is a nonimmigrant (temporary) visa that enables entrepreneurs to explore the U.S. market. Under a B-1 visa, a founder or entrepreneur cannot be employed in the U.S., but can come for a business trip. This means you should not do any paid or unpaid work for a U.S. entity on your trip. However, some activities for founders are OK, such as meeting with investors, negotiating contracts, interviewing and hiring staff, and establishing an office. A B-1 visa typically allows for a maximum stay of one year — six months under the initial application and a six-month extension. It’s usually best to spend less than half the time in the U.S. on B status to ease future entries.</p>
<p>Founders who are citizens of designated countries, including Chile, can qualify for the <a href="https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/">ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization) visa waiver program</a>, allowing them to travel to the U.S. for business for 90 days or less without first obtaining a visa. ESTA cannot typically be extended or changed once you are in the United States.</p>
<h2>L-1A visa for intracompany transferee managers and executives<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Better late than never. So it might be said of the Boston- and New York-based seed-stage firm <a href="https://www.flybridge.com/">Flybridge Capital Partners</a>, which is today announcing that Anna Palmer has been promoted to general partner.</p>
<p>She is the first woman to hold the title at the 19-year-old firm.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a nice distinction to have and Palmer sounds enthusiastic excited about the role, but she also suggests that as a longtime member of Flybridge&#8217;s community, the transition to a full-time position with the firm should be relatively seamless.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Boston-based Harvard Law grad first met Flybridge cofounder Jeff Bussgang a decade ago as a student at the university, where Bussgang teaches on entrepreneurship. Flybridge later funded the second of two companies she has cofounded: <a href="https://www.joindough.com/">Dough Collective</a>, a membership community to discover, buy and save on products made by women. (Palmer previously co-founder Fashion Project, which collected online designer clothing donations, then delivered the proceeds from their sale to thousands of organizations before it ultimately <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/inno/stories/profiles/2016/04/08/the-fashion-project-is-closing-up-shop.html">sold itself </a>in 2016.)</p>
<p>By 2017, Palmer was cofounding the seed-stage firm <a href="https://www.xfactor.ventures/">XFactor Ventures</a> with another of Flybridge&#8217;s cofounders, Chip Hazard. At its launch, the organization featured nine partners altogether. Now it has 22 partners across six different cities who have collectively made 57 investments across two funds. Except for Hazard, all are women who run their own companies. They manage a collective $12 million in assets; Flybridge is among their limited partners.</p>
<p>XFactor&#8217;s overarching goal is to provide seed funding to other startups that are led entirely or in part by women founders. But it was also founded with the belief that &#8220;if we as women founders wanted to change things, we need more women VCs, and as women get experience [on both sides of the table] they will become general partners at other firms,&#8221; says Palmer.</p>
<p>That thesis seems to be paying off. Earlier this year, Aubrie Pagano, an XFactor investor whose online customizable shirt company Bow &amp; Drape was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurendebter/2019/11/05/bow--drape-is-latest-brand-snapped-up-by-an-e-commerce-holding-company/?sh=7ef2b5e9611f">acquired</a> last year by a holding company, was brought into the New York venture firm <a href="https://alpaca.vc/">Alpaca</a> as a general partner. Palmer is the second proof point.</p>
<p>As for what she&#8217;ll be funding, Palmer told us in an interview earlier this week that she&#8217;ll be invest in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer companies and that her specific interest ties right now to &#8220;startups that have some sort of community-driven thesis, including commerce 3.0, marketplaces, and the future of everything economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>One area she&#8217;s is drilling into, for example, is &#8220;large marketplaces for local&#8221; given the opportunity she&#8217;s seeing. As she puts it, &#8220;Why is it easier for me to a Christmas ornament from Amazon than a store in Boston that&#8217;s five miles away?&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked if deal-making is as frantic in Boston as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/technology/this-is-insanity-start-ups-end-year-in-a-deal-frenzy.html">elsewhere</a>, Palmer says it &#8220;absolutely&#8221; is owing to startups that are no longer limited by geography when it comes to fundraising. In the the Zoom era, a partner at every investment firm in the world is just a click away, and Flybridge is seeing it time and again in its portfolio. Indeed, she points to one <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">mobile gaming company funded by Flybridge that &#8220;ended up having gaming-specific funds interested from various geographies in just two to three days.&#8221; Last year, she notes, that wouldn&#8217;t be possible.</span></p>
<p>Because of the hyper-speed at which deals are moving, we wonder if it&#8217;s a tricky time to be diving in as a full-time VC, but Patterson doesn&#8217;t sound daunted. &#8220;You&#8217;re leaning on expertise, which is easier to do in markets that you know incredibly well and patterns you&#8217;ve seen before. Between founding two companies and XFactors, I&#8217;ve had time to develop those theses about where I think the world is going.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flybridge is currently investing a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1752573/000175257418000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">sub-$100 million fund</a> that it closed in early 2019. Palmer says the firm &#8212; which prefers to lead seed rounds, whose first checks range from $500,000 to $2.5 million, and whose biggest win to date may be the database software company MongoDB (its market cap is $16.8 billion on Nasdaq) &#8212; is likely to fundraise again next summer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As competition in the streaming service market heats up, services are looking for ways to differentiate their offerings. One area of increased interest &#8212; especially in light of fierce competition from newcomer Disney+ &#8212; is how to make their services more family-friendly. On this front, Netflix today announced the rollout of new features for families, the Kids Activity Report and Family Profiles, while CBS All Access added a Kids Mode and other updates aimed at families.</p>
<p>Streamers for years have marketed their services towards families with children, not only because these customers will often pay for higher-priced tiers offering more simultaneous logins, but also because strong kids&#8217; entertainment offerings helps to keep subscribers loyal.</p>
<p>Netflix has led on this front with investments in children&#8217;s programming and long time support for parental controls, a &#8220;Kids&#8221; profile, and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, the company says it&#8217;s testing new features to better improve the Netflix experience.</p>
<p>One is a new Kids Activity Report that provides parents with information about what their kids are streaming on Netflix.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2084952" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084952" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2084952" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Netflix-Kids-Activity-Report-gif-small.gif?w=400" alt="" width="400" height="571" /><p id="caption-attachment-2084952" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Netflix</p></div></p>
<p>This includes information about the child&#8217;s recently watched shows and interests, as well as suggested conversation topics and activities &#8212; like coloring pages or jokes &#8212;  that parents can use to engage kids further. This could help those families where parents may not be clued in as to how kids&#8217; are spending their time on Netflix &#8212; like those where the kids often watch independently or on their own device, for example.</p>
<p>It also arrives at a time when families are stuck at home due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has limited the options for kids&#8217; entertainment, leading to increased screen time. A feature that turns something parents worry about &#8212; too much screen time &#8212; into offline activities for family engagement could help this increased Netflix usage been seen in a more positive light.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2084956" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Netflix-Kids-Activity-Report-phonemockup.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Netflix-Kids-Activity-Report-phonemockup.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Netflix-Kids-Activity-Report-phonemockup.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Netflix-Kids-Activity-Report-phonemockup.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Netflix-Kids-Activity-Report-phonemockup.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Netflix-Kids-Activity-Report-phonemockup.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Netflix-Kids-Activity-Report-phonemockup.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Netflix-Kids-Activity-Report-phonemockup.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Netflix-Kids-Activity-Report-phonemockup.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Netflix says the report, which is sent via email, is being tested globally in select markets.</p>
<p>Another test involves a Family Profile, that focuses on helping family members find programming they can all watch together. Like other profiles, the Family Profile would be accessed from the main screen with its own icon and maintain its own recommendations and watch lists, separate from an individual&#8217;s own profile.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2084957" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_1.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Unlike a kids&#8217; user profile, which has a specific age range depending on the settings, the Family Profile would feature a selection of titles that extend up to PG-13 for movies TV-14 for shows.</p>
<p>This content can still be surprisingly hard to find these days, as much of what some streamers consider &#8220;family&#8221; viewing are titles that are actually aimed at little kids &#8211;titles that are often painful for full-grown adults to sit through, that is. Family-friendly profiles could instead include less of this preschool fare, perhaps, and more of <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/enola_holmes">popular</a> family titles like the recent hit, &#8220;Enola Holmes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Netflix suggested you also might find titles like the upcoming animated short &#8220;<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81332733">Canvas</a>,&#8221; animated special &#8220;<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81010807">A Trash Truck Christmas</a>,&#8221; or live action family movie &#8220;<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80994666">We Can Be Heroes,&#8221;</a> on a Family profile.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2084958" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084958" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2084958" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_2.jpg 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_2.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Family-Profile_2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2084958" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Netflix</p></div></p>
<p>This test is also running globally, but only on the TV, Netflix says.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163863/netflix-family-profile-kids-activity-report-data-movies-tv-shows-individual">The Verge</a> first reported on the tests.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re always looking for new ways to improve the Netflix experience for members of all ages,&#8221; a Netflix spokesperson told TechCrunch about its new features. &#8220;We run these tests in different countries and for different periods of time &#8211; and only make them broadly available if people find them useful,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p>Of course, new family features could also help Netflix overcome some of the customer backlash against its service following the &#8220;Cuties&#8221; scandal earlier this year.</p>
<p>The French film and award winner, was meant to be social commentary on the hypersexualization of children, but was condemned for exploiting children instead, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2020/10/20/netflix-tiny-subscriber-growth-pegged-cuties-scandal/5991684002/">possibly even denting Netflix subscriber growth.</a> (The controversy was heavily tied to the<a href="https://adage.com/article/digital/how-netflixs-shocking-movie-poster-landed-it-middle-qanons-child-crusade/2275891"> QAnon #SavetheChildren conspiracy</a>, too, though not all customers objecting to the film knew they were participating in the broader movement driven by QAnon.)</p>
<p>Netflix was not the only streamer to launch family-friendly features today.</p>
<p>In addition, CBS All Access today announced the roll out of new family-friendly features of its own. However, it&#8217;s playing catch-up with other streamers with its launches.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2084951" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084951" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2084951" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CBS_AA_image.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="361" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CBS_AA_image.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CBS_AA_image.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CBS_AA_image.jpg?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CBS_AA_image.jpg?resize=768,408 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CBS_AA_image.jpg?resize=680,361 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CBS_AA_image.jpg?resize=1536,815 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CBS_AA_image.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2084951" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> CBS All Access</p></div></p>
<p>The company says it will add a new feature that allows families to create up to 6 profiles per account and manage those using a &#8220;Kids Mode&#8221; option. This allows parents to create profiles that limit content to younger and older children based on content ratings. In addition, the service&#8217;s existing parental controls (the PIN-based controls) will also be available across these new profiles.</p>
<p>The features arrived alongside the addition of nearly 800 more episodes of kids&#8217; content, including Nick Jr. favorites like <em>Paw Patrol, Blaze and the Monster Machines, Blue&#8217;s Clues, Bubble Guppies, Dora the Explorer, Shimmer and Shine</em>, and others. The service already had over 1,000 episodes of children&#8217;s programming before the new shows arrived, including <em>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Danger Mouse, Lassie, George of the Jungle,</em> and <em>Mr. Magoo.</em> A SpongeBob spinoff, <em>Kamp Koral</em>, will arrive next year, along with <em>The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run. </em></p>
<p>In related news, a top streaming platform, Fire TV, is also looking to better serve multi-person households and families with its latest changes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2084950" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084950" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2084950" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fire-tv-profiles.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fire-tv-profiles.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fire-tv-profiles.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fire-tv-profiles.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fire-tv-profiles.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fire-tv-profiles.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fire-tv-profiles.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fire-tv-profiles.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2084950" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>Fire TV today offers a platform for engaging with streaming apps, games and other content, but organizes this into an interface complete with tailored recommendations and other features. Its redesign, first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/amazon-redesigns-fire-tv-introduces-new-fire-tv-stick-and-low-cost-fire-tv-stick-lite/">announced in September</a>, rolls out starting today.</p>
<p>The update brings a brand-new look-and-feel to Fire TV, which now reorganizes the navigation and improves how it makes recommendations. But one of the bigger changes is that Fire TV users &#8212; including kids &#8212; will now each get their own profile for a more personalized experience.</p>
<p>All the updates are rolling out starting today. Netflix&#8217;s tests, however, won&#8217;t reach all users at this time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/getaccepts-workflow-and-e-signature-platform-for-sales-secures-7m-series-a-funding/">Last year</a> all-in-one digital sales platform <a href="http://GetAccept.com">GetAccept</a> raised a $7 million Series A funding. The platform, which wraps-in video, live chat, proposal design, document tracking and e-signatures, has now raised $20 million in Series B funding, led by Bessemer Venture Partners, as the company expands its platform aimed at SMBs. The funding comes as the pandemic means SMBs have largely shifted to remote and so has their digital sales process.</p>
<p>Last year the funding was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dn-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="dn-capital">DN Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from BootstrapLabs, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/y-combinator" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="y-combinator">Y Combinator <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and a number of Spotify&#8217;s early investors. This round brings GetAccept&#8217;s total financing raised to $30M. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/getaccept" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="getaccept">GetAccept <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> competes with several separate tools, including well-financed solutions like DocSend, PandaDoc,  Showpad, Highspot, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/docusign" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="docusign">DocuSign <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Adobe Sign.</p>
<p>Founded in 2015 by Swedish entrepreneurs and Y Combinator alumni Samir Smajic, Mathias Thulin, Jonas Blanck, and Carl Carell, GetAccept has expanded from 30 to now 100+ employees over the last 18 months with offices across US and EU countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Smajic said: “We believe in the power of relationships and want to bring personalized and engaging interactions back to the online sales process. We saw this digital sales shift and change in behavior back in 2015, which is why we founded GetAccept in the first place. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated and forced B2B buyers and sellers to go digital, which has placed digital sales models high up on the company agendas. We aim to be the online place where every B2B business happens, in a personal way.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Twitter and Facebook scrambled to institute <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/twitter-contested-election-misinformation-policy-trump/">new policies for the 2020 election</a>, YouTube was&#8230; mostly quiet. The platform didn&#8217;t make any flashy announcements about a crackdown on election-related misinformation, nor did it really fully grapple with its massive role in distributing information during what was widely regarded as an extremely volatile time for American democracy.</p>
<p>Former Vice President Joe Biden won the presidential election on November 7, but <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/youtube" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="youtube">YouTube <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> decided to <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supporting-the-2020-us-election/">wait until the &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; deadline</a>, when audits and recounts must be wrapped up at the state level, to enforce a set of rules against election misinformation.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supporting-the-2020-us-election/">a new blog post</a> out Wednesday, the world&#8217;s second biggest social network explained itself — sort of:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Yesterday was the safe harbor deadline for the U.S. Presidential election and enough states have certified their election results to determine a President-elect. Given that, we will start removing any piece of content uploaded today (or anytime after) that misleads people by alleging that widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election, in line with our approach towards historical U.S. Presidential elections. For example, we will remove videos claiming that a Presidential candidate won the election due to widespread software glitches or counting errors. We will begin enforcing this policy today, and will ramp up in the weeks to come.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>YouTube clarified that while its users were allowed to spread misinformation about an undecided election, content claiming that &#8220;widespread fraud or errors&#8221; influenced the result of a <em>past</em> election will not be allowed. And from YouTube&#8217;s perspective, which accommodated the Trump administration&#8217;s many empty challenges to the results, the election was only decided yesterday.</p>
<p>The four days between November 3 and November 7 were fraught, plagued by false victory claims from President Trump and his supporters and concerns about political violence as online misinformation, already a pervasive threat, kicked into overdrive. Rather than wading into all that as Twitter and even the ever reluctant-to-act Facebook did, YouTube mostly opted to sit back and wait for history to take its course. The company was more comfortable universally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/youtube-voting-misinformation-election/">pointing users toward real information</a> than making tough calls and actively purging false claims from its platform.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vXZwy7k1ZH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/trump-election-2020-premature-victory-facebook-twitter/">Close US election results plunge social media into nightmare misinformation scenario</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Close US election results plunge social media into nightmare misinformation scenario&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/trump-election-2020-premature-victory-facebook-twitter/embed/#?secret=vXZwy7k1ZH" data-secret="vXZwy7k1ZH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>YouTube doesn&#8217;t go to great lengths to explain itself these days, much less make realtime platform policy decisions in a transparent way. Twitter has pioneered that approach, and while its choices aren&#8217;t always clear or decisive, its transparency and open communication is admirable. If Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/twitter-new-york-post/">doesn&#8217;t always get it right</a>, YouTube fails to even step up to the plate, making few real efforts to adapt to the rapidly mutating threats posed by misinformation online.</p>
<p>YouTube&#8217;s opaque decision making process is compounded by the also opaque nature of online video, which is vastly more difficult for journalists to search and index than text-based platforms. The result is that YouTube had largely gotten away with relatively little scrutiny compared to its stature in the social media world. It&#8217;s bizarre to see Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey called before the Senate Judiciary Committee <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/dorsey-zuckerberg-hearing-senate-judiciary-election/">without even a passing thought</a> to bringing in YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki as well. In spite of its massive influence and two billion users, the social video behemoth is barely on the radar for lawmakers.</p>
<p>If YouTube&#8217;s strategy is that communicating less attracts less attention, unfortunately it appears to be working. The company is bound to be anxious about getting dragged into federal and state-level antitrust investigations, particularly with state lawsuits that could try to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/08/facebook-ftc-states-antitrust-lawsuit/">force Facebook and Instagram apart</a>.</p>
<p>The Justice Department is already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/justice-department-will-reportedly-file-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-today/">targeting Google with a historic antitrust suit</a> focused on its search business, but that doesn&#8217;t preclude other antitrust actions from taking aim at YouTube. Keeping its head down may have worked for YouTube during four years of Trump, but President-Elect Biden is more interested in inoculating people against misinformation rather than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/trump-flu-covid-misinformation-facebook-and-twitter/">super-spreading it</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://getsquire.com/">Squire</a>, a startup that sells software to barbershops, has raised $59 million in a round led by Iconiq Capital. The raise is $45 million in equity capital, and $15 million in debt financing.</p>
<p>The round comes just months after <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/squir-technologies-4" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="squir-technologies-4">Squire <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> closed its $34 million Series B, led by CRV. With the new financing, Squire has nearly tripled its valuation, up from $85 million in June to $250 million today. Other investors include Tiger Global, Charles River Ventures, and Trinity Ventures.</p>
<p>What happened? Squire’s revenue went from zero in March, when all barber shops closed, to between $10 million to $20 million in ARR just 10 months later, TechCrunch has learned. The growth indicates how the next wave of barbershops will be built atop digital technology, instead of offline processes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We just took off like a lightning bolt,” co-founder Dave Salvant tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Salvant and Squire’s other co-founder, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/songe-laron" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="songe-laron">Songe LaRon, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> began the business as a back-end barbershop management tool for independent businesses in 2016. Squire lets businesses schedule appointments, offer loyalty programs and install contactless and cashless payment. The team claims that barbershop operations are more complex than many other types of small businesses because there are multiple parties transacting, plus customers might check out different services from different barbers all within one service.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CqqJyz3k02"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/squire-haircuts-coronavirus-crv-34-million-series-b/">Squire balances clean fades with the coronavirus</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Squire balances clean fades with the coronavirus&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/squire-haircuts-coronavirus-crv-34-million-series-b/embed/#?secret=CqqJyz3k02" data-secret="CqqJyz3k02" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That’s where Squire comes in — to be a point of sale to manage those confusing transactions.</p>
<p>The coronavirus has threatened the livelihoods of small and medium-sized business owners, making it harder for them to secure loans or financing to undergo tricky times. Salvant says that Squire took on $15 million in debt financing to create a banking-as-a-service feature for these business owners.</p>
<p>“This market is underserved by traditional financial institutions,” Salvant said. “And we think there&#8217;s opportunities to help these owners with financial tools.”</p>
<p>Going forward, Squire plans to expand into new markets, including Australia, Canada, and the U.K. The majority of capital raised will go toward hiring new sales and marketing professionals.</p>
<p>Squire’s total staff is currently 100 people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Haters gonna hate, IPOs gonna pop.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the story today as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/how-doordash-and-c3-ai-can-defend-their-red-hot-ipo-valuatons/">richly valued DoorDash and C3.ai</a>, two American technology unicorns, saw their values skyrocket after they began trading today.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/doordash" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="doordash">DoorDash <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> shares are up just under 83% to $186.51. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/doordash-ipo-pricing/">priced its IPO at $102 per share</a> last night, ahead of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/doordash-amps-its-ipo-range-ahead-of-blockbuster-ipo/">raised IPO range of $90 to $95 per share</a>.</p>
<p>And as I write to you, shares of C3.ai are up an even sharper 151% to $105.58, after pricing at $42 per share earlier today. The company had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/the-ipo-market-looks-hot-as-airbnb-and-c3-ai-raise-price-targets/">raised its IPO range from $31 to $34 per share to $36 to $38 per share</a>.</p>
<p>It appears that public investors are, again, more exuberant about the growth and profit prospects of select late-stage unicorns than private investors. Earlier this year DoorDash <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/after-ipo-delays-doordash-confirms-400m-raise/">raised $400 million at a valuation of around $16 billion</a>, for example.</p>
<p>Today on a <em>non-diluted </em>basis, the company is worth around $59 billion. That figure rises sharply if you include shares that could be created from the exercise of options and other forms of compensation.</p>

<p>TechCrunch is speaking with DoorDash&#8217;s CFO and the CEO of C3.ai later today.</p>
<p>For a passel of companies coming next, the day&#8217;s tidings are more than welcome. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/airbnb" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="airbnb">Airbnb <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> may be able to secure a higher per-share price when it prices later today. And with Affirm and Upstart and Roblox and Wish quickly approaching their final IPO prices, the explosive early trading of today&#8217;s debuts could provide them with a boost as well.</p>
<p>Why are the two companies up so sharply? Your guess is as good as mine, but factors could include &#8212; as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/how-doordash-and-c3-ai-can-defend-their-red-hot-ipo-valuatons/">noted this morning</a> &#8212; a boom in retail trading and a possibly constrained float, among other factors. Regardless, for both firms it has been a dream week, first raising more money than they likely anticipated, then receiving a rapturous welcome from public investors.</p>
<p>How should we understand the new valuations? It&#8217;s too soon to fully grok what is going on. More trading with more shares in motion will help clarify the two companies&#8217; more stable value.</p>
<p>Until then we&#8217;re going to sit back and watch Yahoo Finance.</p>

<p>The Chrome team also today announced that it will launch <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/">Manifest V3</a> in mid-January, when Chrome 88 hits the stable channel. That&#8217;s something a lot of extension developers &#8212; especially those working on ad blockers &#8212; have been dreading. Manifest V3 introduces new limits for extension developers that are meant to prevent them from accessing too much data from their users, but it also puts relatively severe limits on how extensions can interact with a web page. Google now says it has made some changes to V3 based on the feedback it has received, but this is probably not the last we&#8217;ve heard of this.</p>
<p>Overall, however, if you&#8217;re a user, the most welcome news from today&#8217;s event may be that, after working to reduce the overall memory footprint of the browser with a couple of updates earlier this year, the team is now tackling the V8 JavaScript engine and reducing its memory footprint as well. In addition, the team found some new ways to speed up V8 and eliminate any parsing pauses by loading a site&#8217;s JavaScript files in parallel to make sure they can be used the moment a page wants to execute them.</p>
<p>The team also continues to work on new ways to speed up the browsing experience, too. The team is doing this by actually changing the way it compiles Chrome, something it first talked about this summer, when these changes arrived in the Chrome beta channel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on looking at the usage patterns of Chrome, we asked ourselves &#8212; with insights of how users are actually using Chrome &#8212; are there things we could do in how we compile chrome itself that would make it more efficient? And we found that the answer is yes,&#8221; Google&#8217;s <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/ben-galbraith" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="ben-galbraith">Ben Galbraith <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> told me. &#8220;[&#8230;] We call it profile-guided optimization and in [certain] scenarios, we found up to 10 percent faster page loads due to these task-specific compiler optimizations.&#8221; Most of the scenarios are in the 2 to 5 percent range, but given how mature most browser engines are now, even that&#8217;s a significant difference.</p>
<p>The team is also recently worked on <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/11/tab-throttling-and-more-performance.html">improving tab throttling</a> and how it allocates resources to foreground and background tasks. Galbraith noted that the plan is to do more work along these lines moving forward.</p>
<p>Developers, too, will get some new tools to improve the performance of their web apps as part of Google&#8217;s <a href="https://web.dev/vitals/">Web Vital initiative</a>, which aims to provide developers with the right performance metrics to help them understand how users experience their web apps. Google Search will use some of these core metrics in its rankings, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/11/timing-for-page-experience">starting May 2021</a>. Google already highlights this data in the Chrome Experience Report, in its Search Console and elsewhere, but today it is also launching an open-source <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-vitals-report">Web Vitals Report</a> tool to help developers create custom visualization based on the Web Vitals data they&#8217;ve sent to Google Analytics. Google Analytics doesn&#8217;t currently surface this data in the context of Web Vitals, so developers can now run these reports using Google&#8217;s own <a href="https://web-vitals-report.web.app/">hosted tool</a> or fork the code and run them on their own infrastructure.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you look at the different metrics, we&#8217;re focused on the things that we understand the most: loading metrics, visual stability and the like, and interaction &#8212; so when you click on something, something actually happens. The mission for these metrics is to be able to really understand the quality of the experience that you&#8217;ve got.,&#8221; Google&#8217;s <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/dion-almaer" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="dion-almaer">Dion Almaer <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> explained.</p>
<p>And there is more. On the privacy front, Google continues to iterate on its Privacy Sandbox model. It&#8217;s adding two new experiments here with the <a href="https://web.dev/conversion-measurement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://web.dev/conversion-measurement/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1607620334082000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGflcW9zqrh4dPi8O7GtOzzKCR8EQ">Click Conversion Measurement API</a> to measures ad conversions without using cross-site identifiers and the new <a href="https://web.dev/trust-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://web.dev/trust-tokens/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1607620334082000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE6VwWDlb284wMtOZiFg6YYef_vpw">Trust Token APIs</a> that allow a site to issue a cryptographic token to a user it trusts. The idea behind this token is that the browser can then use this token in another context as well to evaluate that a user is who they say they are &#8212; and not a bot or an impostor with malicious intent.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also new features for developers who want to write PWAs, updates to how developers can accept payments in Chrome and more.</p>

<p>The draft Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act are due to be unveiled by the Commission next week, though the EU lawmaking process means it&#8217;ll likely be years before either becomes law.</p>
<p>The Commission has said the legislative proposals will set clear responsibilities for how platforms must handle illegal and harmful content, as well as applying a set of additional responsibilities on the most powerful players which are intended to foster competition in digital markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It also plans to legislate around political ads transparency &#8212; under a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/europe-to-put-forward-rules-for-political-ads-transparency-and-beef-up-its-disinformation-code-next-year/">Democracy Action Plan</a> &#8212; but not til Q3 next year.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe to limit how big tech can push its own services and use third-party data&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/europe-to-limit-how-big-tech-can-push-its-own-services-and-use-third-party-data/embed/#?secret=qc60e0fHNA" data-secret="qc60e0fHNA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>On the challenge of regulating digital content without damaging vibrant online expression they advocate for a more nuanced approach to &#8220;legal-but-harmful&#8221; content &#8212; pressing a &#8216;freedom of speech is not freedom of reach&#8217; position by urging EU lawmakers not to limit their policy options to binary takedowns (which they suggest would benefit the most powerful platforms).</p>
<p>Instead they suggest tackling problem (but legal) speech by focusing on content visibility as key and ensuring consumers have genuine choice in what they see &#8212; implying support for regulation to require that users have meaningful controls over algorithmic feeds (such as the ability to switch off AI curation entirely).</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, the present conversation is too often framed through the prism of content removal alone, where success is judged solely in terms of ever-more content removal in ever-shorter periods of time. Without question, illegal content &#8212; including terrorist content and child sexual abuse material &#8212; must be removed expeditiously. Indeed, many creative self-regulatory initiatives proposed by the European Commission have demonstrated the effectiveness of an EU-wide approach,&#8221; they write.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet by limiting policy options to a solely stay up-come down binary, we forgo promising alternatives that could better address the spread and impact of problematic content while safeguarding rights and the potential for smaller companies to compete. Indeed, removing content cannot be the sole paradigm of Internet policy, particularly when concerned with the phenomenon of ‘legal-but-harmful’ content. Such an approach would benefit only the very largest companies in our industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;We therefore encourage a content moderation discussion that emphasises the difference between illegal and harmful content and highlights the potential of interventions that address how content is surfaced and discovered. Included in this is how consumers are offered real choice in the curation of their online environment.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;On illegal hate speech, EU lawmakers eye binding transparency for platforms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/on-illegal-hate-speech-eu-lawmakers-eye-binding-transparency-for-platforms/embed/#?secret=YjLdOZ7F9M" data-secret="YjLdOZ7F9M" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Twitter does already let users switch between a chronological content view or &#8216;top tweets&#8217; (aka, its algorithmically curated feed) &#8212; so arguably it already offers users &#8220;real choice&#8221; on that front. That said, its platform can also inject some (non-advertising) content into a user&#8217;s feed regardless of whether a person has elected to see it &#8212; if its algorithms believe it&#8217;ll be of interest. So not quite 100% real choice then.</p>
<p>Another example is Facebook &#8212; which does offer a switch to turn off algorithmic curation of its News Feed. But it&#8217;s so buried in settings most normal users are unlikely to discover it. (Underlying the importance of default settings in this context; algorithmic defaults with buried user choice do already exist on mainstream platforms &#8212; and don&#8217;t sum to meaningful user control over what they&#8217;re exposed to.)</p>
<p>In the letter, the companies go on to write that they support &#8220;measures towards algorithmic transparency and control, setting limits to the discoverability of harmful content, further exploring community moderation, and providing meaningful user choice&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that it’s both more sustainable and more holistically effective to focus on limiting the number of people who encounter harmful content. This can be achieved by placing a technological emphasis on visibility over prevalence,&#8221; they suggest, adding: &#8220;The tactics will vary from service to service but the underlying approach will be familiar.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Commission has signalled that algorithmic transparency will be a key plank of the policy package &#8212; saying in October that the proposals will include requirements for the biggest platforms to provide information on the way their algorithms work when regulators ask for it.</p>
<p>Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said then that the aim is to &#8220;give more power to users &#8212; so algorithms don’t have the last word about what we get to see, and what we don’t get to see&#8221; &#8212; suggesting requirements to offer a certain level of user control could be coming down the pipe for the tech industry&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/01/wtf-is-dark-pattern-design/">dark patterns</a>.</p>

<p>In their letter, the four companies also express support for harmonizing notice-and-action rules for responding to illegal content, to clarify obligations and provide legal certainty, as well as calling for such mechanisms to &#8220;include measures proportionate to the nature and impact of the illegal content in question&#8221;.</p>
<p>The four are also keen for EU lawmakers to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach for regulating digital players and markets. Although given the DSA/DMA split that looks unlikely; there will at least be two sizes involved in Europe&#8217;s rebooted rules, and most likely a lot more nuance.</p>
<p>&#8220;We recommend a tech-neutral and human rights-based approach to ensure legislation transcends individual companies and technological cycles,&#8221; they go on, adding a little dig over the controversial <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/european-parliament-votes-for-controversial-copyright-reform/">EU Copyright directive</a> &#8212; which they describe as a reminder there are &#8220;major drawbacks in prescribing generalised compliance solutions&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our rules must be sufficiently flexible to accommodate and allow for the harnessing of sectoral shifts, such as the rise of decentralised hosting of content and data,&#8221; they go on, arguing a &#8220;far-sighted approach&#8221; can be ensured by developing regulatory proposals that &#8220;optimise for effective collaboration and meaningful transparency between three core groups: companies, regulators and civil society&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here the call is for &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">co-regulatory oversight grounded in regional and global norms&#8221;, as they put it, to ensure Europe&#8217;s rebooted digital rules are &#8220;effective, durable, and protective of individuals’ rights&#8221;.  </span></p>
<p>The joint push for collaboration that includes civic society contrasts with Google&#8217;s public response to the Commission&#8217;s DSA/DMA consultation &#8212; which mostly focused on trying to lobby against ex ante rules for gatekeepers (like Google will surely be designated).</p>
<p>Though on liability for illegal content front the tech giant also lobbied for clear delineating lines between how illegal material must be handled and what’s “lawful-but-harmful.”</p>
<p>The full official detail of the DSA and DMA proposals are expected next week.</p>
<p>A Commission spokesperson declined to comment on the specific positions set out by Twitter et al today, adding that the regulatory proposals will be unveiled &#8220;soon&#8221;. (<a href="https://twitter.com/vestager/status/1334186227327700992">December 15 is the slated date</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/europe-to-put-forward-rules-for-political-ads-transparency-and-beef-up-its-disinformation-code-next-year/">Last week</a> &#8212; setting out the bloc&#8217;s strategy towards handling politically charged information and disinformation online &#8212; values and transparency commissioner, Vera Jourova, confirmed the forthcoming DSA will not set specific rules for the removal of &#8220;disputed content&#8221;.</p>
<p>Instead, she said there will be a beefed up code of practice for tackling disinformation &#8212; extending the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/26/tech-and-ad-giants-sign-up-to-europes-first-weak-bite-at-fake-news/">current voluntary arrangement</a> with additional requirements. She said these will include algorithmic accountability and better standards for platforms to cooperate with third-party fact-checkers. Tackling bots and fake accounts and clear rules for researchers to access data are also on the (non-legally-binding) cards.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not want to create a ministry of truth. Freedom of speech is essential and I will not support any solution that undermines it,&#8221; said Jourova. &#8220;But we also cannot have our societies manipulated if there are organized structures aimed at sewing mistrust, undermining democratic stability and so we would be naive to let this happen. And we need to respond with resolve.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Nutanix.com">Nutanix</a> announced today that it was bringing in former VMware executive Rajiv Ramaswami as president and CEO. Ramaswami replaces co-founderr Dheeraj Pandey, who previously announced his plans to retire in August.</p>
<p>The new CEO brings 30 years of industry experience to the position including stints with Broadcom, Cisco, Nortel and IBM &#8212; in addition to his most recent gig at VMware as Chief Operating Officer of Products and Cloud Services at VMware.</p>
<p>At his position at VMware, Ramaswami had the opportunity to see <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nutanix" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nutanix">Nutanix <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> up close as a key competitor, and he now has the opportunity to lead the company into its next phase. &#8220;I have long admired Nutanix as a formidable competitor, a pioneer in hyperconverged infrastructure solutions and a leader in cloud software,&#8221; he said in a statement. He hopes to build on his industry knowledge to continue growing the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nutanix up 131% on first day of trading&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/30/nutanix-up-131-on-first-day-of-trading/embed/#?secret=fOsHgRWVEf" data-secret="fOsHgRWVEf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Sohaib Abbasi, lead independent director of Nutanix says that as a candidate, Ramaswami&#8217;s experience really stood out. &#8220;Rajiv distinguished himself among the CEO candidates with his rare combination of operational discipline, business acumen, technology vision and inclusive leadership skills,&#8221; he said in statement.</p>
<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research says the hiring makes a lot of sense as VMware is quickly becoming the company&#8217;s primary competitor. &#8220;Nutanix and VMware want to be the same in the future &#8212; the virtualization and workload portability Switzerland across cloud and on premise compute infrastructures,&#8221; he told me.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, it allows Nutanix to grab a talented executive. &#8220;So hiring Ramaswami brings both an expert for multi-cloud to the Nutanix helm, as well as weakening a key competitor from a talent perspective,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Nutanix was founded in 2009. It raised over $600 million from firms like Khosla Ventures, Lightspeed Ventures, Sapphire Ventures, Fidelity and Wellington Management, according to Crunchbase data. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/30/nutanix-up-131-on-first-day-of-trading/">company went public in 2016</a>. Investors seem pleased by the announcement with the company stock price up 1.29% as of publication.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sweden’s <a href="https://www.mtg.com">MTG</a> is making a significant acquisition in the mobile gaming industry. The company is acquiring <a href="https://www.hutch.io">Hutch Games</a>, the London-based game studio behind popular mobile racing games, such as Rebel Racing, F1 Manager and Top Drives.</p>
<p>The acquisition is an important one for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/mtg-4de8" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="mtg-4de8">MTG <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as the company is spending $275 million right away and setting aside another $100 million for performance-based payments.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with MTG, you probably know its portfolio companies. Over the past few years, MTG has acquired ESL and DreamHack to become an esports leader.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>MTG has also acquired InnoGames and Kongregate for their popular web-based and mobile games. And it sounds like MTG isn’t done just yet as the company plans to acquire more companies in the near future.</p>
<p>MTG explains why the acquisition makes sense in its <a href="https://www.mtg.com/press-releases/mtg-acquires-hutch-a-leading-developer-and-publisher-of-mobile-racing-games/">announcement</a>. Hutch Games isn’t focused on a single game. It has built a portfolio of successful games, which is always a good sign for future growth.</p>
<p>The game studio has also licensed some well-known brands, such as F1. And MTG believes that F1 Manager, Top Drives and Rebel Racing still have a lot of growth potential. Free-to-play mobile games have become games as a service, so you want to keep them popular over the long run.</p>
<p>When it comes to long-term potential, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hutch" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hutch">Hutch <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Games also has more games in the pipeline for 2021 and 2022. Finally, it’s a cost-effective studio as most employees are developers.</p>
<p>During the first nine months of 2020, Hutch Games generated $56.3 million in revenue and $13.3 million in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). Hutch Games investors included Backed VC, Index Ventures, Initial Capital and angel investor Chris Lee.</p>
<p>As you can see, free-to-play games can be lucrative. That’s why there will be some consolidation in the future. Some companies will use their deep pockets or take advantage of debt to build out big portfolios and the real estate of your home screen, one game at a time.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/powerplatform/2020/12/09/automating-automation-with-rpa-and-process-mining-available-for-power-automate/">real news</a> today, though, is that the team is also launching a new tool, the Process Advisor, which is now in preview as part of the Power Automate platform. This new process mining tool provides users with a new collaborative environment where developers and business users can work together to create new automations.</p>
<p>The idea here is that business users are the ones who know exactly how a certain process works. With Process Advisor, they can now submit recordings of how they process a refund, for example, and then submit that to the developers, who are typically not experts in how these processes usually work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What&#8217;s maybe just as important is that a system like this can identify bottlenecks in existing processes where automation can help speed up existing workflows.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2084822" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-3.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084822" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2084822" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-3.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-3.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-3.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-3.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-3.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-3.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-3.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-3.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2084822" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;This goes back to one of the things that we always talk about for Power Platform, which, it&#8217;s a corny thing, but it&#8217;s that development is a team sport,&#8221; Charles Lamanna, Microsoft&#8217;s corporate VP for its Low Code Application Platform, told me. &#8220;That&#8217;s one of our big focuses: how do bring people to collaborate and work together who normally don&#8217;t. This is great because it actually brings together the business users who live the process each and every day with a specialist who can build the robot and do the automation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The way this works in the backend is that Power Automate&#8217;s tools capture exactly what the users do and click on. All this information is then uploaded to the cloud and &#8212; with just five or six recordings &#8212; Power Automate&#8217;s systems can map how the process works. For more complex workflows, or those that have a lot of branches for different edge cases, you likely want more recordings to build out these processes, though.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2084823" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084823" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2084823" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PA_Image-2.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2084823" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>As Lamanna noted, building out these workflows and process maps can also help businesses better understand the ROI of these automations. &#8220;This kind of map is great to go build an automation on top of it, but it&#8217;s also great because it helps you capture the ROI of each automation you do because you&#8217;ll know for each step, how long it took you,&#8221; Lamanna said. &#8220;We think that this concept of Process Advisor is probably going to be one of the most important engines of adoption for all these low-code/no-code technologies that are coming out. Basically, it can help guide you to where it&#8217;s worth spending the energy, where it&#8217;s worth training people, where it&#8217;s worth building an app, or using AI, or building a robot with our RPA like Power Automate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lamanna likened this to the advent of digital advertising, which for the first time helped marketers quantify the ROI of advertising.</p>
<p>The new process mining capabilities in Power Automate are now available in preview.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The coronavirus outbreak, elections, and Zoom meetings were on U.S. consumers minds&#8217; this year, according to Google&#8217;s list of the <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2020/US/">U.S. top trending searches in 2020</a>, released this morning. These search trends don&#8217;t reflect the most-searched for words and phrases across Google, but rather those that saw high spikes in traffic over a sustained period of time during the year, as compared with 2019. This paints a more accurate picture of consumers&#8217; changing interests during the year, than Google&#8217;s top searches would.</p>
<p>The lists of <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2020/GLOBAL/">top Global search trends</a> had a similar set of results.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Election Results was the No. 1 top trending search, followed by Coronavirus.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The PlayStation 5, Zoom and the names of several celebrities we tragically lost in 2020 also made the list.</p>
<p>In order, the top trending searches of 2020 were: Election results, Coronavirus, Kobe Bryant, Coronavirus update, Coronavirus symptoms, Zoom, who is winning the election, Chadwick Boseman, and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>The top trending News searches reflected similar trends, with Elections, the pandemic, and other related impacts making the list. There was a lot of bad news in 2020, including natural disasters and the largest stock market crash since 1929 (the Coronavirus Crash), which made the list, too.</p>
<p>In order, the top trending News searches were: Election results, Coronavirus, Stimulus checks, Unemployment, Iran, Hurricane Laura, Super Tuesday, Stock Market, Murder hornet, and Australia fires.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s year-end search trends also highlighted top people, actors, politicians, athletes, musicians and losses of the year, with the U.S. No. 1&#8217;s going to Joe Biden (top people search trend and politician search trend), Tom Hanks (who got COVID in 2020), Ryan Newman, Shakira, and Kobe Bryant.</p>
<p>The year-end review also broke out other topics, <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/sweet-streams-2020s-top-trending-tv-shows-and-movies/">like top trending</a> TV shows, sports teams, songs, movies, games, and more.</p>
<p>The No.1&#8217;s across these lists, in order, included the Netflix viral hit, &#8220;Tiger King,&#8221; the Boston Celtics, &#8220;WAP,&#8221; &#8220;Parasite,&#8221; and Among Us.</p>
<p><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2020/GLOBAL/">Globally</a>, many of the top trends remained the same, with Coronavirus, Election results, Kobe Bryant, Zoom and IPL as top search trends. Meanwhile, the Coronavirus, Election results, Iran, Beirut, and Hantavirus were top trending News searches.</p>
<p>There were other similarities across subtopics, too, like No. 1&#8217;s which included Tom Hanks, Ryan Newman, Among Us, WAP, Parasite, Joe Biden, &#8220;Tiger King,&#8221; and more.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/rokGy0huYEA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Beyond the terms themselves, Google says there were <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/2020-year-in-search/?">other apparent trends</a> that emerged from its data. This year, people continued to use Google to ask &#8220;why&#8221; to learn about the world. Although, this year, many of our &#8220;why&#8217;s&#8221; were related to COVID &#8212; like where to buy toilet paper, face masks, and hand sanitizer and top &#8220;where to buy&#8221; search trends. We also looked for nearby places like covid testing and early voting centers, as well as protests in our &#8220;Near Me&#8221; searches.</p>
<p>And, despite everything, people remained optimistic as Google users searched for ways to spend time in coronavirus lockdowns. Searches for &#8220;sourdough bread recipe&#8221; hit an all-time high, for example. Other popular food searches included whipped coffee (thanks TikTok!), Disney churro, Dole whip and others. Top trends in &#8220;how to&#8221; searches reflected a world <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/2020-lifestyle-trends">where we learned to stay at home, doing things for ourselves</a> &#8212; like how to cut hair, or cut bangs, or color hair at home, as well as work from home, take virtual field trips, go on virtual dates, and more.</p>
<p>Searches for Black Lives Matter increased five-fold over 2019, as well.</p>
<p>These searches and those for other supported markets can be <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2020/GLOBAL/">viewed on Google Trends</a>.</p>

<p>But while the new, higher valuations and strong cash hauls from their respective IPOs are great news, they each have a higher bar to cross when they begin to trade later today and over the next few weeks as the market settles on their real value.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start by calculating new valuations and revenue multiples. This will be fun!</p>
<h2>How to keep winning</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s kick off with DoorDash, the larger of the two IPOs.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/doordash-amps-its-ipo-range-ahead-of-blockbuster-ipo/">raising its IPO range from $75 to $85 per share</a>, a price point that already appraised the company far above its final private valuation, DoorDash raised its range to $90 to $95 per share. Then <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/73879/DoorDash-prices-IPO-at-$102-well-above-the-upwardly-revised-range">it priced at $102</a>.</p>
<p>The company has a nondiluted valuation of $32.4 billion at that price, a figure that <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/73879/DoorDash-prices-IPO-at-$102-well-above-the-upwardly-revised-range">rises as high as $38.4 billion</a> if you include shares that currently exist as unexercised options and the like. For a company worth just $16 billion earlier this summer, its IPO price is a coup.</p>
<p>Given DoorDash&#8217;s huge consumer brand, the recent IPO climate, a possibly limited first-day float and the impact of a retail-investing boom, its shares may soar today.</p>
<p>But to defend its new valuation, pop or not, DoorDash has a steep road ahead of it. Investors have valued the firm as if it will not only defend its 2020 growth, but that it will continue to accrete new revenues even as the pandemic subsides as vaccines roll out in 2021.</p>
<p>Recall that COVID-19 took an already-growing DoorDash, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/how-covid-19-accelerated-doordashs-business/">accelerated its revenue growth</a> and helped it drive operating leverage against its new scale. The company&#8217;s economics seem to improve with scale, a good thing, but one that might worry the more ursine amongst us if one expects consumers to order less food when it&#8217;s safer to go outside.</p>
<p>DoorDash is not the only COVID-accelerated company to receive a shiny, new, larger valuation during the pandemic. Robinhood and Instacart are further examples of the trend.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At a time when more companies are building machine learning models, <a href="http://Arthur.ai">Arthur.ai</a> wants to help by ensuring the model accuracy doesn&#8217;t begin slipping over time, thereby losing its ability to precisely measure what it was supposed to. As demand for this type of tool has increased this year, in spite of the pandemic, the startup announced a $15 million Series A today.</p>
<p>The investment was led by Index Ventures with help from newcomers Acrew and Plexo Capital, along with previous investors Homebrew, AME Ventures and Work-Bench. The round comes almost exactly a year after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/11/arthur-announces-3-3m-seed-to-monitor-machine-learning-model-performance/">$3.3 million seed round</a>.</p>
<p>As CEO and co-founder Adam Wenchel explains, data scientists build and test machine learning models in the lab under ideal conditions, but as these models are put into production, the performance can begin to deteriorate under real-world scrutiny. Arthur.ai is designed to root out when that happens.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even as COVID has wreaked havoc throughout much of this year, the company has grown revenue 300% in the last six months smack dab in the middle of all that. &#8220;Over the course of 2020, we have begun to open up more and talk to [more] customers. And so we are starting to get some really nice initial customer traction, both in traditional enterprises as well as digital tech companies,&#8221; Wenchel told me. With 15 customers, the company is finding that the solution is resonating with companies.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to note that AWS announced a similar tool yesterday at re:Invent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/aws-announces-sagemaker-clarify-to-help-reduce-bias-in-machine-learning-models/">called SageMaker Clarify</a>, but Wenchel sees this as more of a validation of what his startup has been trying to do, rather than an existential threat. &#8220;I think it helps create awareness, and because this is our 100% focus, our tools go well beyond what the major cloud providers provide,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Investor Mike Volpi from Index certainly sees the value proposition of this company. &#8220;One of the most critical aspects of the AI stack is in the area of performance monitoring and risk mitigation. Simply put, is the AI system behaving like it’s supposed to?&#8221; he wrote in a blog post announcing the funding.</p>

<p>When we spoke a year ago, the company had eight employees. Today it has 17 and it expects to double again by the end of next year. Wenchel says that as a company whose product looks for different types of bias, it&#8217;s especially important to have a diverse workforce. He says that starts with having a diverse investment team and board makeup, which he has been able to achieve, and goes from there.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve sponsored and work with groups that focus on both general sort of coding for different underrepresented groups as well as specifically AI, and that&#8217;s something that we&#8217;ll continue to do. And actually I think when we can get together for in-person events again, we will really go out there and support great organizations like AI for All and Black Girls Code,&#8221; he said. He believes that by working with these groups, it will give the startup a pipeline to underrepresented groups, which they can draw upon for hiring as the needs arise.</p>
<p>Wenchel says that when he can go back to the office, he wants to bring employees back, at least for part of the week for certain kinds of work that will benefit from being in the same space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://stufstorage.com/">Stuf</a>, a new startup transforming basements and other unused spaces into self-storage locations, is announcing that it has raised $1.8 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Katharine Lau previously led the real estate team at co-working company <a href="https://www.industriousoffice.com">Industrious</a>. She told me that she became interested in the self-storage industry during the early months of the pandemic, after a period of spring cleaning prompted her to put some of her belongings into storage.</p>
<p>Lau lives in New York City, where she said most self-storage locations are &#8220;way out in the West Side Highway or the East River, pretty far from where most people live.&#8221; She added that &#8220;at some of these traditional operations, it felt really sterile, with these fluorescent lights.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;They were designed like morgues,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You really don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s behind these doors.&#8221;</p>
<p>These may not be big issues for people who put their things into storage and then forget about them for months or years, but Lau said that it&#8217;s a bad fit for the modern customer, particularly millennial women living in cities.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;On-demand storage startup MakeSpace picks up another $55M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/on-demand-storage-startup-makespace-picks-up-another-55m/embed/#?secret=lyR6kfJxB9" data-secret="lyR6kfJxB9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Millennials tend to live more transient lifestyles and visit on a more frequent basis,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The storage facility becomes an extension of their home. It’s about much more than having a place to leave your stuff. It becomes a useful extension of your life.&#8221;</p>
<p>So <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/stuf" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="stuf">Stuf <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> looks for what Lau described as &#8220;the forgotten spaces that weren&#8217;t generating cash flow,&#8221; signing revenue-sharing deals with landlords and then converting the space. The startup can go from touring a site to opening up for storage in four to six weeks, she said.</p>
<p>The result is a self-storage location closer to where customers actually live. And Lau said the company pays close attention to interior design, aiming to create a &#8220;warm and inviting&#8221; environment that people enjoy visiting.</p>
<p>Other startups are trying to reinvent self-storage with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/on-demand-storage-startup-makespace-picks-up-another-55m/">a more on-demand approach</a>, where the company picks up your belongings for you. Lau said that&#8217;s a nice consumer experience, but it creates unit economics that are &#8220;quite challenging.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stuf&#8217;s pricing is currently &#8220;on par&#8221; with traditional self-storage, she said, and because &#8220;we don’t buy the buildings or sign [a traditional lease], there are some savings we plan to pass on to customers as we grow.&#8221; (When I looked at listings for Stuf&#8217;s Brooklyn location this morning, pricing ranged from $172.51 per month for a 10&#215;6 foot space to $43 for a 5&#215;3 space.)</p>
<p>The startup already has three locations in San Francisco and New York. And it&#8217;s seeing real consumer demand, with its initial spaces filled to 90% capacity within three months.</p>
<p>The seed funding was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wilshire-lane-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wilshire-lane-partners">Wilshire Lane Partners <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Harlem Capital, allowing Stuf to continue opening new locations nationwide. Lau&#8217;s goal is to launch more than 100,000 square feet of storage space in 2021.</p>
<p>“Stuf is truly special because, business opportunity aside, two Black-led VC funds came together to invest in a business founded and run by a woman,“ said Harlem Capital Managing Partner Henri Pierre-Jacques in a statement. “Katharine stood out given her industry expertise, leadership and vision. We couldn’t be more excited to be on the journey with her as she looks to alter the storage industry.”</p>
