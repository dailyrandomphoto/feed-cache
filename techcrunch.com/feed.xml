										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://avepoint.com/">AvePoint</a>, a company that gives enterprises using Microsoft Office 365, SharePoint and Teams a control layer on top of these tools, announced today that it would be going public via a SPAC merger with <a href="https://apexacquisitioncorp.com/">Apex Technology Acquisition Corporation</a> in a deal that values AvePoint at around $2 billion.</p>
<p>The acquisition brings together some powerful technology executives with Apex run by former Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein and former Goldman Sachs head of technology investment banking Brad Koenig, who will now be working closely with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/avepoint" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="avepoint">AvePoint&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO Tianyi Jiang. <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1777921/000121390019018376/f424b4091719_apextech.htm">Apex filed for a $305 million SPAC</a> in September 2019.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the transaction, Apex’s balance of $352 million plus a $140 million additional private investment will be handed over to AvePoint. Once transaction fees and other considerations are paid for, AvePoint is expected to have $252 million on its balance sheet. Existing AvePoint shareholders will own approximately 72% of the combined entity, with the balance held by the Apex SPAC and the private investment owners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jiang sees this is a way to keep growing the company. &#8220;Going public now gives us the ability to meet this demand and scale up faster across product innovation, channel marketing, international markets and customer success initiatives,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>AvePoint was founded in 2001 as a company to help ease the complexity of SharePoint installations, which at the time were all on-premise. Today, it has adapted to the shift to the cloud as a SaaS tool and primarily acts as a policy layer enabling companies to make sure employees are using these tools in a compliant way.</p>

<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/avepoint-grabs-200m-series-c-for-microsoft-cloud-governance-tools/">raised $200 million in January</a> this year led by TPG Sixth Street Partners, with additional participation from prior investor Goldman Sachs, meaning that Koenig was probably familiar with the company based on his previous role.</p>
<p>The company has raised a total of $294 million in capital before today’s announcement. It expects to generate almost $150 million in revenue by the end of this year with ARR growing at over 30%. It&#8217;s worth noting that the company&#8217;s ARR and revenue has been growing steadily since Q12019. The company is projecting significant growth for the next two years with revenue estimates of $257 million and ARR of $220 million by the end of 2022.</p>

<p>The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of next year. Upon close the company will continue to be known as AvePoint and be publicly traded on NASDAQ under the new ticker symbol AVPT.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.curehydration.com/">Cure Hydration</a> is announcing that it has raised $2.6 million in seed funding as it brings a healthier approach to the sports beverage market.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO Lauren Picasso, whose past roles include serving as director of marketing at Jet.com, told me that she became interested in the market after training for a triathlon; she&#8217;d often feel dehydrated even after drinking lots of water. (This is also something I struggled with while training for a marathon last year — and yes, I&#8217;m only mentioning this because I really want you to know that I ran a marathon.)</p>
<p>The obvious solution was to drink Gatorade or something similar to replenish her electrolytes, but Picasso said, &#8220;When I started looking for electrolyte products that were healthy and effective, I realized everything on the market still uses a base of sugar.&#8221; In fact the average sports drink contains <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/is-gatorade-bad-for-you#cons-of-gatorade">36 grams of sugar</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So Picasso and the Cure team developed a new beverage <a href="https://www.curehydration.com/pages/why-cure">based on the World Health Organization&#8217;s Oral Rehydration Solution</a>, which Picasso said is &#8220;primarily used to help people suffering from diseases like cholera,&#8221; and which has saved &#8220;millions of lives and is proven to hydrate as effectively as an IV drip.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cure uses the ORS as a foundation to create a range of flavored beverages (it&#8217;s adding the new flavors Ruby Riot Grapefruit and Laser Focus Matcha). The core ingredients include coconut water and pink Himalayan salt, while everything is organic and vegan, with no added sugars.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2077457" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077457" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2077457" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Cure Hydration" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077457" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cure-hydration" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cure-hydration">Cure Hydration</p></div></p> <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>
<p>The startup sells these drinks in the form of powders that you mix with water. On its website, they cost $24.99 for a pack of 14, or $19.99 of you subscribe. (The company donates 1% of proceeds to the women&#8217;s sports nonprofit <a href="https://www.sheissport.com">SheIS</a>.) Picasso said early customers have tended to be amateur athletes and people who need help staying hydrated due to chronic illnesses and other health conditions.</p>
<p>The product is also rolling out in stores like CVS, Walmart and Whole Foods. Picasso said that one of her goals with the funding is to bring Cure to 4,200 retail locations across the United States.</p>
<p>She also plans to develop new products beyond hydration, though she said they will stay true to the company&#8217;s &#8220;guiding principles&#8221; that all its products are &#8220;backed by science&#8221; and &#8220;taste delicious.&#8221; The company has a medical advisory board that includes Dr. Roshini Rajapaksa, a gastroenterologist; Dr. Dana Cohen, the author of &#8220;Quench&#8221;; and nutritionist Brooke Alpert, author of &#8220;The Sugar Detox.&#8221;</p>
<p>The round was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lerer-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lerer-ventures">Lerer Hippeau, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from M3 Ventures, Litani Ventures, Andy Roddick, Nas, Matthew Dellavedova, Casper CEO Philip Krim, mParticle CEO Michael Katz, Thrive Market CEO Nick Green and others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, more than ever, consumers are prioritizing health in their daily lives and looking for products that are not only effective, but better-for-you,&#8221; said Lerer Hippeau Principal Caitlin Strandberg in a statement. &#8220;Lauren is an exceptional operator and we&#8217;ve been impressed with her ability to bring a WHO-approved formulation to market without compromising on product quality or efficacy. With this cash infusion and retail expansion, we&#8217;re excited to see Cure get into even more hands.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://joinblvd.com">Boulevard</a>, a spa management and payment platform, has raised $27 million in a new round of funding despite a business slowdown caused by the COVID0-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Founded four years ago by Matt Danna and Sean Stavropoulos, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/boulevard-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="boulevard-3">Boulevard <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was inspired by Stavropoulos&#8217; inability to book a haircut and Danna&#8217;s hunch that the inability of salons and spas to cater to customers like the busy programmer could be indicative of a bigger problem.</p>
<p>The two spent months pounding the pavement in Los Angeles pretending to be college students doing research on the industry. They spoke with salon owners in Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and other trendy neighborhoods trying to get a sense of where software and services were falling short.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Through those months of interviews the two developed the booking management and payment platform that would become Boulevard. The inspiration was one part Shopify and one part ServiceTitan, Danna said.</p>
<p>The idea was that the Boulevard could build a pretty large business catering to the needs of a niche industry that hadn&#8217;t traditionally been exposed to a purpose-built toolkit for its vertical.</p>
<p>Investors including Index Ventures, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/toba-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="toba-capital">Toba Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> VMG Partners, Bonfire Ventures, Ludlow Ventures and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/boxgroup" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="boxgroup">BoxGroup <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> agreed.</p>
<p>That could be because of the size of the industry. There&#8217;s over $250 billion spent per year across roughly 3 million businesses in the salon and spa category, according to data provided by the company. By comparison, fitness attracts roughly $34 billion in annual spending from 150,000 businesses.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With limited access to the professionals that help us look and feel our best, I think the world has realized something that our team has always recognized: salons and spas are more than a luxury, they are essential to our well-being,” said Danna, in a statement. “We are humbled that so many businesses are placing their trust in us during such a turbulent time. This new capital will help accelerate our mission and deliver value to salons and spas that they never imagined was possible from technology.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data provided by the company, Boulevard is definitely giving businesses a boost. On average, businesses increase bookings by 16%, retail revenue jumps by 18%, and gratuity paid out to stylists jumps by 24% for businesses that use Boulevard, the company said. It also reduces no-shows and cancellations, and halves time spent on the phone. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Boulevard is revitalizing the salon and spa industry, as evidenced by the company’s sustained 300-400% revenue growth over the last three years,” said Damir Becirovic of Index Ventures, whose firm led the company&#8217;s Series A round and has doubled down with the new capital infusion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers using the company&#8217;s software</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> include: Chris McMillan the Salon, Heyday, MèCHE Salon, Paintbox, Sassoon Salon, SEV Laser, Spoke &amp; Weal, and TONI&amp;GUY.</span></p>
<p>Boulevard now has 90 employees and will look to increase that number as it continues to expand across the country.</p>
<p>Investors have taken a run at the spa market in the past, with company&#8217;s like MindBody valued at over $1 billion for its software services. Indeed, that company <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mindbody-m-a-vista-equity-partners/vista-equity-partners-to-buy-mindbody-in-a-1-9-billion-deal-idUSKCN1ON0QG">was taken private two years ago</a> in a $1.9 billion transaction by Vista Equity Partners.</p>
<p>As Boulevard expands, the company may look to get deeper into financial services for the salons and spas that it&#8217;s already working with. Given the company&#8217;s window into these businesses&#8217; financing, it&#8217;s not impossible to image a new line of business providing small business loans to these companies.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s something that the founders would likely not rule out. And it&#8217;s a way to provide more tools to entrepreneurs that often fall outside of the traditional sweet spot for banks and other lenders, Danna said.</p>

<p>COVID-19 has obliterated entire business models, while boosting others. Micromobility startups were some that suffered in the early days of the pandemic. However, there appears to be a recovery. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/limebike" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="limebike">Lime <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is the latest example.</p>
<p>Lime said this week it has moved beyond the financial hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, is now largely profitable. Alex Wilhelm and I raised our eyebrows at this and asked for more detail. As you might know, there are all kinds of tricks to be able to claim profitability. What we learned from the company — and yes, reader I know, it&#8217;s a private company and therefore no public filing — was rosier than we expected.</p>
<p>Lime said it was both operating cash flow positive and free cash flow positive in the third quarter &#8212; a first &#8212; and is on pace to be full-year profitable, excluding certain costs (EBIT), in 2021. In general, cash flow positivity is an important threshold for a startup to reach because it implies that the company can largely self-fund from that point forward, limiting its dependency on external cash for survival.</p>
<p>Lime also claimed that it &#8220;reached EBIT positive at the company level over the summer.&#8221; The specifics of the phrase &#8220;EBIT positive&#8221; are important. Was the company employing strict EBIT on its math and not discounting share-based compensation, or was it measuring using adjusted EBIT as many startups do, removing the cost of share-based compensation that shows up in GAAP results? According to the company the number did exclude share-based compensation, making the news slightly smaller.</p>
<p>And finally, the last most bullish data point. The company said it expects to be full-year profitable in 2021. TechCrunch asked for specifics because again how one measures profitability matters. It turns out, Lime is basing this projection on EBIT, as opposed to more traditional net income. For a startup this is not a surprising decision, but before we declare Lime fully &#8220;profitable,&#8221; we&#8217;ll want some more GAAP metrics.</p>
<p><strong>In other Lime news &#8230;</strong></p>
<p>The company launched its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/lime-plans-for-modes-beyond-bikes-and-scooters-in-2021/">fourth-generation scooter</a> in Paris, a device designed to last more than two years. The Gen4 will roll out across Europe in early 2021. Much of the Gen4 work was done by engineers at Uber’s Jump micromobility unit. Lime did some tweaking to the Jump team&#8217;s work, specifically improving the scooter&#8217;s durability and swapped out some parts that would allow the company to reuse parts from existing Lime vehicles.</p>
<p>Lime also teased that a &#8220;third mode,&#8221; beyond bikes and scooters, is also in the works for the first quarter of 2021, as well as the addition of third-party companies to its platform.</p>
<hr />
<p>I recommend that you take the time to read an article by two of TechCrunch&#8217;s European reporters Natasha Lomas and Romain Dillet. The pair examined the urban transformation that is underway in Paris, Barcelona, London and Milan, specifically policy decisions aimed reclaiming streets for feet and two wheels.</p>
<p>A few highlights include Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo&#8217;s efforts to create a &#8220;15-minute city&#8221; and Barcelona&#8217;s ambitious pedestrianization plan focused on creating ‘superilles’ or ‘superblocks.’</p>
<p>Grab a coffee and get comfortable for this detailed breakdown.</p>

<p><strong>Oh! wait &#8230; a couple of other micromobbin&#8217; items &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voi</strong>, another European electric scooter startup, is equipping its devices with computer vision sensors to detect pedestrians and sidewalks. The aim, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/11/11/escooter-startup-voi-uses-ai-to-detect-pedestrians-and-sidewalks/">VentureBeat reports</a>, is to help users avoid collisions and comply with local legal requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Zipp Mobility</strong>, the Irish micromobility startup, is now operating in two Buckinghamshire towns under a year-long pilot program. The company will launch with 25 electric scooters in each area, with plans to increase the fleet size to 300 scooters over the next two months.</p>
<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>The summer of the SPAC has spilled over into fall and is threatening to continue into 2021. Startups aiming to produce and sell electric vehicles seem to be particularly fond of this path to becoming a public company. We have Canoo, Fisker, Lordstown Motors, Hyliion, Nikola and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/arrival-becomes-latest-electric-vehicle-startup-to-test-the-public-markets-with-a-spac/">now Arrival</a>.</p>
<p>Arrival was an unknown UK startup that operated quietly for about five years until bursting on the public scene in January with a $110 million investment from Hyundai and Kia. It soon became one of the UK&#8217;s most valuable startups with a valuation of $3.4 billion.</p>
<p>Arrival&#8217;s aim is to produce electric vehicles that are competitive in price with traditional fossil fuel-powered vehicles and lower than other EVs. Arrival&#8217;s pitch is that its modular electric &#8220;skateboard&#8221; platform, which can be used on a range of different vehicle types, along with its use of microfactories are the key ingredients to its price competitive sauce. So far, the company has two vehicles — an electric van and bus. Production of its buses are expected to start in the fourth quarter 2021 and its vans in 2022.</p>
<p>OK, so the gist of the deal is this: Arrival agreed to merge with special purpose acquisition company CIIG Merger Corp. with a market valuation up to $5.4 billion. Arrival raised $400 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE, from investors that included Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, Wellington Management, BNP Paribas Asset Management Energy Transition Fund and funds managed by BlackRock. Arrival will have about $660 million in cash proceeds.</p>
<p>On a side note, the company was founded by Denis Sverdlov, who also created Roborace.</p>

<h3><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Electric Last Mile Solutions</strong>, a Michigan-based electric vehicle startup founded by former Accuride and Ford executive Jason Luo, is in talks to go public through a merger with Forum Merger III Corp., <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-18/electric-last-mile-said-to-be-in-merger-talks-with-forum-spac?sref=AwwRcx4b">Bloomberg reported</a>. The startup aims to produce mre than 100,000 vehicles a year at a plant in Indiana. Caveat: the terms are not finalized.</p>
<p><strong>Fenix</strong>, a new Abu Dhabi micromobility startup, raised $3.8 million in a seed round investment led by Israel-based venture firm Maniv Mobility. The deal is notable for a few reasons. Remember Circ? It&#8217;s the Middle East scooter company that Bird acquired and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/bird-shuts-down-circ-operations-in-middle-east-scraps-as-many-as-10000-scooters/">then shuttered in several cities</a>. The founders of Circ, Jaideep Dhanoa and IQ Sayed (who were also colleagues at Careem), started Fenix. Maniv Mobility founder and managing partner Michael Granoff told me this is the first Israeli VC to invest in a UAE-based tech company. Granoff is joining the Fenix board. &#8220;Aside from more momentum toward clean and practical urban mobility, I think it heralds an amazing new age of cooperation in the Middle East,&#8221; Granoff wrote me in an email touting the deal.</p>
<p><strong>Forto</strong>, a digital freight forwarder, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/digital-freight-forwarder-forto-raises-another-50m-in-round-led-by-inven-capital/">raised $50 million</a> in a funding round led by Inven Capital, a growth fund out of the Czech Republic. Additional investment came from Iris Capital as well as existing investors Rider Global, Northzone, Cherry Ventures, Unbound (Shravin Mittal) and the Italian venture fund H14.</p>
<p><strong>Gojek</strong>, the ride-hailing firm, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/indonesian-telecom-network-telkomsel-invests-150-million-in-gojek/">raised $150 million</a> from Indonesia&#8217;s biggest telecom network Telkomsel. This is being sold as a &#8220;strategic partnership,&#8221; and seems to expand upon the companies&#8217; existing relationship. Since 2018, Gojek and Telkomsel have maintained a deal to subsidize the cost of mobile data consumed by the ride-hailing firm&#8217;s driver partners.</p>
<p><strong>Lightning EMotors</strong>, a Colorado-based fleet electrification company, is in advanced talks to go public through a merger with blank-check firm GigCapital3 Inc., <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-19/lightning-emotors-said-in-talks-to-go-public-via-gigcapital3?sref=AwwRcx4b">Bloomberg reported</a>. There is still some ways to go on this deal, however. GigCapital3 is trying to raise about $100 million in new equity to support a transaction that would create a combined entity worth $700 million to $1 billion, including debt.</p>
<p><strong>Loadsmart</strong>, an on-demand digital freight platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/loadsmart-raises-90-million-to-further-consolidate-its-one-stop-freight-and-logistics-platform/">raised $90 million</a> in a Series C funding round co-led by funds under management by BlackRock and Chromo Invest. Strategic investor TFI International, a leader in the logistics space, also participated in this round. Maersk, a global oceanic shipping leader and one of Loadsmart&#8217;s strategic backers since its Series A round, also participated.</p>
<p><strong>Ride Vision</strong>, an Israeli startup building an AI-driven safety system to prevent motorcycle collisions,  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/ride-vision-raises-7m-for-its-ai-based-motorcycle-safety-system/">raised a $7 million</a> Series A round led by crowdsourcing platform OurCrowd. YL Ventures, Mobilion VC and motorcycle mirror manufacturer Metagal also participated in this round. The company has now raised a total of $10 million.</p>
<p><strong>Strava</strong>, the activity and fitness data-tracking platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/strava-raises-110-million-touts-growth-rate-of-2-million-new-users-per-month-in-2020/">raised $110 million</a> in new funding, in a Series F round led by TCV and Sequoia, and including participation by Dragoneer group, Madrone Capital Partners, Jackson Square Ventures and Go4it Capital.</p>
<h2>Election day mobility: scooters</h2>
<p>Spin, the micromobility subsidiary of Ford, sent me an interesting graphic and some data points about its ridership on Election Day.</p>
<p>Now, this is just one company&#8217;s data. We don&#8217;t want to get ahead of ourselves and make wild presumptions. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Think of this an interesting tidbit </span>on how <em>some </em>people were getting around November 3 and one company&#8217;s strategy to encourage ridership to the polls.</p>
<p>Spin recorded a 31.45% overall increase in ridership on Election Day from the previous Tuesday. The company offered a $10 discount for riders commuting to the polls November 3 under its SpinToVote campaign, which certainly helped push those ridership numbers higher. Spin said nearly 3,000 riders used the SpintoVote discount.</p>
<p>Cities with the highest increases in ridership on Election Day were Chicago with a whopping 243% rise, Cleveland with 193%, San Francisco with 25% and Atlanta with a10% increase. Spin also tracked use of its &#8220;Spin to Vote&#8221; campaign. Riders in Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Cleveland, San Diego and Washington D.C. had the highest opt in for that discounted ride campaign.</p>
<p>Update: Lime sent me some of their data, which they also <a href="https://www.li.me/second-street/lime-to-the-polls">posted in a blog</a>. The company said riders used the <em>Lime to the Polls</em> promotion code for 20% of all U.S. trips on Election Day. This is double the percentage of trips taken during the company&#8217;s first Lime to the Polls campaign for the 2018 midterm elections.</p>
<p><strong>How did you get to your polling location? (for those who didn&#8217;t mail in their ballot)</strong></p>

<h2>Notable reds and other tidbits</h2>
<p>Seriously, folks. So.much.news.</p>
<p><strong>California Public Utilities Commission</strong> approved Thursday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/robotaxi-companies-get-the-green-light-to-charge-for-rides-in-california/">two new programs</a> to allow permitted companies to provide and charge for shared rides in autonomous vehicles. While the industry mostly cheered the news, some have argued that the approval process to secure one of these permits adds unnecessary bureaucracy that could delay deployments by more than two years.</p>
<p><strong>General Motors</strong> had a bunch of announcements this week. First up, the company is getting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/gm-to-leverage-driver-data-as-it-jumps-back-into-the-insurance-business/">back into the insurance biz</a>, but this time more in step with the connected-car era. The service, called OnStar Insurance, aims to leverage the vast amounts of data captured through its OnStar connected car service, which today has more than 16 million members in the United States.</p>
<p>The U.S. automaker also upped its budget for electric vehicles and automated technology by 35%. GM said it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/gm-ups-electric-and-autonomous-vehicle-spending-to-27-billion-through-2025/">spend $27 billion</a> over the next five years on EVs and AVs. GM is also accelerating its go-to-market timeline and adding more EVs to its portfolio plans. The new plan is to bring 30 new electric vehicles to a global market through 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Lordstown Motors</strong> said it plans to establish an automotive R&amp;D center in Farmington Hills with support from the Michigan Strategic Fund, the Michigan Economic Development Corporation announced today. The project is expected to create 141 jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Luminar</strong> locked in a supplier deal to furnish Intel subsidiary Mobileye with lidar for its fleet of autonomous vehicles. The deal will see a rising star paired with a company that has long dominated the automotive industry. I breakdown why this is seemingly small deal is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/mobileye-taps-luminar-to-supply-lidar-for-its-robotaxi-fleet/">worth paying attention to</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Motional</strong>, the Aptiv-Hyundai $4 billion joint venture aimed at commercializing autonomous vehicles, received approval from the state of Nevada to test <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/motional-gets-approval-to-test-fully-driverless-vehicles-in-las-vegas/">fully driverless vehicles</a> on public roads. The company plans to begin driverless testing on public roads in Las Vegas sometime in early 2021.</p>
<p><strong>National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration</strong> officials released an advance notice of proposed rule-making for automated driving. Remember last week when I said rumor had it that U.S. regulators planned to make some moves that will affect the autonomous vehicle industry? Specifically, I noted that UL 4600, a standard created by Underwriters Laboratories that offers a guide for how to build the safety case for an AV design, is rumored to be the front runner.</p>
<p>Welp &#8230; the framework released this week includes a whole section for UL 4600. You can view the NHSTA Framework for Automated Driving <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ads_safety_principles_anprm_website_version.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NYT</strong> does a deep dive into the<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/business/car-stereos.html"> arms race in car stereos</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Panasonic </strong>signed a preliminary agreement with the Nordic energy company Equinor and engineering and industrial company Norsk Hydro to collaborate on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/panasonic-explores-a-european-battery-deal-with-norways-largest-energy-and-industrial-companies/">building a battery business</a> in Northern Europe. Ok, I know, it&#8217;s a &#8220;preliminary agreement.&#8221; This got my attention because of the battery supplier battle that between LG Chem and Panasonic. And as TechCrunch&#8217;s Jonathan Shieber notes: Panasonic&#8217;s push into Northern Europe alongside two big regional players in hydrocarbons and renewable energy is a sign of the potential that exists in the European market beyond automotive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Former Sequoia partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunamy/">Amy Sun</a>, who left the famed venture capital firm just months ago, has already raised $3.8 million for her new startup, Daylight Labs, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1832111/000183211120000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">SEC filings show</a>.</p>
<p>Daylight Labs will be creating a solution to help gig economy workers make more money, Sun hints to TechCrunch. Still in the early product development stages, the startup began during the pandemic when Sun noticed how many industries were “completely decimated” by the crisis.</p>
<p>“How can you leverage technology to create new ways for people to earn to make a living,” she said. “We’re innovating on the actual format and product.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There is no site or information available online about Daylight Labs, and Sun declined to comment on more specifics of the business, saying that the company is still iterating on its final product. What we do know, however, is that the company is a combination of all of Sun’s experiences in her career so far, from product management at Uber, to working on the Stories team at Facebook, to, most recently, investing in consumer companies on behalf of Sequoia Capital, which she joined in 2018.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2077446" style="width: 402px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077446" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2077446" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Headshot-2.jpg" alt="" width="392" height="294" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Headshot-2.jpg 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Headshot-2.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Headshot-2.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Headshot-2.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077446" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amy Sun</p></div></p>
<p>The Harvard grad started her career in product marketing at Microsoft, where she helped launch the Surface tablet. Sun then spent more than three years at Uber as a founding member of the ride-sharing companies growth marketing team, which included getting drivers to join the platform.</p>
<p>“Through that experience I got to build really strong relationships with drivers,” she said. “Seeing that you’re able to come into a city with a technology and people can start earning money, instantly &#8212; that’s really eye opening for me.” Notably, in California, the Uber and Lyft-backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/07/human-capital-the-gig-economy-in-a-post-prop-22-world/">Prop 22 bill passed,</a> which allows gig workers to remain classified as independent contractors instead of full-time workers.</p>
<p>At Facebook, Sun worked on the company’s Stories product as a product manager. It&#8217;s unclear how her experience with consumer cameras and AR will be used within Daylight Labs, but that will definitely be interesting to track. During her tenure, users of Facebook Stories swelled from 2 million to 100 million.</p>
<p>Most recently, Sun worked at Sequoia Capital as the first woman on the firm’s growth stage team. Her portfolio included Noom, Aurora, Glossier, and The Wing, although she says she has transitioned “most responsibilities” from her tenure, including board seats, to the rest of the Sequoia team.</p>
<p>As for why leave the firm so soon after joining, Sun simply said that starting a company has “always been a dream” since the beginning of her career.</p>
<p>Since leaving Sequoia, Sun has lived a “nomadic lifestyle” with time in San Francisco, Boston, North Carolina, and more recently, Austin, Texas. Daylight Labs is based out of Austin, and Sun joins troves of entrepreneurs who have been moving to the area <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/techs-great-migration-to-austin-tx/">for years. </a></p>
<p>More to come on Daylight Labs when Sun is ready to share.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Digital PR is an excellent strategy to pair with content marketing, especially if your goals include increasing your brand awareness and improving your backlink portfolio.</p>
<p>When you create excellent content and pitch it to writers, you not only get great media coverage, but you get the link back to your project and the authority that comes with being mentioned in a trusted publication.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://blog.frac.tl/earned-media">earned media</a> tactic is very effective — but it isn’t easy.</p>
<p>If you get any part of it wrong, your chances of success decrease dramatically. If you’ve run into roadblocks, make sure you’re not making any of these mistakes with your content or your pitching.</p>
<h2>1. It’s not newsworthy</h2>
<p>Sure, it’s easy to say the news only wants to cover material that is, well, news <em>worthy</em>.</p>
<p>But what does that actually mean?</p>
<p>For content marketers, it usually refers to three criteria: timeliness, relevance and significance.</p>
<p>But there’s a catch: Most content marketing programs don’t have journalists devoted to breaking news like actual media outlets do. So how can you create content that is truly newsworthy without the resources of a newsroom?</p>
<p><strong>By creating and analyzing your own data. </strong></p>
<p>If your brand provides a fresh data set or a new analysis of existing data, then you’re the sole owner of information, and you can offer it exclusively to publications. This makes your pitch much more interesting.</p>
<p>This tactic is a combination of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/earn-the-best-backlinks-with-high-quality-content-and-digital-pr/">original content marketing and digital PR</a>.</p>
<p>But the content can’t just be timely. It also has to be relevant to the writer you’re pitching and that writer’s audience. I’ll explain more on that in #4.</p>
<p>Finally, significance, which refers to the impact it has on the audience. When you think of local news, this is why they report on things like traffic jams and school closures: It directly affects the daily lives of the people watching and listening.</p>
<p>Alternatively, your data can be significant to writers covering specific beats. For example, for our client ZenBusiness, we surveyed Americans and asked what they thought about the government’s relief packages for COVID-19.</p>
<p>While ZenBusiness operates in the office/work niches, this new insight into American perspective was appealing to the political publication <a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/longevity/496509-americans-believe-paid-sick-leave-is-most-effective-in">The Hill</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2076370" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2076370" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2076370" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/newpollsfind.jpg" alt="zen business poll on sick leave" width="1024" height="412" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/newpollsfind.jpg 1178w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/newpollsfind.jpg?resize=150,60 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/newpollsfind.jpg?resize=300,121 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/newpollsfind.jpg?resize=768,309 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/newpollsfind.jpg?resize=680,274 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/newpollsfind.jpg?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2076370" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.frac.tl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fractl <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Significance is tough criteria from a brand perspective, but if you’re able to offer brand-new insights, it’s certainly not impossible.</p>
<h2>2. The significance isn’t clear</h2>
<p>Imagine a stranger handing you a book with a blank cover and saying, “Here, you’ll find this interesting.” Would you read the whole book?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has teamed up with Disney and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lucasfilm" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lucasfilm">Lucasfilm <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to bring the Star Wars streaming series &#8220;The Mandalorian&#8221; to augmented reality. The company <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/mandalorian-in-ar">announced</a> this morning the launch of a new Android AR app,  &#8220;<a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.mandalorian" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.mandalorian&quot;}">The Mandalorian&#8221; AR Experience</a>, which will display iconic moments from the first season of the show in AR, allowing fans to retrace the Mandalorian&#8217;s steps, find the Child, harness the Force, and more, according to the app&#8217;s Play Store description.</p>
<p>In the app, users will be able to follow the trail of Mando, Din Djarin and the Child, interact with the characters, and create scenes that can be shared with friends.</p>
<p>New AR content will be released for the app on Mondays, starting today Nov. 23 and continuing for nearly a year to wrap on Oct. 31, 2021. That makes this a longer-term promotion than some of the other Star Wars experiences Google has offered in the past.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2077410" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077410" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2077410" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/The_Mandalorian_AR_Experience.gif" alt="" width="800" height="448" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077410" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google/Lucasfilm</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the app itself takes advantage of Google&#8217;s developer platform for building augmented reality experiences, ARCore, in order to create scenes that interact with the user&#8217;s surroundings. This more immersive design means fans will be able to unlock additional effects based on their actions. The app also leverages Google&#8217;s new ARCore Depth API, which allows the app to enable occlusion. This makes the AR scenes blend more naturally with the environment that&#8217;s seen through the smartphone&#8217;s camera.</p>
<p>However, because the app is a showcase for Google&#8217;s latest AR technologies, it won&#8217;t work with all <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/android" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="android">Android <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> devices.</p>
<p>Google says the app will only support &#8220;compatible 5G Android devices,&#8221; which includes its 5G Google Pixel smartphones and other select 5G Android phones that have the <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/9462168">Google Play Services for AR</a> updated. You can check to see if your Android phone is supported on <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/mandalorian">a list provided on the Google Developers website</a>. Other phones may be supported in the future, the company also notes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2077411" style="width: 465px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077411" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2077411" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/The_Mandalorian_AR_Experience_BTS.gif" alt="" width="455" height="800" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077411" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong></p></div></p>
<p>While the experience requires a 5G-capable Android device, Google says that you don&#8217;t have to be on an active 5G connection to use the app. Instead, the requirement is more about the technologies these devices include and not the signal itself.</p>
<p>Google has teamed up with Lucasfilm many times over the past several years for promotional marketing campaigns. These are not typically considered ads, because they give both companies the opportunity to showcase their services or technologies. For example, Google allowed users to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/23/google-lets-you-give-its-apps-a-star-wars-makeover/">give its apps a Star Wars-themed makeover</a> back in 2015, which benefited its own services like Gmail, Maps, YouTube, Chrome and others. It has also introduced both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/11/googles-new-star-wars-ar-stickers-put-porgs-everywhere/">AR</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/18/googles-seurat-for-mobile-vr-means-you-can-finally-truly-step-into-star-wars/">VR</a> experiences featuring Star Wars content over the past several years.</p>
<p>The  &#8220;<a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.mandalorian" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.mandalorian&quot;}">The Mandalorian” AR Experience&#8221;</a> is a free download on the Play Store.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Several years ago <a href="https://serenade.ai/">Serenade</a> co-founder Matt Wiethoff was a developer at Quora when he was diagnosed with a severe repetitive stress injury to his hand and couldn&#8217;t code. He and co-founder Tommy MacWilliam decided to use AI to create a tool that let him speak the code instead and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/serenade" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="serenade">Serenade <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was born.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced a $2.1 million seed investment led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amplify-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amplify-partners">Amplify Partners <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Neo. While it was at it, the startup also announced the first commercial version of the product, Serenade Pro.</p>
<p>&#8220;Serenade is an app that you&#8217;ll download onto your computer. It will plug into your existing editors like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ, and then allows you to speak your code,&#8221; co-founder MacWilliam told me. At that point the startup&#8217;s AI engine takes over and translates what you say into syntactically correct code.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says that while there are a bunch of generalized speech-to-text engines out there, they hadn&#8217;t been able to find anything that was tuned specifically for the requirements of someone entering code. While it may seem that this would have a pretty narrow market focus, the co-founders see this use case as simply a starting point with developers using this kind of technology even when not injured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our vision is that this is just the future of programming. With machine learning, coding becomes faster and easier than ever before, and our AI eliminates a lot of the rote mechanical parts of programming. So rather than needing to remember keyboard shortcuts or syntax details of a language, you can just focus on expressing your idea naturally, and then our machine learning takes care of translating that into actual code for you,&#8221; MacWilliam explained.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="LKcoHNFXUT"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/21/google-clouds-speech-apis-gets-cheaper-and-learn-new-languages/">Google Cloud&#8217;s speech APIs get cheaper and learn new languages</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The startup has five employees today, but has plans to build the company to 15-20 in the next year fueled by the introduction of the commercial product and the new funding. As they build the company, MacWilliam says being diverse is a big part of that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our diversity strategy ranges throughout the process. I think it starts at the top of the funnel. We need to make sure that we&#8217;re going out and reaching great people &#8212; there are great people everywhere and it&#8217;s on us to find them and convince them why working at Serenade would be great,&#8221; he said. They are working with a variety of sources to find a diverse group of candidates that stretches beyond their own personal network, then looking at how they interview and judge candidates&#8217; skill sets with the goal of building a more diverse employee base.</p>
<p>The company sees itself as a way to move beyond the keyboard to speaking your code, and it intends to use this money to continue building the product, while building a community of dedicated users. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be thinking about how we can showcase the value of coding by voice, how we can put together demos and build a community of product champions showing that [it&#8217;s faster to code using your voice],&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.friday.app/">Friday</a>, an app looking to make remote work more efficient, has announced the close of a $2.1 million seed round led by Bessemer Venture Partners. Active Capital, Underscore, El Cap Holdings, TLC Collective, and New York Venture Partners also participated in the round, among others.</p>
<p>Founded by Luke Thomas, Friday sits on top of the tools that teams already use &mdash; Github, Trello, Asana, Slack, etc. &mdash; to surface information that workers need when they need it and keep them on top of what others in the organization are doing.</p>
<p>The platform offers a Daily Planner feature, so users can roadmap their day and share it with others, as well as a Work Routines feature, giving users the ability to customize and even automate routine updates. For example, weekly updates or daily standups done via Slack or Google Hangouts can be done via Friday app, eliminating the time spent by managers, or others, jotting down these updates or copying that info over from Slack.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Friday also lets users set goals across the organization or team so that users&#8217; daily and weekly work aligns with the broader OKRs of the company.</p>
<p>Plus, Friday users can track their time spent in meetings, as well as team morale and productivity, using the Analytics dashboard of the platform.</p>
<p>Friday has a free forever model, which allows individual users or even organizations to use the app for free for as long as they want. More advanced features like Goals, Analytics and the ability to see past three weeks of history within the app, are paywalled for a price of $6/seat/month.</p>
<p>Thomas says that one of the biggest challenges for Friday is that people automatically assume it&#8217;s competing with an Asana or Trello, as opposed to being a layer on top of these products that brings all that information into one place.</p>
<p>&#8220;The number one problem is that we&#8217;re in a noisy space,&#8221; said Thomas. &#8220;There are a lot of tools that are saying they&#8217;re a remote work tool when they&#8217;re really just a layer on top of Zoom or a video conferencing tool. There is certainly increased amount of interest in the space in a good and positive way, but it also means that we have to work harder to cut through the noise.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Friday team is small for now &mdash; four full-time staff members &mdash; and Thomas says that he plans to double the size of the team following the seed round. Thomas declined to share any information around the diversity breakdown of the team.</p>
<p>Following a beta launch at the beginning of 2020, Friday says it is used by employees at organizations such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Quizlet, Red Hat, and EA, among others.</p>
<p>This latest round brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $2.5 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://sleek.com/">Sleek</a>, the corporate services platform that helps entrepreneurs launch and run new companies in Singapore and Hong Kong, has raised $4 million.</p>
<p>The new funding was led by SEEDS Capital, the investment arm of government agency Enterprise Singapore. Returning investors MI8 Limited and Pierre Lorinet also participated, along with Singapore Fintech Association co-founder Varun Mittal as part of Sequoia Capital’s scout program.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sleek-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sleek-2">Sleek <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> co-founder and chief growth officer Adrien Barthel told TechCrunch that the funding is part of Sleek&#8217;s seed round and brings the startup’s total raised so far to $7 million. It will start raising a Series A next year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded three years ago by Barthel and Julien Labruyere, Sleek first began offering online corporate services, including company incorporation, compliance, digital accounting and tax filing, in Singapore before expanding into Hong Kong. Sleek now serves more than 3,000 companies, ranging from individual consultants to SMEs, startups and investment vehicles for funds, Barthel said.</p>
<p>Sleek is one of several cloud-based corporate services platforms focused on Singapore and/or Hong Kong, where regulations make it easier to incorporate companies and file taxes online, that have recently raised new venture capital funding. Others include Lanturn, Osome and Bluemeg. These startups were originally launched to reduce the amount of time and money spent on performing operational tasks, but the COVID-19 pandemic has increased demand for their services.</p>

<p>“We are happy to see other digital initiatives coming up around us,&#8221; Barthel told TechCrunch. &#8220;The market is wide enough for us to evolve on different positioning, and we’re only starting to see traditional firms looking at embracing the use of technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Sleek&#8217;s peers also offer secretarial, accounting and tax services, Barthel said his company&#8217;s vision &#8220;is to become the entrepreneur’s operating system, by going beyond that common service ground and building a range of services that are here to fit all entrepreneurs’ needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, it recently released an electronic signature app called SleekSign that has digitized 145,000 signatures so far, added payroll services and launched a corporate insurance desk. Barthel said more product releases are planned for the end of this year and the first quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>In addition to growing its roster of services for entrepreneurs, Sleek also plans to expand into new markets where regulations also mesh well with its digital services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our platform being common law friendly, we’re looking at such jurisdictions with attention, such as Australia, the United Kingdom and North America,&#8217; said Barthel. &#8220;We are also closely looking at a few regional markets in Southeast Asia where regulatory frameworks are evolving and accepting progressively the use of technology for governance management and accounting.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://metigy.com/">Metigy</a>, a marketing platform created to help small businesses automate more of the decision making in their online ad campaigns, has raised a Series B of $20 million AUD (about $14.6 million USD). The new funding, led by returning investor Cygnet Capital, will be used to grow the Sydney, Australia-based startup’s international customer base, especially in the United States and Southeast Asia. Other participants in the round included Regal Funds Management, OC Funds, Five V Venture Capital and Thorney, plus returning</p>
<p>Founded in 2015, Metigy is currently used by about 26,000 businesses and has channel partnerships with Google and Optus. About 44% of its customers are in Australia and New Zealand, while 26% are in Southeast Asia, and 22% are in the United States. The startup has raised AUD $27.1 million (about USD $19.9 million) in total.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Co-founder and chief executive officer David Fairfull told TechCrunch Metigy was created because &#8220;half of SMEs fail in the first two years and marketing is one of the top two reasons for this. It’s a global issue and a paradigm that can be changed by harnessing technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fairfull and other members of Metigy’s founding team previously worked at We Are Social, a global creative agency. While there, they &#8220;spotted an opportunity to give small businesses access to the same data and strategic insights&#8221; as larger marketing teams.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2077297" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CommandCentre2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077297" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2077297" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CommandCentre2.jpg" alt="Marketing platform Metigy's Command Center" width="1024" height="559" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CommandCentre2.jpg 3344w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CommandCentre2.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CommandCentre2.jpg?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CommandCentre2.jpg?resize=768,419 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CommandCentre2.jpg?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CommandCentre2.jpg?resize=1536,839 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CommandCentre2.jpg?resize=2048,1118 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CommandCentre2.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2077297" class="wp-caption-text">Marketing platform Metigy&#8217;s Command Center</p></div></p>
<p>Metigy’s platform gives more support to small or inexperienced marketing teams by using real-time data from their online advertising channels to create a livestream of recommendations. For example, it will tell marketing teams if they should start posting more content right away, use more hashtags or schedule more posts. The platforms also predicts what posts will result in the most conversions, helping companies decide how to spend their advertising budget.</p>
<p>For example, one of Metigy’s customers, parking app Share with Oscar, used Metigy to analyze what was trending on social media when members of the Royal Family visited Sydney. As a result, Fairfull said they were able to generate 2,700 customer engagements by spending about AUD $10 (about USD $7).</p>
<p>Other social marketing platforms like Hootsuite and Sprout Social are &#8220;essentially process solutions that help make the marketer more efficient,&#8221; said Fairfull. &#8220;However, if you don’t understand marketing, then all this process efficiency won’t help you gain results.&#8221;</p>
<p>Metigy is focusing on the United States and Southeast Asia because of the large number of SMEs there. By 2022, there is expected to be 30 million SMEs in the U.S. “On top of this, success in marketing technology is often benchmarked by success in the U.S., so expanding in this region adds credibility,” Fairfull added.</p>
<p>But in terms of volume, Southeast Asia offers a more promising market. “The real growth opportunity for us though is in Southeast Asia, where there is expected to be 150 million SMEs across the 11 markets by 2022,” Fairfull said. But the majority of them don’t have large marketing teams or access to the kind of ad technology that larger companies do. Companies in the region also tend to be more price sensitive, Fairfull added, so artificial intelligence and machine learning-based technology helps lower the cost of software like Metigy to an attractive price.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After taking on TikTok with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/snapchat-launches-its-tiktok-rival-sounds-on-snapchat/">music-powered features</a> last month, Snapchat this morning is officially launching a dedicated place within its app where users can watch short, entertaining videos in a vertically scrollable, TikTok-like feed. This new feature, called Spotlight, will showcase the community&#8217;s creative efforts, including the videos now backed by music, as well as other Snaps users may find interesting.</p>
<p>Snapchat says its algorithms will work to surface the most engaging Snaps to display to each user on a personalized basis.</p>
<p>To do so, it will rank the Snaps in the new feed using a combination of factors, like how many other people found a particular Snap interesting, how long people spent watching it, if it was favorited or shared with friends, and more. The algorithms will also consider negative factors, like if a viewer skipped watching the Snap quickly, for example. Over time, the feed will become tailored to the individual user based on their own interactions, preferences, and favorites. This is a similar system to what TikTok uses for its &#8220;For You&#8221; feed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2077252" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077252" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2077252" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Introducing-Spotlight.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Introducing-Spotlight.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Introducing-Spotlight.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Introducing-Spotlight.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Introducing-Spotlight.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Introducing-Spotlight.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Introducing-Spotlight.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Introducing-Spotlight.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077252" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snap</p></div></p>
<p>However, on TikTok, only users with public profiles can have their videos hit the &#8220;For You&#8221; feed. Spotlight, meanwhile, can feature Snaps from users with both private or public accounts. These Snaps can be sent to Spotlight directly or posted to <a href="https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/our-story">Our Story</a>. The company says the Snaps from the private accounts will be featured in an unattributed fashion &#8212; that is, no name will be attached to the content. There will also be no way to comment on these Snaps or message the creator, Snapchat explains.</p>
<p>Users who are over 18 can opt in to public profiles in order to have their names displayed, which allows them to build a following. But while this allows users to private and directly reply to the creators, there are no public comment mechanisms on Spotlight.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a different setup than on TikTok and gives Snapchat a way to avoid the much larger hassle of handling comment moderation.</p>
<p>The Spotlight feed itself, though, is moderated. The company says all Snaps that appear on the new feed will have to adhere to Snapchat&#8217;s <a href="https://www.snap.com/en-US/community-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.snap.com/en-US/community-guidelines&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1605992380996000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0zprstDqSZcYUHSFGdmx8e">Community Guidelines</a>, which prohibit the spread of false information (including conspiracy theories), misleading content, hate speech, explicit or profane content, bullying, harassment, violence, and other toxic content. The Snaps must also adhere to Snapchat&#8217;s new Spotlight Guidelines, <a href="https://www.snap.com/en-US/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.snap.com/en-US/terms&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1605992380996000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1YDXK-fi4cgvDr1lR5OtoZ">Terms of Service</a>, and <a href="https://www.snap.com/terms/spotlight-terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.snap.com/terms/spotlight-terms&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1605992380996000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1XWGZ7lTw0HVy5YqGT3EYv">Spotlight Terms</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2077253" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077253" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2077253" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Stories-Screen.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Stories-Screen.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Stories-Screen.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Stories-Screen.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Stories-Screen.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Stories-Screen.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Stories-Screen.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Stories-Screen.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077253" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snap</p></div></p>
<p>The Spotlight Guidelines specify what sort of content Snapchat wants, the format for the Snaps, and other rules. For example, they state the Snaps should be vertical videos with sound up to 60 seconds in length. They should also include a #topic hashtag and should make use of Snapchat&#8217;s <a href="https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/creative-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/creative-tools&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1605992380996000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2E45xEygdLUcjqNkTMzlU0">Creative Tools</a> like Captions, <a href="https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/news/sounds-news">Sounds</a>, Lenses or GIFs, if possible, The Snaps have to be appropriate for a 13+ audience, as well.</p>
<p>Captions are a new feature, designed for use in Spotlight. Also new is a continuous shooting mode for longer Snaps and the ability to trim singular Snaps.</p>
<p>The Snaps can also only use the licensed music from Snapchat&#8217;s own Sounds library and must feature original content, not content repurposed from somewhere else on the internet . That could limit accounts that repost internet memes, which tend draw large subscriber bases on rival platforms, like Instagram and TikTok.</p>
<p>In addition, Snaps in Spotlight won&#8217;t disappear from being surfaced in the feed unless the creator chooses to delete them.</p>
<p>Users will be alerted to the new Spotlight feature when they return to Snapchat following Monday&#8217;s launch. Afterward, they&#8217;ll be able to take Snaps as usual then choose whether they want to send them to their friends, to their Story, to Snap Map, or now to Spotlight.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2077250" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077250" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2077250" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Userflow.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077250" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snap</p></div></p>
<p>The feed itself will be accessible through a prominent new fifth tab on the Snapchat home screen&#8217;s main navigation, and is designated with a Play icon.</p>
<p>To encourage users to publish to Spotlight, the company will distribute over $1 million USD every day to Snapchat users (16 and up) who create the top Snaps on Spotlight. This will continue through the end of 2020. The earnings will be determined by Snapchat&#8217;s proprietary algorithm that rewards users based on the total number of unique views a Snap gets per day (calculated using Pacific Time), as compared with others on the platform.</p>
<p>The company says it expects many users to earn money from this fund each day, but those with the most views will earn more than others. It will also monitor this feed for fraud, it warns.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/snapchat-launches-its-tiktok-rival-sounds-on-snapchat/">the music licensing aspects already ironed out</a>, Snapchat is now looking to leverage the over 4 billion Snaps created by its users every day to power the new Spotlight feed. This move represents Snapchat&#8217;s biggest attempt at taking on TikTok to date &#8212; and one that it&#8217;s willing to kickstart with direct payments, too. That will likely encourage plenty of participation among Snapchat&#8217;s young user base, given they&#8217;re already using the app on a regular basis. And once posting to Spotlight becomes a habit, Snapchat could have a viable competitor on its hands, at least among the younger demographic that favors its app.</p>
<p>Its biggest disadvantage, of course, is that it has struggled to reach beyond its young user base. That&#8217;s something TikTok has done better with, by comparison. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-teens-follow-new-stars-senior-citizens-11605724082">The Wall St. Journal last week noted</a> that TikTok teens were often following accounts from senior citizens, for instance, and <a href="https://www.aarp.org/disrupt-aging/stories/info-2020/tiktok.html">the AARP had earlier reported</a> TikTok had attracted a middle-aged crowd, as well.</p>
<p>Snapchat says Spotlight is live today on both iOS and Android in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the U.K., Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and France, with more countries to come soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> push to phase out third party tracking cookies &#8212; aka its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">&#8216;Privacy Sandbox&#8217; initiative</a> &#8212; is facing a competition challenge in Europe. A coalition of digital marketing companies <a href="https://marketersforanopenweb.com/marketers-for-an-open-web-calls-on-uk-competition-and-market-authority-to-block-googles-privacy-sandbox/">announced</a> today that it&#8217;s filed a complaint with the UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), calling for the regulator to block implementation of the Sandbox.</p>
<p>The coalition wants Google&#8217;s phasing out of third party tracking cookies to be put on ice to prevent the Sandbox launching in early 2021 to give regulators time to devise or propose what it dubs &#8220;long term competitive remedies to mitigate [Google&#8217;s dominance]&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Our] letter is asking for the introduction of Privacy Sandbox to be delayed until such measures are put in place,&#8221; they write in a press release.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The group, which is badging itself as Marketers for an Open Web (MOW), says it&#8217;s comprised of &#8220;businesses in the online ecosystem who share a concern that Google is threatening the open web model that is vital to the functioning of a free and competitive media and online economy&#8221;.</p>
<p>A link on MOW&#8217;s website to a list of &#8220;members&#8221; was not functioning at the time of writing. But, per Companies House, the entity was incorporated on September 18, 2020 &#8212; listing James Roswell, CEO and co-founder of UK mobile marketing company, <a href="https://51degrees.com/about-us">51 Degrees</a>, as its sole director.</p>
<p>The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cma-2067" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cma-2067">CMA <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> confirmed to us that it&#8217;s received MOW&#8217;s complaint, adding that some of the coalition&#8217;s concerns reflect issues identified in a detailed review of the online ad market it published this summer.</p>
<p>However it has not yet taken a decision on whether or not to investigate.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can confirm we have received a complaint regarding Google raising certain concerns, some of which relate to those we identified in our online platforms and digital advertising market study,&#8221; said the CMA spokesperson. &#8220;We take the matters raised in the complaint very seriously, and will assess them carefully with a view to deciding whether to open a formal investigation under the Competition Act.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the urgency of the concerns requires us to intervene swiftly, we will also assess whether to impose interim measures to order the suspension of any suspected anti-competitive conduct pending the outcome of a full investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>In its final<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5efc57ed3a6f4023d242ed56/Final_report_1_July_2020_.pdf"> report</a> of the online ad market, the CMA concluded that the market power of Google and Facebook is now so great that a new regulatory approach &#8212; and a dedicated oversight body &#8212; is needed to address what it summarized as “wide ranging and self reinforcing” concerns.</p>
<p>Although the regulator chose not to take any enforcement action at that point &#8212; preferring to wait for the UK government to come forward with pro-competition legislation.</p>
<p>In its statement today, the CMA makes it clear it could still choose to act on related competition concerns if it feels an imperative to do so &#8212; including potentially blocking the launch of Privacy Sandbox to allow time for a full investigation &#8212; while it waits for legislators to come up with a regulatory framework. Though, again, it has not made any decisions yet.</p>

<p>Reached for a response to the MOW complaint, Google sent us this statement &#8212; attributed to a spokesperson:</p>
<blockquote><p>The ad-supported web is at risk if digital advertising practices don’t evolve to reflect people&#8217;s changing expectations around how data is collected and used. That’s why Google introduced the Privacy Sandbox, an <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-privacy/privacy-sandbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-privacy/privacy-sandbox&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606221350733000&amp;usg=AOvVaw323rCbj59yEZZCenWKAFse">open initiative</a> built in collaboration with the industry, to provide strong privacy for users while also supporting publishers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also commenting in a statement, MOW&#8217;s director Roswell said: “The concept of the open web is based on a decentralised, standards-based environment that is not under the control of any single commercial organisation.  This model is vital to the health of a free and independent media, to a competitive digital business environment and to the freedom and choice of all web users.  Privacy Sandbox creates new, Google-owned standards and is an irreversible step towards a Google-owned ‘walled garden’ web where they control how businesses and users interact online.”</p>
<p>The group&#8217;s complaint follows a similar one filed in France last month (via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/apple-advertisting-france-idUSL1N2HJ237">Reuters</a>) &#8212; albeit, in that case targeting privacy changes incoming to Apple&#8217;s smartphone platform that are also set to limit advertisers access to an iPhone-specific tracking ID that&#8217;s generated for that purpose (IDFA).</p>
<p>Apple has said the incoming changes &#8212; which it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/apple-delay-ios-14-privacy-ad-tracking/">recently delayed until early next year</a> &#8212; will give users &#8220;greater control over whether or not they want to allow apps to track them by linking their information with data from third parties for the purpose of advertising, or sharing their information with data brokers&#8221;. But four online ad associations &#8212; IAB France, MMAF, SRI and UDECAM &#8212; bringing the complaint to France&#8217;s competition regulator argue Apple is abusing its market power to distort competition.</p>
<p>The move by the online ad industry to get European competition regulators to delay Apple&#8217;s and Google&#8217;s privacy squeeze on third party ad tracking is taking place at the same time as industry players band together to try to accelerate development of their own replacement for tracking cookies &#8212; announcing a joint effort called <a href="https://www.ana.net/content/show/id/ResponsibleAddressableMedia">PRAM</a> (Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media) this summer to &#8220;advance and protect critical functionalities like customization and analytics for digital media and advertising, while safeguarding privacy and improving consumer experience&#8221;, as they put it.</p>
<p>The adtech industry now appears to be coalescing behind a cookie replacement proposal called <a href="https://www.thetradedesk.com/blog/identity-2020-the-future-of-addressable-digital-advertising">UnifiedOpen ID 2.0</a> (UID2).</p>
<p>A document detailing the proposal which had been posted to the public Internet &#8212; but was <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik/status/1329842628628770817">taken down after a privacy researcher drew attention to it</a> &#8212; suggests they want to put in place a centralized system for tracking Internet users that&#8217;s based on personal data such as an email address or phone number.</p>
<p>&#8220;UID2 is based on authenticated PII (e.g. email, phone) that can be created and managed by constituents across advertising ecosystem, including Advertisers, Publishers, DSPs, SSPs,&#8221; runs a short outline of the proposal in the paper, which is authored by two people from a Demand Side Platform called <a href="https://www.thetradedesk.com/blog/identity-2020-the-future-of-addressable-digital-advertising">The Trade Desk</a> that&#8217;s proposing to build the tech but then hand it off to an &#8220;independent and non-partial entity&#8221; to manage.</p>
<p>One component of the UID2 proposal consists of a &#8220;Unified ID Service&#8221; that it says would apply a salt and hash process to the PII to generate UID2 and encrypting that to create a UID2 Token, as well as provision login requests from publishers to access the token.</p>
<p>The other component is a user facing website that&#8217;s described as a &#8220;transparency &amp; consent service&#8221; &#8212; to handle user requests for data or UID2 logouts etc.</p>
<p>However the proposal by the online ad industry to centralize Internet users&#8217; identity by attaching it to hashed pieces of actual personal data &#8212; and with a self-regulating &#8220;Trusted Ads Ecosystem&#8221; slated to be controlling the mapping of PII to UID2 &#8212; seems unlikely to assuage the self-same privacy concerns fuelling the demise of tracking cookies in the first place (to put it mildly).</p>
<p>Trusting the mass surveillance industry to self regulate a centralized ID system for Internet users is for the birds.</p>
<p>But adtech players are clearly hoping they can buy themselves enough time to cobble together a self-serving cookie alternative &#8212; and sell it to regulators as a competition remedy. (Their parallel bet is they can buy off inactive privacy regulators with dubious claims of &#8216;transparency and consent&#8217;.)</p>
<p>So it will certainly be interesting to see whether the adtech industry succeeds in forcing competition regulators to stand in the way of platform-level privacy reforms, while pulling off a major reorg and rebranding exercise of privacy-hostile tracking operations.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/apples-idfa-gets-targeted-in-strategic-eu-privacy-complaints/">counter move this month</a>, European privacy campaign group, noyb, filed two complaints against Apple for not obtaining consent from users to create and store the IDFA on their devices.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s one bit of strategic pushback.</p>
<p>Real-time bidding, meanwhile, remains under regulatory scrutiny in Europe &#8212; with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/">huge questions over the lawfulness</a> of its processing of Internet users&#8217; personal data. Privacy campaigners are also now challenging data protection regulators over their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/uks-ico-faces-legal-action-after-closing-adtech-complaint-with-nothing-to-show-for-it/">failure to act</a> on those long-standing complaints.</p>
<p>A flagship online ad industry tool for gathering web users&#8217; consent to tracking is also under attack and looks to be facing imminent action under the bloc&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gdpr" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gdpr">GDPR) <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Last month an investigation by Belgium&#8217;s data protection agency found the IAB Europe&#8217;s so-called Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) didn&#8217;t offer either &#8212; failing to meet the GDPR standard for transparency, fairness and accountability, and the lawfulness of data processing. Enforcement action is expected in early 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://resilience.com/">Resilience</a>, a new biopharmaceutical company backed by $800 million in financing from investors including ARCH Venture Partners and 8VC, <a href="https://resilience.com/resilience-launches-to-change-the-future-of-medicine/">has emerged from stealth</a> to transform the way that drugs and therapies are manufactured in the U.S.</p>
<p>Founded by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/arch-venture-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="arch-venture-partners">ARCH Venture Partners <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> investor Robert Nelsen, National <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/arceo-ai" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="arceo-ai">Resilience <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Inc., which does business as Resilience was born out of Nelsen&#8217;s frustrations with the inept American response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>According to a statement the company will invest heavily in developing new manufacturing technologies across cell and gene therapies, viral vectors, vaccines and proteins.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Resilience&#8217;s founders identified problems in the therapeutic manufacturing process as one of the key problems that the industry faces in bringing new treatments to market &#8212; and that hurdle is exactly what the company was founded to overcome.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 has exposed critical vulnerabilities in medical supply chains, and today’s manufacturing can’t keep up with scientific innovation, medical discovery, and the need to rapidly produce and distribute critically important drugs at scale. We are committed to tackling these huge problems with a whole new business model,” said Nelsen in a statement.</p>
<p>The company brings together some of the leading investment firms in healthcare and biosciences including operating partners from Flagship Pioneering like Rahul Singhvi, who will serve as the company&#8217;s chief executive&#8217; former <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/food-and-drug-administration" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="food-and-drug-administration">Food and Drug Administration <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> commissioner <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/scott-gottlieb" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="scott-gottlieb">Scott Gottlieb, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a partner at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/new-enterprise-associates" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="new-enterprise-associates">New Enterprise Associates <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and director on the Resilience board; and Patrick Yang, the former executive vice president and global head of technical operations at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/roche" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="roche">Roche/Genentech <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>“It is critical that we adopt solutions that will protect the manufacturing supply chain, and provide more certainty around drug development and the ability to scale up the manufacturing of safe, effective but also more complex products that science is making possible,” said Dr. Gottlieb, in a statement. “RESILIENCE will enable these solutions by combining cutting edge technology, an unrivaled pool of talent, and the industry’s first shared service business model. Similar to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon-web-services" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon-web-services">Amazon Web Services, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> RESILIENCE will empower drug developers with the tools to more fully align discovery, development, and manufacturing; while offering new opportunities to invest in downstream innovations in formulation and manufacturing earlier, while products are still being conceived and developed.”</p>
<p>Other heavy hitters in the world of medicine and biotechnology who are working with the company include Frances Arnold, the Nobel Prize-winning professor from the California Institute of Technology; George Barrett, the former chief executive of Cardinal Health; Susan Desmond-Hellmann, the former president of product development at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/genentech" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="genentech">Genentech; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Kaye Foster, the former vice president of human resources at Johnson and Johnson; and Denice Torres, the former President of Johnson &amp; Johnson Pharmaceutical and Consumer Companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Oxford University&#8217;s COVID-19 vaccine, being developed in partnership with drugmaker <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/astrazeneca" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="astrazeneca">AstraZeneca, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has shown to be 70.4% effective in preliminary results from its Phase 3 clinical trial. That rate actually includes data from two different approaches to dosing, including one where two full strength does were applied, which was 62% effective, and a much more promising dosage trial which used one half-dose and one full strength dose to follow – that one was 90% effective.</p>
<p>Oxford&#8217;s results may not have the eye-catching high efficacy headline totals of the recent announcements from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pfizer" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pfizer">Pfizer <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Moderna, but they could actually represent some of the most promising yet for a few different reasons. First, if that second dosage strategy holds true across later results and further analysis, it means that the Oxford vaccine can be administered in lower amounts and provide stronger efficacy (there&#8217;s no reason to use the full two-dose method if it&#8217;s that much less effective).</p>
<p>Second, the Oxford vaccine can be stored and transported at standard refrigerator temperatures – between 35° and 45°F – whereas the other two vaccine candidates require storage at lower temperatures. That helps obviate the need for more specialized equipment during transportation and on-site at clinics and hospitals where it will be administered.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Oxford&#8217;s COVID-19 vaccine also uses a different approach to either Moderna&#8217;s or Pfizer&#8217;s, which are both mRNA vaccines. That&#8217;s a relatively unproven technology when it comes to human therapeutics, which involves using messenger RNA to provide blueprints to a person&#8217;s body to build proteins effective at blocking a virus, without any virus present. The Oxford University candidate is an adenovirus vaccine, which is a much more established technology that&#8217;s already been in use for decades, and which involves genetically altering a weekend common cold virus and using that to trigger a person&#8217;s own natural immune response.</p>
<p>Finally, it&#8217;s also cheaper – in part because it uses tried and tested technology for which there&#8217;s already a robust and mature supply chain, and in part because it&#8217;s easier to transport and store.</p>
<p>The Phase 3 trial for the Oxford vaccine included 24,000 participants, and it&#8217;s expected to grow to 60,000 by the end of the year. Safety data so far shows no significant risks, and among the 131 confirmed cases in the interim analysis that produced these results, none of those who received either vaccine dosage developed a severe case, or one requiring hospitalization.</p>
<p>This is great news for potential vaccination programs, since it introduces variety of supply chain into an apparently effective vaccine treatment for COVID-19. We&#8217;re much better off if we have not only multiple effective vaccines, but multiple different types of effective vaccines, in terms of being able to inoculate widely as quickly as possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a much-anticipated move, California-based gaming firm Roblox <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/roblox-files-to-go-public/">filed to go public</a> last week. One aspect driving the future growth of the children- and community-focused gaming platform is its China entry, which it fleshes out in detail for the first time in its IPO prospectus.</p>
<p>Like all gaming companies entering China, Roblox <a href="https://nikopartners.com/game-regulations-in-china-everything-you-need-to-know/">must work with a local publishing and operations partner</a>. And like Riot Games, Supercell, Epic Games, Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, Nintendo and many more, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/eyeing-an-entry-into-china-roblox-enters-strategic-partnership-with-tencent/">Roblox chose Tencent</a>, the world&#8217;s largest gaming firm by revenue, <a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/rankings/top-25-companies-game-revenues/">according to Newzoo</a>.</p>
<p>The partnership, which began in 2019, revolves around a joint venture in which Roblox holds a 51% controlling stake and a Tencent affiliate called Songhua owns a 49% interest. The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm">prospectus</a> notes that Tencent currently intends to publish and operate a localized version of the Roblox Platform (罗布乐思). Internationally, the platform allows people to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/roblox-files-to-go-public/">create games and play those programmed by others</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>User-generated content is in part what makes Roblox popular amongst young gamers, but that social aspect almost certainly makes its China entry trickier. It&#8217;s widely understood that the Chinese government is asserting more control over what gets published on the internet, and in recent times its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/china-restarts-game-approval-process/">scrutiny over gaming content</a> has heightened. Industry veteran Wenfeng Yang went as far as speculating that games with user-generated content will &#8220;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/publishing-games-china-2020-wenfeng-yang/?articleId=6655161606227537921">never made [their] path to China,</a>&#8221; citing the example of Animal Crossing.</p>
<p>Roblox says it believes it&#8217;s &#8220;uniquely positioned&#8221; to grow its penetration in China but its &#8220;performance will be dependent on&#8221; Tencent&#8217;s ability to clear regulatory hurdles. It&#8217;s unclear what measures Roblox will take to prevent its user-generated content from running afoul of the Chinese authorities, whose appetite for what is permitted can be volatile. Tencent itself has been<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/24/tencent-netease-games-approved-finally/"> in the crosshairs of regulators</a> over allegedly &#8220;addictive&#8221; and &#8220;harmful&#8221; gaming content. It also remains to be seen how Roblox ensures its user experience won&#8217;t be compromised by whatever censorship system that gets implemented.</p>

<h2>Compliance</h2>
<p>At the most basic level, Roblox claims it works to ensure user safety through measures designed &#8220;<span id="textmarker_17" class="textmarker textmarker_17">to enforce real-world laws,&#8221; including</span> text-filtering, content moderation, automated systems to identify behaviors in violation of platform policies, and a review team. The company expresses in its filing optimism about getting China&#8217;s regulatory greenlight:</p>
<p>&#8220;<span id="textmarker_8" class="textmarker textmarker_8">While Tencent is still working to obtain the required regulatory license to publish and operate Luobulesi [Roblox&#8217;s local name] in China,</span> we believe the regulatory requirements specific to China<span id="textmarker_9" class="textmarker textmarker_9"> will be met. </span><span id="textmarker_9" class="textmarker textmarker_9">I</span>n the meantime, <span id="textmarker_10" class="textmarker textmarker_10">Luobu is working towards creating a robust developer community in China</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is rightfully optimistic. Tencent has a proven history of converting its social network users into gamers and publishing foreign games. Roblox&#8217;s marketing focus on encouraging &#8220;creativity&#8221; could sit well with Beijing&#8217;s call for tech companies to &#8220;do good,&#8221; an order <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/07/tencent-motto-tech-for-good/">Tencent has answered</a>. Roblox&#8217;s <a href="https://edu.roblox.qq.com/cooperation.html">Chinese website</a> suggests it&#8217;s touting part of its business as a learning and STEM tool and shows it&#8217;s <a href="https://edu.roblox.qq.com/cooperation.html">seeking collaborations</a> with local schools and educators.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roblox is aimed at a younger audience and the majority of its content will not be an issue in China,&#8221; said games analyst from Niko Partners Daniel Ahmad to TechCrunch. &#8220;However, we do see some risk from its user-generated content features which can be used in ways that Chinese regulators may disapprove.&#8221;</p>
<p>There might be an easier path into China. Yang, who is the U.S. general manager for China-listed games maker Yoozoo, told TechCrunch that &#8220;Roblox China may only introduce the platform to Chinese developers, asking them to join and make content for the global market, not necessarily bringing the platform to China under such heavy regulations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Foreign games overall are having a more difficult time entering China, In 2019 there were 185 foreign games approved for release in the country, but that there have only been 56 foreign games approved year to date, Ahmad noted.</p>
<h2>Geopolitics</h2>
<p>The involvement of Tencent, while critical, is the elephant in the room in times of uncertain U.S.-China relations. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. or CFIUS, which is chaired by the Treasury Department, was inquiring about data practices by Tencent-backed gaming studios in the U.S. including Epic and Riot, Bloomberg <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/gaming-companies-are-reportedly-the-next-targets-in-the-us-governments-tencent-purge/">reported in September</a>.</p>
<p>Roblox isn&#8217;t exempt. It notes in the prospectus that CFIUS has &#8220;<span id="textmarker_1" class="textmarker textmarker_1">made inquiries to us with respect to Tencent’s equity investment in us</span> and involvement in the China JV.&#8221; It further warns that it &#8220;cannot predict what effect any further inquiry by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. into our relationship with Tencent or changes in China-U.S. relations overall may have on our ability to effectively support the China JV or on the operations or success of the China JV.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other obstacle faced by all foreign companies entering China, the world&#8217;s biggest gaming market, is local clones. <a href="https://www.reworld.io/">Reworld</a>, <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/8gddzclHn_NBXimJ2ZLQNw">backed by prominent Chinese venture firms</a> such as Northern Light Venture Capital and Joy Capital, is one. The game is unabashed about its origin. In a Reddit post responding to the accusation of it being &#8220;a ripoff of Roblox,&#8221; Reworld pays its tribute to Roblox and admits its product is &#8220;built on the shoulders of Roblox,&#8221; while claiming &#8220;it did not take any code from Roblox Studio.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Beijing-based startup behind Reworld has so far raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/reworld/company_financials">more than $50 million</a> and had about 100 developers working on Reworld&#8217;s editing tool and 50 other operational staff, its co-founder said in a <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/148776278">June interview</a>. In comparison, Roblox had 38 employees in China by September, 38 of whom were in product and engineering functions. It&#8217;s actively <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?f_C=147977&amp;geoId=102890883&amp;keywords=china&amp;location=China">hiring</a> in China.</p>
<p>Roblox cannot comment for the story as it&#8217;s in the IPO quiet period.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;The Crown,&#8221; <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/netflix" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="netflix">Netflix&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> lavish historical drama about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, has returned for a fourth season that focuses on Elizabeth&#8217;s relationship with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and on Prince Charles&#8217; troubled marriage to Diana, Princess of Wales.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/07/original-content-crown-season-3/">conflicting opinions</a> about the show&#8217;s past seasons, and the new season hasn&#8217;t exactly settled those disagreements, as we explain on the latest episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">the Original Content podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Anthony and (especially) Jordan remain fans of the show, and they found season four to be particularly compelling. Yes, the monarchy is a little ridiculous and &#8220;The Crown&#8221; does have a tendency to simplify real-world events, but its retelling of the Charles-Diana relationship is heartbreaking, and it also takes the time to show some of the damage wrought by Thatcher&#8217;s policies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Darrell, on the other hand, remains a skeptic, with little patience for all the attention paid to the royal family. He was particularly exasperated by the show&#8217;s deviation from historical reality, and by performances (particularly Gillian Anderson as Thatcher) that felt more like cheesy, &#8220;Saturday Night Live&#8221;-style imitations.</p>
<p>In addition to reviewing the show, we also discuss this week&#8217;s announcement that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/wonder-woman-1984-hbo-max/">&#8220;Wonder Woman 1984&#8221; will be premiering in both theaters and on HBO Max</a> on December 25.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Karan Bajaj, an Indian entrepreneur who teaches meditation and in his recent book invites others to live a life away from the noise, is going after the most vocal critics of his startup.</p>
<p>Bajaj, founder of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/indias-byjus-acquires-whitehat-jr-for-300-million/">coding platform WhiteHat Jr</a>, has filed a defamation case against Pradeep Poonia, an engineer who has publicly criticized the firm for its marketing tactics, the quality of the courses on the platform, and aggressive takedowns of such feedback. On Monday, WhiteHat Jr, filed a similar case against Aniruddha Malpani, an investor who has shared unflattering feedback about the startup.</p>
<p>Most of the customers of WhiteHat Jr, which is aimed at kids, live in America, and demand for its one-to-one classes has surged nearly 90% this year, according to the startup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/485381422/Karan-Bajaj-Anr-vs-Pradeep-Poonia">the lawsuit</a> against Poonia &#8212; in which Bajaj (pictured left above) is seeking $2.7 million in damages &#8212; Poonia has been accused of infringing trademarks and copyright of properties owned by WhiteHat Jr, defaming and spreading misleading information about the startup and its founder, and accessing the company&#8217;s private communications app.</p>
<p>The lawsuit also accuses Poonia of publicly sharing phone numbers of WhiteHat Jr employees and making strong accusations such as likening the startup&#8217;s marketing tactics to &#8220;child sexual abuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawyers further claim that Poonia recorded sessions of some classes conducted by WhiteHat Jr, asked questions that were not relevant to the course with the &#8220;humiliate and harass&#8221; the teachers and then posted them online.</p>
<p>&#8220;As some of the one-on-one communications between the Plaintiffs’ teachers and the Defendant have demonstrated, the former have felt extremely threatened and harassed by the Defendant which is even more pertinent given that the Plaintiffs’ entire workforce of 11,000 teachers is female,&#8221; the suit says.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Defendant’s activities have critically affected the Plaintiffs’ business and resulted in loss of its goodwill and reputation, and the confidence of its customers in its business. It is submitted that as a consequence of the Defendant’s tweets, Plaintiffs have suffered a steep dip in the conversion rate from trial classes to actual registrations which has severely affected revenue its revenue.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="BslZLk1hwG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/indias-byjus-acquires-whitehat-jr-for-300-million/">India&#8217;s Byju&#8217;s acquires WhiteHat Jr. for $300 million</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;India&#8217;s Byju&#8217;s acquires WhiteHat Jr. for $300 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/indias-byjus-acquires-whitehat-jr-for-300-million/embed/#?secret=BslZLk1hwG" data-secret="BslZLk1hwG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But the lawsuit, riddled with spelling and grammatical errors, appears to be also indicative of just how little criticism WhiteHat Jr, owned by India&#8217;s second most valuable startup Byju&#8217;s, is willing to accept.</p>
<p>According to internal posts of a Slack channel of WhiteHat Jr shared by Poonia, the startup has aggressively used copyright protection to take down numerous unflattering feedback about the startup in recent months.</p>
<p>The suit also raises concern with Poonia accusing WhiteHat Jr of &#8220;murdering&#8221; an imaginary kid that featured in one of its earlier ads.</p>
<p>A 12-year-old child named &#8220;Wolf Gupta&#8221; appeared in earlier ads of WhiteHat Jr, which claimed that the kid had landed a lucrative job at Google. The kid does not exist, the lawyers of Bajaj say in the suit. Ironically that was also the argument Poonia, who spent a long time trying to unearth more information about this supposed poster child of WhiteHat Jr, was making in his tweets.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In its <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r5OOFCxsQbdZ2bmzGjjBt6HUxgEUO8KT/view">second lawsuit</a>, the startup alleges that Malpani has been critical of WhiteHat Jr because he is an investor in rival platforms Bibox Labs, Multibhashi and ConceptOwl. (They don&#8217;t appear to be rivals.) The startup is seeking damages of about $1.9 million from Malpani.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn’t want to go to court. Startups require intense, singular focus with no distraction. But false, unethical attacks, including attempts to breach into company servers &amp; defame women teachers, severely impacted employees &amp; teachers daily. News cycles turned against us because negative stories are far more sensational than the truth,&#8221; Bajaj wrote in a LinkedIn post Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The truth is that WhiteHat Jr grew rapidly worldwide because the curriculum was not only effective but also wildly creative for kids and the teachers from India gave their heart &amp; souls to teaching them. We’ve made mistakes while growing up. Our marketing campaigns were poorly designed, which we changed. Legitimate, honest fact-based criticism is truly welcome. Blitzscaling is hard.Fires burn all over. Keep giving us feedback to improve. But lies and illegal breaches damage real lives &amp; take no one forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scores of education startups in India have reported skyrocketing growth in recent months as schools remain shut across the country amid the coronavirus pandemic. Byju&#8217;s is the most valuable edtech startup in the world with a roster of marquee backers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/mary-meekers-bond-invests-in-indian-online-learning-giant-byjus/">including Mary Meeker</a>&#8216;s Bond.</p>
<p>Even as most Indians tend not to pay for online services — just ask Facebook, which has amassed over 400 million users in India and makes little in the country — the education category is an outlier. Indian families continue to spend heavily on their children’s education in hopes of paving the way for a better future.</p>
