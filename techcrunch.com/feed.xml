					<description><![CDATA[AI rounds are particularly hot or at least as hot as the larger SaaS market, which is itself enjoying historically rich multiples are more capital pours into the aggregate startup world.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The startup investing market is crowded, expensive and rapid-fire today as venture capitalists work to preempt one another, hoping to deploy funds into hot companies before their competitors. The AI startup market may be even hotter than the average technology niche.</p>
<p>This should not surprise.</p>
<p>In the wake of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">the Microsoft-Nuance deal</a>, The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/expect-an-even-hotter-ai-venture-capital-market-in-the-wake-of-the-microsoft-nuance-deal/">reported that it would be reasonable</a> to anticipate an even more active and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/17/why-its-not-surprising-to-see-nine-figure-ai-rounds/">competitive market</a> for AI-powered startups. Our thesis was that after Redmond dropped nearly $20 billion for the AI company, investors would have a fresh incentive to invest in upstarts with an AI focus or strong AI component; exits, especially large transactions, have a way of spurring investor interest in related companies.</p>
<p>That expectation is coming true. Investors The Exchange reached out to in recent days reported a fierce market for AI startups.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But don’t presume that investors are simply falling over one another to fund companies betting on a future that may or may not arrive. Per a <a href="https://www.signal-ai.com/">Signal AI survey</a> of 1,000 C-level executives, nearly 92% thought that companies should lean on AI to improve their decision-making processes. And 79% of respondents said that companies are already doing so.</p>
<p>The gap between the two numbers implies that there is space in the market for more corporations to learn to lean on AI-powered software solutions, while the first metric belies a huge total addressable market for startups constructing software built on a foundation of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Now deep in the second quarter, we’re diving back into the AI startup market this morning, leaning on notes from <a href="https://twitter.com/davidblumberg?lang=en">Blumberg Capital’s David Blumberg</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rudina11?lang=en">Glasswing Ventures’ Rudina Seseri</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/benblume?lang=en">Atomico’s Ben Blume</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/jgoldfein?lang=en">Jocelyn Goldfein of Zetta Venture Partners</a>. We’ll start by looking at recent venture capital data regarding AI startups and dig into what VCs are seeing in both the U.S. and European markets before chatting about applied AI vs. &#8220;core&#8221; AI &#8212; and in which context VCs might still care about the latter.</p>
<h2>Hot, expensive, crowded</h2>
<p>The exit market for AI startups is more than just the big Microsoft-Nuance deal. CB Insights <a href="https://t.yesware.com/tt/2f1386565598f726094ae2a168a6fbd1bf787596/87febc0caed6d0e2c8e834f740f5a703/b99969f3c71b842d45dcc08ca9c599c2/www.cbinsights.com/reports/CB-Insights_Tech-Giants-Artificial-Intelligence.pdf">reports that</a> four of the largest five American tech companies have bought a dozen or more AI-focused startups to date, with Apple leading the pack with 29 such transactions.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Apple hosts their annual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/WWDC-2021/">Worldwide Developers Conference</a>, Instagram and Facebook chose this moment to pilot their first-ever Creator Week. This three-day event is geared toward aspiring and emerging digital creators, complete with 9:45 AM virtual DJ sets and panels on &#8220;Algorithm Mythbusting&#8221; and raising &#8220;zillions for a nonprofit you care about.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the first day of the event, Mark Zuckerberg made an announcement introducing <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/creator-week-2021-new-ways-for-creators-to-make-a-living">new ways for creators to make money</a>. In the coming months, Instagram will start testing a native affiliate tool, which allows creators to recommend products available on checkout, share them with followers and earn commissions for sales their posts drive. When creators make these posts, the text &#8220;eligible for commission&#8221; will appear beneath their username in the same way that sponsored content labels appear.</p>
<p>Available immediately, creators will be able to link their shops to their personal profiles, not just business ones. By the end of the year, eligible creators in the U.S. will be able to partner with one of Instagram&#8217;s merchandise partners (Bravado/UMG, Fanjoy, Represent and Spring) to drop exclusive product launches on the app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>During live Instagram videos, viewers can tip creators by sending them a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/instagram-rolls-out-fan-badges-for-live-videos-expands-igtv-ads-test/">Badge</a>, which costs between $0.99 and $4.99. Facebook Gaming has a similar feature called Stars, in which one Star is valued at $0.01. Starting this week, creators can earn bonuses for accomplishing certain challenges, like going live with another account. In a promotional image, for example, Facebook offers a bonus of $150 for creators who earn 5,000 Stars, the equivalent of $50.</p>

<p>&#8220;To help more creators make a living on our platforms, we&#8217;re going to keep paid online events, fan subscriptions, badges, and our upcoming independent news products free for creators until 2023,&#8221; Zuckerberg wrote in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113127348899371">a Facebook post</a>. &#8220;And when we do introduce a revenue share, it will be less than the 30% that Apple and others take.&#8221;</p>

<p>These updates mark the latest push by Instagram toward affiliate marketing and in-app shopping, like its redesigned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/instagram-launches-its-redesigned-shop-now-powered-by-facebook-pay/">Instagram Shop</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/instagram-launches-shopping-in-reels-its-tiktok-rival/">Shopping in Reels</a>, which debuted within the last year.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to be the best platform for creators like you to make a living. And if you have an idea that you want to share with the world, you should be able to create it and get it out there easily and simply &#8212; across Facebook and Instagram &#8212; and then earn money for your work,&#8221; Zuckerberg added during Creator Week.</p>
<p>Creators may be drawn to experiment with these affiliate and shop features, since for now, they won&#8217;t lose a cut of their profits to Instagram. But platforms like TikTok and YouTube offer monetization strategies that extend beyond e-commerce.</p>
<p>Last July, TikTok announced its $200 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tiktok-creator-fund-200-million-us/">TikTok Creator Fund</a>, which allows popular posters to earn money from their videos. It&#8217;s unclear exactly how TikTok determines <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/tiktok-creator-fund-your-questions-answered">how much money</a> to dole out, but it depends on the number of views, engaged views and other factors. In August 2020, the YouTuber-turned-TikToker Hank Green estimated that he would bring home <a href="https://twitter.com/hankgreen/status/1296866360908107776">about $700 from 20,000,000 TikTok views</a> in one month, averaging to about 3.5 cents per 1,000 views.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, YouTube announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/youtube-announces-a-100m-fund-to-reward-top-youtube-shorts-creators-over-2021-2022/">a $100 million fund</a> last month for top creators on YouTube Shorts, its TikTok competitor. The platform pointed out that over the last three years it has paid $30 billion to content creators. Snapchat has been paying <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/20/snapchat-paying-1-million-a-day-to-video-creators.html">$1 million per day to creators</a> on their own TikTok competitor, Spotlight.</p>
<p>For users who don&#8217;t have millions of followers, these creator funds might not pay the rent. Still, it offers an income stream based on views, outside of e-commerce or viewer tips. For now, Instagram can&#8217;t say the same.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://segment.com/?ref=nav">Twilio Segment</a> announced a tool, which is available starting today, to help marketers create fine-grained customer journeys. Until now the company has enabled marketers to build buyer personas and broader audiences, but this enables users to have much greater control of their interactions with a customer.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Peter Reinhardt says that marketers have been craving the ability to build more customized customer journeys and this tool gives them that. &#8220;It&#8217;s basically taking the power that existed in personas and audiences and actually putting it fully in marketers&#8217; hands to build their dream journeys across every channel with the best data,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This enables marketers to stitch together a whole sequence of audiences. &#8220;Say when someone comes to the top of the funnel, they want to do X, then if they want to branch it and use X or Y, then do two different things, and you can keep branching and personalizing via this whole journey to cover the whole lifecycle.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says this capability has existed in some tools, but the Twilio Segment offering enables it to be used in more than 300 tools in the Segment ecosystem. &#8220;This is the first time that we&#8217;re going to be able to really do that and orchestrate this way, not just for a limited subset of channels, but across all of the channels,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8xH29Oyl5R"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/customer-experience-and-digital-transformation-concepts-are-merging-during-the-pandemic/">Customer experience and digital transformation concepts are merging during the pandemic</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Customer experience and digital transformation concepts are merging during the pandemic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/customer-experience-and-digital-transformation-concepts-are-merging-during-the-pandemic/embed/#?secret=8xH29Oyl5R" data-secret="8xH29Oyl5R" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Marketers can build branching by dragging and dropping journey components to send people on different paths depending on things like if they are a regular customer or a first-time customer or just about anything you can think of. Reinhardt says that flexibility is a key attribute of the new feature.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s competing with some major players like Adobe and Salesforce in this space, Reinhardt believes this capability really gives Twilio a leg up over the competitors. &#8220;I think if you look at more of the legacy journey builders, [their products] are not built on real-time data, meaning that they&#8217;re actually missing basically all of the interesting behavioral data that marketers actually build on,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Segment <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilio-confirms-it-is-buying-segment-for-3-2b-in-an-all-stock-deal/">was acquired by Twilio last year</a> for $3.2 billion, and part of the reason for that was to increase its customer engagement capabilities. Segment gives Twilio a customer data platform to build on top of its other communications tooling, and today&#8217;s announcement expands on that capability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swedish battery developer and manufacturer Northvolt AB has raised $2.75 billion in capital as it prepares to ramp up to an annual production capacity of 150 GWh in Europe by 2030.</p>
<p>The funding round – Northvolt’s largest thus far – was co-led by existing investors Goldman Sachs and Volkswagen, and new investors including the Swedish pension funds AP1-4, and OMERS, one of Canada’s largest pension plans. AMF, ATP, Baillie Gifford, Baron Capital Group, Bridford Investments Limited, Compagnia di San Paolo through Fondaco Growth, Cristina Stenbeck, Daniel Ek, IMAS Foundation, EIT InnoEnergy, Norrsken VC, PCS Holding, Scania and Stena Metall Finans also participated in the raise.</p>
<p>Volkswagen’s investment came to €500 million ($620 million), the OEM said Wednesday, maintaining its 20% stake in the battery manufacturer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/09/northvolt-raises-2point75-billion-from-goldman-vw-to-compete-with-tesla.html">CNBC reported</a> that Northvolt’s valuation now stands at $11.75 billion. The company declined to comment on the specific valuation figure to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Northvolt has already scored major deals with automakers like Volkswagen and BMW. In July 2020, the company inked a $2.3 billion contract with BMW for batteries; more recently in March, Volkswagen put in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/swedish-battery-manufacturer-northvolt-receives-a-14-billion-order-from-vw/">$14 billion order</a> over a ten-year period. The two deals bring Northvolt’s total contracts to $27 billion. Other notable customers include Swedish heavy duty truck manufacturer Scania and energy storage company Fluence.</p>
<p>This brings Northvolt’s total raised to more than $6.5 billion since the company was founded in 2016. The manufacturer’s first gigafactory in Skellefteå, Sweden, will be expanded from 40 GWh to 60 GWh, in part due to increased demand from the Volkswagon order, the company said in a statement. That facility will commence production later in 2021.</p>
<p>Northvolt’s overarching plan is to ramp up to at least 150 GWh of annual battery production across Europe by 2030. To meet this massive target, the company is considering at least two additional gigafactories, including one in Germany.</p>
<p>Northvolt is one of Europe’s largest battery manufacturers. Company shareholder EIT InnoEnergy said in a statement Wednesday that the funding is key to Europe achieving its Green Deal objectives, which includes creating a European battery value chain.</p>
<p>The Swedish company aims to distinguish itself from other battery manufacturers by producing batteries using renewable energy for the manufacturing process. Northvolt says its batteries have an 80% lower carbon footprint than those made with coal power. It also recycles batteries in-house and reuses the raw materials in its production process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">President Joe Biden is reducing some uncertainty faced by Chinese tech companies in the United States, erasing parts of the Trump-era legacy. The President signed an executive order revoking <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/trump-signs-executive-orders-banning-transactions-with-tiktok-and-wechat/">actions targeting TikTok and WeChat</a> put forward by former President Donald Trump, according to a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/09/executive-order-on-protecting-americans-sensitive-data-from-foreign-adversaries/">statement</a> released by the White House on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Instead, President Biden signed a new order requiring the Commerce Department to review apps with ties to &#8220;jurisdiction of foreign adversaries&#8221; that may pose national security risks.</p>
<p>Former President Trump&#8217;s orders seeking to ban TikTok and WeChat in the U.S. had been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/tiktok-stars-got-a-judge-to-block-trumps-tiktok-ban/">blocked by federal court jurisdictions</a>. Separately, his attempt to force a sale of TikTok&#8217;s U.S. operations <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/tiktoks-forced-sale-to-oracle-is-put-on-hold/">was also shelved</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The &#8220;increased use in the United States of certain connected software applications designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by persons owned or controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of, a foreign adversary,&#8221; which the Secretary of Commerce has defined to include Chinna among others, &#8220;continues to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scrutiny over Chinese tech firms will most likely remain a high priority for U.S. regulators but policies may be more methodical under the presidency of President Biden. Chinese companies coveting the U.S. market will have to be better prepared for data compliance challenges.</p>
<p>The order directs the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, and the heads of other agencies as the Secretary of Commerce deems appropriate, to recommend actions to protect Americans&#8217; data on platforms owned or controlled by a &#8220;foreign adversary&#8221; within 120 days.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that American tech companies like Facebook and Google also collect large amounts of user data, but the “scope and scale” of TikTok’s app’s data collection makes it easier for Chinese spies to answer “all kinds of different intelligence questions” on U.S. nationals, Anne Neuberger, NSA’s director of cybersecurity, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/nsa-anne-neuberger-hackers-covid-19/">told TechCrunch at Disrupt 2020</a>. She said there were “greater concerns on how [China] in particular could use all that information collected against populations other than its own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chinese tech firms have produced a raft of top-ranking apps in the U.S. TikTok, which has been working to make Singapore its beachhead following the U.S. government&#8217;s attempted ban, came in second among the free apps on the U.S. App Store as of writing. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/capcut-bytedance-tiktok/">CapCut</a>, a video-editing app also owned by ByteDance app, has seen a surge in downloads in the U.S. recently. Mobile games from Tencent and smaller studios continue to rack up big bucks in the U.S., and fast-fashion shopping app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/shein-overtakes-amazon/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Shein</a> is outpacing Amazon&#8217;s growth in the country.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, Tencent and ByteDance could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>

<p>On an upcoming episode of Extra Crunch Live, we&#8217;ll sit down with MaC Venture Capital founding managing partner Marlon Nichols and Wonderschool co-founder and CEO Chris Bennett. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-mac-venture-capital-and-wonderschool?ref=cc6fdfd74b4f">REGISTER HERE FOR FREE!</a></p>
<p>Not only will we discuss how they came together for Wonderschool&#8217;s seed round in 2017, but how that translated into what has become a total of $24 million in funding from VCs like a16z and First Round Capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;ll also host the Extra Crunch Live Pitch-off, where folks in the audience can pitch their startup to Nichols and Bennett to get their live feedback.</p>
<p>Nichols is a former Kauffman Fellow and Investment Director at Intel Capital. His portfolio includes Gimlet Media, MongoDB, Thrive Market, PlayVS, Fair, LISNR, Mayvenn, Blavity and Wonderschool. Nichols knows more than most of us will ever learn about seed-stage fundraising, and even gave a chat at TechCrunch Early Stage in April that outlines four strategies for securing seed funding.</p>

<p>Bennett can talk extensively on edtech as a sector, and we&#8217;ll pick both his and Nichols&#8217; mind on that fast-growing space.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget that this episode will feature an Extra Crunch Live Pitch-off, so founders in the audience should be ready to &#8220;raise their hand&#8221; and get in the mix.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://ourbranch.com/?utm_source=press&amp;utm_campaign=seriesb">Branch Insurance</a>, a startup offering bundled home and auto insurance, has raised $50 million in a Series B funding round led by Anthemis Group.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Acrew, Cherry Creek Holdings and existing backers Greycroft, HSCM Bermuda, American Family Ventures, SignalFire, SCOR P&amp;C Ventures, Foundation Capital and Tower IV also participated in the round. With this latest financing, Columbus, Ohio-based Branch has raised $82.5 million in total funding since its 2017 inception.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With so many players in the insurtech space, it can get tough distinguishing the various offerings. Branch claims that it is unique in that it is able to provide customers with “an instant insurance offer” for bundled home and auto insurance “within seconds” using just a few pieces of information.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Co-founder and CEO Steve Lekas began his career at Allstate, where he went on to hold roles in underwriting, technology and product management. He then went on to build Esurance’s first online home insurance business.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But in the back of his mind, Lekas yearned to figure out a way to make insurance more accessible for more people. And so he teamed up with Joe Emison, and Branch was born.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The industry is structurally flawed and it harms consumers. Complicated policies, rising costs and marketing warfare all contribute to a vicious cycle that results in overpriced insurance,” said Lekas. “We are a full-stack insurance company transforming the way people think about their home and car insurance.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Branch, he claims, is the only insurance company that he is aware of that can bind insurance through an API, and the only one that can bundle auto and home insurance in a single transaction.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another way Branch is unique, according to Lekas, is that it can be embedded into the buying experience. In other words, the company has partnered with companies such as Rocket Mortgage and ADT to integrate insurance at the point of sale in their products. For example, if a person is closing on a home, they have the option of purchasing Branch insurance at the same time.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Every home or car policy starts with another transaction,” Lekas said. “Insurance is a product that exists only because of the other transaction. It’s never before been possible to embed in that primary purchase before.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">This distribution model means that Branch shells out less to acquire customers and thus, it claims, is able to offer premiums for a lower price than competitors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“In just two clicks, a consumer can have home and car insurance or just home and we’ll cancel the old insurance on their closing date, and transmit all the data to their existing mortgage,” Lekas said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Branch also offers its insurance direct-to-consumer and through agencies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company plans to use its new capital in part to accelerate its rollout across the U.S. so that it can sign more such partnerships where it can embed its offering. Currently, Branch has more than 30 partnerships of varying sizes, and is “adding more every week” as it launches in more states.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s really hard to move quickly,” Lekas said. “The system is built to make you move slowly. Every state regulator has to approve individually and independently with their own rules.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lekas predicts Branch will be available in more than 80% of the U.S. before the year’s out.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Branch has seen increased momentum since its $24 million Series A in July 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Specifically, the startup says it has achieved a 435% growth in its partner channel, 660% growth in active policies and a 734% increase in active premium less than one year after its last raise.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Anthemis Group Partner Ruth Foxe Blader notes that Branch marks her firm’s first investment from its new growth fund.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Blader says she has invested in insurance innovation over the past decade, and is particularly attracted to insurtech businesses that represent three things: significant technology and data science innovation; significant product innovation and significant cultural innovation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Branch easily ticks those boxes,” Blader told TechCrunch. “Branch&#8217;s products are both embedded and bundled, making them less expensive and more convenient to purchase, and less likely to leave customers with critical protection gaps.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The startup, she added, effectively combines data science and technology to create “unique, automatic product bundles.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">With what it describes as a “built-for-savings” structure, Branch said it has created connected home discounts as well as programs that reward members for making referrals and practicing safe driving behaviors, for example.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Branch also has formed a nonprofit, <a href="https://www.safetynest.org/">SafetyNest</a>, to help those who are un- or underinsured.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two years ago, Lillian Cartwright teamed up with some fellow Harvard Business School students to launch a new spiked seltzer brand called Astrid. Despite all the tools that make launching a D2C brand easier than it&#8217;s ever been, the team ran into complications when it came to securing raw materials.</p>
<p>This piece of the supply chain is still stuck in the past, according to Cartwright, who explained that most of it is still based around trade shows, powered by referrals and personal connections and plenty of phone calls.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when the idea for <a href="https://www.shelflife.us/">ShelfLife</a> was born. The company, cofounded by Cartwright and John Cline, is aiming to build a directory and marketplace of raw material suppliers based on what brands actually, specifically need, allowing them to secure quotes quickly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The current system is set up to benefit the large incumbent CPG brands, but the industry is shifting. Craft beverages, in particular, are <a href="https://www.grocerydive.com/news/online-packaged-food-and-beverage-sales-could-top-100b-in-2021/593946/">growing in popularity</a> and the pandemic encouraged consumers to buy more bottled, box, and canned goods online.</p>
<p>In fact, Cartwright says that 50 food and beverage brands are <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-markets-prices/processing-marketing/new-products/">launched every single day</a>. But the small, new brands don&#8217;t have an easy way to procure materials. For Cartwright and Astrid, it was so complicated that it led her and her team to abandon the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;I instead took that experience kind of ran with it,&#8221; said Cartwright. &#8220;There are thousands of other people that want to launch brands in the food and beverage space. There are no resources when it comes to supply chain. There&#8217;s something there, and this entire space is going to end up digitizing in the very near term.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2163717" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shelflife_demo_tc-2.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /></p>
<p>In beta, ShelfLife charges a small fee for use of the software, and is manually procuring supplier quotes on behalf of brands. The funding will, in part, go towards automating that process as much as possible to scale on both the brand and supplier side.</p>
<p>One of the challenges of that is that not all suppliers love the idea of being compared to one another, all on one page. Cartwright argues that the shifting landscape of the industry means that lead generation around new brands is growing in importance, and a trend that suppliers should get ahead of.</p>
<p>Eventually, Cartwright wants to shift the ShelfLife business model to a commission structure that would come out of the budget suppliers usually reserve for field sales reps. The company also wants to build products around financing for the brands, as many suppliers require upfront payment, which can be taxing on a small brand.</p>
<p>The funding round was co-led by Switch Ventures and Kindred Ventures, with participation from NextView Ventures, Ben Zises (SuperAngel.vc), Ilia Papas (former CTO of Blue Apron), and Elena Donio (former President of SAP Concur) among others.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For this week’s deep dive, Alex, Natasha, and Chris dug into the world of hormonal health, a sub-sector within the massive (and booming) world of digital health.</p>
<p>The show was inspired by Natasha&#8217;s latest Extra Crunch piece: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/hormonal-health-is-a-massive-opportunity-where-are-the-unicorns/">&#8220;Hormonal Health is a massive opportunity: Where are the unicorns?&#8221;.</a> To round out the show, we asked one of the featured founders, <a href="https://twitter.com/sequinlabcoat?lang=en">Dr. Elizabeth Ruzzo</a>, to hop on the mic and help us understand if hormonal health is at its infancy, or at an inflection point, in tech.</p>
<p>The tl;dr before we hop into the show is that hormones &#8212; while constantly evolving and changing &#8212; are center node for a ton of health conditions that disproportionately impact women. These can include mental health issues, infertility, diabetes, and more. If you&#8217;re someone interested in the world of digital health and always read about the Ro&#8217;s and Hinge Health&#8217;s of the ecosystem, this episode will teach you what else there is that deserves equal &#8211; if not more &#8211; attention.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>We started with landscaping! <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/hormonal-health-is-a-massive-opportunity-where-are-the-unicorns/">We defined the term &#8220;hormonal health&#8221; and got a sense of market size,</a> as to show the opportunity there is to innovate here right now.</li>
<li>Ruzzo walked us through the opportunity in pro-active medicine, as well as how investors reacted to her pitch when she was first raising her seed round.</li>
<li>We ping-ponged around different reasons as to why hormonal health is an underserved category, starting with stigma and ending with stigma.</li>
<li>This <a href="https://ovsecondopinion.substack.com/p/why-were-betting-big-on-womens-health">post from a set of venture capital investors</a> discussing the market opportunity that women&#8217;s health may have for founders and VCs alike.</li>
<li>Then we got into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ro-acquires-modern-fertility-in-a-reportedly-225-million-deal/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Modern Fertility&#8217;s acquisition by Ro</a>, and why Ruzzo and many in the digital health community were surprised at the outcome. That said, it’s still one of the rare exits, and as far as unicorns go, there are virtually no companies valued at over $1 billion that focus explicitly on women’s hormonal health.</li>
<li>Shifting gears, the trio turned to startups working on PCOS, one of the most common hormonal conditions out there that impacts one in ten women. Former Ro director Rachel Blank <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/allara-pcos-ro-rachel-blank/">announced today that she is starting a company in this world</a>, Allara.</li>
<li>To round out the conversation we touched on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/veera-health-wants-to-help-women-in-india-navigate-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/">recent Veera venture capital round</a>, and closed with a short discussion concerning the the term &#8220;femtech&#8221; and why it&#8217;s not so good.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to take the Equity survey, and we&#8217;ll chat you on Friday morning!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Union has been digging into the competition implications of AI-powered voice assistants and other Internet of Things (IoT) connected technologies for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/eu-antitrust-lawmakers-kick-off-iot-deep-dive-to-follow-the-data-flows/">almost a year</a>. Today it&#8217;s put out a first report discussing potential concerns that EU lawmakers say will help inform their wider digital policymaking in the coming years.</p>
<p>A major piece of EU legislation introduced at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">back of last year</a> is already set to apply ex ante regulations to so-called &#8216;gatekeeper&#8217; platforms operating in the region, with a list of business practice &#8216;dos and don&#8217;ts&#8217; for powerful, intermediating platforms being baked into the forthcoming pan-EU Digital Services Act.</p>
<p>But if course applications of technology don&#8217;t stand still. The bloc&#8217;s competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, has also had her eye on voice assistant AI technologies for a while &#8212; raising concerns about the challenges being posed for user choice <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/dont-break-up-big-tech-regulate-data-access-says-eu-antitrust-chief/">as far back as 2019</a>, when she said her department was &#8220;trying to figure out how access to data will change the marketplace&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Commission took a concrete step <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/eu-antitrust-lawmakers-kick-off-iot-deep-dive-to-follow-the-data-flows/">last July</a> when it announced a sectoral inquiry to examine IoT competition concerns in detail.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now published a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition-policy/antitrust/sector-inquiries/consumer-internet-things_en">preliminary report</a>, based on polling more than 200 companies operating in consumer IoT product and services markets (in Europe, Asia and the US) &#8212; and is soliciting further feedback on the findings (until September 1) ahead of a final report due in the first half of next year.</p>
<p>Among the main areas of potential competition concern it found are: Exclusivity and tying practices in relation to voice assistants and practices that limit the possibility to use different voice assistants on the same smart device; the intermediating role of voice assistants and mobile OSes between users and the wider device and services market &#8212; with the concern being this allows the owners of the platform voice AI to control user relationships, potentially impacting the discoverability and visibility of rival IoT services.</p>
<p>Another concern is around (unequal) access to data. Survey participants suggested that platform and voice assistant operators gain extensive access to user data &#8212; including capturing information on user interactions with third-party smart devices and consumer IoT services as a result of the intermediating voice AI.</p>
<p>&#8220;The respondents to the sector inquiry consider that this access to and accumulation of large amounts of data would not only give voice assistant providers advantages in relation to the improvement and market position of their general-purpose voice assistants, but also allow them to leverage more easily into adjacent markets,&#8221; the Commission writes in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2884">press release</a>.</p>
<p>A similar concern underlies an ongoing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/europe-lays-out-antitrust-case-against-amazons-use-of-big-data/">EU antitrust investigation into Amazon&#8217;s use of third party merchants&#8217; data</a> which it obtains via its ecommerce marketplace (and which the Commission believes could be illegally distorting competition in online retail markets).</p>
<p>Lack of interoperability in the consumer IoT sector is another concern flagged in the report. &#8220;In particular, a few providers of voice assistants and operating systems are said to unilaterally control interoperability and integration processes and to be capable of limiting functionalities of third-party smart devices and consumer IoT services, compared to their own,&#8221; it says.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing very surprising in the above list. But it&#8217;s noteworthy that the Commission is trying to get a handle on competitive risks &#8212; and start mulling potential remedies &#8212; at a point when the adoption of voice assistant AIs is still at a relatively early stage in the region.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_21_2908">press release</a>, the Commission notes that usage of voice assistant tech is growing worldwide and expected to double between 2020 and 2024 (from 4.2BN voice AIs to 8.4BN) &#8212; although only 11% of EU citizens surveyed last year had already used a voice assistant, per cited <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/isoc_iiot_use/default/table?lang=en">Eurostat data</a>.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers have certainly learned lessons from the recent failure of competition policy to keep up with digital developments and rein in a first wave of tech giants. And those giants of course continue to dominate the market for voice AIs now (Amazon with Alexa, Google with its eponymous Assistant and Apple&#8217;s Siri). So the risks for competition are crystal clear &#8212; and the Commission will be keen to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p>Still, quite how policymakers could look to tackle competitive lock-in around voice AIs &#8212; whose USP tends to be their lazy-web, push-button and branded convenience for users &#8212; remains to be seen.</p>
<p>One option, enforcing interoperability, could increase complexity in a way that&#8217;s negative for usability &#8212; and may raise other concerns, such as around the privacy of user data.</p>
<p>Although giving users themselves more say and control over how the consumer tech they own works can certainly be a good idea, at least provided the platform&#8217;s presentation of choices isn&#8217;t itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/20/just-say-no/">manipulative and exploitative</a>.</p>
<p>There are certainly plenty of pitfalls where IoT and competition is concerned &#8212; but also potential opportunities for startups and smaller players if proactive regulatory action can ensure that dominant platforms don&#8217;t get to set all the defaults once again.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Vestager said: “When we launched this sector inquiry, we were concerned that there might be a risk of gatekeepers emerging in this sector. We were worried that they could use their power to harm competition, to the detriment of developing businesses and consumers. From the first results published today, it appears that many in the sector share our concerns. And fair competition is needed to make the most of the great potential of the Internet of Things for consumers in their daily lives. This analysis will feed into our future enforcement and regulatory action, so we look forward to receiving further feedback from all interested stakeholders in the coming months.”</p>
<p>The full sectoral report can be <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition-policy/antitrust/sector-inquiries/consumer-internet-things_en">found here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Amazon reached out to send the below statement, responding to the Commission&#8217;s report:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There is intense competition from many companies in the smart home sector. There will not, and should not, be one winner. We recognized this from the beginning and designed Alexa accordingly. Today, Alexa is compatible with over 140,000 smart home products, and we make it easy for device makers to integrate Alexa directly into their own products. We also founded the Voice Interoperability Initiative &#8212; now 80 companies strong &#8212; which is committed to giving customers the choice and flexibility to access multiple voice services on a single device.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://commit.dev/">Commit</a>, a Vancouver, Canada-based startup that has a unique approach to matching up engineers looking for a new job to early-stage startups that want to hire them, today announced that it has raised a $6 million seed round. Accomplice led the round<span style="font-weight: 400;">, with participation from Kensington Capital Partners, Inovia and Garage Capital. </span></p>
<p>The company, which focuses on working with remote-first startups, launched in 2019, with co-founders Greg Gunn (CEO) and Beier Cai (CTO), who met as early employees at Hootsuite, bootstrapping the company while they worked out the details of how they wanted Commit to work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was an EIR [at Inovia Capital] and I just saw all these amazing founders that were coming in with world-changing ideas. They raised money, but their biggest challenge was getting an engineer to join them,&#8221; Gunn explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2163563" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Commit_Exec_Group.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2163563" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2163563 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Commit_Exec_Group.png" alt="" width="1024" height="765" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Commit_Exec_Group.png 3300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Commit_Exec_Group.png?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Commit_Exec_Group.png?resize=300,224 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Commit_Exec_Group.png?resize=768,574 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Commit_Exec_Group.png?resize=680,508 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Commit_Exec_Group.png?resize=1536,1147 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Commit_Exec_Group.png?resize=2048,1530 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Commit_Exec_Group.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2163563" class="wp-caption-text">Beier Cai, Co-founder &amp; CTO, Greg Gunn, Co-founder &amp; CEO, , Tiffany Jung, VP, Strategy &amp; Ops <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Commit</p></div></p>
<p>In his experience, founders typically look for senior full-stack tech leads to join their company, but it&#8217;s exactly those senior engineers that are often already in very comfortable roles at larger companies and taking a bet on an early-stage startup &#8212; or even a succession of early-stage startups &#8212; is often not the most pragmatic choice for them.</p>
<p>After talking to dozens of engineers, the founders found that many didn&#8217;t want to lose the support network they had built inside their current company, both from fellow engineers but also the kind of institutional support you get through formal and informal mentorship and personal development opportunities that most large tech companies offer. In addition, as Gunn noted, &#8220;hiring at early-stage startups sucks.&#8221; Senior engineers don&#8217;t want to have to go through a bunch of technical interviews anymore that test their whiteboarding skills but say very little about their actual capabilities as an engineer.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/pIbkW6wMqrw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>So the team decided to figure out ways to remove these barriers. Like a VC firm, it vets the startups and startup founders it works with, so the engineers that come to Commit know that these are serious companies with at least some prospect of raising funding and allowing their engineers to shape their trajectory and grow into what is potentially an early leadership role.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it vets the engineers by giving them a technical interview so they can get started without having to do another one for every interview with the companies that partner with Commit. As Gunn noted, so far, the average engineer Commit has worked with only met 1.6 vetted founders before they started a pilot project together.</p>
<p>To mitigate some of the fiscal risks of leaving a large tech company, Commit actually pays the engineers it works with a salary until they find a job. Currently, around 90% of the engineers that start pilot projects with their prospective employees end up in full-time employment.</p>

<p>In addition to matching up founders and engineers, it also offers its community members access to an active remote-first community of fellow engineers for peer support and career advice, as well as <a href="https://commit.dev/2021/03/04/personal-coaching-at-commit-part-iv-engineering-partner-thiago-araujo/">coaching</a> and other transition services.</p>
<p>In the backend, Commit uses a lot of data to match founders and engineers, but Gunn noted that while the team is very selective and has a tight profile for the people it partners with, it is committed to building a diverse pool of founders and engineers. &#8220;The thing we&#8217;re combating is the fact that these opportunities have been unevenly distributed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Even within the Valley [&#8230;] you have to be from a socio-economic class to even have access to those opportunities. For us, our whole business model is live where you want to live, but then get access to whatever opportunities you have.&#8221; Later this year, Commit plans to launch a project that specifically focuses on hiring diversity.</p>
<p>Commit&#8217;s startup partners currently include Patch, Plastiq, Dapper Labs, Relay, Certn, Procurify, Scope Security, Praisidio, Planworth, Georgian Partners and Lo3 Energy. The team started out slowly, working with fewer than 100 engineers so far, but hopes to expand its community to 10,000 engineers within the next 12 months. Starting today, engineers who want to join the program can now get on <a href="https://commit.dev/">Commit&#8217;s waitlist</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-blank-64004525/">Rachel Blank </a>has a history with hormones. The entrepreneur left her investment job at General Catalyst to join a portfolio company they had been backing since its seed round: Ro. Blank was tasked with growing Rory, a product line for menopausal women.</p>
<p>But Blank left her director position at the health tech unicorn, last valued at $5 billion, to start her own company in women’s hormonal health. Today, that startup is launching out of stealth with millions in venture-backing and more than 35,000 women in its community.</p>
<p><a href="https://allarahealth.com/">Allara</a> is an early-stage, New York-based startup that wants to help women better manage polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS. The reproductive and hormonal condition can cause irregular periods, infertility or gestational diabetes in women, as well as acne, weight gain and excessive hair growth. And it’s far from rare, affecting some one in 10 women of childbearing age.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Along with launching today, the company told TechCrunch that it has raised $2.5 million in a seed round led by Global Founders Capital, with participation from Great Oaks and Humbition.</p>
<p>Allara bundles a suite of services needed to address PCOS &#8212; such as gynecologists, nutrition plans or mental health support &#8212; and gives consumers one spot to access all of the above. The company describes it as a “collaborative care management model.”</p>
<p>When a consumer first joins the platform, Allara asks them to go through a virtual on-boarding visit with a medical provider. That provider can arrange for labs, then review the lab work and medical history to better understand a patient’s background. Lab work, and any prescriptions, are paid for by the consumer through traditional insurance.</p>
<p>Then, the rest of Allara moves out of pocket. Allara charges $100 a month for access to its care team. Patients get quarterly check-ins with their providers, and have ongoing text-based access to registered dietitians to help with eating and lifestyle goals. Blank explained how Allara wants to make sure all services find ways to talk to each other, creating a patient experience where a nutritionist already knows what your OB-GYN told you and vice-versa so a care plan is centralized.</p>

<p>If it pulls it off, this is where the heart of Allara’s innovation lies: creative ways to take care of people.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2162984" style="width: 680px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162984" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2162984" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image5.jpg" alt="" width="670" height="404" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image5.jpg 2674w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image5.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image5.jpg?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image5.jpg?resize=768,463 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image5.jpg?resize=680,410 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image5.jpg?resize=1536,925 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image5.jpg?resize=2048,1234 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image5.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2162984" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Allara</p></div></p>
<p>One hurdle for Allara, and any company working on a solution for this condition, is that PCOS is hard to diagnose, and impossible to fully cure. Like many hormonal conditions, the condition looks different in everyone, which is part of the reason it&#8217;s so hard for doctors to identify. There is no blood test, and there is no pill to pop.</p>
<p>PCOS is currently diagnosed with the Rotterdam criteria, which means a patient must have two of the following three conditions: irregular period, excess androgen or polycystic ovaries. Some research argues that the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2893212/">criteria is controversial</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7328349/">not fully inclusive</a> of the spectrum of how PCOS presents. For now, the Rotterdam criteria is the best method toward diagnosing.</p>
<p>Blank says that Allara’s goal is all about “managing risk.”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s not that women with these conditions weren&#8217;t looking for a solution,” Blank said. “It&#8217;s that they&#8217;re all desperately looking for solutions, but the solutions haven&#8217;t existed yet.”</p>
<p>Over the past few months, Allara has been operating under a different name &#8212; Astrid &#8212; to build up interest and get feedback needed to iterate its product. Blank claims that more than 35,000 women are part of its community, either directly or on a waitlist, underscoring the demand for explicit attention on this condition. The startup recently began seeing patients.</p>
<h2>Hormonal health grows bigger</h2>
<p>Allara is the latest startup to bet that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/hormonal-health-is-a-massive-opportunity-where-are-the-unicorns/">hormonal health is a key wedge into the digital health boom.</a> Companies like Adyn, Modern Fertility, Tia, Veera Health and Perla Health are all working on different ways to better serve hormonal disorders.</p>
<p>Still, the sector remains relatively nascent compared to other health conditions. Blank chalks up part of this truth to stigma.</p>
<p>“There’s been a lack of understanding what women’s health means,” Blank said, explaining how society often views it as a fertility or reproductive health condition. Blank thinks that PCOS is a common thread between a multitude of conditions, from fertility, diabetes, increased risk of uterus and endometrial cancer, heartsease, anxiety and depression.</p>

<p>When she explains this, she said, people are able to get the market opportunity.</p>
<p>“How do we treat women&#8217;s healthcare in a way that their entire healthcare outcomes become better but we&#8217;re taking on the nuances of them being women?” Blank said.</p>
<p>Blank herself was diagnosed with PCOS at the age of 21, which came as a surprise to her.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2162985" style="width: 916px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162985" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2162985" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RACHEL22649.jpg" alt="" width="906" height="604" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RACHEL22649.jpg 7952w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RACHEL22649.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RACHEL22649.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RACHEL22649.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RACHEL22649.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RACHEL22649.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RACHEL22649.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RACHEL22649.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 906px) 100vw, 906px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2162985" class="wp-caption-text">Rachel Blank, the CEO and founder of Allara. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Allara</p></div></p>
<p>“I think what made it more surprising is that my dad is actually an OB-GYN,” she said. “So even though I had grown up around women&#8217;s healthcare, and had access to the best of women&#8217;s health specialists, I even struggled with getting a process and understanding what was going on in my body.”</p>
<p>Blank initially joined Ro because of her passion for polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS. Allara is a return to, and doubling down on, her belief in the condition needing a better standard of care.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ViWd2kpwjR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ro-acquires-modern-fertility-in-a-reportedly-225-million-deal/">Ro acquires Modern Fertility in a deal north of $225 million</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ro acquires Modern Fertility in a deal north of $225 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ro-acquires-modern-fertility-in-a-reportedly-225-million-deal/embed/#?secret=ViWd2kpwjR" data-secret="ViWd2kpwjR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As for going solo, and not building it within Ro’s blanket of brands and massive footprint, Blank explained how her vision of specialty care and services is different from what Ro focuses on, which is largely primary care and prescription focus. Notably, Ro did acquire Modern Fertility, a hormonal health company, for<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ro-acquires-modern-fertility-in-a-reportedly-225-million-deal/?tpcc=ECTW2020"> north of $225 million, last month</a>.</p>
<p>“PCOS was just part of my personal story &#8212; not the vision for Rory,” she said. “Allara is not a primary care platform &#8212; it’s a specialty care platform, developing new clinical care models for complex women’s health conditions like PCOS. Imagine it as a place a primary care platform might refer a patient to if they discover she has more complex needs than they can currently serve.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s game day for mobility tech mavens around the world. Well, at least for the ones who made the savvy decision to attend <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=today&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=today&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a>. Are you ready for a day packed with potential, overflowing with opportunity and focused on the future of transportation? Yeah, you are, and so are we!</p>
<p><strong>No FOMO zone:</strong> Did you wait until the last minute? We don’t judge — simply <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=today&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=today&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">purchase a pass</a> at the virtual door.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at just some of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/#c861bf5b-e0a9-4806-a40d-c1c4c86d8ea5">speakers</a>, presentations and breakout sessions on tap today. We’re talking about leading visionaries, founders and makers of mobility tech. They just might have info you need to know, amirite? The times listed below are EDT, but the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/#878941bf-c22c-4ec4-ab2f-d8c0c15cb8ae">event agenda</a> will automatically reflect your time zone,</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Throughout the course of the day:</strong> Be sure to make time to meet, greet and network with the 28 early-stage startups exhibiting in our virtual expo area (seriously, they’re an impressive bunch). The platform lets exhibitors present live demos, host Q&amp;As about their products or hold private 1:1 meetings. Go mining for opportunities!</p>
<p><strong>2:05 pm &#8211; 2:15 pm</strong></p>
<p><strong>EV Founders in Focus:</strong> We sit down with Ben Schippers, co-founder and CEO of TezLab, an app that operates like a Fitbit for Tesla vehicles (and soon other EVs) and allows drivers to go deep into their driving data. The app also breaks down the exact types and percentages of fossil fuels and renewable energy coming from charging locations.</p>
<p><strong>2:40 pm &#8211; 3:10 pm</strong></p>
<p><strong>Equity, Accessibility and Cities:</strong> Can mobility be accessible, equitable and remain profitable? We have brought together community organizer, transportation consultant and lawyer Tamika L. Butler; Remix by Via co-founder and CEO Tiffany Chu and Revel co-founder and CEO Frank Reig to discuss how (and if) shared mobility can provide equity in cities, while still remaining a viable and even profitable business. The trio will also dig into the challenges facing cities and how policy may affect startups.</p>
<p><strong>3:10 pm – 3:40 pm</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rise of Robotaxis in China</strong>: Silicon Valley has long been viewed as a hub for autonomous vehicle development. But another country is also leading the charge. Executives from three leading Chinese robotaxi companies (WeRide, AutoX and Momenta) — that also have operations in Europe or the U.S. — will join us to provide insight into the unique challenges of developing and deploying the technology in China and how it compares to other countries.</p>
<p>That’s just a tiny taste of what today has in store for you. Choosing which of the 20 presentations and breakout sessions to attend could be tough. The good news is that you can catch anything you missed — or want to review again — with video-on-demand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="http://tryterra.co/">Terra</a>, a recent <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/terra">Y Combinator graduate</a> building an API for fitness and health data, announced that it has closed a $2.8 million round. The investment includes capital from <a href="https://www.generalcatalyst.com/">General Catalyst</a>, <a href="https://www.samsungnext.com/">Samsung Next</a>, and <a href="https://nextventures.com/team">NEXT VENTURES</a>.</p>
<p>The company intends to hire with its new capital, from a team of four today &#8212; the co-founders and two other engineers &#8212; to seven this month. Terra expects to staff up to 10 people inside the quarter.</p>
<p>More folks makes sense given the scope of what Terra is building. The company&#8217;s APIs allow developers to hook into fitness and health data generated by software and hardware. In order-of-operations terms, Terra CEO and co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/kyriakosel?lang=en">Kyriakos Eleftheriou</a> told TechCrunch that his company is targeting integration points first with companies that offer APIs, then SDKs and, later, Bluetooth-enabled health wearables. That&#8217;s a lot of possible connections, so having more hands on-deck will help the company code up its integration points makes sense.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sure, providing connective tissue between fitness and health data is neat, but only as cool as the technology that is built <em>using</em> the now-unlocked data. With Terra having attracted around early 100 developers or so to its product according to Eleftheriou, the startup should be starting to form an idea of what&#8217;s possible. During an interview with TechCrunch Eleftheriou brought up a neat idea of linking music selection to heart rate. So, as your heart rate goes up &#8212; say, from exercise &#8212; your music player could read that data from your wearable and shake up its shuffle.</p>
<p>Or the opposite, I&#8217;d add. Say you are like myself, a Nervous Person. I might want Spotify to move deeper into the Chopin the higher my heart rate during work hours.</p>
<p>How hard is it to link to fitness and health data sources? Per Eleftheriou, the fitness-tech world is more connection-ready than we might have expected. Polar, which makes wearables like fitness trackers, already has an API that Terra can plug into for example, the CEO said.</p>
<p>TechCrunch was curious about third-party hesitancy regarding allowing Terra to plug into various health, and fitness tech hardware and software. But Eleftheriou said that that hasn&#8217;t been a large problem for his startup, and that some companies &#8212; like those who sell wearables &#8212; have a natural incentive to make their hardware as useful as possible.</p>
<p>Calling Terra the Plaid for fitness data is not merely a useful comparison to help ourselves understand what it&#8217;s building; the company is pursuing a consumption-pricing model, meaning that its economics will scale akin to Plaid&#8217;s, or perhaps Twilio&#8217;s own.</p>
<p>But what matters more than where Terra sees health and fitness data fitting into the world is watching what developers actually build with its service. Now flush with a few million dollars, the company has to now prove that it has material market demand for its APIs. If so, we might see a more connected, integrated health and fitness data environment in the future. I&#8217;m here for that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today announced its plans to build a new subsea cable that will connect the East Coast of the U.S. and Las Toninas, Argentina &#8212; with additional landings in Brazil and Uruguay. The idea here is to provide users in South America with improved low-latency access to Google&#8217;s portfolio of consumer and cloud services. The cable will be designed and installed by SubCom and should be ready for service by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>The closest Google data center in the region (and its only one in South America) can be found near Santiago, Chile, which is connected to the U.S. West Coast through Google&#8217;s Curie cable.</p>
<p>The Firmina cable, named after Brazilian abolitionist and author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Firmina_dos_Reis">Maria Firmina dos Reis</a>, will augment Google&#8217;s existing cable investments in the region. The Tannat cable, a joint venture between Antel Uruguay and Google, for example, already connects the same locations while the Monet cable connects the U.S. and Brazil, where Google&#8217;s Junior cable already connects various parts of the country.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2163549" style="width: 938px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-05-24-at-10.46.44-AM.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2163549" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2163549" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-05-24-at-10.46.44-AM.png" alt="" width="928" height="795" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-05-24-at-10.46.44-AM.png 928w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-05-24-at-10.46.44-AM.png?resize=150,129 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-05-24-at-10.46.44-AM.png?resize=300,257 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-05-24-at-10.46.44-AM.png?resize=768,658 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-05-24-at-10.46.44-AM.png?resize=680,583 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-05-24-at-10.46.44-AM.png?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 928px) 100vw, 928px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2163549" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The new cable doesn&#8217;t just add capacity but also resilience to Google&#8217;s existing network. Specifically, one technical feat that makes this new cable, which consists of 12 fiver pairs, stand out is the system&#8217;s ability to power the cable from a single-end power source.</p>
<p>&#8220;With submarine <span class="il">cables</span>, data travels as pulses of light inside the <span class="il">cable</span>’s optical fibers,&#8221; Google explains. &#8220;That light signal is amplified every 100 km with a high-voltage electrical current supplied at landing stations in each country. While shorter <span class="il">cable</span> systems can enjoy the higher availability of power feeding from a single end, recent longer <span class="il">cables</span> with large fiber pair count have made this harder and harder.&#8221; To achieve this, the Firmina cable is supplied by a cable with a voltage that is 20% higher than previous cables.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Human resources is generally a salient cornerstone of any organization, but digitization has democratized a lot of the work that goes into HR, and that&#8217;s meant more people in businesses interested in, and using, the kind of data that HR people build and typically manage. Today, a startup called <a href="https://www.charthop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChartHop</a> that&#8217;s built a platform to cater to that trend is announcing $35 million in funding on the heels of strong growth.</p>
<p>The Series B is being led by Andreessen Horowitz, a past backer, with Elad Gil and previous investors Cowboy Ventures and SemperVirens also participating. We understand from sources close to the company that the round values ChartHop at between $300 million and $400 million.</p>
<p>ChartHop was founded in New York by Ian White, now the CEO, who first started building the tools to fill what he felt were gaps in his own knowledge when he founded, ran and eventually sold his previous company, Sailthru (which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/15/campaign-monitor-acquires-email-enterprise-services-sailthru-and-liveclicker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by CampaignMonitor</a>).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He said he realized the company could build &#8220;all the tech we wanted,&#8221; but when it came down to thinking about how to run and scale the business, that was at its heart actually a people question, and also understanding how departments, and the entire organization, looked and worked as a whole.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2163721" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Ian-White-ChartHop-CEO-headshot.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Ian-White-ChartHop-CEO-headshot.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Ian-White-ChartHop-CEO-headshot.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Ian-White-ChartHop-CEO-headshot.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Ian-White-ChartHop-CEO-headshot.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Ian-White-ChartHop-CEO-headshot.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Ian-White-ChartHop-CEO-headshot.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Ian-White-ChartHop-CEO-headshot.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Ian-White-ChartHop-CEO-headshot.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />&#8220;It was not as important as hiring, structuring a &#8216;single you&#8217; of the organization,&#8221; he said. (Ian&#8217;s pictured here to the right.) Similar to the great analytics tools that have been built for developers, sales teams and others, &#8220;What I wanted was people analytics,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I wanted to understand my team.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s actually a very multifaceted question. It&#8217;s not just a matter of an org chart &#8212; a big enough task in its own right that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/charthop-grabs-5m-seed-led-by-a16z-to-automate-the-org-chart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the very day that ChartHop came out of stealth in early 2020</a>, another org chart startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/the-org-nabs-8-5m-led-by-founders-fund-to-build-a-global-database-of-company-org-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Org, launched, too</a>. It&#8217;s also retention strategy, employee satisfaction, turnover statistics, diversity statistics, predictive visualizations on finances one area was compensated differently, or if hiring were frozen, etc. &#8220;All of those problems became mine and there was no great software out there to solve for it,&#8221; White said.</p>
<p>The ChartHop platform is built like all strong structures these days in the world of tech: tons of integrations to feed data into ChartHop to make it richer; tons of integrations also to export and use that data in more dedicated applications when needed; and an easy way for everyone to update data but also put in place easy and strong protections to keep confidential data as it should be.</p>
<p>And while HR still &#8220;owns&#8221; the platform, White said, it can be accessed and used by anyone in the organization, and it is.</p>
<p>It seems that others have found the talent management software market lacking for it, too. Since 2019 it went from a team of one &#8212; White himself &#8212; to 75, with 130 corporates now using its services. The list has a strong list of household company names with a heavy emphasis in tech, from what White showed me. Revenues in the last 12 months &#8212; a time when the spread-out nature of many of our workplaces has meant an even greater need for a platform to manage all the information has possibly reached a high water mark &#8212; have grown at a rate of 17% month-by-month.</p>
<p>“With HR and people functions so crucial to the growth and success of businesses, it&#8217;s unfortunate that most HR teams lack the critical people data to drive organizational decision making,” said David Ulevitch, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, in a statement. “ChartHop is the solution to this all-too-common problem, and is built by company leaders who have felt this pain personally. ChartHop’s visual approach to people analytics allows leaders to make organizational planning and strategy decisions with confidence. We&#8217;re thrilled to lead ChartHop&#8217;s Series B because of their impressive growth, the company&#8217;s vision, and the terrific, mission-oriented team they&#8217;ve assembled.” He also led the company&#8217;s seed round in February 2020.</p>
<p>“Since implementing ChartHop earlier this year, we’ve seen significant improvement in our engagement with talent routines as they’re managed via ChartHop,” said Sara Howe, vice president human resources at ZoomInfo, a customer of ChartHop, in a statement. “Our employees have found the simple user interface and the centralized view of their data as the most helpful features. Leaders across ZoomInfo have also leveraged ChartHop to ensure that their organizations are well structured to support our continued rapid growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remote work was the order of the day for the past 16 months, but as we (fingers crossed) move out of the pandemic, it&#8217;s looking like a lot of people may move into a new era of hybrid work: less focus being present in offices to feel like you are getting things done, less time commuting, and more time to be productive. To help better address that opportunity, a company called <a href="https://www.1e.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1e</a>, which builds solutions for companies to enable hybrid working along with managing the wider space of endpoint management, has been acquired by Carlyle on the heels of a strong year of business.</p>
<p>The private equity firm has picked up the London-based company in a $270 million deal.</p>
<p>The acquisition is coming in the form of a majority stake with CEO and co-founder Sumir Karayi maintaining a significant minority stake, along with employees of the company. The firm is completely bootstrapped &#8212; no outside investors, no VCs on the cap table prior to this deal &#8212; and profitable, with growth of 28% in the last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The birth and now exit of 1e is an interesting counterpoint to that of most of the enterprise startups that you will read about on the pages of TechCrunch, or maybe in tech press overall.</p>
<p>The company was started in 1997 when Karayi and co-founders Phil Wilcock and Mark Blackburn were at Microsoft working as in-house consultants helping enterprises adopt and adapt to Microsoft software. Karayi decided he wanted to start something of his own, rather than, in his words, &#8220;working for Microsoft forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given his background, his business started first as a consultancy, but he said that it didn&#8217;t take long to pivot, since &#8220;We realized that the problems we were looking to solve we needed to build technology to do that, so we started to write our own software.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company got its start as a Microsoft shop, building endpoint technology management, along with tools to help companies manage their computer terminals and networks better. That included products like NightWatchman, a power management tool for PCs and servers that helped save energy consumption for businesses; Nomad, a bandwidth management tool that helps reduce server usage; and Shopping, a platform for companies to build app-store-like experiences for internal employees or customer-facing tools.</p>
<p>Over time &#8212; years before the Covid-19 pandemic &#8212; that also evolved into software to enable hybrid working environments, which were already emerging as a thing and already posing challenges to businesses and users.</p>
<p>&#8220;The challenge was that remote working was a second-class experience,&#8221; he said, with technical support, software usage, network connectivity, device issues and just about everything harder to sort out when problems arose for workers not working in the office. So 1e &#8212; a play on the last two characters of the error message you get on a failing PC, &#8220;STOP 0x0000001E&#8221; &#8212; built software to address that, too.</p>
<p>Overall the company amassed some 40 patents on its technology, which now is used across more than 11 million devices among 500 large enterprise customers, including AT&amp;T, Nestle, and a number of big banks that can&#8217;t be named.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been the remote working software that has seen the company through an especially strong year &#8212; no surprise there, given the environment many of us have been working in &#8212; where businesses have been buying its tools as part of their &#8220;digital transformation&#8221; efforts, and it was this that got Karayi thinking that the company &#8212; which had largely built the business it had today on an employee base of people who just like building new things, and word-of-mouth between end users &#8212; could finally do with an outside investment and cash injection to take the business to the next level.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going through a seismic change right now and we think it&#8217;s a big opportunity for 1e,&#8221; he noted, adding that while many of us might feel like remote work is everywhere, he believes this is just the beginning of how to enable better remote working. &#8220;I think the office boat has sailed,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>1e went with Carlyle among a number of other bidders as it seemed like the right fit: strong support and understanding of the business, combined with a well-recognized name. The plan more generally is to follow the PE playbook if all goes well: four years of growth, with &#8220;all later options open.&#8221;</p>
<p>“We were attracted to 1E’s fully integrated digital experience technology, which is differentiated by its advanced remediation and automation capabilities, and are delighted to partner with Sumir as we support the company as it enters its next phase of growth,&#8221; said Fernando Chueca, an MD in the Carlyle Europe Technology Partners (CETP) advisory team. &#8220;With strong industry tailwinds, we believe 1E has significant growth opportunities and we look forward to supporting another founder-backed business to scale through investments in product innovation, commercial operations, and international expansion.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.aserto.com/">Aserto</a>, a new startup from a couple of tech industry vets who want to build an Authorization as a Service solution, announced a $5.1 million seed round today from Costanoa Ventures, Heavybit Industries and several industry luminaries.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s two founders, Omri Gazitt, CEO and Gert Drapers, CTO, have decades of experience building some of the industry&#8217;s identity building blocks including SAML, OAuth 2.0 and OpenID. As the two founders considered what to do next last year, they felt that authorization would be a natural extension of their work in identity, and an area where there were few good solutions for developers.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at authorization, it really hasn&#8217;t hasn&#8217;t moved forward at all. The access part is really stuck in the world of the 2000s. And we wanted to figure out essentially what authorization would look like in the age of SaaS and cloud. We feel like that&#8217;s another 10 year mission with a lot of pain right now, and a lot of value that we can deliver,&#8221;Gazitt told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While there are other early stage startups attacking a similar problem Gazitt believes their experience gives them a leg up, and he sees it as such a critical area for developers. &#8220;If you think about authorization, it really is in the critical path of every application request. Every time I send your SaaS application a request, that authorization system has to be live to 100% availability, and it has to do its work in probably a millisecond of latency budget. Otherwise it&#8217;s putting too much burden on the application,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>What the company is doing is creating a sophisticated service that does much of the work for developers, giving them fine-grained control over roles access control based on policies using what they call a &#8220;policy-as-code approach to authoring, editing, storing, versioning, building, deploying and managing authorization rules.&#8221; The solution is built using the CNCF Open Policy Agent (OPA) project.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Oso announces $8.2M Series A to simplify authorization for developers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/oso-announces-8-2m-series-a-to-simplify-authorization-for-developers/embed/#?secret=EtMAx57ukF" data-secret="EtMAx57ukF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For now, the company is still working with early customers but is also expanding the private beta today. to include additional companies who could benefit from this kind of solution.</p>
<p>Casey Aylward, who is leading the investment at Costanoa, sees a wide open space and an experienced team ready to attack it. &#8220;I get really excited thinking about what are these big ecosystem plays in the open source world? Where should we be investing? And I think this is going to be one of them, and the wat Omri and Gert are thinking about the problem and approaching the ecosystem is really, really key,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The company launched in August 2020, but it was really the culmination of many discussions that Aylward and Gazitt had over the previous couple of years around authorization and how to attack the problem. In addition to the two founders, they have six employees spread across four continents.</p>
<p>When it comes to diversity Gazitt and Drapers are both immigrants and their lead investor is female, bringing an element of diversity to the company from the start, but it&#8217;s also something they are thinking about as they build the company. Having Aylward and other women involved certainly helps bring that to the forefront.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite frankly super valuable that Casey, [and other women investors on the team Martina Lauchengco GP at Costanoa and Dana Oshiro, GP/GM at Heavybit] that can basically project the point of view that we&#8217;re not just a bunch of men sitting around the table with solutions, so that&#8217;s super helpful, and [&#8230;] you can&#8217;t start thinking about it too early. There&#8217;s no such thing as too early with diversity,&#8221; Gazitt said.</p>
<p>While Gazitt and Draper both work in Seattle, their team is spread far and wide, and he says that the plan is to be a remote-first company. In fact, he has spent a lot of time talking to companies like GitLab and HashiCorp, two companies who have successfully built remote companies to learn more about how to do that right.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">End-to-end encrypted email service ProtonMail has refreshed its design, updating with a cleaner look and a more customizable user interface &#8212; including the ability to pick from a bunch of themes (dark and contrasting versions are both in the mix).</p>
<p>Last month the Swiss company officially announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/__trashed-13/">passing 50M users globally</a>, as it turned seven years old. Over those years privacy tech has come a long way in terms of usability &#8212; which in turn has helped drive adoption.</p>
<p>ProtonMail&#8217;s full integration of PGP, for example, makes the gold standard of e2e encryption invisibly accessible to a mainstream Internet user, providing them with a technical guarantee that it cannot poke around in their stuff.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its new look (see screenshot gallery below) is really just a cherry on the cake of that underlying end-to-end encryption &#8212; but as usage of its product continues to step up it&#8217;s necessarily paying more attention to design and user interface details&#8230;</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2163650,2163649,2163648,2163651"]</p>
<p>Proton has also been busy building out a suite of productivity tools which it can cross-promote to webmail users, using the same privacy promise as its sales pitch (it talks about offering an &#8220;encrypted ecosystem&#8221;).</p>
<p>And while ProtonMail is a freemium product, which can be a red flag for digital privacy, Proton&#8217;s business has the credibility of always having had privacy engineering at its core. Its business model is to monetize via paying users &#8212; who it says are subsidizing the free tier of its tools.</p>
<p>One notable change to the refreshed ProtonMail web app is an app switcher that lets users quickly switch between (or indeed discover) its other apps: Proton Calendar and Proton Driver (an e2e encrypted cloud storage offering, currently still in beta).</p>
<p>The company also offers a VPN service, although it&#8217;s worth emphasizing that while Proton&#8217;s pledge is that it doesn&#8217;t track users&#8217; web browsing, the service architecture of VPNs is different so there&#8217;s no technical &#8216;zero access&#8217; guarantee here, as there is with Proton&#8217;s other products.</p>
<p>A difference of color in the icons Proton displays in the app switcher &#8212; where Mail, Calendar and Drive are colored purple like its wider brand livery and only the VPN is tinted green &#8212; is perhaps intended to represent that distinction.</p>
<p>Other tweaks to the updated ProtonMail interface include redesigned keyboard shortcuts which the company says makes it easier to check messages and quick filters to sort mails by read or unread status.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s Import-Export app &#8212; to help users transfer messages to they can make the switch from another webmail provider &#8212; exited beta back in November. Since then they&#8217;ve actually baked this functionality into ProtonMail (as a feature called Import Assistant), rather than needing to download a separate app.</p>
<p>Zooming out, adoption of privacy tech is growing for a number of reasons. As well as the increased accessibility and usability that&#8217;s being driven by developers of privacy tech tools like Proton, rising awareness of the risks around digital data breaches and privacy-hostile ad models is a parallel and powerful driver &#8212; to the point where iPhone maker Apple now routinely draws attention to rivals&#8217; privacy-hostile digital activity in its marketing for iOS, seeking to put clear blue water between how it treats users&#8217; data vs the data-mining competition.</p>
<p>Proton, the company behind ProtonMail, is positioned to benefit from the same privacy messaging. So it&#8217;s no surprise to see it making use of the iOS App Privacy disclosures introduced by Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/apple-launches-its-new-app-privacy-labels-across-all-its-app-stores/">last year</a> to highlight its own competitive distinction.</p>
<p>Here, for example, it&#8217;s pointing users&#8217; attention to background data exchanges which underlie Google-owned Gmail and contrasting all those direct lines feeding into Google&#8217;s ad targeting business with absolutely no surveillance at all of ProtonMail users&#8217; messages&#8230;</p>

<p>Commenting on ProtonMail&#8217;s new look in a statement, Andy Yen, founder and CEO, added: &#8220;Your email is your life. It’s a record of your purchases, your conversations, your friends and loved ones. If left unprotected it can provide a detailed insight into your private life. We believe users should have a choice on how and with whom their data is shared. With the redesigned <span class="il">ProtonMail</span>, we are offering an even easier way for users to take control of their data.&#8221;</p>
